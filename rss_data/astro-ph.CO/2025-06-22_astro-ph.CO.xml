      <title>Cancellation of one-loop correction to soft tensor power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that there are no scale-invariant one-loop corrections to the superhorizon tensor perturbations from small-scale (potentially enhanced) scalar perturbations, irrespective of the details of inflationary background time evolution. For this purpose we derive a soft tensor effective field theory at leading order in the gradient expansion by integrating out small-scale scalar fluctuations in a general time-dependent background over the Schwinger-Keldysh contour, i.e., we perform loop calculations in the soft limit of external momentum. The absence of scale-invariant corrections originates from the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity and is therefore unavoidable.</description>

      <title>The Impact of $\Omega_{m0}$ Prior Bias on Cosmological Parameter Estimation: Reconciling DESI DR2 BAO and Pantheon+ SNe Data Combination Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cosmological parameter analyses combining DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data with external probes, such as Pantheon+ Supernovae (SNe) observations, have reported deviations of the dark energy equation-of-state parameters ($\oo, \oa$) from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model predictions ($\oo=-1, \oa=0$). A notable aspect of these results is the role of $\Omo$ prior information from SNe, which is known to exhibit tension with BAO-only constraints. In this study, we rigorously investigate this effect through a statistical analysis using 100 mock DESI DR2 BAO data realizations. We demonstrate that the strong degeneracy between $\oo$, $\oa$, and $\Omo$ causes significant biases in the estimated dark energy parameters when the $\Omo$ prior mean deviates from its true underlying value. Specifically, applying an $\Omo$ prior mean of 0.33 (consistent with some SNe-only constraints) to mock data, assuming a true $\Lambda$CDM universe ($\Omo=0.30, \oo=-1, \oa=0$), yields biased estimates such as $\oo \approx -0.82 \pm 0.06$ and $\oa \approx -0.82 \pm 0.4$. This systematic shift, driven by the $\Omo$ prior, moves the estimated parameters towards the non-$\Lambda$CDM region, offering a qualitative resemblance to outcomes reported in current combined DESI DR2 BAO + Pantheon+ SNe analyses (e.g., $\oo = -0.888^{+0.055}_{-0.064}$, $\oa = -0.17 \pm 0.46$). Our findings suggest that these observed non-$\Lambda$CDM parameters may largely arise from statistical biases due to $\Omo$ prior tensions between datasets. This study proposes a potential resolution to current cosmological tensions without necessarily invoking new physics.</description>

      <title>The Modeling Landscape of Extragalactic CO in CMB Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extragalactic carbon monoxide (CO) line emission will likely be an important signal in current and future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) surveys on small scales. However, great uncertainty surrounds our current understanding of CO emission. We investigate the implications of this modeling uncertainty on CMB surveys. Using a range of star formation rate and luminosity relations, we generate a suite of CO simulations across cosmic time, together with the broadband cosmic infrared background (CIB). From these, we quantify the power spectrum signatures of CO that we would observe in a CMB experiment at 90, 150, and 220 GHz. We find that the resulting range of CO auto-spectra spans up to two orders of magnitude and that while CO on its own is unlikely to be detectable in current CMB experiments, its cross-correlation with the CIB will be a significant CMB foreground in future surveys. We then forecast the bias on CMB foregrounds that would result if CO were neglected in a CMB power spectrum analysis, finding shifts that can be comparable to some of the uncertainties on CMB foreground constraints from recent surveys, particularly for the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and radio sources, and many times greater than the expected uncertainties expected for future data. Finally, we assess how the broad range of multifrequency CO$\times$CIB spectra we obtain is captured by a reduced parameter set by performing a principal component analysis, finding that three amplitude parameters suffice for a CMB-S4-like survey. Our results demonstrate the importance for future CMB experiments to account for a wide range of CO modeling, and that high-precision CMB experiments may help constrain extragalactic CO models.</description>

      <title>Testing Light Unaffiliated Mass Clumps in MACS 0416 on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales using JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light unaffiliated mass clumps (LUMCs), i.e. dark matter (DM) components without any stellar counterparts, have been reported in strong lensing mass reconstructions of MACS 0416, both on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales. On galaxy cluster scale, the most recent parametric study based on 303 multiple images features a LUMC, in the south of the cluster. On galaxy scale, the most recent GRALE non-parametric study based on 237 multiple images features two LUMCs, M1 and M2. Given the implications of these findings in the context of structure formation and evolution, we test these features parametrically, using LENSTOOL. First, we show that a mass model where each large scale DM component introduced in the modelling is associated with a stellar counterpart can reproduce the 303 multiple images, removing the need for any cluster scale LUMC in \lens. We then update the GRALE model using the 303 multiple images, finding that one of the two galaxy scale LUMC, M1, is no longer significant, while M2 remains. We test M2 by explicitely including it in our parametric model. We find that the inclusion of this LUMC does not improve the global RMS, but mildly improves locally the RMS for one multiple image located close to M2. Besides, the preferred mass for M2 corresponds to the lowest mass allowed by the adopted prior. M2 is therefore not strongly favoured by a parametric approach but it is not ruled out. We present a comparison of parametric and non-parametric models in the M2 area. Both approaches show very similar surface mass density at this location, with a 5-6 % difference between the mass maps. The difference is that GRALE favors a distinct mass substructure when LENSTOOL favors a more diffuse mass distribution. We have been able to propose a parametric mass model without including any LUMCs, providing further evidences for DM being associated with light in clusters.</description>

      <title>Comprehensively Constraining Ultra-Light Primordial Black Holes Through Relic Formation and Early Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate constraints on the least explored, smallest mass scales of primordial black holes (PBHs), which evaporate prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Our study examines the impact of Planck-mass relics on the allowed fraction of dark matter composed of PBHs ($f_{PBH}$), as well as on the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background and the formation of primordial binaries. We discuss how these binaries and early mergers lead to longer PBH lifetimes, extending the reach of the stringent BBN constraints to smaller masses than usually expected. We make comprehensive constraint plots on the collapse fraction $\beta$ and $f_{PBH}$ (including relics), focusing on ultra-light PBHs.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing simulation-based cosmological Fisher forecasts: a case study using the Voronoi volume function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting cosmological constraints from halo-based statistics often suffers from instability in derivative estimates, especially when the number of simulations is limited. This instability reduces the reliability of Fisher forecasts and machine learning based approaches that use derivatives. We introduce a general framework that addresses this challenge by stabilizing the input statistic and then systematically identifying the optimal subset of summary statistics that maximizes cosmological information while simultaneously minimizing the instability of predicted constraints. We demonstrate this framework using the Voronoi volume function (VVF), a summary statistic that captures beyond two-point clustering information. Applying our two-step procedure -- random sub-sampling followed by optimization -- improves the constraining power by up to a factor of 2, while also enhancing the stability of the forecasts across realizations. As surveys like Euclid, DESI, and LSST push toward tighter constraints, the ability to produce stable and accurate theoretical predictions is essential. Our results suggest that new summary statistics such as the VVF, combined with careful data curation and stabilization strategies, can play a key role in next-generation precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Going beyond $S_8$: fast inference of the matter power spectrum from weak-lensing surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak lensing surveys are often summarized by constraints on the derived parameter ${S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}}$, obscuring the rich scale and redshift information encoded in the data, and limiting our ability to identify the origin of any tensions with $\Lambda$CDM predictions from the cosmic microwave background. In this work, we introduce a fast and flexible framework to extract the scale-dependent matter power spectrum $P(k, z)$ from cosmic shear and CMB lensing measurements, parameterizing deviations from the Planck $\Lambda$CDM prediction as a free function $\alpha(k)$. Using public data from DES Y3, KiDS-1000, HSC Y3, and ACT DR6, we constrain $\alpha(k)$ with fast Hamiltonian Monte Carlo inference. Our results show a consistent 15-30\% suppression in the matter power spectrum at intermediate scales ($k \sim 0.1-1{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) in galaxy-lensing data relative to Planck, with combined tensions reaching up to $4\sigma$ at fixed cosmology. In contrast, ACT CMB lensing is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM at ${k\lesssim 0.1 {\rm Mpc}^{-1}}$. We validate our method using mock data, quantify consistency between datasets, and demonstrate how the resulting $\alpha(k)$ likelihoods can be used to test specific models for the power spectrum. All code, data products, and derived likelihoods are publicly released. Our results highlight the importance of reporting lensing constraints on $P(k, z)$ and pave the way for model-agnostic test of growth of structure with upcoming surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetic fields and modified recombination histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cosmological data and astrophysical observations, such as the Hubble tension and the increasing preference from galaxy surveys for dynamical dark energy, have begun to challenge the standard $\Lambda$-cold dark matter cosmological model. Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) offer a mechanism to alleviate these tensions within the framework of the standard model. These fields source excess small-scale baryon clumping, which can speed up recombination and shrink the comoving sound horizon at the surface of last scattering. Computing the modified recombination history requires coupling the radiative transport of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons to compressible magnetohydronamic simulations. Since doing so is generically computationally intractable, we have developed a linearized treatment which self-consistently computes the modified recombination history in the presence of PMF induced baryon clumping for fields with red-tilted spectra. The clumping factors we find are too small to alleviate outstanding cosmological tensions, but our general framework can be applied to other PMF spectra, and provides a significant theoretical step towards a complete account of recombination in the presence of small-scale baryon clumping.</description>

      <title>Analysis of shape and angular orientation parameters of velocity-dependent dark matter annihilation signals in Galactic Centers for FIRE simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use FIRE-2 zoom cosmological simulations of Milky Way size galaxy halos to characterize the shape of the J-factor emission signal on the sky. We find that, at a fixed dJ/d{\Omega} contour,the shape is well-fit by an ellipse, with semi-major axis Rmajor and semi-minor axis Rminor measured in degrees on the sky. We use least squares fitting to fit ellipses to the J-factor emission, viewed from the solar location. The ratio of minor to major axes (Rminor/Rmajor) allows us to characterize the shape of each contour, with ratio 1.0 corresponding to circular/spherical emission. These results provide new expectations for the shape of dark matter annihilation emission signals we might expect to see if dark matter is annihilating with its own anti-particle. We find that both the shape and angular orientation of the emission signal is different than results predict from dark matter only simulations. In terms of shape, we find that the ratios of semi-minor to semi-major axis is always consistently at 0.8, revealing a consistent circular emission shape, whereas with dark matter only emission signals the range of ratios from halo to halo is broader, and often closer to 0.5, showing a much more elliptical shape in general. In terms of angular orientation, we find that the major axis of the J-factor emission signal maps for FIRE halos are consistently aligned with the galactic plane within a few degrees, meaning that excess emission out of the plane would be hard to explain with a dark matter annihilation signal. However, we also find that the expected emission signal would be consistent with Fermi-LAT measurements showing a galactic center excess in full hydrodynamical simulations with stars and gas included, while dark-matter-only simulations do not produce the expected signal.</description>

      <title>Analytical weak-lensing shear response of galaxy model fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy model fitting is widely employed to estimate properties such as galaxy shape, size, and color. Understanding how the outputs of galaxy model fitting respond to weak-lensing shear distortions is crucial for accurate shear estimation and mitigating shear-related systematics in weak lensing image analyses. In this paper, we investigate how the fitted parameters - specifically flux, size, and shape - respond to weak-lensing shear distortions within the AnaCal framework. To achieve this, we introduce quintuple numbers, a novel algebraic system inspired by dual numbers from automatic differentiation. Quintuple numbers enable the propagation of shear response information throughout the entire model-fitting process by linking analytical pixel shear responses to those of the fitted parameters. We integrate quintuple numbers into the AnaCal framework to derive the shear responses of shapes estimated with model fitting and validate the pipeline using image simulations that include realistic blending. Our results demonstrate that the multiplicative bias remains below 0.003 for ground-based, oversampled images.</description>

      <title>Observational Space Unveils Cosmic Expansion's Role in the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric embedding method that directly constrains $H_0$ by exploiting the exact kinematic relation $\dot{z} = H_0(1+z) - H(z)$ in a unified observational framework. This approach reconstructs expansion history without requiring specific cosmological models, incorporating both existing Cosmic Chronometer data and forecasted Sandage-Loeb measurements. Through mathematical embedding of observational constraints, we achieve $\sim 1.6\%$ precision in $H_0$ determination, matching current Cepheid distance ladder accuracy while maintaining model independence. The method demonstrates how fundamental kinematic constraints enable precision cosmology, providing a promising pathway to address the Hubble tension as future redshift drift observations become available.</description>

      <title>CosmoGLINT: Cosmological Generative Model for Line Intensity Mapping with Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling star-forming galaxies is crucial for upcoming observations of large-scale matter and galaxy distributions with galaxy redshift surveys and line intensity mapping (LIM). We introduce CosmoGLINT (Cosmological Generative model for Line INtensity mapping with Transformer), a Transformer-based generative framework designed to create realistic galaxy populations from dark matter (DM)-only simulations. CosmoGLINT auto-regressively generates sequences of galaxy properties -- including star formation rate (SFR), distance to the halo centre, and radial and tangential velocities relative to the halo -- conditioned on halo mass. Trained on the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation, the model reproduces key statistical properties of the original data, including the voxel intensity distribution and the power spectrum both in real and redshift space. It can efficiently generate a number of different realisations of the designated galaxy populations, enabling the creation of mock LIM/redshift survey catalogues from large halo catalogues produced by fast DM-only simulations. We show that our model trained at multiple redshifts can be applied to DM halo lightcone data to generate a realistic mock galaxy lightcone with incorporating the redshift evolution of the galaxy population. The mock catalogues can be readily used to derive statistical quantities and to develop data analysis pipelines for ongoing and future wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>Infalling Ultra Faint Dwarfs as Emissaries of the Axiverse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of Ultra Faint dwarf galaxies (UFG's) infalling onto the Milky Way, namely Leo K \&amp; M at $r \simeq 450$kpc, considerably strengthens the case that UFG's constitute a distinct galaxy class that is inherently smaller, fainter and metal poor compared to the classical dwarf spheroidals (dSph). This distinction is at odds with the inherent continuity of galaxy halo masses formed under scale-free gravity for any standard dark matter model. Here we show that distinct galaxy classes do evolve in cosmological simulations of multiple light bosons representing the 'Axiverse' proposal of String Theory, where a discrete mass spectrum of axions is generically predicted to span many decades in mass. In this context, the
  observed UFG class we show corresponds to a relatively heavy boson of $3\times 10^{-21}$eV, including Leo K \&amp; M, whereas a lighter axion of $10^{-22}$eV comprises the bulk of dark matter in all larger galaxies including the dSph's. Although Leo M is larger in size than Leo K, we predict its velocity dispersion to be smaller $\simeq 1.7$km/s, compared to $\simeq 4.5$km/s for Leo K, since soliton cores are required by the Uncertainty Principle to be wider at lower momentum. This scenario can be definitively tested using millisecond pulsars close to the Galactic center, where the Compton frequencies of the heavy and light bosons imprint monotone timing residuals that may be detected by SKA on timescales of approximately 1 week and 4 months, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Detecting anisotropic screening of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) holds the promise of revealing the distribution of gas in the Universe, characterizing the complex processes of galaxy formation and feedback, and studying the epoch of reionization. Estimators for inhomogeneous screening, including some recently proposed small-scale (stacked) estimators, are quadratic or higher order in the CMB temperature or polarization fields and are therefore subject to contamination from CMB lensing. We review the origin of this lensing bias and show that, when stacking on unWISE galaxies, the expected lensing bias dominates the signal if left unmitigated. Hardening techniques that null the lensing bias have been proposed for standard quadratic estimators, whereas only approximate methods have been proposed for stacked estimators. We review these techniques and apply the former to stacked estimators, presenting several strategies (including the optimal strategy) to null lensing contamination when stacking on any large-scale structure (LSS) tracer.</description>

Abstract: Smooth hybrid inflation is a hybrid inflation model which is free from topological defects and predicts the density perturbation with the spectral index of about $0.97$. We show that the prediction on the spectral index is robust regardless the power of nonrenormalizable terms and meets with the latest results reported by Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Viable scenarios for baryogenesis and dark matter are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Scalar Field--Matter Interaction in Weyl Integrable Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test an analytic cosmological solution within the framework of Weyl Integrable Spacetime using current observational data. In this model, dark energy is described by a pressureless fluid, while a scalar field arises naturally through the definition of the connection. This gravitational theory reveals a Chameleon Mechanism leading to a nonzero interaction between the scalar field and the matter sector. This model extends the standard $\Lambda $CDM cosmology by introducing one additional degree of freedom, allowing for deviations from $\Lambda$CDM dynamics. For the observational constraints we consider the Supernova data of Pantheon+ collaboration, the Cosmic Chronometers, the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillators of DESI DR2 collaboration and the gamma-ray bursts. We find that Weyl Integrable Spacetime fits the data in a better way than the $\Lambda$CDM. When all datasets are considered, the statistical comparison indicates a weak to moderate preference for Weyl Integrable Spacetime according to the Akaike Information Criterion and Jeffrey's scale for the Bayesian evidence.</description>

      <title>Tracing Dark Matter in the Central Regions of Galaxy Clusters Using Galaxies, Gas, and Intracluster Light in TNG300: Connections to Cluster Dynamical State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of intracluster light (ICL) as a dark matter tracer. Moreover, the ICL co-evolves with the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the host cluster, making it a valuable tool for understanding cluster dynamics. In this study, we utilize 426 galaxy clusters (with total mass $M_{\rm tot}&gt;10^{14} M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$) simulated in the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Illustris TNG300 to compare the spatial distributions of dark matter, member galaxies, gas, and ICL and assess their effectiveness as dark matter tracers in the central regions of clusters at $R_{\rm vir}&lt;0.3$. We apply the Weighted Overlap Coefficient (WOC), a methodology for quantifying the similarity of two-dimensional spatial distributions, to various components of the galaxy clusters at different dynamical stages. Our findings reveal that the spatial distributions of both ICL combined with the BCG and gas closely resemble the dark matter distribution, with higher fidelity observed in more relaxed galaxy clusters with earlier half-mass epochs. These results demonstrate that the BCG+ICL component serves as an effective tracer of dark matter, consistent with previous observational studies linking cluster light to mass. Moreover, the degree of spatial similarity between the BCG+ICL and dark matter distributions appears to reflect the dynamical state of the cluster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of $\gamma$-ray from blazars suggest the presence of magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium, which may require a primordial origin. Intense enough primordial magnetic fields can arise from theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking during the big bang, where supercooling is ended by a strongly first order phase transition. We consider theories involving new scalars and possibly vectors, including thermal particle dark matter candidates. Intense enough magnetic fields can arise if the reheating temperature after the phase transition is below a few TeV. The same dynamics also leaves testable primordial gravitational waves and possibly primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Black holes as telescopes: Discovering supermassive binaries through quasi-periodic lensed starlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary systems are unavoidable outcomes of galaxy mergers. Their dynamics encode information about their formation and growth, the composition of their host galactic nuclei, the evolution of galaxies, and the nature of gravity. Many SMBH binaries with separations pc-kpc have been found, but closer (sub-parsec) binaries remain to be confirmed. Identifying these systems may elucidate how binaries evolve past the ``final parsec'' until gravitational radiation drives them to coalescence. Here we show that SMBH binaries in non-active galactic nuclei can be identified and characterized by the gravitational lensing of individual bright stars, located behind them in the host galaxy. The rotation of `caustics' -- regions where sources are hugely magnified due to the SMBH binary's orbit and inspiral -- leads to Quasi-Periodic Lensing of Starlight (QPLS). The extreme lensing magnification of individual bright stars produces a significant variation in the host galaxies' luminosity; their lightcurve traces the orbit of the SMBH binary and its evolution. QPLS probes the population of sources observable by pulsar timing arrays and space detectors (LISA, TianQin), offering advance warning triggers for merging SMBHs for coincident or follow-up GW detections. SMBH population models predict $1-50\; [190-5,000] \left({n_\star}/{\rm pc}^{-3}\right)$ QPLS binaries with period less than $10\; [40]$ yr with comparable masses and $z&lt;0.3$, where $n_\star$ is the stellar number density. Additionally, stellar and orbital motion will lead to frequent instances of single/double flares caused by SMBHBs with longer periods. This novel signature can be searched for in a wealth of existing and upcoming time-domain photometric data: identifying quasi-periodic variability in galactic lightcurves will reveal an ensemble of binary systems and illuminate outstanding questions around them.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Supernova Constraints on Lepton Flavor Violating Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extreme conditions within the supernova core, a high-temperature and high-density environment, create an ideal laboratory for the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Of particular interest are low-energy supernovae, characterized by their low explosion energies, which place strong constraints on the new-physics energy transfer from the core to the mantle. We compute low-energy supernova constraints on lepton-flavor-violating axions and axion-like particles that couple to both electrons and muons. For axion mass above the muon mass, the electron-muon coalescence and the axion decay are dominant production and reabsorption processes, respectively. We find that the low-energy supernovae provide the most stringent constraints on the axions in the mass range of $\sim (110,550)$ MeV, probing the coupling constant down to $g_{ae\mu} \simeq {\cal O}(10^{-11})$.</description>

      <title>Shadow in the Galactic Center: Theoretical Concept -- Prediction -- Realization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) was created in November 1915 and since its creation and up to now this theory has undergone many tests. The first realistic cosmological models were proposed in the works of Friedman, written in the 1920s. For a long time Friedman's cosmological works were actually banned in Soviet Union due to philosophical reasons, since the models where the birth and evolution of the Universe occurs were considered ideologically unacceptable. Due to great achievements in relativity and cosmology and due to increasing interest to these branches of of science in last decades we recall a development of relativistic astrophysics and contribution of Russian researchers in these studies. Since one of the world leaders in physical cosmology A. A. Friedman passed away in September 1925, it is reasonable to outline the main achievements of physical cosmology over the past 100 years. We discuss also observational and theoretical achievements in confirmations of relativistic observational predictions for black holes, including the closest supermassive black hole in our Galactic Center. We outline an evolution of black hole shadow from the purely theoretical concept to observable quantities for supermassive black holes in Sgr A* and M87*.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of Cubic Poincar\'e Gauge gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study flat FLRW cosmology for a Poincar\'e gauge theory containing cubic invariants that is free from ghosts in arbitrary backgrounds in the axial and vector sectors of the torsion tensor. The new degrees of freedom can be related to hypermomentum but continue to be dynamical even in vacuum. These extra degrees of freedom open a more natural way in which to construct potential gravitational models that provide possible ways to modify astrophysical and cosmological physics. In this framework, we study two particular branches of the theory where preliminary routes of exploring these new variables are exposed. The first is the branch where the hypermomentum vanishes, while the second branch involves the setting where the perfect fluid and hypermomentum parts of the sources are independently conserved. In both settings, we find generically faster expanding cosmologies with similar estimates of the cosmic matter content as in the standard model of cosmology. Cubic Poincar\'e Gauge gravity offers an interesting theoretical basis on which to study cosmology, and indicates some preliminary positive constraints when compared with observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Impact of the large-scale cosmic web on the X-ray emitting circumgalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot circumgalactic medium (CGM), probed by X-ray observations, plays a central role in understanding gas flows that drive a galaxy's evolution. While CGM properties have been widely studied, the influence of a galaxy's large-scale cosmic environment on the hot gas content remains less explored. We investigate how the large-scale cosmic web affects the X-ray surface brightness (XSB) profiles of galaxies in the context of cosmological simulations. We use our novel IllustrisTNG-based lightcone, spanning $0.03 \leq z \leq 0.3$, first developed in our previous work, and generate self-consistent mock X-ray observations, using intrinsic gas cell information. We apply the filament finder DisPerSE on the galaxy distributions to identify the cosmic filaments within the lightcone. We classify central galaxies into five distinct large-scale environment (LSE) categories: clusters and massive groups, cluster outskirts, filaments, filament-void transition regions, and voids/walls. We find that the X-ray surface brightness profiles (XSB) of central galaxies of dark matter halos in filaments with $M_{\rm 200m} &gt;10^{12}\ M_\odot$ are X-ray brighter than those in voids and walls, with $20-45%$ deviations in the radial range of $\sim (0.3-0.5) R_{\rm 200m}$. We investigate the source of this enhancement and find that the filament galaxies show higher average gas densities, temperatures, and metallicities compared to voids/walls galaxies. Our results demonstrate that the impact of the large-scale cosmic environment is imprinted on the hot CGM's X-ray emission. Future theoretical work on studying the effect of assembly history, connectivity, and gas accretion on galaxies in filaments and voids would help to further our understanding of the impact of the environment on X-ray observations.</description>

      <title>Union Through UNITY: Cosmology with 2,000 SNe Using a Unified Bayesian Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12098v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were instrumental in establishing the acceleration of the universe's expansion. By virtue of their combination of distance reach, precision, and prevalence, they continue to provide key cosmological constraints, complementing other cosmological probes. Individual SN surveys cover only over about a factor of two in redshift, so compilations of multiple SN datasets are strongly beneficial. We assemble an up-to-date "Union" compilation of 2087 cosmologically useful SNe Ia from 24 datasets ("Union3"). We take care to put all SNe on the same distance scale and update the light-curve fitting with SALT3 to use the full rest-frame optical. Over the next few years, the number of cosmologically useful SNe Ia will increase by more than a factor of ten, and keeping systematic uncertainties subdominant will be more challenging than ever. We discuss the importance of treating outliers, selection effects, light-curve shape and color populations and standardization relations, unexplained dispersion, and heterogeneous observations simultaneously. We present an updated Bayesian framework, called UNITY1.5 (Unified Nonlinear Inference for Type-Ia cosmologY), that incorporates significant improvements in our ability to model selection effects, standardization, and systematic uncertainties compared to earlier analyses. As an analysis byproduct, we also recover the posterior of the SN-only peculiar-velocity field, although we do not interpret it in this work. We compute updated cosmological constraints with Union3 and UNITY1.5, finding weak 1.7--2.6 sigma tension with LambdaCDM and possible evidence for thawing dark energy (w0 &gt; -1, wa &lt; 0). We release our SN distances, light-curve fits, and UNITY1.5 framework to the community.</description>

      <title>A new "temperature inversion" estimator to detect CMB patchy screening by large-scale structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thomson scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons imprints various properties of the baryons around galaxies on the CMB. One such imprint, called patchy screening, is a direct probe of the gas density profile around galaxies. It usefully complements the information from the kinematic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and does not require individual redshifts. In this paper, we derive new estimators of patchy screening called the "temperature inversion" (TI) and "signed" estimators, analogous to the gradient inversion estimator of CMB lensing. Pedagogically, we clarify the relation between these estimators and the standard patchy screening quadratic estimator (QE). The new estimators trade optimality for robustness to biases caused by the dominant CMB lensing and foreground contaminants, allowing the use of smaller angular scales. We perform a simulated analysis to realistically forecast the expected precision of patchy screening measurements from four CMB experiments, ACT, SPT, Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4, cross-correlated with three galaxy samples from BOSS, unWISE and the simulated Rubin LSST Data Challenge 2 catalog. Our results give further confidence in the first detection of this effect from the ACT$\times$unWISE data in the companion paper and show patchy screening will be a powerful observable for future surveys like SO, CMB-S4 and LSST. Implementations of the patchy screening QE and the TI and signed estimators are publicly available in our LensQuEst and ThumbStack software packages, available at https://github.com/EmmanuelSchaan/LensQuEst and https://github.com/EmmanuelSchaan/ThumbStack , respectively.</description>

      <title>Diverse dark matter haloes in Two-field Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is a compelling candidate for dark matter, offering a natural explanation for the structure of diffuse low-mass haloes. However, the canonical FDM model with a mass of $10^{-22}~{\rm eV}$ encounters challenges in reproducing the observed diversity of dwarf galaxies, except for possibly scenarios where strong galactic feedback is invoked. The introduction of multiple-field FDM can provide a potential resolution to this diversity issue. The theoretical plausibility of this dark matter model is also enhanced by the fact that multiple axion species with logarithmically-distributed mass spectrum exist as a generic prediction of string theory. In this paper, we consider the axiverse hypothesis and investigate non-linear structure formation in the two-field fuzzy dark matter (2FDM) model. Our cosmological simulation with an unprecedented resolution and self-consistent initial conditions reveals the diverse structures of dark matter haloes in the 2FDM model for the first time. Depending on the formation time and local tidal activities, late-time haloes can host solitons of nested cores or solitons of one dominant species.</description>

      <title>Window convolution of the galaxy clustering bispectrum</title>

Abstract: In galaxy survey analysis, the observed clustering statistics do not directly match theoretical predictions but rather have been processed by a window function that arises from the survey geometry including the sky footprint, redshift-dependent background number density and systematic weights. While window convolution of the power spectrum is well studied, for the bispectrum with a larger number of degrees of freedom, it poses a significant numerical and computational challenge. In this work, we consider the effect of the survey window in the tripolar spherical harmonic decomposition of the bispectrum and lay down a formal procedure for their convolution via a series expansion of configuration-space three-point correlation functions, which was first proposed by Sugiyama et al. (2019). We then provide a linear algebra formulation of the full window convolution, where an unwindowed bispectrum model vector can be directly premultiplied by a window matrix specific to each survey geometry. To validate the pipeline, we focus on the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1) luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample in the South Galactic Cap (SGC) in the redshift bin $0.4 \leqslant z \leqslant 0.6$. We first perform convergence checks on the measurement of the window function from discrete random catalogues, and then investigate the convergence of the window convolution series expansion truncated at a finite of number of terms as well as the performance of the window matrix. This work highlights the differences in window convolution between the power spectrum and bispectrum, and provides a streamlined pipeline for the latter for current surveys such as DESI and the Euclid mission.</description>

      <title>A Sound Horizon-Free Measurement of $H_0$ in DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical size of the sound horizon at recombination is a powerful source of information for early-time measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$, and many proposed solutions to the Hubble tension therefore involve modifications to this scale. In light of this, there has been growing interest in measuring $H_0$ independently of the sound horizon. We present the first such measurement to use data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), jointly analyzing the full-shape galaxy power spectra of DESI luminous red galaxies, emission line galaxies, quasars, and the bright galaxy sample, in a total of six redshift bins. Information from the sound horizon scale is removed from our constraints via a rescaling procedure at the power spectrum level, with our sound horizon-marginalized measurement being driven instead primarily by the matter-radiation equality scale. This measurement is then combined with additional sound horizon-free information from Planck+ACT CMB lensing, uncalibrated type Ia supernovae, and the DESI Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We agnostically combine with the DESY5, Pantheon+, and Union3 supernova datasets, with our tightest respective constraints being $H_0=66.7^{+1.7}_{-1.9},~67.9^{+1.9}_{-2.1},$ and $67.8^{+2.0}_{-2.2}$ km s-1 Mpc-1. This corresponds to a sub-3% sound horizon-free constraint of the Hubble constant, and is the most precise measurement of its kind to date. Even without including information from the sound horizon, our measurement is still in 2.2-3.0$\sigma$ tension with SH0ES. Additionally, the consistency between our result and other measurements that do rely on the sound horizon scale provides no evidence for new early-Universe physics (e.g. early dark energy). Future DESI data releases will allow unprecedented measurements of $H_0$ and place strong constraints on models that use beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics to ameliorate the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic and X-ray Modeling of the Strong Lensing Galaxy Cluster MACS J0138.0-2155</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the total mass and galactic substructure in the strong lensing galaxy cluster MACS J0138.0-2155 using a combination of Chandra X-ray data, Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) spectroscopy, and Hubble Space Telescope imaging. MACS J0138.0-2155 lenses a source galaxy at $z=1.95$ which hosts two strongly lensed supernovae, Requiem and Encore. We find MACS J0138.0-2155 to have an X-ray temperature of $6.7\pm0.4$ keV and a velocity dispersion of cluster member galaxies of $718^{+132}_{-182}$ km s$^{-1}$. These lead to the mass estimates for the cluster of $M_{500} = 5.2^{+1.5}_{-1.2} \times 10^{14} M_\odot$ from the X-ray results and $M_{200} \approx 3.6^{+2.0}_{-2.7} \times 10 ^{14} M_{\odot}$ from the velocity dispersion results. The round morphology of the X-ray emission indicates that this cluster is relaxed with an ellipticity within the lensing region of $e=0.12\pm0.03$. Using 18 of the brightest, non-blended, quiescent galaxies, we fit the cluster specific Faber-Jackson relation, including a set of 81 variations in the analysis choices to estimate the systematic uncertainties in our results. We find a slope of $\alpha = 0.26 \pm 0.06 (\mathrm{stat.}) \pm 0.03 (\mathrm{sys.})$ with an intrinsic scatter of $\Delta \sigma = 31^{+8}_{-6} (\mathrm{stat.}) \pm 4 (\mathrm{sys.})$ km s$^{-1}$ at a reference velocity dispersion of $\sim 220$ km s$^{-1}$. We also report on significant galaxies along the line-of-sight potentially impacting the lens modeling, including a massive galaxy with stellar velocity dispersion of $236 \pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$ which lies close in projection to the central cluster galaxy. This galaxy is part of a small group at a slightly higher redshift than the cluster.</description>

      <title>A theoretical approach to density-split clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytical model for density-split correlation functions, that probe galaxy clustering in different density environments. Specifically, we focus on the cross-correlation between density-split regions and the tracer density field. We show that these correlation functions can be expressed in terms of the two-point probability density function (PDF) of the density field. We derive analytical predictions using three levels of approximation for the two-point PDF: a bivariate Gaussian distribution, a bivariate shifted log-normal distribution, and a prediction based on the Large Deviation Theory (LDT) framework. For count-in-cell densities, obtained through spherical top-hat smoothing, one can leverage spherical collapse dynamics and LDT to predict the density two-point PDF in the large-separation regime relative to the smoothing radius. We validate our model against dark matter N-body simulations in real space, incorporating Poisson shot noise and galaxy bias. Our results show that the LDT prediction outperforms the log-normal approximation, and agrees with simulations on large scales within the cosmic variance of a typical DESI DR1 sample, despite relying on only one degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>In search for the Local Universe dynamical homogeneity scale with CF4++ peculiar velocities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article explores an update to the cosmography of the local Universe within z=0.1, incorporating galaxy peculiar velocity datasets from the first data releases of WALLABY, FAST, and DESI surveys. The galaxies with peculiar velocities currently selected in each survey is 655, 4796, and 4191 respectively. The new CF4++ compendium enables a more comprehensive study of the nearby Universe bulk flow dynamics. We find a bulk flow of 315 \pm 40 km/s at 150 Mpc/h. This analysis additionally reveals that the dynamical scale of homogeneity is not yet reached in the interval [200-300] Mpc/h from the observer. This new data also refines the structure of local superclusters, revealing more spherical shapes and more clearly defined boundaries for key regions such as Great Attractor (Laniakea) and Coma. Very few measurements make a big difference in revealing the hidden Vela supercluster.To help colleagues obtain a peculiar velocity prediction for the object they are currently studying (SNIa, gravitational waves, etc.), we publicly release the CF4++ catalogue, as well as the reconstructed density and velocity fields used in this work.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Binaries in Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight (or fuzzy) dark matter (ULDM) is an alternative to cold dark matter. A key feature of ULDM is the presence of solitonic cores at the centers of collapsed halos. These would potentially increase the drag experienced by supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, changing their merger dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave background. We perform detailed simulations of high-mass SMBH binaries in the soliton of a massive halo. We find more rapid decay than previous simulations and semi-analytic approximations. We confirm expectations that the drag depends strongly on the ULDM particle mass, finding masses greater than $10^{-21}$ eV could potentially alleviate the final parsec problem and that ULDM may even suppress gravitational wave production at lower frequencies in the pulsar timing band.</description>

      <title>Observational Insights on DBI K-essence Models Using Machine Learning and Bayesian Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comparative observational investigation of two Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) k-essence scalar field models that address late-time cosmic acceleration and dark sector dynamics. The first model involves a non-canonical scalar field representing dark energy alongside standard matter, which is regulated by the Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L} = -\left[f(\phi)\sqrt{1- \frac{2X}{f(\phi)}} - f(\phi) + V(\phi)\right] + \mathcal{L}_m$. The second model combines dark matter and dark energy with $ \mathcal{L} = -V(\phi)\sqrt{1-2X}$. The background evolution is based on modified Friedmann and scalar field equations constrained by Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae, Hubble parameter data, and BAO (including DESBAO). A hybrid inference methodology is chosen, which includes Bayesian parameter estimation using the NUTS sampler in {\it NumPyro} and a deep-learning emulator employing supervised neural networks to speed up likelihood computations. A nuisance parameter $\mu_0$ is added to reduce systematics and improve the estimate of $H_0$, $r_d$, and $\Omega_{d0}$. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ exhibits significant differences: Model I yields $q^{\text{Bayes}}_0 = -0.538$, $q^{\text{ML}}_0 = -0.509$, with $z^{\text{Bayes}}_{\text{trans}} = 0.650$, $z^{\text{ML}}_{\text{trans}} = 0.602$, consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, while Model II results in stronger present acceleration ($q^{\text{Bayes}}_0 = -0.831$, $q^{\text{ML}}_0 = -0.780$). Model I performs better statistically and dynamically than Model II, as shown by lower $\chi^2_\nu$, AIC, and BIC values. We additionally use symbolic regression ({\it PySR}) to rebuild analytic forms of $\omega_{\text{eff}}(z)$, which improves interpretability. Model I provides a feasible, statistically preferred alternative to $\Lambda$CDM that addresses the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Imaging systematics induced by galaxy sub-sample fluctuation: new systematics at second order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaging systematics refers to the inhomogeneous distribution of a galaxy sample caused by varying observing conditions and astrophysical foregrounds. Current mitigation methods correct the galaxy density fluctuations, caused by imaging systematics assuming that all galaxies in a sample have the same galaxy density fluctuations. Under this assumption, the corrected sample cannot perfectly recover the true correlation function. We name this effect sub-sample systematics. For a galaxy sample, even if its overall sample statistics (redshift distribution n(z), galaxy bias b(z)), are accurately measured, n(z), b(z) can still vary across the observed footprint. It makes the correlation function amplitude of galaxy clustering higher, while correlation functions for galaxy-galaxy lensing and cosmic shear do not have noticeable change. Such a combination could potentially degenerate with physical signals on small angular scales, such as the amplitude of galaxy clustering, the impact of neutrino mass on the matter power spectrum, etc. Sub-sample systematics, cannot be corrected using imaging systematics mitigation approaches that rely on the cross-correlation signal between imaging systematics maps and the observed galaxy density field. In this paper, we derive formulated expressions of sub-sample systematics, demonstrating its fundamental difference with other imaging systematics. We also provide several toy models to visualize this effect. Finally, we discuss the estimation and mitigation of sub-sample systematics, with a combination of synthetic source injection (SSI), analytical benchmarking on SSI, and self-organizing map.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Remapping for Efficient Generation of 21 cm Intensity Mapping Mocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel application of cosmological rescaling, or "remapping," to generate 21 cm intensity mapping mocks for different cosmologies. The remapping method allows for computationally efficient generation of N-body catalogs by rescaling existing simulations. In this work, we employ the remapping method to construct dark matter halo catalogs, starting from the Horizon Run 4 simulation with WMAP5 cosmology, and apply it to different target cosmologies, including WMAP7, Planck18 and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. These catalogs are then used to simulate 21 cm intensity maps. We use the halo occupation distribution (HOD) method to populate halos with neutral hydrogen (HI) and derive 21 cm brightness temperature maps. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the remapping approach in generating cosmological simulations for large-scale structure studies, offering an alternative for testing observational data pipelines and performing cosmological parameter forecasts without the need for computationally expensive full N-body simulations. We also analyze the precision and limitations of the remapping, in light of the rescaling parameters $s$ and $s_m$, as well as the effects of the halo mass and box size thresholds.</description>

      <title>Gaseous Dynamical Friction: a Numerical Study of Extended Perturbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.15848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of momentum and energy transfer between a massive body and a background medium it is moving through is known as dynamical friction (DF). It is key to our understanding of many astrophysical systems. We present a series of high-resolution simulations of gaseous DF using Lagrangian meshless finite mass hydrodynamics solver, the moving-mesh MUSCL scheme, and the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) solver. We use a set of simulations of massive bodies, modelled as Plummer spheres, moving with Mach $0.2 \leq \mathcal{M} \leq 3$. We investigate at which radial distances from the perturber these solvers recover the linear point mass solution for gaseous DF. We analyse the drag force and the structure and time evolution of the wake. The different solvers agree closely. Numerical convergence is reached when the initial spatial resolution is $0.2r_s$, where $r_s$ is the softening scale of the Plummer sphere. We find that the wake structure and drag force are recovered, at the $5\%$ level, when compared beyond $4r_\mathrm{s}$. Our results predict that models using the standard linear point mass DF solution will overestimate the drag force on extended perturbers by as much as 25\%, for Mach$\sim$1. Finally, we consider DF in the context of galaxy clusters, where dark matter subhaloes move through circumgalactic media. We show that DF is typically in the linear regime for most subhaloes in hosting haloes $&lt;10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ but non-linear in more massive host haloes.</description>

      <title>On the minimum number of radiation field parameters to specify gas cooling and heating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast and accurate approximations of gas cooling and heating functions are needed for hydrodynamic galaxy simulations. We use machine learning to analyze atomic gas cooling and heating functions computed by Cloudy in the presence of a generalized incident local radiation field. We characterize the radiation field through binned radiation field intensities instead of the photoionization rates used in our previous work. We find a set of 6 energy bins whose intensities exhibit relatively low correlation. We use these bins as features to train machine learning models to predict Cloudy cooling and heating functions at fixed metallicity. We compare the relative SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) value importance of the features. From the SHAP analysis, we identify a feature subset of 3 energy bins ($0.5-1, 1-4$, and $13-16 \, \mathrm{Ry}$) with the largest importance and train additional models on this subset. We compare the mean squared errors and distribution of errors on both the entire training data table and a randomly selected 20% test set withheld from model training. The machine learning models trained with 3 and 6 bins, as well as 3 and 4 photoionization rates, have comparable accuracy everywhere, with errors $\gtrsim 10$ times smaller than for the interpolation table of Gnedin and Hollon (2012). We conclude that 3 energy bins (or 3 analogous photoionization rates: molecular hydrogen photodissociation, neutral hydrogen HI, and fully ionized carbon CVI) are sufficient to characterize the dependence of the gas cooling and heating functions on our assumed incident radiation field model.</description>

Abstract: [Abridged] The [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ and [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[NII]$_{122\mu m}$ luminosity ratios have shown to be promising tracers of the ionisation state and gas-phase metallicity of the ISM. Observations of galaxies at redshift $z &gt; 6$ show peculiarly higher [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios compared to local sources. No model has so far successfully managed to match the observed emission from both [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$ and [CII]$_{158\mu m}$ as well as their ratio. We use Cloudy to model the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$, [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$, [NII]$_{122\mu m}$ and [NIII]$_{57\mu m}$ emission lines of Ponos: a high-resolution ($m_{\mathrm{gas}} = 883.4\, M_{\odot}$) cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy at redshift $z = 6.5$, which is post-processed using kramses-rt. We modify Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen abundances in our Cloudy models to obtain C/O and N/O abundance ratios respectively lower and higher than Solar, more in line with recent high-z observational constraints. We find [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios that are a factor of $\sim 5$ higher compared to models assuming solar abundances. Additionally, we find an overall better agreement of the simulation with high-z observational constraints of the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$-SFR and [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$-SFR relations. This shows that a lower C/O abundance ratio is essential to reproduce the enhanced [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios observed at $z &gt; 6$. By assuming a super-solar N/O ratio, motivated by recent $z &gt; 6$ JWST observations, our models yield an [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[NII]$_{122\mu m}$ ratio of $1.3$, which, according to current theoretical models, would be more appropriate for a galaxy with a lower ionisation parameter than the one we estimated for Ponos.</description>

      <title>Massive graviton dark matter searches with long-baseline atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometers offer exceptional sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) by precisely measuring effects on atomic systems. Previous studies have demonstrated their capability to detect scalar and vector ULDM candidates, yet their potential for probing spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM across several frameworks for massive gravity, including the Lorentz-invariant Fierz-Pauli case and two distinct Lorentz-violating scenarios. We show that coherent oscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce measurable phase shifts in atom interferometers through three coupling mechanisms: scalar interactions that modify atomic energy levels, and vector and tensor effects that alter the propagation of both atoms and light. We demonstrate that these multifaceted interactions enable atom interferometers to probe a range of ULDM properties and mass scales that are inaccessible to laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Our results establish the potential of atom interferometers to open a new experimental frontier for spin-2 dark matter detection.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as background and signal in searches using the Migdal effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ionization or excitation resulting from the noninstantaneous response of the electron cloud to nuclear recoil is known as the Migdal effect. Dark matter searches utilizing this process set the most stringent bounds on the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section over a large region of the sub-GeV dark matter parameter space, underscoring its significance in dark matter detection. In this paper, we quantify the regions of dark matter parameter space that are challenging to probe via the Migdal effect due to the presence of dominant solar neutrino backgrounds for both liquid noble and semiconductor targets. Our findings reveal that there is no hard floor in the dark matter parameter space. Instead, we map the so-called neutrino fog. In mapping the neutrino fog, we identify the importance of incorporating the Migdal effect induced by neutrinos, as well as neutrino-electron scattering and dominant coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, particularly for semiconductor targets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a large portion of the relic density allowed parameter space lies within the neutrino fog. Finally, we estimate the exposure required to detect neutrino-induced Migdal events in direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Double Exponents in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19324v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of the potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large values of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion direction is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field remains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The inflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum fluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not feed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and discuss the possibility of such transfer at the post-inflationary stage.</description>

      <title>Simulations of the accreted stellar halos of low-mass field galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict the properties of stellar halos in galaxies of present-day virial mass $10^8 &lt; M_{200} &lt; 10^{12} {\rm M_\odot}$ by combining the GALFORM semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, the COCO cosmological N-body simulation, and the STINGS particle tagging technique. Galaxies in low mass halos have a wide range of stellar halo properties. Their diversity is much greater at fixed stellar mass than fixed virial mass. In the least massive DM halos capable of supporting galaxy formation, accreted mass fractions are &lt; 10 per cent, and the typical density profile of accreted stars is similar to that of stars formed in situ. In low mass galaxies, the radial scale lengths of accreted stellar halos are smaller than those of stellar disks formed in situ, but the accreted component is still diffuse, not bulge-like. At the scale of galaxies like M33, the surface density of accreted stars exceeds that of the in situ component at ~15kpc; the accreted surface density at this radius is $3.5\lesssim \log_{10} M_\star/{\rm M_\odot} \mathrm{kpc^{-2}} \lesssim 6$, varying systematically with virial mass. We compare our predictions to observations and other cosmological simulations. A small but significant number of $\sim 10^{12} {\rm M_\odot}$ halos with exceptionally inefficient star formation -- "failed Milky Ways" -- are more prominent in our model than others; the true abundance of this population is a potential constraint on galaxy formation physics and could be measured by low surface brightness surveys targeting field galaxies with M33-like stellar mass. The stellar particle data for our simulation is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy from an ultralight axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Collaboration presented evidence that the equation of state $w$ of the dark energy is varying, or $w \simeq -0.948$ if it is constant. In either case, the dark energy cannot be due to a cosmological constant alone. Here we study an ultralight axion (or axion-like particle) with mass $m_\phi \simeq 2 \times 10^{-33}$ eV that has properties that can explain the new $w$ measurement. In particular, $w\ge -1$ and a negative cosmological constant $\Lambda &lt; 0$ is preferred in this model. We also present a simple formula for $w$ for the model to ease data fitting.</description>

      <title>Two or three things particle physicists (mis)understand about (pre)heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition from the end of inflation to a hot, thermal Universe, commonly referred to as (re)heating, is a critical yet often misunderstood phase in early Universe cosmology. This short review aims to provide a comprehensive, conceptually clear, and accessible introduction to the physics of (re)heating, tailored to the particle physics community. We critically examine the standard Boltzmann approach, emphasizing its limitations in capturing the intrinsically non-perturbative and non-linear dynamics that dominate the early stages of energy transfer. These include explosive particle production, inflaton fragmentation, turbulence, and thermalization; phenomena often overlooked in perturbative treatments. We survey a wide range of theoretical tools, from Boltzmann equations to lattice simulations, clarifying when each is applicable and highlighting scenarios where analytic control is still feasible. Special attention is given to model-dependent features such as (pre)heating, the role of fermions, gravitational couplings, and the impact of multifield dynamics. We also discuss exceptional cases, including Starobinsky-like models and instant (pre)heating, where (re)heating proceeds through analytically tractable channels without requiring full non-linear simulations. Ultimately, this review serves both as a practical guide and a cautionary tale, advocating for a more nuanced and physically accurate understanding of this pivotal epoch within the particle physics community.</description>

      <title>Fractional attractors in light of the latest ACT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of the latest results from ACT observations we review a class of potentials labeled as fractional attractors, that can originate from Palatini gravity. We show that, for certain choices of the scalar potential $V(\phi)$, the fractional attractors predict both a spectral index $n_s$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ that fall within the $1\sigma$ region of the combined ACT+Planck data for a wide range of parameters. We also provide a numerical fit for the parameter space of this models in the case of a simple quadratic and quartic fractional potential.</description>

      <title>Black hole photon ring beyond General Relativity: an integrable parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the shape of the photon ring in black holes images has been argued to provide a sharp test of the Kerr hypothesis for future black hole imaging missions. In this work, we confront this proposal to beyond Kerr geometries and investigate the degeneracy in the estimations of the black hole parameters using the circlipse shape proposed by Gralla and Lupsasca. To that end, we consider a model-independent parametrization of the deviations to the Kerr black hole geometry, dubbed Kerr off shell (KOS), which preserves the fundamental symmetry structure of Kerr known as the Killing tower. Besides exhibiting a Killing tensor and thus a Carter-like constant, all the representants of this family also possess a Killing-Yano tensor and are of Petrov type D. The allowed deviations to Kerr, selected by the symmetry, are encoded in two free functions which depend respectively on the radial and polar angle coordinates. Using the symmetries, we provide an analytic study of the radial and polar motion of photon trajectories generating the critical curve, to which the subrings composing the photon ring converge. This allows us to derive a ready-to-use closed formula for the parametric critical curve in term of the free functions parametrizing the deviations to Kerr. Using this result, we confront the circlipse fitting function to four examples of Kerr-like objects and we show that it admits a high degree of degeneracy. At a given inclination, the same circlipse can fit both a Kerr black hole of a given mass and spin $(M,a)$ or a modified rotating black hole with different mass and spin parameters $(M,a)$ and a new parameter $\alpha$. Therefore, future tests of the Kerr hypothesis could be achieved only provided one can measure independently the mass and spin of the black hole to break this degeneracy.</description>
