      <title>Detecting extremely low frequency primordial gravitational wave by gravitational lens system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) are predicted to origin from inflation, according to which a period of accelerated expansion exists in the very early Universe. The detection of PGWs would verify the inflationary theory and determine its energy scale. The traditional method of using B-mode polarization to detect extremely low frequency PGW faces challenges due to the contamination from dust in Milky Way. We investigated the feasibility of using gravitational lens system (GLS) with source of high redshift to detect extremely low frequency PGW. With GLS perturbed by extremely low frequency PGWs, we found that the observed time delay in GLS could strongly deviate from the theoretical one, such strong deviation is the evidence of extremely low frequency PGWs.</description>

      <title>General form of the function $f(\mathbb{Q})$ using cylindrically static spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find an exact static solution in four dimensions to the field equations of the $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity by using a cylindrically static spacetime with two different ansatz, $\nu(r)$ and $\mu(r)$. This solution is derived without imposing any conditions on $f(\mathbb{Q})$. The black hole solution involves four constants: $c_1$, $c_2$, $c_3$, and $c_4$. Among these, $c_1$ is linked to the cosmological constant, $c_2$ to the black hole's mass, while $c_3$ and $c_4$ are responsible for the deviation of the solution from the linear form of $f(\mathbb{Q})$. We demonstrate how the analytical function $f(\mathbb{Q})$ relies on $c_3$. When $c_3$ is zero, $f(\mathbb{Q})$ becomes a constant function, leading to the non-metricity case. We investigate the singularity of this solution and show that the Kretschmann invariant has a much milder singularity compared to the non-metricity case. We produce a black hole that rotates with non-vanishing values of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $f(\mathbb{Q})$ by using a coordinate transformation. Then, we analyze the laws of thermodynamics to determine the physical characteristics of this black hole solution and demonstrate that it is locally thermodynamically stable.</description>

      <title>On regular charged black holes in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As argued in arXiv:2104.10172, introducing a non-minimally coupled scalar field, three-dimensional Einstein gravity can be extended by infinite families of theories which admit simple analytic generalizations of the charged BTZ black hole. Depending on the gravitational couplings, the solutions may describe black holes with one or several horizons and with curvature or BTZ-like singularities. In other cases, the metric function behaves as $f(r)\overset{(r\rightarrow 0)}{\sim} \mathcal{O}(r^{2s})$ with $s\geq 1$, and the black holes are completely regular -- a feature unique to three dimensions. Regularity arises generically i.e., without requiring any fine-tuning of parameters. In this paper we show that all these theories satisfy Birkhoff theorems, so that the most general spherically-symmetric solutions are given by the corresponding static black holes. We perform a thorough characterization of the Penrose diagrams of the solutions, finding a rich structure which includes, in particular, cases which tessellate the plane and others in which the diagrams cannot be drawn in a single plane. We also study the motion of probe particles on the black holes, finding that observers falling to regular black holes reach the center after a finite proper time. Contrary to the singular cases, the particles are not torn apart by tidal forces, so they oscillate between antipodal points describing many-universe orbits. We argue that in those cases the region $r=0$ can be interpreted as a horizon with vanishing surface gravity, giving rise to generic inner-extremal regular black hole solutions. We also analyze the deep interior region of the solutions identifying the presence of Kasner eons and the conditions under which they take place. Finally, we construct new black hole solutions in the case in which infinite towers of terms are included in the action.</description>

      <title>Non-Affine Extensions of the Raychaudhuri Equation in the K-essence Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Raychaudhuri equation (RE) governs the evolution of geodesic congruences in curved spacetime. Here, we extend the classical RE by incorporating non-affine parametrization within the framework of k-essence scalar field dynamics. The non-affine parametrization introduces deviations from purely geodesic congruences (motion), allowing investigation of non-gravitational interactions and external forces. Using a DBI-type k-essence Lagrangian, we analyze the behavior of non-geodesic flow curves in the background FLRW metric, elucidating their role in cosmic acceleration and structure formation. The emergent metric formalism is used to derive a modified RE, revealing new geometric and dynamical features induced by the k-essence field. The cosmological implications of our model are studied by constraining key parameters using observational data from the PANTHEON+SHOES+BAO and Hubble datasets. Our results suggest that non-affine parametrization, coupled with k-essence dynamics, can provide a viable explanation for late-time cosmic acceleration while addressing the Hubble tension. Further, we reinterpret the modified RE as an anti-damped harmonic oscillator, revealing quantum-like effects in cosmic expansion. These results suggest a deep connection between scalar field dynamics and modified gravity, offering new perspectives on the nature of the universe's expansion history.</description>

      <title>Spacetime perturbations and quasi-teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravity is identical to curved spacetime. It is manifested by the curvature of a Riemannian spacetime in general relativity but by torsion or non-metricity in teleparallel gravity models. In this paper, we apply these multiple options to the spacetime perturbation theory and seek the possibilities of representing the gravitation of the background and that of the perturbation in separate ways. We show that the perturbation around a Riemannian background can be described by torsion or non-metricity, so that we have teleparallel like actions for the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Charged Gravastar Solutions in the Finch-Skea Framework with f(\mathbb{Q}) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the features of a charged gravastar within the framework of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity ($\mathbb{Q}$ represents non-metricity) using the Finch-Skea metric. This metric is applied to both the interior and shell regions of the charged gravastar and the field equations are derived accordingly. For the exterior regions, we consider various black holes, i.e., Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m, Bardeen and Hayward regular black holes. The interior and exterior layers are matched using the Israel junction conditions, which help to determine the surface energy density and surface pressure for these black holes. We examine some physical properties such as proper length, entropy, energy and the equation of state parameter. The stability of the developed gravastar model is discussed through the effective potential, the causality condition and adiabatic index. We conclude that the compact gravastar structure could be a viable alternative to black holes within this framework.</description>

      <title>Equations of motion for compact binary systems in general relativity: Do they depend on the bodies' internal structure at the third post-Newtonian order?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and discuss the possibility, derived from work carried out 20 years ago, that the equations of motion for compact binary neutron stars at the third post-Newtonian (3PN) order in general relativity might actually depend on the internal structure of the bodies. These effects involve integrals over the density and internal gravitational potentials of the bodies that are independent of the mass and radius of the bodies, but dependent on their equations of state. These effects could alter the coefficients in the 3PN equations derived using ``point mass'' methods by as much as 100 percent. They were found in independent calculations done at Washington University using the Direct Integration of the Relaxed Einstein Equations (DIRE) approach, and at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris using the Multipolar post-Minkowskian (MPPM) approach. Neither calculation was completed because of the enormous complexity of the algebraic computations and the limitations of software of the day (Maple, Mathematica), and because of an assumption (hope) that the effects would somehow cancel or be removable by some transformation. If these structure-dependent effects are real, but are not incorporated into gravitational waveforms, they could severely impact efforts using next-generation gravitational-wave interferometers to extract information about the equation of state for neutron star matter from gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star mergers. Conversely, if they exactly cancel or can be absorbed into renormalized masses or shifted positions of each body, this would provide further support for the Strong Equivalence Principle of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Evaporation of regular black holes in 2D dilaton gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general class of non-singular black holes in semi-classical, two-dimensional dilaton gravity, with a focus on a Bardeen-like model. The equations of motion for an evaporating black hole including backreaction are solved numerically. The apparent horizons evaporate smoothly in finite time to form a compact trapped region. Backreaction effects lead to the formation of additional trapped and anti-trapped regions after the primary black hole becomes un-trapped. Numerical simulations of microscopic black holes yield a final spacetime that is free of apparent horizons and Cauchy horizons. This would imply that the evaporation of regular black holes is a unitary process.</description>

      <title>Cosmic dynamics and observational constraints in $f(Q)$ gravity with affine equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the cosmological implications of $f(Q)$ gravity with an affine equation of state (EoS). We study the impact of affine EoS on the cosmic evolution in model and derive the functional form of $f(Q)$ gravity realizing this kind of scenario. We show that the non-metricity scalar may describe the unified scenario in which the universe transits from the decelerated expansion into the accelerated expansion. The model parameters are constrained through the Bayesian analysis based on $\chi^{2}$ minimization technique with the observational data of the cosmic chronometer and supernovae type Ia. The cosmic dynamics based on constrained parameters describe the observable universe evolution. The present day values of the cosmological parameters along with the current age of the universe are compatible with the observations.</description>

      <title>On covariant and canonical Hamiltonian formalisms: Weakly Isolated Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian description of classical gauge theories is a well studied subject. The two best known approaches, namely the covariant and canonical Hamiltonian formalisms have received a lot of attention in the literature. However, in our opinion, a full understanding of the relation between them is not available, specially for gauge theories that are defined over regions with boundaries. Here we consider this issue, for spacetimes with isolated horizons as inner boundaries (representing black holes in equilibrium), and assess whether their corresponding descriptions can be seen as equivalent. First, we shall review and reanalyze both formalisms from anew, focusing on some subtleties not considered before. Next we show that, if we compare them at face value, there are subtle differences between both formalisms, for instance in the derivation of horizon energy, a physical observable of the theory, as well as in the number of boundary degrees of freedom. At first sight, it seems that the canonical formalism introduces some additional ambiguities that make more challenging the comparison between both formalisms. We analyze different possible interpretations in both approaches and show how one can obtain complete correspondence between results within covariant and canonical formalisms. We also show that the correspondence can be achieved in the original phase spaces, with no boundary degrees of freedom, or by appropriately extending them by adding horizon degrees of freedom. Along the way, we shed light on the role of boundary terms in the symplectic structure in relation to boundary degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory for post-Newtonian neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars are compact, relativistic bodies that host several extremes of modern physics. An exciting development in recent years has been the opportunity to probe this exotic physics by observing compact-binary coalescences using sensitive gravitational-wave and electromagnetic instruments. To maximise the science inferred from these measurements, we require models that accurately represent the physics. In this study, we consider the post-Newtonian approximation to general relativity for the modelling of neutron-star dynamics, with a particular view to model dynamical tides at the late stages of binary inspiral. We develop the post-Newtonian perturbation equations for a non-rotating star and show that the perturbation problem is Hermitian and therefore derives from a fundamental Lagrangian. Establishing this Lagrangian system leads to a conserved symplectic product and canonical energy for the perturbations. We determine the orthogonality condition for the post-Newtonian oscillation modes, which in turn forms the foundation of a mode-sum representation often used for dynamical tides. Finally, we demonstrate that the perturbation formulation is unique.</description>

      <title>Constraints on inflationary decoherence from attractor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum-to-classical transition of inflationary perturbations remains a fundamental challenge in cosmology, and quantum decoherence is one of the proposed solutions to this issue. By treating primordial quantum perturbations as an open quantum system interacting with environmental degrees of freedom during inflation, decoherence can be described by the Lindblad master equation. Lindblad equation modifies the dynamical evolution of the primordial quantum perturbations and affects the power spectrum of the curvature perturbations, resulting in changes in the primordial power spectrum. In this paper, we examine the decoherence process of a polynomial attractor model that includes an ultra-slow-roll plateau. We compare our findings with previous results from slow-roll analyses. We numerically compute the corrections to the power spectrum due to decoherence. The results show significant modifications only on large scales, with a peak appearing at the minimum of the power spectrum. Using CMB constraints on the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio, and requiring complete decoherence for relevant scales by the end of inflation, we constrain the interaction parameter: $10^{-28}\text{Mpc}^{-1}&lt;k_\gamma&lt;0.042\text{Mpc}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Evolution of human cognition required Einstein's gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an unexpected anthropic fine-tuning of gravity: human cognition arose on Earth only because the laws of gravity included gravitational waves. Their link is the heat from decays of the radioactive isotopes U-238 and Th-232, which were synthesized mainly in rare explosive mergers of binary neutron stars, brought about by the loss of orbital energy to gravitational radiation. This heat, released in Earth's interior, has (1) maintained plate tectonics and (2) likely helped keep Earth's iron core molten. The core's magnetic field has protected all life from annihilation by the solar wind. More surprisingly, relative brain size, a proxy for cognition, has seen two sharp increases, first for mammals and then for humans, both attributed by evolutionary biologists to adaptations to major climatic changes caused by specific tectonic events. After the second event, the joining of North and South America, human brain size grew from chimpanzee levels to modern ones. If the laws of gravity had not included gravitational waves, humans would not be capable of studying the laws of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, black hole models in a nonlinear modification of the Maxwell electrodynamics were suggested, possessing simultaneously properties of an extreme charge and regularity (Bronnikov K. A., Phys. Rev. D, 110 (2024) 024021). We study quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field around such black holes and show that they are characterized by a comparatively small damping rate, indicating the possible existence of arbitrarily long-lived quasinormal modes, called quasi-resonances.</description>

      <title>Searching for continuous gravitational waves from highly deformed compact objects with DECIGO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for continuous gravitational waves from isolated compact objects and those in binary systems aim to detect non-axisymmetric, deformed neutron stars at particular locations in the Galaxy or all-sky. However, a large fraction of known pulsars have rotational frequencies that lie outside the audio frequency band, rendering current detectors insensitive to these pulsars. In this work, we show that DECIGO, a future space-based deci-hertz gravitational-wave interferometer, will be sensitive to severely deformed compact objects, e.g. hybrid stars, neutron stars, or magnetars. We estimate the number of possible compact objects that could be detected with such high deformations, both via their individual continuous gravitational-wave emission and the stochastic gravitational-wave background created by a superposition of gravitational waves from the $\sim 10^8$ compact objects in the Galaxy. Furthermore, we show that the existence of such compact objects could be probed across a wide parameter space at a fraction of the computational cost of current searches for isolated compact objects and those in binary systems. For known pulsars, we will be able to both beat the spin-down limit and probe the Brans-Dicke modified theory of gravity parameter $\zeta&lt;1$ for approximately 85% of known pulsars with $f_{\rm gw}&lt;10$ Hz, the latter of which is currently only possible for $O(10)$ pulsars. DECIGO will thus open a new window to probe highly deformed compact objects and over half of the known pulsars, both of which are currently inaccessible to ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Impact of the cosmic neutrino background on black hole superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the effect of the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) on the superradiant phase caused by an ultralight scalar field around a spinning black hole (BH). When the scalar-neutrino Yukawa coupling $y_{\phi \nu}$ reaches values near $10^{-16}$ for astrophysical black holes (ApBHs) or $10^{-20}$ for supermassive black holes (SMBHs), thermal field theory corrections to the scalar field self-interaction drive superradiant instability, regardless of whether the scalar field constitutes dark matter. Additionally, we assess how these thermal corrections influence the scalar field mass $m_\phi$. In scenarios lacking self-interactions, these effects impose stricter constraints on the parameter space of the scalar field. Assuming two degenerate C$\nu$B neutrino masses and an inverted mass ordering, these Yukawa couplings constrain $y_{\phi \nu}$ to values as large as $10^{-6}$ for ApBHs and $10^{-11}$ for SMBHs, with comparable results for massless neutrinos or normal mass ordering. We also examine the robustness of these findings in light of astrophysical uncertainties near the BH and highlight prospects for future observational discoveries.</description>

      <title>Path integral measures and diffeomorphism invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much like the action, diffeomorphism invariance can be used to fix the form of the path integral measure in quantum gravity. Moreover, since there is a redundancy between what constitutes "the action" and what constitutes "the measure" one can always pick a minimal form of the latter. However, the authors of the recent papers arXiv:2412.14108, arXiv:2412.10194 have advocated a form of the path integral measure for quantum gravity, proposed long ago by Fradkin and Vilkovisky, that is not invariant. This is easily seen since it depends explicitly on the $g^{00}$ component of the inverse metric without being contracted to form a scalar. An equally non-invariant measure was proposed in arXiv:2009.00728. As noted by their proponents, when these measures are used, certain divergences that typically appear are absent. However, the divergences that remain with the proposed measures are, unsurprisingly, neither diffeomorphism-invariant nor is the regulated effective action. We demonstrate this explicitly by computing the free scalar field contribution to the divergent part of the gravitational effective action using different measures and a proper-time cutoff. We support our findings with a thorough discussion of the path integral measure. In particular, we see how the contributions from the measure, obtained in a canonical setting, could be reinterpreted in a relational way compatible with diffeomorphism invariance.</description>

      <title>Gravito-electromagnetism, Kerr-Schild and Weyl double copies; a unified perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two modern programs involving analogies between general relativity and electromagnetism, gravito-electromagnetism (GEM) and the classical double copy (CDC), induce electromagnetic potentials from specific classes of spacetime metrics. We demonstrate such electromagnetic potentials are gauge equivalent to Killing vectors present in the spacetime, long known themselves to be analogous to electromagnetic potentials. We utilize this perspective to relate the Type D Weyl double copy to the Kerr-Schild double copy without appealing to specific coordinates. We analyze the typical assumptions taken within Kerr-Schild double copies, emphasizing the role Killing vectors play in the construction. The basis of the GEM program utilizes comparisons of tidal tensors between GR and EM; we perform a more detailed analysis of conditions necessary for equivalent tidal tensors between the theories, and note they require the same source prescription as the classical double copy. We discuss how these Killing vector potentials relate to the Weyl double copy, in particular there must a relation between the field strength formed from the Killing vector and the Weyl tensor. We consider spacetimes admitting a Killing-Yano tensor which provide a particularly insightful example of this correspondence. This includes a broad class of spacetimes, and provides an explanation for observations regarding the splitting of the Weyl tensor noted when including sources.</description>

      <title>Using Gravitational Wave Signals to Disentangle Early Matter Dominated Epochs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curvature perturbations induce gravitational waves (GWs) at second order, contributing to the stochastic gravitational wave background. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum is sensitive to the evolutionary history of the universe and can be substantially enhanced by early matter-dominated (eMD) epochs, particularly if they end rapidly. Such epochs can be caused by primordial black holes (PBHs) and non-topological solitons (Q-balls), for example. Prior analysis approximated the end of the eMD epoch as instantaneous or used a Gaussian smoothing. In this work, we present a complete analysis fully incorporating their time-evolving decay rates. We demonstrate that the resulting signal spectra from PBH, thin wall Q-ball, thick wall Q-ball, and delayed Q-ball eMD epochs are distinguishable for monochromatic distributions. We then consider log-normal mass distributions and discuss the distinguishability of the various GW spectra. Importantly we find that the change in the spectrum from a finite mass width is qualitatively different from the change arising from a slower transition to radiation domination.</description>

      <title>Periodic Cosmic String Formation and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study string formation and dynamics in a scalar field theory with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. If a scalar field $\Phi$ is initially displaced from the minimum of a wine-bottle potential, even if uniformly over large spatial patches, small spatial perturbations to $\Phi$ grow via parametric resonance as $\Phi$ oscillates; this occurs for a wide range of initial $U(1)$ charge densities. The growth of perturbations leads to the formation of spatially coherent, temporally stable "counter-rotating regions" (CRR): spatially connected regions exhibiting $\Phi$ evolution with large, opposite-sign rotation speeds in field space which persist over long durations. These CRR are separated by domain boundaries that have a large field gradient and zero rotational speed in field space. String or vortex topological defects form, are confined to, and then annihilate periodically on these boundaries. We demonstrate these periodic dynamics with numerical simulations in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, in both Minkowski spacetime and in a radiation-dominated FLRW universe, and we explain some features of the evolution (semi-)analytically. At late times in an expanding universe, when $\Phi$ approaches the potential minimum, the CRR and vortices dissipate into scalar radiation. Phenomenologically, periodic bursts of string formation and annihilation can lead to periodic bursts of gravitational-wave production. For small initial $U(1)$ charge density, these gravitational-wave bursts can be synchronized across the whole Universe. Owing to their periodic nature, they could give rise to a gravitational-wave frequency spectrum consisting of a forest of peaks. These periodic scalar field dynamics also occur with large, untuned initial $U(1)$ charge density; they may thus have implications for models that depend on a coherent field rotation, such as kination and the axion kinetic-misalignment mechanism.

      <title>Bilateral constraints on proton Lorentz violation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the early reports of events beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff, the investigation of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays has emerged as a fundamental method for testing Lorentz Invariance violation (LV) effects. Recent advances in observational capabilities have resulted in more stringent constraints on LV parameters. This study delves into the potentially anomalous phenomena arising from subluminal and superluminal LV effects, encompassing aspects such as proton decay and atypical threshold behavior of photo-pion production from protons within the GZK region. High-energy proton observations in cosmic rays have imposed stringent constraints on superluminal proton LV effects, while the confirmation of the GZK cutoff has established a robust boundary for the anomalous phenomena associated with subluminal proton LV effects. The research provides rigorously bilateral constraints on proton LV effects from both subluminal and superluminal standpoints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the Higgs particle in the cosmic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) below the electroweak phase transition temperature $T_\mathrm{EW}\simeq 125\mathrm{\,GeV}$. We show that Higgs is neither in abundance (chemical) nor in momentum distribution equilibrium in certain stages of the Universe evolution. Nonequilibrium originates in: For chemical nonequilibrium in the always present irreversible decays into virtual heavy gauge bosons, and; For $T&lt;25$\,GeV in relatively rapid $2\leftrightarrow 1$ formation and decay processes yielding momentum distribution as created in these reactions. As heavy particles disappear, the minimal Higgs coupling to abundant low mass particles fails in $2\to2$ (two-particle) scattering processes to assure a kinetic distribution equilibrium. The expansion of the Universe is by more than 10 orders of magnitude slower compared to microscopic processes. All other particles in the Universe are in full thermal equilibrium, with exception of the late in QGP evolution of the bottom flavor near to hadronization condition.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a Lorentz-covariant bispinorial wave function and wave equation for a single photon on a curved background with no symmetries. We show the existence of a 10-dimensional set of conservation laws for this equation, and prove that on an asymptotically flat background 8 of these conservation laws yield global, gauge-invariant, ADM-like quantities that together define a covariantly constant self-dual bispinor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel logarithmic spectral estimation method for dark matter searches using gravitational-wave detectors, integrating established dark matter search techniques with insights from computer music analysis. By leveraging symmetries between the time and frequency domains, this method matches the computational efficiency of FFT based algorithms without, unlike such algorithms, compromising precision. We apply this approach to data from LIGO's third observing run, directly comparing its performance with that of a previous search. Our results show a consistent 15 percent improvement across nearly the entire frequency range, without additional computational costs. With potential for further refinements, this method already offers a solution capable of maximizing the scientific potential of current and future gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a black hole microstate counting method based on the canonical quantization of the asymptotic symmetries of a two-dimensional dilaton-gravity system at future null infinity. This dilaton-gravity is obtained from the s-wave reduction of an $N$-dimensional Einstein gravity over a generic asymptotically flat black hole solution. We show that a Cardy-type formula leads to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. In this scenario, the quantized bulk degrees of freedom act as a source for the dual field theory operators living at future null infinity that are soft gravitons of the higher dimensional system, up to some gauge fixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological censorship theorem suggests that higher dimensional black holes can possess the domain of outer communication (DOC) of nontrivial topology. In this paper, we seek for a black hole coexisting with two bubbles adjacent to the horizon in five-dimensional minimal supergravity, under the assumptions of stationarity and bi-axisymmetry. For simplicity, we also assume that the spacetime is symmetric under the exchange of the two axisymmetric Killing vectors. To find the solution, we combine the inverse scattering method and the Harrison transformation, and we present the conditions for the absence of conical, orbifold and Dirac-Misner string singularities, respectively. As the result, we find that the black hole with topology of $S^3$ or $S^2\times S^1$ can be supported by two bubbles if we admit the conical singularities (deficits).</description>

Abstract: We establish limitations and bounds on the transmission of quantum states between gravitationally interacting mechanical oscillators under different models of gravity. This provides benchmarks that can enable tests for quantum features of gravity. Our proposal does not require the measurement of gravitationally induced entanglement and only requires final measurements of a single subsystem. We discuss bounds for classical models based on local operations and classical communication when considering coherent-state alphabets, and we discuss the transfer of quantum squeezing for falsifying the Schr\"odinger-Newton model.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Cosmological Constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamical realisation of the equation of state $p +\rho =0$ is studied. A non-pathological dynamics for the perturbations of such a system mimicking a dynamical cosmological constant (DCC) requires to go beyond the perfect fluid paradigm. It is shown that an anisotropic stress must be always present. The Hamiltonian of the system in isolation resembles the one of a Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator and linear stability requires that it cannot be positive definite. The dynamics of linear cosmological perturbations in a DCC dominated Universe is studied in detail showing that when DCC is minimally coupled to gravity no dramatic instability is present. In contrast to what happens in a cosmological constant dominated Universe, the non-relativistic matter contrast is no longer constant and exhibits an oscillator behaviour at small scales while it grows weakly at large scales. In the gravitational waves sector, at small scales, the amplitude is still suppressed as the inverse power of the scale factor while it grows logarithmically at large scales. Also the vector modes propagate, though no growing mode is found.</description>

      <title>Quantum of action in entangled relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03824v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate that the novel general theory of relativity named `Entangled Relativity' is more economical than General Relativity in terms of universal dimensionful constants and units when both theories are considered through a path integral formulation. The sole parameter of Entangled Relativity is a quantum of energy squared. However, in order to recover standard Quantum Field Theory when gravity is neglected in the path integral, we show that this quantum of energy corresponds to the reduced Planck energy. But this result also implies that Planck's quantum of action $\hbar$ and Newton's constant $G$ are not fixed constants in this framework but vary proportionally to a gravitational scalar degree-of-freedom, akin to typical scalar-tensor and $f(R)$ theories. In particular, it is derived that $\hbar$ is proportional to $G$ in this framework. This establishes an explicit connection between the quantum and gravitational realms. Given the absence of any free theoretical parameter in the theory, we evaluate the level of variation of $\hbar$ and $G$ in the solar system and for neutron stars. We argue that this type of quantitative predictions might be probed observationally in the future, although their amplitudes are extremely small.</description>

      <title>Impact of bulk viscosity on the post-merger gravitational-wave signal from merging neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the violent post-merger of binary neutron-star mergers strong oscillations are present that impact the emitted gravitational-wave (GW) signal. The frequencies, temperatures and densities involved in these oscillations allow for violations of the chemical equilibrium promoted by weak-interactions, thus leading to a nonzero bulk viscosity that can impact dynamics and GW signals. We present the first simulations of binary neutron-star mergers employing the self-consistent and second-order formulation of the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics for dissipative fluids proposed by M\"uller, Israel and Stewart. With the spirit of obtaining a first assessment of the impact of bulk viscosity on the structure and radiative efficiency of the merger remnant we adopt a simplified but realistic approach for the viscosity, which we assume to be determined by direct and modified Urca reactions and hence to vary within the stars. At the same time, to compensate for the lack of a precise knowledge about the strength of bulk viscosity, we explore the possible behaviours by considering three different scenarios of low, medium, and high bulk viscosity. In this way, we find that large values of the bulk viscosities damp the collision-and-bounce oscillations that characterize the dynamics of the stellar cores right after the merger. At the same time, large viscosities tend to preserve the $m=2$ deformations in the remnant, thus leading to a comparatively more efficient GW emission and to changes in the post-merger spectrum that can be up to $100\,{\rm Hz}$ in the case of the most extreme configurations. Overall, our self-consistent results indicate that bulk viscosity increases the energy radiated in GWs soon after the merger by $\lesssim 2\%$ in the (realistic) scenario of small viscosity, and by $\lesssim 30\%$ in the (unrealistic) scenario of large viscosity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The early post-merger phase of a binary neutron-star coalescence is shaped by characteristic rotational velocities as well as violent density oscillations and offers the possibility to constrain the properties of neutron star matter by observing the gravitational wave emission. One possibility to do so is the investigation of gravitational wave damping through the bulk viscosity which originates from violations of weak chemical equilibrium. Motivated by these prospects, we present a comprehensive report about the implementation of the self-consistent and second-order formulation of the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics for dissipative fluids proposed by M\"uller, Israel and Stewart. Furthermore, we report on the results of two test problems, namely the viscous damping of linear density oscillations of isolated nonrotating neutron stars and the viscous migration test, both of which confirm our implementation and can be used for future code tests. Finally, we present fully general-relativistic simulations of viscous binary neutron-star mergers. We explore the structural and thermal properties of binary neutron-star mergers with a constant bulk-viscosity prescription and investigate the impact of bulk viscosity on dynamical mass ejection. We find that inverse Reynolds numbers $\sim 1\%$ can be achieved for the highest employed viscosity thereby suppressing the dynamically ejected mass by a factor of $\sim 5$ compared to the inviscid case.</description>

      <title>Scattering and dynamical capture of two black holes: synergies between numerical and analytical methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study initially unbound systems of two black holes using numerical relativity (NR) simulations performed with GR-Athena++. We focus on regions of the parameter space close to the transition from scatterings to dynamical captures, considering equal mass and spin-aligned configurations, as well as unequal mass and nonspinning ones. The numerical results are then used to validate the effective-one-body (EOB) model TEOBResumS-Dal\'i for dynamical captures and scatterings. We find good agreement for the waveform phenomenologies, scattering angles, mismatches, and energetics in the low energy regime ($E_0\lesssim 1.02\,M$). In particular, mismatches weighted with the zero-detuned, high-power noise spectral density of Advanced LIGO are typically below or around the $1\%$ level, with only a few cases, corresponding to spinning binaries, slightly above the $3\%$ threshold, thus suggesting the usability of TEOBResumS-Dal\'i for current data analysis of low-energy scatterings and dynamical captures. We also discuss dynamical captures in the test-mass limit by solving numerically the Zerilli equation with the time domain code RWZHyp. The latter analysis provides valuable insights into both the analytical noncircular corrections of the EOB waveform and the integration of NR Weyl scalars.</description>

      <title>Quasistationary hair for binary black hole initial data in scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent efforts to numerically simulate compact objects in alternative theories of gravity have largely focused on the time-evolution equations. Another critical aspect is the construction of constraint-satisfying initial data with precise control over the properties of the systems under consideration. Here, we augment the extended conformal thin sandwich framework to construct quasistationary initial data for black hole systems in scalar Gauss-Bonnet theory and numerically implement it in the open-source SpECTRE code. Despite the resulting elliptic system being singular at black hole horizons, we demonstrate how to construct numerical solutions that extend smoothly across the horizon. We obtain quasistationary scalar hair configurations in the test-field limit for black holes with linear/angular momentum as well as for black hole binaries. For isolated black holes, we explicitly show that the scalar profile obtained is stationary by evolving the system in time and compare against previous formulations of scalar Gauss-Bonnet initial data. In the case of the binary, we find that the scalar hair near the black holes can be markedly altered by the presence of the other black hole. The initial data constructed here enable targeted simulations in scalar Gauss-Bonnet simulations with reduced initial transients.</description>

      <title>The principled-parameterized approach to gravitational collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New physics beyond General Relativity impacts black-hole spacetimes. The effects of new physics can be investigated in a largely theory-agnostic way by following the principled-parameterized approach. In this approach, a classical black-hole metric is upgraded by following a set of principles, such as regularity, i.e., the absence of curvature singularities. We expect these principles to hold in many theories beyond General Relativity. In the present paper, we implement this approach for time-dependent spacetimes describing gravitational collapse. We find that the Vaidya spacetime becomes regular through the same modification of the spacetime metric as stationary black-hole spacetimes [1-3]. We investigate null geodesics and find indications that the modification is even sufficient to render null geodesics future complete. Finally, we find that the modification of the spacetime structure results in violations of the null energy condition in a finite region inside the apparent horizon of the black hole that forms. Null geodesics are attracted to the boundary of this region, such that the new-physics effects are shielded from asymptotic observers. An exception occurs, if the classical spacetime has a naked singularity. Then, the upgraded spacetime is singularity-free and null geodesics from the regular core can escape towards asymptotic observers.</description>

Abstract: The generalization of photon spheres by considering the trajectories of massive particles leads to the definition of Massive Particle Surfaces (MPS). These surfaces are built with the trajectories of massive particles, and have a partial umbilicity property. Using the geodesic and Gaussian curvature of the Jacobi metric (a Riemannian metric) we derive a general condition for the existence of a Massive Particle Surface defined for an asymptotically flat spacetime metric. Our results can be applied to the worldlines of charged massive particle surfaces. We provide a simple characterization for timelike and null trajectories using a Riemannian geometric approach. We are able to recover the results for the existence of Light Rings (LR's) and timelike circular orbits (TCO's). We show how an event horizon gets characterized using the curvatures of a Riemannian metric. We discuss several examples, where we derive conditions for the existence of photon sphere and a massive particle surface. We calculate the radius of the photon sphere and the radius of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbits (ISCO).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Newtonian gravity, it is well known that Kepler's problem admits no bound solutions in more than three spatial dimensions. This limitation extends naturally to General Relativity, where Tangherlini demonstrated that Schwarzschild black holes in higher dimensions admit no bound timelike geodesics. However, an analogous result for the rotating counterpart of the five-dimensional Tangherlini spacetime - the $d=5$ Myers-Perry black hole - has not yet been established. This work addresses this gap by proving that no bound timelike geodesics exist outside the event horizon of a $d=5$ Myers-Perry black hole, for any choice of spin parameters that avoid naked singularities. With this result in place, we further generalize to null geodesics. It is shown that radially bound null geodesics, which are absent in the four-dimensional Kerr spacetime as established by Wilkins, also cannot exist in the $d=5$ Myers-Perry spacetime. These results complete the geodesic analysis of this spacetime and provide a direct generalization of Wilkins' classical result to higher dimensions. Specifically, we establish the following theorem: no radially bound timelike or null geodesics are possible outside the event horizon of a $d=5$ Myers-Perry black hole, regardless of the spin configuration.</description>

Abstract: Quasinormal modes are excited during the ringdown phase of black holes after merger. Determination of quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes in alternative theories of gravity has remained a challenge for a long time. Here we discuss in detail our recently developed method to extract the quasinormal modes for rapidly rotating black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton theory. We first obtain numerically the exact rapidly rotating background solutions, which also clarify their domain of existence. Then we solve the equations for the linear perturbations of the metric and the dilaton field by employing an appropriate set of boundary conditions and a spectral decomposition of the perturbation functions. The resulting spectrum agrees well with the known limits obtained for slow rotation and weak coupling, while it exhibits larger deviations for stronger coupling.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scenario based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics: Thermodynamic constraints on a generalized cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first and second laws of thermodynamics should lead to a consistent scenario for discussing the cosmological constant problem. In the present study, to establish such a thermodynamic scenario, cosmological equations in a flat Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker universe were derived from the first law, using an arbitrary entropy $S_{H}$ on a cosmological horizon. Then, the cosmological equations were formulated based on a general formulation that includes two extra driving terms, $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$, which are usually used for, e.g., time-varying $\Lambda (t)$ cosmology and bulk viscous cosmology, respectively. In addition, thermodynamic constraints on the two terms are examined using the second law of thermodynamics, extending a previous analysis [Phys. Rev. D 99, 043523 (2019) (arXiv:1810.11138)]. It is found that a deviation $S_{\Delta}$ of $S_{H}$ from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy plays important roles in the two terms. The second law should constrain the upper limits of $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ in our late Universe. The orders of the two terms are likely consistent with the order of the cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$ measured by observations. In particular, when the deviation $S_{\Delta}$ is close to zero, $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ and $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ should reduce to zero and a constant value (consistent with the order of $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$), respectively, as if a consistent and viable scenario could be obtained from thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Accounting for the Known Unknown: A Parametric Framework to Incorporate Systematic Waveform Errors in Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Parameter Estimation (PE) for Gravitational Waves (GW) merger events relies on a waveform model calibrated using numerical simulations. Within the Bayesian framework, this waveform model represents the GW signal produced during the merger and is crucial for estimating the likelihood function. However, these waveform models may possess systematic errors that can differ across the parameter space. Addressing these errors in the current data analysis pipeline is an active area of research. This work presents a framework for accounting for uncertainties in waveform modeling. We introduce two parametrizations, relative and absolute errors in the phase of the waveform, to modify the base waveform model, which can account for uncertainties. When the waveform errors are known, those error budgets can be used as a prior distribution in the Bayesian framework. We also show that conservative priors can be used to quantify uncertainties in waveform modeling without any knowledge of waveform error budgets. By conducting zero-noise injections and recoveries, we demonstrate through PE results that even 1-2% of errors in relative phase to the actual waveform model can introduce biases in the recovered parameters. These biases can be corrected when we account for waveform uncertainties within the PE framework. By injecting a series of precessing waveform models and using the nonspinning model for recovery, we show that our method can account for the missing physics by making the posterior samples broad enough to account for bias. We also present a Python package that is easily integrated with the publicly available GW analysis tool PyCBC and can be used to do PE with the parametrization presented in this paper.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a situation where a holographic CFT state has multiple semiclassical bulk duals. In our example, a given holographic state has two simple, semiclassical descriptions, one with a closed universe, constructed using the gravitational path integral, and one without a closed universe, constructed using the extrapolate dictionary. This highlights an ambiguity in the AdS/CFT dictionary. We propose various options for resolving this tension although none are perfectly satisfactory. We also discuss what this implies for the black hole interior and the gravitational path integral.</description>

Abstract: The effect of noise induced by gravitons on a Bose-Einstein condensate has been explored in (Phys. Rev. D 110 (2024) 026014; https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.026014). In the previous paper, we investigated the effects of graviton while detecting a gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein condensate. In this work we shall explicitly calculate the decoherence due to the noise of gravitons between two momentum states of the Bose-Einstein condensate. This decoherence happens due to Bremsstrahlung from the Bose-Einstein condensates due to the effect of the noise induced by gravitons. It is also observed that the two states become entangled because of the existence of a surrounding graviton field which degrades over time via means of this gravitational Bremsstrahlung. Using this property of the Bose-Einstein condensate in a quantum gravity background, we propose an experimental test via the use of atom lasers (generated from the condensate) which would, in principle, help to detect gravitons in future generations of very advanced ultra-cold temperature experiments.</description>

Abstract: Due to the splitting problem, it is difficult to derive the holographic entanglement entropy for general higher derivative gravity. Inspired by double holography and renormalized entanglement entropy, we develop a method to derive the generalized gravitational entropy for the brane-world higher derivative (BWHD) gravity. Remarkably, this approach is independent of the splitting problem. The so-called BWHD gravity is an effective theory on the brane, given by the counter terms of holographic renormalization. Interestingly, all solutions to Einstein gravity are also solutions to BWHD gravity. We first verify our approach can derive the correct results for curvature-squared gravity and then derive the holographic entanglement entropy for cubic BWHD gravity, which is the main result of this paper. We also derive the entropy of quartic BWHD gravity in flat space with constant extrinsic curvatures and perform several tests on our results. Finally, we briefly comment on our results.</description>

Abstract: With GW170817 being the only multimessenger gravitational wave (GW) event with an associated kilonova (KN) detected so far, there exists a pressing need for realistic estimation of the GW localization uncertainties and rates, as well as optimization of available telescope time to enable the detection of new KNe. For this purpose, we simulate GW events assuming a data-driven, GW-motivated distribution of binary parameters for the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) fourth and fifth observing runs (O4 and O5). For our particular case of estimating KN detection rates in the O4 and O5 runs, we map the binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) properties to the optical light curves arising from r-process nucleosynthesis in the ejecta. We use the simulated population of KNe to generate follow-up observing plans, with the primary goal of optimizing detection with the Gravitational Wave Multi-Messenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS). We explore KN detectability as a function of mass, distance, and spin of the binaries. Out of the mergers that produce a KN in our simulations, we expect detectable KNe for DECam-like instruments at a per-year rate of: $1-16$ ($0-1$) for BNS (NSBH) in O4, and $16-165$ ($1-12$) for BNS (NSBH) in O5, using a fiducial exposure time and conditional on the uncertainty on the equation of state (EOS) and volumetric rates of the mergers. Taking into account observability constraints, our scheduler covers the location of the KN $\sim 30-38\%$ of the times for our fiducial EOS. We provide the depths needed to detect a significant fraction of our simulated mergers for the astronomical community to use in their follow-up campaigns.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormhole in AdS and Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A traversable wormhole generally violates the averaged null energy condition, usually requiring exotic matter. Recently, it has been found that the traversable wormhole can be realized by non-exotic matter in Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theories in flat space. This paper generalizes discussions to the AdS spacetime and finds traversable wormholes with spherical and planar topologies. Furthermore, based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the entanglement entropy of strips and disks on two AdS boundaries of the wormhole. We find that entanglement entropy undergoes a phase transition as the subsystem size increases.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave probes of particle dark matter: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various theories of dark matter predict distinctive astrophysical signatures in gravitational-wave sources that could be observed by ground- and space-based laser interferometers. Different candidates-including axions, dark photons, macroscopic dark matter, WIMPs, and dark-matter spikes-may appear in interferometer data via their coupling to gravity or the Standard Model, altering the measured gravitational-wave strain in distinct ways. Despite their differences, these candidates share two key features: (1) they can be probed through their effects on gravitational waves from inspiraling compact objects, isolated black holes, and neutron stars, or via direct interactions with detectors, and (2) their signatures likely persist far longer than the seconds-long mergers detected today, necessitating new data analysis methods beyond matched filtering. This review outlines these dark matter candidates, their observational signatures, and approaches for their detection.</description>
