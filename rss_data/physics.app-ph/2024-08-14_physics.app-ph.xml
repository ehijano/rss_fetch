      <title>Vibrational Squeezing via Spin Inversion Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM) describes a range of approaches to detect nuclear spins with mechanical sensors. MRFM has the potential to enable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with near-atomic spatial resolution, opening up exciting possibilities in solid state and biological research. In many cases, the spin-mechanics coupling in MRFM is engineered with the help of periodic radio-frequency pulses. In this paper, we report that such pulses can result in unwanted parametric amplification of the mechanical vibrations, causing misinterpretation of the measured signal. We show how the parametric effect can be cancelled by auxiliary radio-frequency pulses or by appropriate post-correction after careful calibration. Future MRFM measurements may even make use of the parametric amplification to reduce the impact of amplifier noise</description>

      <title>Dispersive gains enhance wireless power transfer with asymmetric resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity-time symmetry is a fundamental concept in non-Hermitian physics that has recently gained attention for its potential in engineering advanced electronic systems and achieving robust wireless power transfer even in the presence of disturbances, through the incorporation of nonlinearity. However, the current parity-time-symmetric scheme falls short of achieving the theoretical maximum efficiency of wireless power transfer and faces challenges when applied to non-resistive loads. In this study, we propose a theoretical framework and provide experimental evidence demonstrating that asymmetric resonance, based on dispersive gain, can greatly enhance the efficiency of wireless power transfer beyond the limits of symmetric approaches. By leveraging the gain spectrum interleaving resulting from dispersion, we observe a mode switching phenomenon in asymmetric systems similar to the symmetry-breaking effect. This phenomenon reshapes the distribution of resonance energy and enables more efficient wireless power transfer compared to conventional methods. Our findings open up new possibilities for harnessing dispersion effects in various domains such as electronics, microwaves, and optics. This work represents a significant step towards exploiting dispersion as a means to optimize wireless power transfer and lays the foundation for future advancements in these fields.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the viability of CubeSats as an attractive platform for lightweight instrumentation by describing a proof of concept CubeSat that houses an astrophotonic chip for transit spectroscopy-based exoplanet atmosphere gas sensing. The Twin Earth SEnsoR Astrophotonic CubesaT (TESERACT) was designed to house a correlation spectroscopy chip along with an electrical and optical system for operation. We investigate design challenges and considerations in incorporating astrophotonic instrumentation such as component integration, thermal management and optical alignment. This work aims to be a pathfinder for demonstrating that astrophotonic-based CubeSat missions can perform leading edge, targeted science in lower-cost CubeSat platforms.</description>

      <title>Integrated astrophotonic phase control for high resolution optical interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long baseline optical interferometry and aperture synthesis using ground-based telescopes can enable unprecedented angular resolution astronomy in the optical domain. However, atmospheric turbulence leads to large, dynamic phase errors between participating apertures that limit fringe visibility using telescopes arrays or subaperture configurations in a single large telescope. Diffraction limited optics or adaptive optics can be used to ensure coherence at each aperture, but correlating the phase between apertures requires high speed, high stroke phase correction and recombination that is extremely challenging and costly. As a solution, we show an alternative phase correction and beam combination method using a centimeter-scale silicon astrophotonic chip optimized for H-band operation. The 4.7x10mm silicon photonic chip is fabricated using electron beam lithography with devices with 2 up to 32 independent channels. Light is coupled into the chip using single mode fiber ribbons. An array of microheaters is used to individually tune the effective index of each spiral delay waveguides. Narrowband spectral splitters at each spatial channel divert a modulated digital reference signal from an artificial guide star off-chip for phase measurement. Science light from other wavelengths is coherently combined using on-chip beam combiners and outputted to a single waveguide. We described the role, design, fabrication and characterization of the photonic chip. This photonic phase control scheme can be applied in astronomical interferometry or optical satellite communications.</description>

      <title>Influence of Point Defects on Laser-Induced Excitation in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the influence of defect states on the laser excitation process in silicon using time-dependent density functional theory. We assumed two types of point defects: interstitial oxygen and silicon vacancies. We found that the photoabsorption efficiency increased with defect density in both cases owing to the color center. These defects distorted the crystal structure, thereby relaxing the selection rules and changing the indirect gap to direct. At low laser intensities, the defect states dominated the absorption process. However, as the laser intensity increased, the excitation efficiency approached that of crystalline silicon. In addition, we observed that the excitation efficiency did not scale linearly with the pulse length. Notably, in the case of Si vacancies, saturable absorption significantly reduced photoabsorption. Our results suggest that the existence of a defect and its density could be detected by even-order high-harmonics generation.</description>

      <title>Si-waveguide-based optical power monitoring of 2$\times$2 Mach$\unicode{x2013}$Zehnder interferometer based on InGaAsP/Si hybrid MOS optical phase shifter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transparent in-line optical power monitoring in Si programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) is indispensable for calibrating integrated optical devices such as optical switches and resonators. A Si waveguide (WG) photodetector (PD) based on defect-mediated photodetection is a promising candidate for a transparent in-line optical power monitor owing to its simplicity and ease of integration with a fully complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible process. Here, we propose a simple optical power monitoring scheme for a 2$\times$2 Mach$\unicode{x2013}$Zehnder interferometer (MZI) optical switch based on InGaAsP/Si hybrid MOS optical phase shifters. In the proposed scheme, a low-doped p-type Si WG PD with a response time of microseconds is utilized as a transparent in-line optical power monitor and the ground terminal of the MOS optical phase shifter is shared with that of the Si WG PD to enable the simple monitoring of the output optical power of the MZI. Based on this scheme, we experimentally demonstrate that the output optical power of a 2$\times$2 MZI can be simply monitored by applying a bias voltage to the Si slabs formed at the output WGs of the MZI without excess optical insertion loss.</description>

Abstract: We show the first demonstration of a hybrid external cavity diode laser (ECDL) using aluminum nitride (AlN) as the wave-guiding material. Two devices are presented, a near-infrared (NIR) laser using a 850 nm diode and a red laser using a 650 nm diode. The NIR laser has $\approx$1 mW on chip power, 6 nm of spectral coverage, instantaneous linewidth of 720$\pm$80 kHz, and 12 dB side mode suppression ratio (SMSR).

      <title>AlN/Si interface engineering to mitigate RF losses in MOCVD grown GaN-on-Si substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fabrication of low-RF loss GaN-on-Si HEMT stacks is critical to enable competitive front-end-modules for 5G and 6G applications. The main contribution to RF losses is the interface between the III-N layer and the HR Si wafer, more specifically the AlN/Si interface. At this interface, a parasitic surface conduction layer exists in Si, which decreases the substrate effective resistivity sensed by overlying circuitry below the nominal Si resistivity. However, a clear understanding of this interface with control of the parasitic channel is lacking. In this letter, a detailed physical and electrical description of MOCVD-grown AlN/Si structures is presented. The presence of a $\text{SiC}_\text{x}\text{N}_\text{y}$ interfacial layer is revealed and its importance for RF losses is shown. Through C-V and I-V characterisation, an increase in the C concentration of this interfacial layer is linked to the formation of negative charge at the AlN/Si interface, which counteracts the positive charge present in the 0-predose limit. The variation of TMAl predose is shown to allow precise tuning of the C composition and, consequently, the resulting interface charge. Notably, a linear relationship between predose and net interface charge is observed and confirmed by the fabrication of an AlN/Si sample with close to zero net charge. In addition, a higher $D_{it}$ ($\sim 2\times 10^{12}$ cm$^\text{-2}$) for such compensated samples is observed and can contribute to low RF loss. An exceptionally high effective resistivity of above 8 k$\Omega\cdot$cm is achieved, corresponding to an RF loss below 0.3 dB/mm at 10 GHz.</description>

      <title>Algorithm-Based Linearly Graded Compositions of GeSn on GaAs (001) via Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06695v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of high-composition GeSn films of the future will likely be guided via algorithms. In this study we show how a logarithmic-based algorithm can be used to obtain high-quality GeSn compositions up to 16 % on GaAs (001) substrates via molecular beam epitaxy. Within we demonstrate composition targeting and logarithmic gradients to achieve linearly graded pseudomorph Ge1-xSnx compositions up to 10 % before partial relaxation of the structure and a continued gradient up to 16 % GeSn. In this report, we use X-ray diffraction, simulation, SIMS and atomic force microscopy to analyze and demonstrate some of the possible growths that can be produced with the enclosed algorithm. This methodology of growth is a major step forward in the field of GeSn development and the first demonstration of algorithmically driven, linearly graded GeSn films.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of unsteady premixed flames in meso scale channels and the effects of varying the wall heating conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of flames at small scales opens up opportunities to enhance the performance of small-scale power generation devices, micro-reactors, fire safety devices, and numerous other systems that confine combustion to micro/meso scales. The current study delves into the dynamics of laminar premixed methane-air flames in mesoscale channels, subject to different wall heating conditions. Two external heaters, positioned at adjustable distances, are employed to create a bimodal wall heating profile on the combustor walls. The separation distance (d) between the heaters was varied, and the resulting flame dynamics were examined across a wide range of equivalence ratios and Reynolds numbers (Re). The observed dynamics were also compared against a baseline configuration that utilises a single heater to establish an axial unimodal wall temperature profile. Apart from the previously documented observations of unsteady flames with repetitive extinction and ignition (FREI) characteristics, this study identifies an additional unsteady propagating flame (PF) regime. While FREI appeared at stoichiometric and fuel-rich conditions, propagating flames were observed at the equivalence ratio of 0.8. Unlike the FREI regime where the flame extinguishes after a characteristic travel distance, propagating flames continue to travel till they reach the upstream end of the combustor tube, where they extinguish upon encountering a meshed constriction. These flames are associated with a characteristic heat-release-rate oscillation that couples with the pressure fluctuations at frequencies close to the natural harmonic of the combustor tube. These dynamics are discussed in detail with appropriate theoretical arguments to justify the observed trends.</description>
