      <title>The Structure and Kinetic Ion Behavior of Low Mach Number Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Mach number collisionless shocks are routinely observed in the solar wind and upstream of planetary bodies. However, most in situ observations have lacked the necessary temporal resolution to directly study the kinetic behavior of ions across these shocks. We investigate a series of five low Mach number bow shock crossings observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. The five shocks had comparable Mach numbers, but varying shock-normal angles ($66^{\circ} \lesssim \theta_{Bn} \lesssim 89^{\circ}$) and ramp widths ($5~\mathrm{km} \lesssim l \lesssim 100~\mathrm{km}$). The shock width is shown to be crucial in determining the fraction of protons reflected and energized by the shock, with proton reflection increasing with decreasing shock width. As the shock width increases proton reflection is arrested entirely. For nearly perpendicular shocks, reflected protons exhibit quasi-periodic structures, which persist far downstream of the shock. As the shock-normal angle becomes more oblique these periodic proton structures broaden to form an energetic halo population. Periodic fluctuations in the magnetic field downstream of the shocks are generated by fluctuations in dynamic pressure of alpha particles, which are decelerated by the cross-shock potential and subsequently undergo gyrophase bunching. These results demonstrate that complex kinetic-scale ion dynamics occur in low Mach number shocks, which depend significantly on the shock profile.</description>

      <title>Variation of Whistler-Mode Wave Characteristics Along Magnetic Field Lines: Comparison of Near-Equatorial THEMIS and Middle-Latitude ERG Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latitudinal distribution of whistler-mode wave intensity plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency and energy of electrons scattered by these waves in the outer radiation belt. Traditionally, this wave property has mostly been derived from statistical measurements of off-equatorial spacecraft, which collect intensity data at various latitudes under different geomagnetic conditions and at different times. In this study we examine a set of events captured by both the near-equatorial THEMIS spacecraft and the off-equatorial ERG spacecraft. Specifically, we compare the whistler-mode wave intensity from THEMIS and ERG measurements at the same MLT and time sectors. Similar wave spectrum characteristics confirm that THEMIS and ERG indeed observed the same wave activity. However, upon closer examination of the wave intensity variations, we identify two distinct categories of events: those that follow the statistically predicted variations in wave intensity along magnetic latitudes, and those that exhibit rapid wave intensity decay away from the equatorial plane. We analyze main characteristics of events from both categories and discuss possible implications of our analysis for radiation belt models.</description>

      <title>Applications of Atomic Data to Studies of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun is a standard reference object for Astrophysics and also a fascinating subject of study in its own right. X-ray and extreme ultraviolet movies of the Sun's atmosphere show an extraordinary diversity of plasma phenomena, from barely visible bursts and jets to coronal mass ejections that impact a large portion of the solar surface. The processes that produce these phenomena, heat the corona and power the solar wind remain actively studied and accurate atomic data are essential for interpreting observations and making model predictions. For the Sun's interior intense effort is focused on resolving the "solar problem," (a discrepancy between solar interior models and helioseismology measurements) and atomic data are central to both element abundance measurements and interior physics such as opacity and nuclear reaction rates. In this article, topics within solar interior and solar atmosphere physics are discussed and the role of atomic data described. Areas of active research are highlighted and specific atomic data needs are identified.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of temperature anisotropy instabilities stimulated by suprathermal protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new in situ measurements of the Solar Orbiter mission contribute to the knowledge of the suprathermal populations in the solar wind, especially of ions and protons whose characterization, although still in the early phase, seems to suggest a major involvement in the interaction with plasma wave fluctuations. Recent studies point to the stimulating effect of suprathermal populations on temperature anisotropy instabilities in the case of electrons already being demonstrated in theory and numerical simulations. Here, we investigate anisotropic protons, addressing the electromagnetic ion-cyclotron (EMIC) and the proton firehose (PFH) instabilities. Suprathermal populations enhance the high-energy tails of the Kappa velocity (or energy) distributions measured in situ, enabling characterization by contrasting to the quasi-thermal population in the low-energy (bi-)Maxwellian core. We use hybrid simulations to investigate the two instabilities (with ions or protons as particles and electrons as fluid) for various configurations relevant to the solar wind and terrestrial magnetosphere. The new simulation results confirm the linear theory and its predictions. In the presence of suprathermal protons, the wave fluctuations reach increased energy density levels for both instabilities and cause faster and/or deeper relaxation of temperature anisotropy. The magnitude of suprathermal effects also depends on each instability's specific (initial) parametric regimes. These results further strengthen the belief that wave-particle interactions govern space plasmas. These provide valuable clues for understanding their dynamics, particularly the involvement of suprathermal particles behind the quasi-stationary non-equilibrium states reported by in situ observations.</description>

      <title>Classifying different types of solar wind plasma with uncertainty estimations using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decades of in-situ solar wind measurements have clearly established the variation of solar wind physical parameters. These variable parameters have been used to classify the solar wind magnetized plasma into different types leading to several classification schemes being developed. These classification schemes, while useful for understanding the solar wind originating processes at the Sun and early detection of space weather events, have left open questions regarding which physical parameters are most useful for classification and how recent advances in our understanding of solar wind transients impact classification. In this work, we use neural networks trained with different solar wind magnetic and plasma characteristics to automatically classify the solar wind in coronal hole, streamer belt, sector reversal and solar transients such as coronal mass ejections comprised of both magnetic obstacles and sheaths. Furthermore, our work demonstrates how probabilistic neural networks can enhance the classification by including a measure of prediction uncertainty. Our work also provides a ranking of the parameters that lead to an improved classification scheme with ~96% accuracy. Our new scheme paves the way for incorporating uncertainty estimates into space weather forecasting with the potential to be implemented on real-time solar wind data.</description>

      <title>Electron-ion heating partition in imbalanced solar-wind turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13048v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A likely candidate mechanism to heat the solar corona and solar wind is low-frequency "Alfv\'enic" turbulence sourced by magnetic fluctuations near the solar surface. Depending on its properties, such turbulence can heat different species via different mechanisms, and the comparison of theoretical predictions to observed temperatures, wind speeds, anisotropies, and their variation with heliocentric radius provides a sensitive test of this physics. Here we explore the importance of normalized cross helicity, or imbalance, for controlling solar-wind heating, since it is a key parameter of magnetized turbulence and varies systematically with wind speed and radius. Based on a hybrid-kinetic simulation in which the forcing's imbalance decreases with time -- a crude model for a plasma parcel entrained in the outflowing wind -- we demonstrate how significant changes to the turbulence and heating result from the "helicity barrier" effect. Its dissolution at low imbalance causes its characteristic features -- strong perpendicular ion heating with a steep "transition-range" drop in electromagnetic fluctuation spectra -- to disappear, driving more energy into electrons and parallel ion heat, and halting the emission of ion-scale waves. These predictions seem to agree with a diverse array of solar-wind observations, offering to explain a variety of complex correlations and features within a single theoretical framework.</description>
