      <title>Low-Thrust Trajectory Optimization for Cubesat Lunar Mission: HORYU-VI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a low-thrust trajectory optimization strategy to achieve a near-circular lunar orbit for a CubeSat injected into a lunar flyby trajectory. The 12U CubeSat HORYU-VI is equipped with four Hall-effect thrusters and designed as a secondary payload on NASA's Space Launch System under the Artemis program. Upon release, the spacecraft gains sufficient energy to escape the Earth-Moon system after a lunar flyby. The proposed trajectory is decomposed into three phases: (1) pre-flyby deceleration to avoid heliocentric escape, (2) lunar gravitational capture, and (3) orbit circularization to the science orbit. For each phase, an impulsive-burn solution is first computed as an initial guess, which is then refined through finite-burn optimization using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). The dynamical model incorporates Earth-Moon-Sun-Jupiter gravitational interactions and a high-fidelity lunar gravity field. All trajectories are independently verified with NASA's General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT). Results demonstrate that HORYU-VI achieves lunar capture within 200 days, establishes a stable science orbit at 280 days, and can spiral down to a near-circular 100 km orbit by 450 days, using a total Delta-V of 710 m/s, well within the capability of the electric propulsion system.</description>

      <title>Beyond Average-Channel-Based Rate Approximations: UAV Trajectory and Scheduling Optimization With Expected Rate Consideration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the joint optimization of trajectory, user scheduling, and time-slot duration in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless communication systems under minimum expected spectral efficiency (SE) constraints. Unlike most existing studies that approximate the expected SE by substituting the random channel gain with its mean value, thereby evaluating the SE at the average channel realization and overestimating the true expected SE due to Jensen's inequality, we approximate the expected SE by numerically integrating the SE over the channel distributions. Specifically, instead of relying on average-channel-based approximations, we develop a conservative yet tractable quadrature-based approximation by discretizing the associated cumulative distribution functions. The resulting finite-sum representation explicitly accounts for the probabilistic LoS structure and channel fading effects, while remaining tractable for optimization. Leveraging this lower bound, we formulate a mission completion time minimization problem subject to minimum expected-SE requirements for all ground nodes. The resulting problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization, which is tackled via a penalty-based block coordinate descent framework. The proposed algorithm alternately optimizes the scheduling decisions and the UAV trajectory along with adaptive time-slot durations, and maintains feasibility with respect to the original expected-SE constraints by leveraging successive convex approximation and quadratic transform techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method strictly satisfies the minimum expected-SE constraints and achieves a significantly shorter mission completion time than conventional average-channel-based approaches, which are shown to yield infeasible or overly conservative solutions.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Internal Energy Regulation and Inertial Response Provision for Grid-Forming Multilevel-Converter-Based E-STATCOMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As power systems accommodate higher shares of renewable generation, short-term power imbalances become more frequent and can manifest as pronounced voltage and frequency excursions under low-inertia conditions. E-STATCOMs (STATCOMs equipped with energy storage) offer a practical means to provide both voltage support and fast frequency assistance under grid-forming control. Among candidate implementations, double-star multilevel-converter (DS-MC)-based E-STATCOMs enable centralized energy-storage integration at the dc link, which improves thermal management and maintainability. Nevertheless, conventional dc-side power-based internal-energy regulation in DS-MCs can undesirably couple loss compensation to the energy-storage path, accelerating storage cycling and constraining operation when the storage is unavailable. This paper introduces a control strategy that assigns DS-MC total internal-energy regulation to the ac-side active-power path, while reserving dc-side storage power solely for frequency support. By decoupling internal-energy management from inertial-response provision, the proposed scheme enables flexible operation as either a STATCOM or an E-STATCOM according to storage availability and mitigates unnecessary storage cycling. The proposed strategy is verified through offline simulations and laboratory-scale experiments.</description>

      <title>Validation of KESTREL EMT for Industrial Capacitor Switching Transient Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation is essential for analyzing sub-cycle switching phenomena in industrial power systems; however, commercial EMT platforms present significant cost barriers for smaller utilities, consultancies, and academic institutions, particularly in developing regions. This paper validates KESTREL EMT, a free and open-source electromagnetic transient solver with Python integration, through three progressive case studies involving industrial capacitor switching transients. This work investigates energization, switching resonance and VFD interactions with capacitor banks. The results demonstrate that KESTREL, when supported by appropriate circuit modeling techniques, produces EMT responses consistent with analytical predictions and established IEEE benchmarks. This work establishes a validated and reproducible methodology for conducting industrial EMT studies using freely available, open-source tools.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Scheduling of Electrified Heating Under Heat Demand Forecast Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrified heating systems with thermal storage, such as electric boilers and heat pumps, represent a major source of demand-side flexibility. Under current electricity market designs, balance responsible parties (BRPs) operating such assets are required to submit binding day-ahead electricity consumption schedules, and they typically do it based on forecasts of heat demand and electricity prices. Common scheduling approaches implicitly assume that forecast uncertainty can be well characterized using historical forecast errors. In practice, however, the cumulative effect of uncertainty creates significant exposure to imbalance-price risk when the committed schedule cannot be followed. To address this, we propose a distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization framework for the day-ahead scheduling of a multi-MW electric boiler using only limited residual forecast samples. We derive a tractable convex reformulation of the problem and calibrate the ambiguity set directly from historical forecast-error data through an a priori tunable risk parameter. Numerical results show that enforcing performance guarantees on the heat-demand balance constraint reduces demand violations by 40% compared to a deterministic forecast-based scheduler and up to 10% relative to a nominal chance-constrained model with a fixed error distribution. Further, we show that modeling the real-time rebound cost of demand violations as a second-stage term can reduce the overall daily operating cost by up to 34% by hedging against highly volatile day-ahead electricity prices.</description>

      <title>On the Value of Base Station Motion Knowledge for Goal-Oriented Remote Monitoring with Energy-Harvesting Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates goal-oriented remote monitoring of an unobservable Markov source using energy-harvesting sensors that communicate with a mobile receiver, such as a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Unlike conventional systems that assume stationary base stations, the proposed framework explicitly accounts for receiver mobility, which induces time-varying channel characteristics modeled as a finite-state Markov process. The remote monitoring problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is transformed into a tractable belief-state MDP and solved using relative value iteration to obtain optimal sampling and transmission policies. Two estimation strategies are considered: Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Minimum Mean Distortion (MMD). Numerical results demonstrate that incorporating receiver mobility and channel state information into the optimization reduces the average distortion by 10% to 42% compared to baseline policies and constant-channel assumptions, highlighting the importance of base station motion knowledge for effective goal-oriented communication.</description>

      <title>Learning-based augmentation of first-principle models: A linear fractional representation-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear system identificationhas proven to be effective in obtaining accurate models from data for complex real-world systems. In particular, recent encoder-based methods with artificial neural network state-space (ANN-SS) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, using computationally efficient methods and offering consistent model estimation in the presence of noisy data. However, inclusion of prior knowledge of the system can be further exploited to increase (i) estimation speed, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) interpretability of the resulting models. This paper proposes a model augmentation method that incorporates prior knowledge from first-principles (FP) models in a flexible manner. We introduce a novel linear-fractional-representation (LFR) model structure that allows for the general representation of various augmentation structures including the ones that are commonly used in the literature, and an encoder-based identification algorithm for estimating the proposed structures together with appropriate initialisation methods. The performance and generalisation capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated on the identification of a hardening mass-spring-damper system in a simulation study and on the data-driven modelling of the dynamics of an F1Tenth electric car using measured data.</description>

      <title>Herd Behavior in Decentralized Balancing Models: A Case Study in Belgium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a decentralized balancing model, Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) are encouraged by the Transmission System Operator (TSO) to deviate from their schedule to help the system restore balance, also referred to as implicit balancing. This could reduce balancing costs for the grid operator and lower the entry barrier for flexible assets compared to explicit balancing services. However, these implicit reactions may overshoot when their total capacity is high, potentially requiring more explicit activations. This study analyses the effect of increased participation in the decentralized balancing model in Belgium. To this end, we develop a market simulator that produces price signals on minute-level and simulate the implicit reactions for battery assets with different risk profiles. Besides the current price formula, we also study two potential candidates for the near-term presented by the TSO. A simulation study is conducted using Belgian market data for the year 2023. The findings indicate that, while having a significant positive effect on the balancing costs at first, the risk of overshoots can outweigh the potential benefits when the total capacity of the implicit reactions becomes too large. Furthermore, even when the balancing costs start to increase for the TSO, BRPs were still found to benefit from implicit balancing.</description>

      <title>Robust Model Predictive Control for Linear Systems with Interval Matrix Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for linear discrete-time systems affected by model uncertainty described by interval matrices.
  The key feature of the proposed method is a bound on the uncertainty propagation along the prediction horizon which exploits a set-theoretic over-approximation of each term of the uncertain system impulse response.
  Such an approximation is based on matrix zonotopes and leverages the interval matrix structure of the uncertainty model.
  Its main advantage is that all the relevant bounds are computed offline, thus making the online computational load independent of the number of uncertain parameters.
  A variable-horizon MPC formulation is adopted to guarantee recursive feasibility and to ensure robust asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system.
  Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to match the feasibility regions of the most effective state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing the computational burden, thereby enabling the treatment of nontrivial dimensional systems with multiple uncertain parameters.</description>

      <title>Bluetooth Phased-array Aided Inertial Navigation Using Factor Graphs: Experimental Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phased-array Bluetooth systems have emerged as a low-cost alternative for performing aided inertial navigation in GNSS-denied use cases such as warehouse logistics, drone landings, and autonomous docking. Basing a navigation system off of commercial-off-the-shelf components may reduce the barrier of entry for phased-array radio navigation systems, albeit at the cost of significantly noisier measurements and relatively short feasible range. In this paper, we compare robust estimation strategies for a factor graph optimisation-based estimator using experimental data collected from multirotor drone flight. We evaluate performance in loss-of-GNSS scenarios when aided by Bluetooth angular measurements, as well as range or barometric pressure.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Temporal Logic Planning via Penalty Functions and Block-Coordinate Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent planning under Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is often hindered by collaborative tasks that lead to computational challenges due to the inherent high-dimensionality of the problem, preventing scalable synthesis with satisfaction guarantees. To address this, we formulate STL planning as an optimization program under arbitrary multi-agent constraints and introduce a penalty-based unconstrained relaxation that can be efficiently solved via a Block-Coordinate Gradient Descent (BCGD) method, where each block corresponds to a single agent's decision variables, thereby mitigating complexity. By utilizing a quadratic penalty function defined via smooth STL semantics, we show that BCGD iterations converge to a stationary point of the penalized problem under standard regularity assumptions. To enforce feasibility, the BCGD solver is embedded within a two-layer optimization scheme: inner BCGD updates are performed for a fixed penalty parameter, which is then increased in an outer loop to progressively improve multi-agent STL robustness. The proposed framework enables scalable computations and is validated through various complex multi-robot planning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Robust Adaptive Sliding-Mode Control for Damaged Fixed-Wing UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can remain aerodynamically flyable after sustaining structural or control surface damage, yet insufficient robustness in conventional autopilots often leads to mission failure. This paper proposes a robust adaptive sliding mode controller (RASMC) for fixed-wing UAVs subject to aerodynamic coefficient perturbations and partial loss of control surface effectiveness. A damage-aware flight dynamics model is developed to systematically analyze the impact of such impairments on the closed-loop behavior. The RASMC is designed to ensure reliable tracking and stabilization, while a gain adaptation law maintains low control effort under nominal conditions and increases the gains as needed in the presence of aerodynamic damage. Lyapunov-based stability guarantees are derived, and assumptions on admissible uncertainty bounds are formulated to characterize the limits within which closed-loop stability and performance can be ensured. The proposed controller is implemented within an existing UAV autopilot framework, where outer-loop guidance and speed control modules provide reference commands to the RASMC for attitude stabilization. Simulations demonstrate that, despite significant aerodynamic damage and control surface degradation, all closed-loop states remain stable with bounded tracking errors.</description>

      <title>Dodging the Moose: Experimental Insights in Real-Life Automated Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sudden appearance of a static obstacle on the road, i.e. the moose test, is a well-known emergency scenario in collision avoidance for automated driving. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has long been employed for planning and control of automated vehicles in the state of the art. However, real-time implementation of automated collision avoidance in emergency scenarios such as the moose test remains unaddressed due to the high computational demand of MPC for evasive action in such hazardous scenarios. This paper offers new insights into real-time collision avoidance via the experimental imple- mentation of MPC for motion planning after a sudden and unexpected appearance of a static obstacle. As the state-of-the-art nonlinear MPC shows limited capability to provide an acceptable solution in real-time, we propose a human-like feed-forward planner to assist when the MPC optimization problem is either infeasible or unable to find a suitable solution due to the poor quality of its initial guess. We introduce the concept of maximum steering maneuver to design the feed-forward planner and mimic a human-like reaction after detecting the static obstacle on the road. Real-life experiments are conducted across various speeds and level of emergency using FPEV2-Kanon electric vehicle. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our planning strategy via comparison with the state-of- the-art MPC motion planner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method to assess the pointing and image motion performance of optical payloads in the presence of image displacement (shift), smear, and jitter. The method assumes the motion is a stationary random process over an image exposure interval. Displacement, smear, and jitter covariances are computed from the solution to a Lyapunov differential equation. These covariances parameterize statistical image motion modulation transfer functions (MTFs), and they can be used to verify pointing and image motion MTF requirements. The method in the present paper extends a previous method to include smear, as well as displacement, and hence jitter. The approach in the present paper also leads, as a special case, to a more efficient method to compute the displacement covariance than the previous method. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented (Knowledge Graph), and Large Language Model-Driven Design Structure Matrix (DSM) Generation of Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) for generating Design Structure Matrices (DSMs). We test these methods on two distinct use cases -- a power screwdriver and a CubeSat with known architectural references -- evaluating their performance on two key tasks: determining relationships between predefined components, and the more complex challenge of identifying components and their subsequent relationships. We measure the performance by assessing each element of the DSM and overall architecture. Despite design and computational challenges, we identify opportunities for automated DSM generation, with all code publicly available for reproducibility and further feedback from the domain experts.</description>

      <title>A Few-Shot LLM Framework for Extreme Day Classification in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a few-shot classification framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict whether the next day will have spikes in real-time electricity prices. The approach aggregates system state information, including electricity demand, renewable generation, weather forecasts, and recent electricity prices, into a set of statistical features that are formatted as natural-language prompts and fed to an LLM along with general instructions. The model then determines the likelihood that the next day would be a spike day and reports a confidence score. Using historical data from the Texas electricity market, we demonstrate that this few-shot approach achieves performance comparable to supervised machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines and XGBoost, and outperforms the latter two when limited historical data are available. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as a data-efficient tool for classifying electricity price spikes in settings with scarce data.</description>

      <title>Smooth trajectory generation and hybrid B-splines-Quaternions based tool path interpolation for a 3T1R parallel kinematic milling robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a smooth trajectory generation method for a four-degree-of-freedom parallel kinematic milling robot. The proposed approach integrates B-spline and Quaternion interpolation techniques to manage decoupled position and orientation data points. The synchronization of orientation and arc-length-parameterized position data is achieved through the fitting of smooth piece-wise Bezier curves, which describe the non-linear relationship between path length and tool orientation, solved via sequential quadratic programming. By leveraging the convex hull properties of Bezier curves, the method ensures spatial and temporal separation constraints for multi-agent trajectory generation. Unit quaternions are employed for orientation interpolation, providing a robust and efficient representation that avoids gimbal lock and facilitates smooth, continuous rotation. Modifier polynomials are used for position interpolation. Temporal trajectories are optimized using minimum jerk, time-optimal piece-wise Bezier curves in two stages: task space followed by joint space, implemented on a low-cost microcontroller. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method offers enhanced accuracy, reduced velocity fluctuations, and computational efficiency compared to conventional interpolation methods.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Argument of Latitude Error Model for LEO Satellite Orbit and Covariance Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are leveraged to support new position, navigation, and timing (PNT) service alternatives to GNSS. These alternatives require accurate propagation of satellite position and velocity with a realistic quantification of uncertainty. It is commonly assumed that the propagated uncertainty distribution is Gaussian; however, the validity of this assumption can be quickly compromised by the mismodeling of atmospheric drag. We develop a machine learning approach that corrects error growth in the argument of latitude for a diverse set of LEO satellites. The improved orbit propagation accuracy extends the applicability of the Gaussian assumption and modeling of the errors with a corrected mean and covariance. We compare the performance of a time-conditioned neural network and a Gaussian Process on datasets computed with an open source orbit propagator and publicly available Vector Covariance Message (VCM) ephemerides. The learned models predict the argument of latitude error as a Gaussian distribution given parameters from a single VCM epoch and reverse propagation errors. We show that this one-dimensional model captures the effect of mismodeled drag, which can be mapped to the Cartesian state space. The correction method only updates information along the dimensions of dominant error growth, while maintaining the physics-based propagation of VCM covariance in the remaining dimensions. We therefore extend the utility of VCM ephemerides to longer time horizons without modifying the functionality of the existing propagator.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal dual-stage hypergraph MARL for human-centric multimodal corridor traffic signal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-centric traffic signal control in corridor networks must increasingly account for multimodal travelers, particularly high-occupancy public transportation, rather than focusing solely on vehicle-centric performance. This paper proposes STDSH-MARL (Spatio-Temporal Dual-Stage Hypergraph based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning), a scalable multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that follows a centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. The proposed method captures spatio-temporal dependencies through a novel dual-stage hypergraph attention mechanism that models interactions across both spatial and temporal hyperedges. In addition, a hybrid discrete action space is introduced to jointly determine the next signal phase configuration and its corresponding green duration, enabling more adaptive signal timing decisions. Experiments conducted on a corridor network under five traffic scenarios demonstrate that STDSH-MARL consistently improves multimodal performance and provides clear benefits for public transportation priority. Compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance. Further ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component of STDSH-MARL, with temporal hyperedges identified as the most influential factor driving the observed performance gains.</description>

      <title>Geometric Inverse Flight Dynamics on SO(3) and Application to Tethered Fixed-Wing Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a robotics-oriented, coordinate-free formulation of inverse flight dynamics for fixed-wing aircraft on SO(3). Translational force balance is written in the world frame and rotational dynamics in the body frame; aerodynamic directions (drag, lift, side) are defined geometrically, avoiding local attitude coordinates. Enforcing coordinated flight (no sideslip), we derive a closed-form trajectory-to-input map yielding the attitude, angular velocity, and thrust-angle-of-attack pair, and we recover the aerodynamic moment coefficients component-wise. Applying such a map to tethered flight on spherical parallels, we obtain analytic expressions for the required bank angle and identify a specific zero-bank locus where the tether tension exactly balances centrifugal effects, highlighting the decoupling between aerodynamic coordination and the apparent gravity vector. Under a simple lift/drag law, the minimal-thrust angle of attack admits a closed form. These pointwise quasi-steady inversion solutions become steady-flight trim when the trajectory and rotational dynamics are time-invariant. The framework bridges inverse simulation in aeronautics with geometric modeling in robotics, providing a rigorous building block for trajectory design and feasibility checks.</description>

      <title>Continual uncertainty learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust control of mechanical systems with multiple uncertainties remains a fundamental challenge, particularly when nonlinear dynamics and operating-condition variations are intricately intertwined. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains. We verified that the resulting controller is robust against structural nonlinearities and dynamic variations, realizing successful sim-to-real transfer.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Predictive Control of the Continuum and Hybrid Dynamics of a Suspended Deformable Cable for Aerial Pick and Place</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for aerial manipulation of an extensible cable that combines a high-fidelity model based on partial differential equations (PDEs) with a reduced-order representation suitable for real-time control. The PDEs are discretised using a finite-difference method, and proper orthogonal decomposition is employed to extract a reduced-order model (ROM) that retains the dominant deformation modes while significantly reducing computational complexity. Based on this ROM, a nonlinear model predictive control scheme is formulated, capable of stabilizing cable oscillations and handling hybrid transitions such as payload attachment and detachment. Simulation results confirm the stability, efficiency, and robustness of the ROM, as well as the effectiveness of the controller in regulating cable dynamics under a range of operating conditions. Additional simulations illustrate the application of the ROM for trajectory planning in constrained environments, demonstrating the versatility of the proposed approach. Overall, the framework enables real-time, dynamics-aware control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) carrying suspended flexible cables.</description>

      <title>A Multi-modal Detection System for Infrastructure-based Freight Signal Priority</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Freight vehicles approaching signalized intersections require reliable detection and motion estimation to support infrastructure-based Freight Signal Priority (FSP). Accurate and timely perception of vehicle type, position, and speed is essential for enabling effective priority control strategies. This paper presents the design, deployment, and evaluation of an infrastructure-based multi-modal freight vehicle detection system integrating LiDAR and camera sensors. A hybrid sensing architecture is adopted, consisting of an intersection-mounted subsystem and a midblock subsystem, connected via wireless communication for synchronized data transmission. The perception pipeline incorporates both clustering-based and deep learning-based detection methods with Kalman filter tracking to achieve stable real-time performance. LiDAR measurements are registered into geodetic reference frames to support lane-level localization and consistent vehicle tracking. Field evaluations demonstrate that the system can reliably monitor freight vehicle movements at high spatio-temporal resolution. The design and deployment provide practical insights for developing infrastructure-based sensing systems to support FSP applications.</description>

      <title>Visual Insights into Agentic Optimization of Pervasive Stream Processing Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processing sensory data close to the data source, often involving Edge devices, promises low latency for pervasive applications, like smart cities. This commonly involves a multitude of processing services, executed with limited resources; this setup faces three problems: first, the application demand and the resource availability fluctuate, so the service execution must scale dynamically to sustain processing requirements (e.g., latency); second, each service permits different actions to adjust its operation, so they require individual scaling policies; third, without a higher-level mediator, services would cannibalize any resources of services co-located on the same device. This demo first presents a platform for context-aware autoscaling of stream processing services that allows developers to monitor and adjust the service execution across multiple service-specific parameters. We then connect a scaling agent to these interfaces that gradually builds an understanding of the processing environment by exploring each service's action space; the agent then optimizes the service execution according to this knowledge. Participants can revisit the demo contents as video summary and introductory poster, or build a custom agent by extending the artifact repository.</description>

      <title>LexiSafe: Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning with Lexicographic Safety-Reward Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly important for cyber-physical systems (CPS), where safety violations during training are unacceptable and only pre-collected data are available. Existing offline safe RL methods typically balance reward-safety tradeoffs through constraint relaxation or joint optimization, but they often lack structural mechanisms to prevent safety drift. We propose LexiSafe, a lexicographic offline RL framework designed to preserve safety-aligned behavior. We first develop LexiSafe-SC, a single-cost formulation for standard offline safe RL, and derive safety-violation and performance-suboptimality bounds that together yield sample-complexity guarantees. We then extend the framework to hierarchical safety requirements with LexiSafe-MC, which supports multiple safety costs and admits its own sample-complexity analysis. Empirically, LexiSafe demonstrates reduced safety violations and improved task performance compared to constrained offline baselines. By unifying lexicographic prioritization with structural bias, LexiSafe offers a practical and theoretically grounded approach for safety-critical CPS decision-making.</description>

      <title>Distributed Virtual Model Control for Scalable Human-Robot Collaboration in Shared Workspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a decentralized, agent agnostic, and safety-aware control framework for human-robot collaboration based on Virtual Model Control (VMC). In our approach, both humans and robots are embedded in the same virtual-component-shaped workspace, where motion is the result of the interaction with virtual springs and dampers rather than explicit trajectory planning. A decentralized, force-based stall detector identifies deadlocks, which are resolved through negotiation. This reduces the probability of robots getting stuck in the block placement task from up to 61.2% to zero in our experiments. The framework scales without structural changes thanks to the distributed implementation: in experiments we demonstrate safe collaboration with up to two robots and two humans, and in simulation up to four robots, maintaining inter-agent separation at around 20 cm. Results show that the method shapes robot behavior intuitively by adjusting control parameters and achieves deadlock-free operation across team sizes in all tested scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hybrid System Planning using a Mixed-Integer ADMM Heuristic and Hybrid Zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedded optimization-based planning for hybrid systems is challenging due to the use of mixed-integer programming, which is computationally intensive and often sensitive to the specific numerical formulation. To address that challenge, this article proposes a framework for motion planning of hybrid systems that pairs hybrid zonotopes - an advanced set representation - with a new alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) mixed-integer programming heuristic. A general treatment of piecewise affine (PWA) system reachability analysis using hybrid zonotopes is presented and extended to formulate optimal planning problems. Sets produced using the proposed identities have lower memory complexity and tighter convex relaxations than equivalent sets produced from preexisting techniques. The proposed ADMM heuristic makes efficient use of the hybrid zonotope structure. For planning problems formulated as hybrid zonotopes, the proposed heuristic achieves improved convergence rates as compared to state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming heuristics. The proposed methods for hybrid system planning on embedded hardware are experimentally applied in a combined behavior and motion planning scenario for autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Compression and Distillation of Data Quadruplets in Non-intrusive Reduced-order Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16683v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a quadrature-free, non-intrusive approach to balanced truncation for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. The method non-intrusively constructs reduced-order models using available transfer function samples from the right half of the $s$-plane. It is highlighted that the proposed data-driven balanced truncation and existing quadrature-based balanced truncation algorithms share a common feature: both compress their respective data quadruplets to derive reduced-order models. Additionally, it is demonstrated that by using different compression strategies, these quadruplets can be utilized to develop three non-intrusive formulations of the IRKA for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. These formulations non-intrusively generate reduced models using transfer function samples from the $j\omega$-axis or the right half of the $s$-plane, or impulse response samples. Notably, these IRKA formulations eliminate the necessity of computing new transfer function samples as IRKA iteratively updates the interpolation points. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is validated through numerical examples, which show that the proposed non-intrusive approaches perform comparably to their intrusive counterparts.</description>

      <title>Reach-avoid games for players with damped double integrator dynamics</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates a reach-avoid game between two players with damped double integrator dynamics. An optimal state-feedback strategy is derived using a differential game framework combined with geometric analysis. To facilitate the analysis, we introduce the concept of multiple reachable region by characterizing the motion of players with damped double integrator dynamics. Based on this, a new type of the attackers dominance region is introduced. We show that distinct strategies are required depending on the location of the terminal position within different areas of the attacker's dominance region. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed strategies satisfy the necessary condition for optimality. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the conclusions.</description>

      <title>Deception Against Data-Driven Linear-Quadratic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deception is a common defense mechanism against adversaries with an information disadvantage. It can force such adversaries to select suboptimal policies for a defender's benefit. We consider a setting where an adversary tries to learn the optimal linear-quadratic attack against a system, the dynamics of which it does not know. On the other end, a defender who knows its dynamics exploits its information advantage and injects a deceptive input into the system to mislead the adversary. The defender's aim is to then strategically design this deceptive input: it should force the adversary to learn, as closely as possible, a pre-selected attack that is different from the optimal one. We show that this deception design problem boils down to the solution of a coupled algebraic Riccati and a Lyapunov equation which, however, are challenging to tackle analytically. Nevertheless, we use a block successive over-relaxation algorithm to extract their solution numerically and prove the algorithm's convergence under certain conditions. We perform simulations on a benchmark aircraft, where we showcase how the proposed algorithm can mislead adversaries into learning attacks that are less performance-degrading.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Order Reduction of Dynamical Systems in Process Engineering: Review and Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computationally cheap yet accurate dynamical models are a key requirement for real-time capable nonlinear optimization and model-based control. When given a computationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a lower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we review nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a comparison of method characteristics. Additionally, we discuss both general-purpose methods and tailored approaches for chemical process systems and we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As machine learning manifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the construction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to dynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight established model order reduction methods to an air separation process model: POD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode decomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor, compartment modeling, and model aggregation. Herein, we do not investigate hyperreduction, i.e., reduction of floating point operations. Based on our findings, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the model order reduction methods.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Convexity of Neural Networks in Dynamic Operating Envelope Optimization for Distributed Energy Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) brings opportunities and challenges to the operation of distribution systems. To ensure network integrity, dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs) are issued by utilities to DERs as their time-varying export/import power limits. Due to the non-convex nature of power flow equations, the optimization of DOEs faces a dilemma of solution accuracy and computation efficiency. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we facilitate DOE optimization by exploiting the convexity of input convex neural networks (ICNNs). A DOE optimization model is first presented, comprehensively considering multiple operational constraints. We propose a constraint embedding method that allows us to replace the non-convex power flow constraints with trained ICNN models and convexify the problem. To further speed up DOE optimization, we propose a linear relaxation of the ICNN-based DOE optimization problem, for which the tightness is theoretically proven. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated with numerical case studies. Results show that the proposed ICNN-based method outperforms other benchmark methods in optimizing DOEs in terms of both solution quality and solution time.</description>

      <title>Scalable Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Accelerating Electromagnetic Transient Stability Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper puts forward a framework to accelerate Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulations by replacing individual components with trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). EMT simulations are considered the cornerstone of transient stability assessment of power systems with high shares of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), and, although accurate, they are notorious for their slow simulation speed. Taking a deeper dive into the EMT simulation algorithms, this paper identifies the most computationally expensive components of the simulation and replaces them with fast and accurate PINNs. The proposed novel PINN formulation enables a modular and scalable integration into the simulation algorithm. Using a type-4 wind turbine EMT model, we demonstrate a 4--6x simulation speedup by capturing the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with a PINN. We validate all our results with PSCAD software.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Step Duration for Accurate Foot Placement: Achieving Robust Bipedal Locomotion on Terrains with Restricted Footholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional one-step preview planning algorithms for bipedal locomotion struggle to generate viable gaits when walking across terrains with restricted footholds, such as stepping stones. To overcome such limitations, this paper introduces a novel multi-step preview foot placement planning algorithm based on the step-to-step discrete evolution of the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) of walking robots. Our proposed approach adaptively changes the step duration and the swing foot trajectory for optimal foot placement under constraints, thereby enhancing the long-term stability of the robot and significantly improving its ability to navigate environments with tight constraints on viable footholds. We demonstrate its effectiveness through various simulation scenarios with complex stepping-stone configurations and external perturbations. These tests underscore its improved performance for navigating foothold-restricted terrains, even with external disturbances.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Decision Making in Restless Bandits: Theory and Algorithms for Planning and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23029v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In restless bandits, a central agent is tasked with optimally distributing limited resources across several bandits (arms), with each arm being a Markov decision process. In this work, we generalize the traditional restless bandits problem with a risk-neutral objective by incorporating risk-awareness, which is particularly important in various real-world applications especially when the decision maker seeks to mitigate downside risks. We establish indexability conditions for the case of a risk-aware objective and provide a solution based on Whittle index for the first time for the planning problem with finite-horizon non-stationary and for infinite-horizon stationary Markov decision processes. In addition, we address the learning problem when the true transition probabilities are unknown by proposing a Thompson sampling approach and show that it achieves bounded regret that scales sublinearly with the number of episodes and quadratically with the number of arms. The efficacy of our method in reducing risk exposure in restless bandits is illustrated through a set of numerical experiments in the contexts of machine replacement and patient scheduling applications under both planning and learning setups.</description>

      <title>Harpocrates: A Statically Typed Privacy Conscious Programming Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06317v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Harpocrates, a compiler plugin and a framework pair for Scala that binds the privacy policies to the data during data creation in form of oblivious membranes. Harpocrates eliminates raw data for a policy protected type from the application, ensuring it can only exist in protected form and centralizes the policy checking to the policy declaration site, making the privacy logic easy to maintain and verify. Instead of approaching privacy from an information flow verification perspective, Harpocrates allow the data to flow freely throughout the application, inside the policy membranes but enforces the policies when the data is tried to be accessed, mutated, declassified or passed through the application boundary. The centralization of the policies allow the maintainers to change the enforced logic simply by updating a single function while keeping the rest of the application oblivious to the change. Especially in a setting where the data definition is shared by multiple applications, the publisher can update the policies without requiring the dependent applications to make any changes beyond updating the dependency version.</description>

      <title>Robust Reinforcement Learning-Based Locomotion for Resource-Constrained Quadrupeds with Exteroceptive Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact quadrupedal robots are proving increasingly suitable for deployment in real-world scenarios. Their smaller size fosters easy integration into human environments. Nevertheless, real-time locomotion on uneven terrains remains challenging, particularly due to the high computational demands of terrain perception. This paper presents a robust reinforcement learning-based exteroceptive locomotion controller for resource-constrained small-scale quadrupeds in challenging terrains, which exploits real-time elevation mapping, supported by a careful depth sensor selection. We concurrently train both a policy and a state estimator, which together provide an odometry source for elevation mapping, optionally fused with visual-inertial odometry (VIO). We demonstrate the importance of positioning an additional time-of-flight sensor for maintaining robustness even without VIO, thus having the potential to free up computational resources. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed controller can flawlessly traverse steps up to 17.5 cm in height and achieve an 80% success rate on 22.5 cm steps, both with and without VIO. The proposed controller also achieves accurate forward and yaw velocity tracking of up to 1.0 m/s and 1.5 rad/s respectively. We open-source our training code at github.com/ETH-PBL/elmap-rl-controller.</description>

      <title>Human-Like Trajectories Generation via Receding Horizon Tracking Applied to the TickTacking Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TickTacking is a rhythm-based interface that allows users to control a pointer in a two-dimensional space through dual-button tapping. This paper investigates the generation of human-like trajectories using a receding horizon approach applied to the TickTacking interface in a target-tracking task. By analyzing user-generated trajectories, we identify key human behavioral features and incorporate them in a controller that mimics these behaviors. The performance of this human-inspired controller is evaluated against a baseline optimal-control-based agent, demonstrating the importance of specific control features for achieving human-like interaction. These findings contribute to the broader goal of developing rhythm-based human-machine interfaces by offering design insights that enhance user performance, improve intuitiveness, and reduce interaction frustration</description>
