      <title>The fermionic DGFF and its scaling limit logCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify the scaling limit of the fermionic discrete Gaussian free field (fDGFF) as a logarithmic conformal field theory (CFT) in two dimensions. We first establish a one-to-one correspondence between the space of local observables of the fDGFF and the space of local fields of the symplectic fermions CFT, a logarithmic CFT with central charge $c = - 2$. This correspondence is meaningful in the sense that, when appropriately renormalised, the fDGFF correlation functions converge to corresponding CFT correlation functions in the scaling limit. As an application to these results, we interpret (the scaling limit of) certain local observables in the uniform spanning tree and the Abelian sandpile model as local fields of the symplectic fermions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the real eigenvalue distribution for the real spherical ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real Ginibre spherical ensemble consists of random matrices of the form $A B^{-1}$, where $A,B$ are independent standard real Gaussian $N \times N$ matrices. The expected number of real eigenvalues is known to be of order $\sqrt{N}$. We consider the probability $p_{N.M}^{\rm r}$ that there are $M$ real eigenvalues in various regimes. These are when $M$ is proportional to $N$ (large deviations), when $N$ is proportional to $\sqrt{N}$ (intermediate deviations), and when $M$ is in the neighbourhood of the mean (local central limit theorem). This is done using a Coulomb gas formalism in the large deviations case, and by determining the leading asymptotic form of the generating function for the probabilities in the case of intermediate deviations (the local central limit regime was known from earlier work). Moreover a matching of the left tail asymptotics of the intermediate deviation regime with that of the right tail of the large deviation regime is exhibited, as is a matching of the right tail intermediate deviation regime with the leading order form of the probabilities in the local central limit regime. We also give the leading asymptotic form of $p_{N,0}^{\rm r}$, i.e. the probability of no real eigenvalues.</description>

Abstract: With G. Borot we have previously proved that moments of the Kontsevich matrix model with arbitrary potential satisfy quadratic BKP relations. In this note we show that, for even potential, these moments also satisfy simpler linear relations, which are organised by elementary Schur Q-functions.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical states localized on a one-dimensional manifold and governed by the nonlocal NLSE with an anti-Hermitian term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the method for constructing solutions to the nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE) with an anti-Hermitian term that are semiclassically localized on a one-dimensional manifold (a curve). The evolution of the curve is given by the closed system of integro-differential equations that can be treated as the "classical"\, analog of the open quantum system with the nontrivial geometry. Using our approach, we consider the evolution of vortex states in the open quantum system described by the specific model NLSE. The semiclassical stage of the vortex evolution can be treated as a quasi-steady vortex state. We show that the behaviour of this state is largely determined by the geometry of the localization curve.</description>

      <title>Finite 2-group gauge theory and its 3+1D lattice realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we employ the Tannaka-Krein reconstruction to compute the quantum double $\mathcal D(\mathcal G)$ of a finite 2-group $\mathcal G$ as a Hopf monoidal category. We also construct a 3+1D lattice model from the Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT functor for the 2-group $\mathcal G$, generalizing Kitaev's 2+1D quantum double model. Notably, the string-like local operators in this lattice model are shown to form $\mathcal D(\mathcal G)$. Specializing to $\mathcal G = \mathbb{Z}_2$, we demonstrate that the topological defects in the 3+1D toric code model are modules over $\mathcal D(\mathbb{Z}_2)$.</description>

      <title>A Gentle Introduction to Algebraic Operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This text, based on the author's Bachelor's thesis, introduces the theory of Algebraic Operads, a mathematical formalism that provides a unifying framework for modern algebra. We demonstrate how the fundamental theories of associative, commutative, and Lie algebras can be fully recovered as categories of representations of three archetypal operads: $\mathsf{As}$, $\mathsf{Com}$ and $\mathsf{Lie}$ -- the so-called 'three graces' of algebra.
  Following a deductive and self-contained approach, the notion of an operad is initially presented in its classical form, as a single-object multicategory. Subsequently, alternative definitions -- namely, the partial and functorial definitions -- are provided. This framework allows for the extension of classical algebraic notions, such as free objects and quotients, to the operadic context, thereby enabling operads to be formally presented through generators and relations.
  The central result of this work is the rigorous proof of the correspondence between operads and algebras. We establish isomorphisms of categories between the algebras over the operads $\mathsf{As}$, $\mathsf{Com}$ and $\mathsf{Lie}$, and their respective classical counterparts.
  This thesis thus highlights how the theory of operads offers a higher-level language for algebra, encoding entire algebraic theories within single mathematical objects. This formalism not only unifies known structures but also lays the foundation for advanced concepts, such as 'algebras up to homotopy,' with applications in fields like theoretical physics and geometry.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the operator extension of strong subadditivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the operator extension of the strong subadditivity of von Neumann entropy $\rho_{AB} \otimes \sigma_{C}^{-1} \leq \rho_{A} \otimes \sigma_{BC}^{-1}$ by identifying the mathematical structure behind it as Connes' theory of spatial derivatives. This immediately generalizes the inequality to arbitrary inclusions of von Neumann algebras. In the case of standard representations, it reduces to the monotonicity of the relative modular operator.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Dynamics and First-Passage Properties of Stochastic Processes: From Brownian Motion to Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we develop analytical methods to study out-of-equilibrium stochastic processes driven by colored noise, i.e., noise with temporal correlations. These non-Markovian processes pose significant analytical challenges compared to processes driven by white noise, such as Brownian motion. A primary focus is on active particle systems, specifically the run-and-tumble particle subjected to an arbitrary force. We derive exact expressions for its mean first-passage time (MFPT) and exit probability from an interval using the backward Fokker-Planck equation. Remarkably, we find that the MFPT can be optimized as a function of the tumbling rate. Additionally, we investigate stochastic resetting and switching diffusion models. For switching diffusion models which are examples of "Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusions", we use a renewal approach and large deviation theory to derive exact results for various observables. These include the distribution of the position of the particle and its moments, but also its cumulants which are key observables to characterize non-Gaussian fluctuations. Notably, we uncover an unexpected connection between this model and free cumulants. We also examine these models in the presence of a harmonic potential by using Kesten variables. This approach enables us to write an integral equation for the steady-state distribution, which we solve in specific cases. Furthermore, we extend Siegmund duality - a concept that is not widely known in the physics literature - to active particles, random diffusion models, stochastic resetting, and continuous-time random walks. This duality establishes a direct relation between first passage observables and the spatial properties of a dual process, which we explicitly construct.</description>

      <title>On integrable structure of the null string in (anti-)de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presently integrability turned the key property in the study of duality between superconformal gauge theories and strings in anti-de Sitter superspaces. Complexity of the study of integrable structure in string theory is caused by complicated dependence of background fields of the Type II supergravity multiplets, with which strings interact, on the superspace coordinates. This explains an interest to study of limiting cases, in which superstring equations simplify. In the present work considered is the limiting case of zero tension corresponding to null string. It is obtained the representation in the form of the Lax equation of null-string equations in (anti-)de Sitter space realized as coset manifold. Proposed is twistor interpretation of the Lagrangian of (null) string in anti-de Sitter space expressed in terms of group variables.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem for a generalized two-component Novikov system with weak dissipation. We first establish the local well-posedness of solutions by using the Kato's theorem. Then we give the necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of wave breaking in a finite time. Finally, we investigate the persistence properties of strong solutions in the weighted $L^{p}(\mathbb{R})$ spaces for a large class of moderate weights.</description>

      <title>D-ideal of generic mass banana integrals in dimensional regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a set of $\ell + 3$ simple differential operators and prove that they annihilate an $\ell$-loop generic mass banana integral in dimensional regularization. We study the singular locus of the ideal generated by these operators and show that it is contained in the set of Landau singularities of the first and second type. Through the Macaulay matrix method, we calculate the corresponding holonomic rank up to $\ell = 8$, obtaining $2^{\ell +1}-1$, which agrees with the number of master integrals for the generic mass banana integrals. Based on these findings, we conjecture that the proposed operators generate the annihilating ideal for the generic mass banana integrals in dimensional regularization.</description>

      <title>Almost local integrable models from supersymmetry algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetry algebras can be used to obtain algebraic expressions for constant Yang-Baxter solutions, also known as braid group generators. This was done for non-invertible braid operators in \cite{maity2025non}. In this work we extend this construction for the invertible ones. The resulting expressions are then shown to obey relations analogous to those satisfied by quotients of braid groups. Examples of the latter include the Iwahori-Hecke algebra and the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) algebra. As a result, we can Baxterize the constant Yang-Baxter solutions to yield spectral parameter dependent $R$-matrices. The regularity of these $R$-matrices depend on the representation of SUSY generators. In some cases they are regular in the usual sense and in the remaining they are `almost' regular. In the latter case they are also non-invertible. Nevertheless we show that they can still help us construct integrable models in all dimensions of the local Hilbert space. These models can be described by Hamiltonian densities that are either local or non-local, depending on the representation chosen for the SUSY generators. We demonstrate this for all constant $4\times 4$ invertible Yang-Baxter solutions. Apart from finding new nearest-neighbor interaction spin $\frac{1}{2}$ systems, we also find their higher spin analogs due to the algebraic [representation independent] approach.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler Divergence as a Measure of Irreversible Information Loss Near Black Hole Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified theoretical framework that integrates information theory, thermodynamics, and general relativity to analyze the fundamental limit of decoding time-encoded signals in curved spacetime. In particular, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) as a quantitative measure of the mismatch between the transmitted and received symbol distributions induced by gravitational time dilation. Using a minimal communication model, we derive the critical radius at which information decoding becomes thermodynamically impossible due to the divergence of the KLD. We show that this radius approaches the Schwarzschild horizon in the limit where the information entropy cost becomes negligible relative to the transmission energy. This result provides a novel information-theoretic interpretation of the event horizon as a boundary of irreversible information loss governed by universal thermodynamic principles. Our framework offers new insights into the entropic and energetic constraints on communication in strong gravitational fields and may extend to general relativistic and quantum information settings.</description>

      <title>Universality for fluctuations of counting statistics of random normal matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04386v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the fluctuations of the number of eigenvalues of $n\times n$ random normal matrices depending on a potential $Q$ in a given set $A$. These eigenvalues are known to form a determinantal point process, and are known to accumulate on a compact set called the droplet under mild conditions on $Q$. When $A$ is a Borel set strictly inside the droplet, we show that the variance of the number of eigenvalues $N_A^{(n)}$ in $A$ has a limiting behavior given by
  \begin{align*} \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac1{\sqrt n}\operatorname{Var } N_A^{(n)} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt\pi}\int_{\partial_* A} \sqrt{\Delta Q(z)} \, d\mathcal H^1(z), \end{align*} where $\partial_* A$ is the measure theoretic boundary of $A$, $d\mathcal H^1(z)$ denotes the one-dimensional Hausdorff measure, and $\Delta = \partial_z \overline{\partial_z}$. We also consider the case where $A$ is a microscopic dilation of the droplet and fully generalize a result by Akemann, Byun and Ebke for arbitrary potentials. In this result $d\mathcal H^1(z)$ is replaced by the harmonic measure at $\infty$ associated with the exterior of the droplet. This second result is proved by strengthening results due to Hedenmalm-Wennman and Ameur-Cronvall on the asymptotic behavior of the associated correlation kernel near the droplet boundary.</description>

      <title>Efficient classical computation of the neural tangent kernel of quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient classical algorithm to estimate the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with a broad class of quantum neural networks. These networks consist of arbitrary unitary operators belonging to the Clifford group interleaved with parametric gates given by the time evolution generated by an arbitrary Hamiltonian belonging to the Pauli group. The proposed algorithm leverages a key insight: the average over the distribution of initialization parameters in the NTK definition can be exactly replaced by an average over just four discrete values, chosen such that the corresponding parametric gates are Clifford operations. This reduction enables an efficient classical simulation of the circuit. Combined with recent results establishing the equivalence between wide quantum neural networks and Gaussian processes [Girardi \emph{et al.}, Comm. Math. Phys. 406, 92 (2025); Melchor Hernandez \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2412.03182], our method enables efficient computation of the expected output of wide, trained quantum neural networks, and therefore shows that such networks cannot achieve quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>How are pseudo-$q$-traces related to (co)ends?</title>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb V$ be an $\mathbb N$-graded $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra (VOA), not necessarily rational or self-dual. Using a special case of the sewing-factorization theorem from [GZ25a], we show that the end $\mathbb E=\int_{\mathbb M\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)}\mathbb M\otimes_{\mathbb C}\mathbb M'$ in $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes2})$ (where $\mathbb{M}'$ is the contragredient module of $\mathbb{M}$) admits a natural structure of associative $\mathbb C$-algebra compatible with its $\mathbb{V}^{\otimes2}$-module structure. Moreover, we show that a suitable category $\mathrm{Coh}_{\mathrm{L}}(\mathbb E)$ of left $\mathbb E$-modules is isomorphic, as a linear category, to $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$, and that the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks is isomorphic to the space $\mathrm{SLF}(\mathbb E)$ of symmetric linear functionals on $\mathbb E$.
  Combining these results with the main theorem of [GZ25b], we prove a conjecture of Gainutdinov-Runkel: For any projective generator $\mathbb G$ in $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$, the pseudo-$q$-trace construction yields a linear isomorphism from $\mathrm{SLF}(\mathrm{End}_{\mathbb V}(\mathbb{G})^{\mathrm{opp}})$ to the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks of $\mathbb V$.
  In particular, if $A$ is a unital finite-dimensional $\mathbb C$-algebra such that the category of finite-dimensional left $A$-modules is equivalent to $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$, then $\mathrm{SLF}(A)$ is linearly isomorphic to the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks of $\mathbb V$. This confirms a conjecture of Arike-Nagatomo.</description>

      <title>A short combinatorial proof of Di Francesco's conjecture on Aztec triangles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Di Francesco conjectured in 2021 that the number of domino tilings of a certain family of regions -- called Aztec triangles -- on the square lattice is given by a product formula reminiscent of the one giving the number of alternating sign matrices. This turned out to be a real challenge to prove without the use of computers -- each of the two existing proofs (one due to Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser, the other to Corteel, Huang and Krattenthaler) relies on substantial computer calculations which would be hard to check directly. In this paper we present a short combinatorial proof that relies on the second author's factorization theorem and complementation theorem for perfect matchings.</description>

Abstract: To a quiver we associate a finite length monoidal abelian category which categorifies the corresponding preprojective K-theoretic Hall algebra of Varagnolo-Vasserot. The simples in this category provide a (dual) canonical basis of the Hall algebra. In particular, if the quiver is affine, this provides a basis for the positive half of the corresponding quantum toroidal algebra. We also show that this abelian category is naturally endowed with renormalized r-matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the extension to higher genus Riemann surfaces of the classical Chebotarev problem, with a view towards the development of the theory of Pad\'e\ approximants on algebraic curves. To this end we define an appropriate notion of capacity that mimics the standard one, following works of Chirka and of the author and collaborators. The nontrivial topology of the Riemann surface requires further specification of the ``homotopy class'' of the continua in the solution of the Chebotarev problem. We also discuss the relationship of this problem to the theory of Jenkins-Strebel quadratic differentials.</description>

      <title>Solution of all quartic matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.04600v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quartic analogue of the Kontsevich model, which is defined by a measure $\exp(-{N}\,\mathrm{Tr}(E\Phi^2+(\lambda/4)\Phi^4)) d\Phi$ on Hermitian ${N}\times{N}$-matrices, where $E$ is any positive matrix and $\lambda$ a scalar. It was previously established that the large-$N$ limit of the second moment (the planar two-point function) satisfies a non-linear integral equation. By employing tools from complex analysis, in particular the Lagrange-B\"urmann inversion formula, we identify the exact solution of this non-linear problem, both for finite $N$ and for a large-${N}$ limit to unbounded operators $E$ of spectral dimension $\leq 4$. For finite $N$, the two-point function is a rational function evaluated at the preimages of another rational function $R$ constructed from the spectrum of $E$. Subsequent work has constructed from this formula a family $\omega_{g,n}$ of meromorphic differentials which obey blobbed topological recursion. For unbounded operators $E$, the renormalised two-point function is given by an integral formula involving a regularisation of $R$. This allowed a proof, in subsequent work, that the $\lambda\Phi^4_4$-model on noncommutative Moyal space does not have a triviality problem.</description>

      <title>A class of 2x2 correlated random-matrix models with Brody spacing distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01514v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of 2x2 random-matrix models is introduced for which the Brody distribution is the exact eigenvalue spacing distribution. The matrix elements consist of constrained finite sums of an exponential random variable raised to various powers that depend on the Brody parameter. The random matrices introduced here differ from those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) in three important ways: the matrix elements are not independent and identically distributed (i.e., not IID) nor Gaussian-distributed, and the matrices are not necessarily real and/or symmetric. The first two features arise from dropping the classical independence assumption, and the third feature stems from dropping the quantum-mechanical conditions imposed in the construction of the GOE. In particular, the hermiticity condition, which in the present class of models, is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the eigenvalues to be real, is not imposed. Consequently, complex non-Hermitian 2x2 random matrices with real or complex eigenvalues can also have spacing distributions that are intermediate between those of the Poisson and Wigner classes. Numerical examples are provided for different types of random matrices, including complex-symmetric matrices with real or complex-conjugate eigenvalues. Various generalizations and extensions are discussed including a simple modification that effectuates cross-over transitions between other classes of eigenvalue spacing statistics. The case of a cross-over transition between semi-Poisson and Ginibre spacing statistics is presented as a novel example.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Lie superheaps as a generalisation of Lie supergroups. We show that the well-known `groupification' and `heapification' functors generalise to the ambience of supergeometry. In particular, we show that there is an isomorphism between the categories of pointed Lie superheaps and Lie supergroups. To do this we make extensive use of the functor of points.</description>

      <title>Field theories and quantum methods for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems are composed of many particles or agents that move and interact with one another. The underlying mathematical framework to model many of these systems must incorporate the spatial transport of particles and their interactions, as well as changes to their copy numbers, all of which can be formulated in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. The probabilistic representation of these processes is complex because of combinatorial aspects arising due to nonlinear interactions and varying particle numbers. This review presents the main field theory representations of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, which handle these issues `under-the-hood'. First, we focus on bringing techniques familiar to theoretical physicists -- such as second quantization, Fock space, and path integrals -- back into the classical domain of reaction-diffusion systems. We demonstrate how various field theory representations can all be unified under a single basis-independent representation. We then extend existing quantum-based methods and notation to work directly on the level of the unifying representation, and we illustrate how they can be used to consistently obtain previous known results, such as numerical discretizations and relations between model parameters at multiple scales. Throughout the work, we contextualize how these representations mirror well-known models of chemical physics depending on their spatial resolution, as well as the corresponding macroscopic limits. The framework presented here may find applications in a diverse set of scientific fields, including physical chemistry, theoretical ecology, epidemiology, game theory and socio-economical models of complex systems. The presentation is done in a self-contained educational and unifying manner such that it can be followed by researchers across several fields.</description>

Abstract: This review presents recent developments in the study of inhomogeneous XX spin chains, highlighting results on perfect state transfer, out-of-equilibrium stationary dynamics in open systems, and entanglement and correlations in ground states. We discuss the conditions on couplings that enable perfect state transfer, examine how heat currents scale when the chains are coupled to thermal baths, explore the role of tridiagonal matrices in approximating the entanglement Hamiltonian and investigate bulk and boundary entanglement negativity and correlation decay. These findings underscore some of the distinctive physical behavior of inhomogeneous spin chains and their potential applications in quantum information and thermal transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove two results concerning percolation on general graphs.
  - We establish the converse of the classical Peierls argument: if the critical parameter for (uniform) percolation satisfies $p_c&lt;1$, then the number of minimal cutsets of size $n$ separating a given vertex from infinity is bounded above exponentially in $n$. This resolves a conjecture of Babson and Benjamini from 1999.
  - We prove that $p_c&lt;1$ for every uniformly transient graph. This solves a problem raised by Duminil-Copin, Goswami, Raoufi, Severo and Yadin, and provides a new proof that $p_c&lt;1$ for every transitive graph of superlinear growth.</description>

      <title>Continuous majorization in quantum phase space for Wigner-positive states and proposals for Wigner-negative states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum resource theory, one is often interested in identifying which states serve as the best resources for particular quantum tasks. If a relative comparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial order, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a resource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of quantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector majorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural partial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general $N$-mode case. In addition, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the convex hull of $N$-mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf. We also prove a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.</description>

      <title>Semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit global existence and decay for small-data solutions of semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole backgrounds satisfying the classical null condition, a problem which was previously addressed by the first author in joint work with Aretakis and Gajic (Ann. of PDE, 2020). In this paper, we develop a new approach based on propagating a significantly weaker set of estimates, which allows for a simpler and more streamlined proof. Our proof does not require tracking sharp estimates for the solution in the near-horizon region, which means that it is compatible with, but does not imply, the non-decay and growth hierarchy of derivatives of the solution along the event horizon expected from the Aretakis instability. In particular, this approach is in principle compatible with other settings where stronger horizon instabilities are expected, such as nonlinear charged scalar fields on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om, or nonlinear waves on extremal Kerr. We also sketch how our proof applies to semilinear problems on spacetimes settling down to extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om, such as those constructed in our joint work with Kehle (arXiv:2410.16234, 2024).</description>

Abstract: Despite decades of research, creating accurate, robust, and efficient lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) on non-uniform grids with seamless GPU acceleration remains challenging. This work introduces a novel strategy to address this challenge by integrating simple yet effective components: (1) parallel algorithms in modern C++, (2) conservative cell-centered grid refinement, (3) local boundary conditions, and (4) robust collision models. Our framework supports multiple lattices (D2Q9, D2Q13, D2Q21, D2Q37, D3Q27, etc) tailored to various flow conditions. It includes collision models with polynomial and numerical equilibria, a second distribution for polyatomic behavior, a Jameson-like shock sensor, and generalizes Rohde's refinement strategy.
  The framework's accuracy and robustness is validated across diverse benchmarks, including lid-driven cavity flows, Aeolian noise, 30P30N airfoil aerodynamics, inviscid Riemann problems, and viscous flows past a NACA airfoil in transonic and supersonic regimes. Modern C++ further enables our framework to reach GPU-native performance, while ensuring high portability, modularity, and ease of implementation. Notably, weakly compressible LBMs achieve state-of-the-art GPU efficiency on non-uniform grids, while fully compressible LBMs benefit from acceleration equivalent to thousands of CPU cores in the most compute-intensive cases. Our advanced performance models incorporate neighbor-list and asynchronous time-stepping effects, providing new insights into the performance decomposition of LB simulations on non-uniform grids.
  Overall, this study sets a new standard for portable, tree-based LBMs, demonstrating that a combination of well-chosen components can achieve high performance, accuracy, and robustness across various flow conditions. As a final proof-of-concept, adaptive mesh refinement is proposed for subsonic and supersonic applications.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic quantum strings from gauged WZW models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct non-relativistic quantum strings from gauged Wess--Zumino--Witten (WZW) models. We depart from the fact that Lie groups with a bi-invariant galilean structure can be seen as the quotient by a null central subgroup of a generalised Nappi--Witten group. We implement the quotient by a chiral null gauging. We use a particular free field realisation of the Nappi--Witten current algebra to compute the Virasoro BRST cohomology of the gauged WZW model, resulting in a closed string theory reminiscent of the bosonic Gomis--Ooguri string, but whose spectrum differs slightly between the holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors.</description>

      <title>Noise sensitivity of crossings for high temperature Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the event that there is a $+$ crossing from left to right in a box for the Ising model on the triangular lattice. We show that this event is noise sensitive under Glauber dynamics $t \mapsto \sigma_t$ in the subcritical regime $\beta&lt;\beta_c$. We rely on the non-spectral approach from our previous work [TV23]. An important aspect in this more general setup is the study of the pair $(\sigma_0,\sigma_t)$ and in particular the establishment of properties such as finite-energy and spatial mixing.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Inhomogeneous Free Bosons and Orthogonal Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ground-state entanglement entropy in inhomogeneous free-boson models in one spatial dimension. We develop a powerful method to extract the leading term in the entanglement scaling, based on the analytic properties of the inhomogeneous potential. This method is applicable to a broad class of models with smooth spatial inhomogeneities. As a case study, we apply this approach for a family of exactly-solvable models characterized by orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme, finding a perfect match between the numerical and analytical results.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian with Energy Levels Corresponding to Riemann Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21192v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian with eigenenergies $E_n = \rho_n(1-\rho_n) $ has been constructed, where $\rho_n $ denotes the $n$-th non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function. To construct such a Hamiltonian, we generalize the Berry-Keating's paradigm and encode number-theoretic information into the Hamiltonian through modular forms. Even though our construction does not resolve the Hilbert-P\'olya conjecture -- since the eigenstates corresponding to $E_n$ are \emph{not} normalizable states -- it offers a novel physical perspective on the Riemann Hypothesis(RH). Especially, we proposed a physical statement of RH, which may serve as a potential pathway toward its proof.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity and Fourier asymptotics of spectral measures for 1D Schr\"odinger operators under exponentially decaying perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity, or even the Lipschitz property, for the spectral measures of half-line discrete Schr\"odinger operators under suitable boundary conditions and exponentially decaying small potentials. These are the first known examples, apart from the free case, of Schr\"odinger operators with Lipschitz continuous spectral measures up to the spectral edge, and it was obtained as a consequence of the Dirichlet boundary condition. Notably, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the time-averaged quantum return probability, either $\log (t) / t$ or $1 / t$, as in the case of the free Laplacian, remains unchanged in this setting. Furthermore, we prove the persistence of the purely absolutely continuous spectrum and the $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity of the spectral measures for (Diophantine) quasi-periodic operators under exponentially decaying small perturbations. These results are optimal and hold for all energies, up to the border of the absolutely continuous spectrum.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Quantum Code Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, it is sometimes necessary to modify the stabilizer code by adding an arbitrary number of physical qubits and parity checks. Motivations may include embedding a high-dimensional quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) code into finite-dimensional Euclidean space, or reducing the weights of an arbitrary CSS code. During this embedding, it is essential that the modified CSS code possesses an isomorphic set of logical qubits as the original CSS code. However, despite numerous explicit constructions, the conditions of when such a property holds true is not known in general. Therefore, using the language of homological algebra, we provide a unified framework that guarantees a natural isomorphism between the output and input codes. In particular, we explicitly show how previous works fit into our framework.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic bootstrap for RCFT: signs and bounds for quasi-characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-characters are solutions of simple modular differential equations that form an explicit basis for the space of all admissible characters that can potentially describe rational CFT. They were classified for rank-$2$ in arXiv:1810.09472 [hep-th], where it was conjectured that their $q$-series has coefficients of alternating sign that stabilise to a fixed sign at order $\frac{c}{12}$ and sometimes undergo more exotic behaviour -- where $c$ is the central charge. Here we prove some of these conjectures and estimate the growth of coefficients near the stabilisation point. We also explain what role the signs play in the construction of admissible characters from quasi-characters.</description>

      <title>The motion of a rigid body in a viscous fluid: new results for strong solutions, uniqueness and integrability properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show two results in the setting of Galdi-Silvestre strong solutions for the rigid body-viscous fluid interaction. The former, under an additional integrability assumption on the gradient of the initial data, proves that the time derivative of the solution belongs to $L^2(0,T;L^2({\Omega}))$. The latter, thanks to a further assumption only on one solution, proves that the uniqueness holds in the quoted setting. However, our extra assumption for the uniqueness is certainly verified under the integrability assumption on the gradient of the initial data. Hence, the set of solutions enjoying the uniqueness is not empty.</description>

      <title>Viscous-inertial waves on the surface of the Sun: modeling, forward and inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical framework for studying the newly discovered solar inertial oscillations, offering promising new avenues for exploring the Sun's dynamics. Under the assumption of purely toroidal motions, the stream function of the flow satisfies a fourth-order scalar equation governing inertial waves on the rotating Sun. We prove well-posedness of wave solutions under explicit conditions on differential rotation. Moreover, we study the inverse problem of simultaneously reconstructing viscosity and differential rotation parameters from either complete or partial surface observations. To this end, we verify the tangential cone condition, ensuring the convergence of iterative regularization methods, furthermore the local unique identifiability of the unknown parameters. Numerical experiments employing the Nesterov-Landweber iteration confirm robustness of the reconstruction across different observation schemes and noise levels.</description>
