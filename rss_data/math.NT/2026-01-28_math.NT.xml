      <title>Closing the gap around the essential minimum of height functions with linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many common height functions, the explicit determination of the essential minimum is an open problem. We consider a classical method to obtain lower bounds that goes back at least to C.J. Smyth, and a method to obtain upper bounds based on the knowledge of the limit distribution of integral points. We use an infinite dimensional linear programming scheme to show that that both methods agree in the limit, by showing that the principle of strong duality holds in our situation. As a corollary we prove that the essential minimum can be attained by sequences of algebraic integers.
  Recent results by A. Smith and B. Orloski--N. Sardari, furnish a characterization of compactly supported measures that can be approximated by complete sets of conjugates of algebraic integers, in terms of infinitely many nonnegativity conditions. We establish an extension of this characterization to measures with non necessarily compact support. As an application of this result and of strong duality, we show that the essential minimum is a computable real number when the Green function used to define the height is computable. We systematically use potential theory for measures that can integrate functions with logarithmic growth.</description>

      <title>Efficient enumeration of quadratic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to enumerate isometry classes of integral quadratic lattices of a given rank and determinant, and analyze its running time by giving bounds on the number of genus symbols for a fixed rank and determinant. We build on previous work of Brandhorst, Hanke, and Dubey and Holenstein. We analyze the running times of their respective algorithms and compare the practical performance of their implementations with our own. Our implementations are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Intersections of Cantor sets with hyperbolas and continuous images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $\lambda\in (0,1/2)$, let \begin{equation*} C_\lambda=\set{(1-\lambda)\sum_{i=1}^\infty d_i\lambda^{i-1}:d_i\in\set{0,1}} \end{equation*} be the middle Cantor sets with convex hull $[0, 1]$. We are interested in the set $S_t=\set{(x,y)\in C_\lambda\times C_\lambda: xy=t}$, where $t\in[0,1]$. Since the cases where $t=0$ or $t=1$ are trivial, we assume that $t\in(0,1)$ in what follows. We show that there exists a $\lambda_0=0.4302$ such that for all $\lambda$ satisfying $\lambda_0 \le \lambda &lt; 1/2$, the set $S_t$ has the cardinality of the continuum for every $t \in (0,1)$. Besides, we further investigate the continuous image of $C_\lambda\times C_\lambda$, that is, for any given $2\le k\in \nn$, we give a sufficient condition for set $\set{x^ky:x,y\in C_\lambda}$ to be the interval $[0,1]$. Our observations reveal that the behavior exhibited by the image of the function $f_k(x,y)=x^ky$ is complex and depends on the parameters $k$ and $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Secondary terms in the distribution of genus numbers of cubic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of secondary terms of order $X^{5/6}$ in the asymptotic formulas for the average size of the genus number of cubic fields and for the number of cubic fields with a given genus number, establishing improved error estimates. These results refine the estimates obtained by McGown and Tucker. We also provide uniform estimates for the moments of the genus numbers of cubic fields.</description>

      <title>Computing $p$-Class Group Structure in Real Quadratic Fields: A New Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is the first in a series devoted to computing the class groups of real quadratic fields. We present a new relation between the class number and the index of unit groups. This relation generalizes Hilbert class field theory for real quadratic fields and establishes a bridge between class field theory, composition laws of binary forms of degree $p^n$, and ideal classes of order $p^n$, where p is prime and n is an arbitrary positive integer.</description>

      <title>Arboreal Galois representations of rational functions: fixed-point proportion and the extension problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit description of the arithmetic-geometric extension of iterated Galois groups of rational functions. This yields a complete solution to the extension problem when either the arithmetic or the geometric iterated Galois group is branch, answering a question of Adams and Hyde.
  Furthermore, we obtain a sufficient condition for the arithmetic iterated Galois group of a rational function to have positive fixed-point proportion, which further applies in many instances to the specialization to non strictly post-critical points. In particular, this holds for all unicritical polynomials of odd degree, which greatly generalizes a result of Radi for the polynomial $z^d+1$.
  Lastly, we obtain the first family of groups acting on the $d$-adic tree whose fixed-point process becomes eventually $d$ for any $d\ge 2$ with positive probability. What is more, these groups are fractal and branch and thus positive-dimensional; hence they yield the first family of counterexamples to a conjecture of Jones for every $d$-adic tree.</description>

      <title>On Dirichlet Series Involving $\zeta(s)$ and Extensions of the Euler-Mascheroni Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of Dirichlet series defined in terms of the Riemann zeta-function, motivated by the study of their special values, and establish integral representations for these series. We also define an extension of the Euler--Mascheroni constant and express certain special values explicitly in terms of the Bendersky constants. These results provide a unified framework for evaluating Dirichlet series involving the Riemann zeta-function at integer arguments, together with the associated number-theoretic constants.</description>

      <title>False and partial Eisenstein series related to unimodal sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the fact that the classical Jacobi theta function $\vartheta$ is the exponential generating function of the Eisenstein series, we study the exponential Taylor coefficients (in the elliptic variable) of a related natural partial theta function, as well as a false theta function related to the Dedekind eta function. We prove that the space spanned by these objects is closed under differentiation, analogous to the space of quasimodular forms, and that it contains the quasimodular forms themselves. We further provide their Fourier expansions, establish quasimodular completions, and derive a recursive formula for the Taylor coefficients of the logarithm of the unimodal rank generating function, expressed as partition traces of the false and partial objects.</description>

      <title>Iwasawa theory for abelian towers of digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ and $\ell$ be prime numbers, and $d\ge1$ an integer. We formulate and prove Iwasawa main conjectures of the Picard groups and Bowen--Franks groups in $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$-towers of digraphs. In particular, we relate the $\ell$ parts of these groups to certain $p$-adic $L$-functions defined using a voltage assignment. In the case where $\ell$ is not equal to $p$, we make use of the recent work of Bandini--Longhi to define the appropriate characteristic ideals. We also prove the growth of the $\ell$-part of these groups, generalizing classical results of Sinnott and Washington on ideal class groups of number fields. Finally, we introduce the concept of defect, which compare certain algebraic and analytic ranks related to Bowen--Franks groups and study their asymptotic behaviour in a $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$-tower.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an analogue, over global function fields, of a conjecture due to Su-Ion Ih concerning the non-Zariski density of torsion points on abelian varieties that are integral with respect to a given non-special divisor. Along the way, we establish a Tate--Voloch type theorem for abelian varieties over completions of global function fields, which allows us to obtain a logarithmic equidistribution result for Galois orbits of torsion points.</description>

      <title>Unimodular lattices of rank 29 and related even genera of small determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the unimodular Euclidean integral lattices of rank 29 by developing an elementary, yet very efficient, inductive method. As an application, we determine the isometry classes of even lattices of rank at most 28 and prime (half-)determinant at most 7. We also provide new isometry invariants allowing for independent verification of the completeness of our lists, and we give conceptual explanations of some unique orbit phenomena discovered during our computations. Some of the genera classified here are orders of magnitude larger than any genus previously classified. In a forthcoming companion paper, we use these computations to study the cohomology of GL_n(Z).</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to consider the extensibility of the Diophantine triple $\{2,b,c\}$, where $2&lt;b&lt;c$, and to prove that such a set cannot be extended to an irregular Diophantine quadruple. We succeed in that for some families of $c$'s (depending on $b$). As corollary, for example, we prove that for $b/2-1$ prime, all Diophantine quadruples $\{2,b,c,d\}$ with $2&lt;b&lt;c&lt;d$ are regular.</description>

      <title>U-Bit Collapse in Arnault Composites:Probing the Boundary of Strong Lucas Pseudoprimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational study of 200 composite integers of approximately 350 bits, engineered using the Arnault framework to pass all Miller-Rabin tests up to base 11. Generated at a rate of approximately 20 per hour from a high-throughput construction process producing ~7,700 Carmichael numbers per minute, all samples fail the strong Lucas probable prime test. We introduce the U-bit collapse metric delta = log_2(n) - log_2(U_d mod n) to quantify deviation from the expected uniform distribution of Lucas sequence terms. Analysis reveals minimal collapse values: mean delta = 1.61 bits, median delta = 1.0 bits, maximum delta = 8 bits, with 26% showing no measurable collapse. We analyze correlations with prime residue classes modulo 35, Arnault construction parameters (k,M), and composite bit-sizes. Our results demonstrate that composites engineered for Miller-Rabin resistance exhibit negligible Lucas sequence degeneracy, providing strong empirical evidence for the statistical independence of these two primality test components and supporting the continued robustness of Baillie-PSW-type tests.</description>

      <title>The most concise recurrence formula for the sums of integer powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For integers $n,k \geq 1$, let $S_k(n)$ denote the power sum $1^k +2^k + \cdots + n^k$. In this note, we first recall the minimal recurrence relation connecting $S_k(n)$ and $S_{k-1}(n)$ established by Abramovich (1973). We then discuss an odd algorithm to determine the coefficients of the power sum polynomial $S_k(n)$ in terms of the coefficients of $S_{k-1}(n)$ (see, e.g., Bloom (1993) and Owens (1992)). Moreover, we bring to light an explicit relationship between $S_k(n)$ and $S_{k+1}(n)$ put forward by Budin and Cantor (1972). We conclude that these procedures (including the integration formula expressing $S_k(n)$ in terms of $S_{k-1}(n)$) all constitute equivalent methods to determine $S_k(n)$ starting from $S_{k-1}(n)$. In addition, as a by-product, we provide a determinantal formula for the Bernoulli numbers involving the binomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>On the Wedderburn decomposition of the total ring of quotients of certain Iwasawa algebras II</title>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal G\simeq H\rtimes\Gamma$ be the semidirect product of a finite group $H$ and $\Gamma\simeq\mathbb Z_p$. Let $ F/\mathbb Q_p$ be a finite extension with ring of integers $\mathcal O_F$. Then the total ring of quotients $\mathcal Q^F(\mathcal G)$ of the completed group ring $\mathcal O_F[[\mathcal G]]$ is semisimple artinian. We determine its Wedderburn decomposition in full generality in terms of the Wedderburn decomposition of the group ring $ F[H]$. Such a description was previously available only for those simple components for which a certain associated field extension is totally ramified.</description>

      <title>Large point-line matchings and small Nikodym sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any integer $d \geq 2$ and prime power $q$, we construct unexpectedly large induced matchings in the point-line incidence graph of $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$ by leveraging a new connection with the Furstenberg-S\'ark\"ozy problem from arithmetic combinatorics. In particular, we significantly improve the previously well-known baselines when $q$ is prime, showing that $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}$ contains matchings of size $q^{1.233}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$ contains matchings of size $q^{d-o_{d}(1)}$.
  These results and their proofs have several applications. First, we also obtain new constructions for finite field Nikodym sets in dimension $d \geq 2$, improving recent results of Tao by polynomial factors. For example, when $q$ is prime, we show the existence of Nikodym sets in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$ of size $q^d - q^{d - o_d(1)}$. Second, we construct a new minimal blocking set in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, solving a longstanding problem in finite geometry. Third, we obtain new constructions for the minimal distance problem (in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and also in higher dimensions), improving a recent result of Logunov-Zakharov.
  We also obtain analogous results for general finite fields with large characteristics. In particular, in one of our constructions we introduce a new special set of points inside the norm hypersurface in $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$, which directly generalizes the classical Hermitian unital and which may be of independent interest for applications.</description>

Abstract: We study obstructed deformation problems for two-dimensional residual Galois representations arising from weight~$2$ newforms of level~$N$. Using Poitou-Tate duality, we isolate local and global sources of obstructions and give concrete criteria for when they occur.

      <title>Algebraic power series and their automatic complexity modulo prime powers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Christol and, independently, Denef and Lipshitz showed that an algebraic sequence of $p$-adic integers (or integers) is $p$-automatic when reduced modulo $p^\alpha$. Previously, the best known bound on the minimal automaton size for such a sequence was doubly exponential in $\alpha$. Under mild conditions, we improve this bound to the order of $p^{\alpha^3 h d}$, where $h$ and $d$ are the height and degree of the minimal annihilating polynomial modulo $p$. We achieve this bound by showing that all states in the automaton are naturally represented in a new numeration system. This significantly restricts the set of possible states. Since our approach embeds algebraic sequences as diagonals of rational functions, we also obtain bounds more generally for diagonals of multivariate rational functions.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the average size of a mixed character sum $$\sum_{1\le n \le x} \chi(n) e(n\theta) w(n/x)$$ (for a suitable smooth function $w$) is on the order of $\sqrt{x}$ for all irrational real $\theta$ satisfying a weak Diophantine condition, where $\chi$ is drawn from the family of Dirichlet characters modulo a large prime $r$ and where $x\le r$. In contrast, it was proved by Harper that the average size is $o(\sqrt{x})$ for rational $\theta$. Certain quadratic Diophantine equations play a key role in the present paper.</description>

      <title>On the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture over function fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field and $X$ a smooth projective variety over $k$. When $k$ is a number field, the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture relates the ranks of the Chow groups of $X$ to the order of vanishing of certain $L$-functions. We consider the same conjecture when $k$ is a global function field, and give a criterion for the conjecture to hold for $X$, extending an earlier result of Jannsen. As an application, we provide a new proof of a theorem of Geisser connecting the Tate conjecture over finite fields and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture over function fields. We then prove the Tate conjecture for a product of a smooth projective curve with a power of a CM elliptic curve over any finitely generated field, and thus deduce special cases of the Beilinson--Bloch conjecture. In the process we obtain a conditional answer to a question of Moonen on the Chow groups of powers of ordinary CM elliptic curves over arbitrary fields.</description>

      <title>Log-free bounds on exponential sums over primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish completely log-free bounds for exponential sums over the primes and the M\"{o}bius function. Let $0&lt;\eta \leq 1/10$, and suppose $\alpha = a/q + \delta/x$, with $(a,q)=1$ and $|\delta| \leq x^{1/5 + \eta}/q$, and set $\delta_0 = \max(1, |\delta|/4)$. For $x \geq x_0(\eta)$ sufficiently large, we show that: \begin{equation*} \Biggl| \sum_{n \leq x} \Lambda(n) e(n\alpha) \Biggr| \leq \frac{q}{\varphi(q)} \frac{\mathscr{F}_{\eta}\bigl( \frac{\log \delta_0 q}{\log x}, \frac{\log^+ \delta_0/q}{\log x} \bigr) \cdot x }{\sqrt{\delta_0 q}} \ \text{ and } \ \Biggl| \sum_{n \leq x} \mu(n) e(n\alpha) \Biggr| \leq \frac{\mathscr{G}_{\eta}\bigl( \frac{\log \delta_0 q}{\log x}, \frac{\log^+ \delta_0/q}{\log x} \bigr) \cdot x}{\sqrt{\delta_0 \varphi(q)}}, \end{equation*} for all $1 \leq q \leq x^{2/5 - \eta}$, where $\log^+ z = \max(\log z, 0)$, and the functions $\mathscr{F}_{\eta}$ and $\mathscr{G}_{\eta}$ are explicitly determined, taking small to moderate values. These bounds improve substantially upon the existing results - particularly with respect to the permissible ranges of $q$, $\delta$ in which log-free bounds are known to hold and potentially with respect to asymptotic functions $\mathscr{F}_{\eta}$ and $\mathscr{G}_{\eta}$ as well. Moreover, the range $1 \leq q \leq x^{2/5 - \eta}$ is essentially the best possible we can expect. The main innovation is a sieve-weighted version of Vaughan's identity (Lemma 2.1), which is effectively log-free. We employ several ideas and results from the pioneering work of Helfgott, and particularly, they play a central role in ensuring the log-freeness of the type-I contribution. Also, like in his work, these bounds improve as $\delta$ increases.</description>

      <title>Real zeros of $L'(s, \chi_d)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1990, Baker and Montgomery conjectured that $L'(s,\chi_d)$ has $\asymp \log\log |d|$ real zeros in the interval $[1/2,1]$ for almost all fundamental discriminants $d$. The study of these zeros was motivated by their connection to real zeros of Fekete polynomials and to sign changes of the character sums $\sum_{n\leq x}\chi_d(n)$. Recent work of Klurman, Lamzouri, and Munsch shows that the number of such zeros is $\gg (\log\log |d|)/(\log\log\log\log |d|)$ for almost all $d$, thereby establishing the conjectured lower bound up to the factor $\log\log\log\log |d|$. In this paper, we prove that for almost all fundamental discriminants $d$, $L'(s,\chi_d)$ has at most $(\log\log |d|)(\log\log\log |d|)$ real zeros in $[1/2,1]$, thus resolving the Baker-Montgomery conjecture up to a factor of $\log\log\log |d|$. We also give a quantitative upper bound on the exceptional set of discriminants. Furthermore, we show, conditionally on certain natural assumptions, that $100\%$ of these zeros lie away from $1/2$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the d'Arcais Numbers at Small $k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The d'Arcais numbers are the triangular array $\{A(2,n,k)\, :\, n=0,1,\dots,\, k=0,\dots,n\}$, such that $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{n} A(2,n,k) x^k z^n/n! = ((z;z)_{\infty})^{-x}$. The infinite $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q^n)$. Holding $k$ fixed and considering large $n$, we note that the ratio $k! A(2,n,k)/n!$ is asymptotic to $C(k) \sigma_{2k-1}(n)/n^k$ where the divisor sum function is $\sigma_p(n) = \sum_{d|n} d^p$ and $C(k) = (\zeta(2))^k/(\Gamma(k) \zeta(2k))$. This is a slightly generalized version of one of Ramanujan's formulas from his paper, ``On Certain Arithmetical Functions," and it is an immediate consequence of the more recent article of Oliver, Shreshta and Thorne. Heim and Neuhauser made a conjecture, that $A(2,n,k)/A(2,n,k-1)$ is greater than or equal to $A(2,n,k+1)/A(2,n,k)$, for $k=2,3,\dots$ and all $n$. The conjecture is false for $k=2$, and it is true for $k=3,4,\dots$ when $n$ is sufficiently large. We consider the Hardy-Ramanujan circle method as a heuristic step.</description>

      <title>Completely Additive Height Functions: Profile Laws, Matula Bounds, and Inverse Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The height $H(n)$ of $n$ is the least integer $i$ such that the $i$-th iterate of Euler's totient function $\varphi^{(i)}(n)$ equals $1$. H. N. Shapiro showed that this $H$ is almost completely additive. Building on the fact that this function can be modified to yield a completely additive function, we establish a general correspondence: to every multi-partition structure there corresponds a completely additive function. In this paper, a \emph{height function} is a completely additive map $H:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}_0$ with $H(1)=0$ whose prime fibres $\{p:\,H(p)=k\}$ are finite for every $k\ge1$. Writing \[ \pi_k=\#\{p:\,H(p)=k\},\qquad N_k=\#\{n:\,H(n)=k\}, \] complete additivity forces the identity \[ \sum_{k\ge0}N_k q^k \;=\; \prod_{j\ge1}(1-q^j)^{-\pi_j}. \] Thus, the prime--height profile $(\pi_k)$ canonically determines the height multiplicities $(N_k)$, linking to the asymptotic theory of weighted partitions. We introduce a broad class of iteratively defined heights on primes, encompassing Matula-type heights (encoding rooted trees) and Shapiro-type totient heights, and show they extend to genuine height functions. In the Matula case this yields a purely number-theoretic proof of the classical extremal bounds for minimal and maximal Matula numbers, answering a question of Gutman and Ivi\'c without recourse to graph theory. Using Meinardus' theorem we prove an \emph{inverse-growth} principle in the polynomial regime: if $\Pi(x)=\sum_{j\le x}\pi_j \sim (C/\alpha)x^\alpha$, then $\log N_k$ satisfies a stretched-exponential law with an explicit constant, and conversely under a standard Tauberian hypothesis. We further derive average-order consequences in this regime for a canonical sequential realization of a given profile. Finally, we briefly discuss behavior beyond the polynomial setting, with computations in the Shapiro case suggesting substantially richer phenomena.</description>

      <title>Prismatic Kunz's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove "prismatic Kunz's theorem" which states that a complete Noetherian local ring $R$ of residue characteristic $p$ is a regular local ring if and only if the Frobenius lift on a prismatic complex of (a derived enhancement of) $R$ over a specific prism $(A, I)$ is faithfully flat. This generalizes classical Kunz's theorem from the perspective of extending the "Frobenius map" to mixed characteristic rings. Our approach involves studying the deformation problem of the "regularity" of prisms and demonstrating the faithful flatness of the structure map of the prismatic complex.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Diophantine approximation and some applications in harmonic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12826v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a new family of sets based on Diophantine approximation in the Euclidean space, and consider their applications in several problems in harmonic analysis.
  Our first application is on the Hausdorff dimension of our sets. We show a recent result of Ren and Wang on the ABC sum-product problem is sharp. Higher dimensional cases and the relation to orthogonal projections are also discussed. Some conjectures are proposed.
  In addition to Hausdorff dimension, we also consider Fourier dimension. For every $0\leq t\leq s\leq 1$, we are able to construct a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that has Hausdorff dimension $s$ and Fourier dimension $t$, together with a measure $\mu$ that captures both dimensions, i.e.,
  $$\mu(B(x,r))\lesssim_\epsilon r^{s-\epsilon}
  \ \text{and} \ |\hat{\mu}(\xi)|\lesssim_\epsilon |\xi|^{-t/2 +\epsilon}, \ \forall\,\epsilon&gt;0.$$
  It is fundamental but the very first such result in the literature.
  Our last result is to provide a viewpoint of the sharpness of Fourier restriction over general measures from dimensions of sets and measures.</description>

      <title>Discrete series representations of quaternionic ${\rm GL}_n(D)$ with symplectic periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a non-Archimedean locally compact field $F$ of odd residue characteristic and characteristic $0$, we prove a conjecture of D. Prasad predicting that, for an integer $n \geq 1$ and a non-split quaternionic $F$-algebra $D$, a discrete series representation of ${\rm GL}_n(D)$ has a symplectic period if and only if it is cuspidal and its Jacquet--Langlands transfer to ${\rm GL}_{2n}(F)$ is non-cuspidal.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic symplectic model for discrete series representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $D$ be the quatenion division algebra over a non-Archimedean local field $F$ of characteristic zero and odd residual characterisitc. We show that an irreducible discrete series representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n(D)$ is $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished only if it is supercuspidal. Here, $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$ is the quaternionic symplectic group. Combined with the recent study on $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished supercuspidal representations by S\'echerre and Stevens, this completes the classification of $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished discrete series representations, as predicted by Dipendra Prasad.</description>
