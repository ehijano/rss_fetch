      <title>Near-field reconstruction of periodic structures with superimposed illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the reconstruction of periodic structures using phase or phaseless near-field measurements. We introduce a novel illumination strategy based on the quasi-periodic condition. Employing the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, we reformulate the scattering problem into a uniquely solvable boundary value problem. Our theoretical analysis shows the advantages of employing a fixed wavenumber superposition illumination strategy and proves that a specific wavenumber interval and fixed direction uniquely determine the grating structure. Numerical results confirm the efficacy of this illumination strategy and reconstruction algorithm, enabling super-resolution imaging from both phase and phaseless near-field measurements.</description>

      <title>Tensor models and group field theories: combinatorics, large $N$ and renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a brief overview of tensor models and group field theories, focusing on their main common features. Both frameworks arose in the context of quantum gravity research, and can be understood as higher-dimensional generalizations of matrix models. We describe the common combinatorial structure underlying such models and review some of the key mathematical results that have been obtained in this area. Of central importance is the discovery of a new family of large $N$ expansions for random tensors. It has driven applications of tensor models to random geometry and non-perturbative local quantum field theory, and has also enabled the development of rigorous renormalization methods for group field theories and other non-local quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'{e} disk as a model of squeezed states of a harmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-mode squeezed states exhibit a direct correspondence with points on the Poincar\'e disk. In this study, we delve into this correspondence and describe the motions of the disk generated by a quadratic Hamiltonian. This provides a geometric representation of squeezed states and their evolution. We discuss applications in bang-bang and adiabatic control problems involving squeezed states.</description>

      <title>Simplifications of Lax pairs for differential-difference equations by gauge transformations and (doubly) modified integrable equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12022v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix differential-difference Lax pairs play an essential role in the theory of integrable nonlinear differential-difference equations. We present sufficient conditions for the possibility to simplify such a Lax pair by matrix gauge transformations. Furthermore, we describe a procedure for such a simplification and present applications of it to constructing new integrable equations connected by (non-invertible) discrete substitutions to known equations with Lax pairs.
  Suppose that one has three (possibly multicomponent) equations $E$, $E_1$, $E_2$, a discrete substitution from $E_1$ to $E$, and a discrete substitution from $E_2$ to $E_1$. Then $E_1$ and $E_2$ can be called a modified version of $E$ and a doubly modified version of $E$, respectively. We demonstrate how the above-mentioned procedure helps (in the considered examples) to construct modified and doubly modified versions of a given equation possessing a Lax pair satisfying certain conditions.
  The considered examples include scalar equations of Itoh-Narita-Bogoyavlensky type and $2$-component equations related to the Toda lattice. Several new integrable equations and discrete substitutions are presented.</description>

      <title>Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics and Field Dislocation Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fully nonlinear (geometric and material) system of Field Dislocation Mechanics is reviewed to establish an exact analogy with the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (ideal MHD) under suitable physically simplifying circumstances. Weak solutions with various conservation properties have been established for ideal MHD recently by Faraco, Lindberg, and Szekelyhidi using the techniques of compensated compactness of Tartar and Murat and convex integration; by the established analogy, these results would seem to be transferable to the idealization of Field Dislocation Mechanics considered. A dual variational principle is designed and discussed for this system of PDE, with the technique transferable to the study of MHD as well.</description>

      <title>Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy Products for NUT class of Black Holes in AdS Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the entropy product rule for Taub-NUT~(Newman-Unti-Tamburino)-de~Sitter black hole~(BH) and Taub-NUT--Anti-de~Sitter BH. We show that the entropy products in terms of both the physical horizons are \emph{mass-independent}. Both \emph{perturbative} approximation and \emph{direct} method have been considered. By introducing the cosmological horizon we show that for Taub-NUT-de~Sitter BH, there exists a mass-independent entropy functional relation in terms of three horizons namely event horizon~(EH), Cauchy horizon~(CH) and cosmological horizon~(CHH) which depends on cosmological parameter~($\Lambda$) and the NUT parameter~($N$). For Taub-NUT-anti-de~Sitter BHs, we determine the mass-independent entropy functional relations in terms of two physical horizons~(namely EH and CH) which depends on only NUT parameter. Some-times some complicated functions of EH entropy and CH entropy are also strictly mass-independent. This is plausible only due to the new formalism developed in~\cite{wu}~[Phys. Rev. D 100, 101501(R)~(2019)] for NUT class of BHs. The formalism states that a generic four-dimensional Taub-NUT spacetime should be described completely in terms of three or four different types of thermodynamic hairs. They could be defined as the Komar mass~($M=m$), the angular momentum~($J_{n}=mn$), the gravitomagnetic charge ($N=n$), the dual~(magnetic) mass $(\tilde{M}=n)$. Finally, we could say that this universality is mainly due to the presence of \emph{new conserved charges $J_{N}=MN$} which is closely analogue to the Kerr-like angular momentum $J=aM$.</description>

      <title>Pointwise two-point function estimates and a non-pertubative proof of mean-field critical behaviour for long-range percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, we connect each pair of distinct points $x$ and $y$ by an edge independently at random with probability $1-\exp(-\beta\|x-y\|^{-d-\alpha})$, where $\alpha&gt;0$ is fixed and $\beta\geq 0$ is a parameter. In a previous paper, we proved that if $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$ then the critical two-point function satisfies the spatially averaged upper bound \[ \frac{1}{r^d}\sum_{x\in [-r,r]^d} \mathbb{P}_{\beta_c}(0\leftrightarrow x) \preceq r^{-d+\alpha} \] for every $r\geq 1$. This upper bound is believed to be sharp for values of $\alpha$ strictly below the crossover value $\alpha_c(d)$, and a matching lower bound for $\alpha&lt;1$ was proven by B\"aumler and Berger (AIHP 2022). In this paper, we prove pointwise upper and lower bounds of the same order under the same assumption that $\alpha&lt;1$. We also prove analogous two-sided pointwise estimates on the slightly subcritical two-point function under the same hypotheses, interpolating between $\| x \|^{-d+\alpha}$ decay below the correlation length and $\| x \|^{-d-\alpha}$ decay above the correlation length. In dimensions $d=1,2,3$, we deduce that the triangle condition holds under the minimal assumption that $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d/3$. While this result had previously been established under additional perturbative assumptions using the lace expansion, our proof is completely non-perturbative and does not rely on the lace expansion in any way. In dimensions $1$ and $2$ our results also treat the marginal case $\alpha=d/3$, implying that the triangle diagram diverges at most logarithmically and hence that mean-field critical behaviour holds to within polylogarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the spherically symmetric solution to an inflow problem for an isentropic model of compressible viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an inflow problem for the multi-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid under consideration occupies the exterior domain of unit ball, $\Omega=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\,\vert\, |x|\ge 1\}$, and a constant stream of mass is flowing into the domain from the boundary $\partial\Omega=\{|x|=1\}$. The existence and uniqueness of a spherically symmetric stationary solution, denoted as $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$, is first proved by I. Hashimoto and A. Matsumura in 2021. In this paper, we show that either $\tilde{\rho}$ is monotone increasing or $\tilde{\rho}$ attains a unique global minimum, and this is classified by the boundary condition of density. Moreover, we also derive a set of decay rates for $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ which allows us to prove the long time stability of $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ under small initial perturbations using the energy method. The main difficulty for this is the boundary terms that appears in the a-priori estimates. We resolve this issue by reformulating the problem in Lagrangian coordinate system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies the quantum action for the five-dimensional real $\phi^3$-theory in the case of a general formulation using the background field method. The three-loop renormalization is performed with the usage of a cutoff regularization in the coordinate representation. The explicit form of the first three coefficients for the renormalization constants is presented. The absence of non-local singular contributions and partial results for the fourth correction are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a recipe for B-model computation of genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau and Fano Projective Hypersurfaces. Our formalism can be applied equally to both Calabi-Yau and Fano cases. In Calabi-Yau case, drastic cancellation of terms used in our formalism occurs and it results in another representation of BCOV-Zinger formula for projective Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Wiener-Hopf solution of the free energy TBA problem and instanton sectors in the O(3) sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbation theory in asymptotically free quantum field theories is asymptotic. The factorially growing perturbative coefficients carry information about non-perturbative corrections, which can be related to renormalons and instantons. Using the Wiener-Hopf technique we determine the full analytic solution for the free energy density in the two dimensional $O(N)$ sigma models. For $N&gt;3$ there are no instantons, and we found that the perturbative series carries all the information about the non-perturbative corrections. However, in the $O(3)$ case, we identify several non-perturbative sectors that are not related to the asymptotics of the perturbative series. The number of sectors depends on the observables: for the ground-state energy density we identify three sectors, which we attribute to instantons. For the free energy density in the running perturbative coupling we found infinitely many sectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a locality preserving unitary mapping from fermions to qubits on a 2D torus whilst accounting for the mapping of topological sectors. Extending the work of Shukla et al. [Phys. Rev. B 101, 155105], an explicit intertwiner is constructed in the form of a projected entangled pair operator. By encoding the information about the charge sectors (and if applicable the twisted boundary conditions) in ancillary qubit(s), the intertwiner becomes a unitary operator which exchanges boundary conditions and charge sectors.</description>

      <title>$(\log t)^\frac{2}{3}$-superdiffusivity for the 2d stochastic Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stochastic Burgers equation was introduced in [H. van Beijeren, R. Kutner and H. Spohn, Excess noise for driven diffusive systems, PRL, 1985] as a continuous approximation of the fluctuations of the asymmetric simple exclusion process. It is formally given by $$\partial_t\eta =\frac{1}{2}\Delta\eta+ \mathfrak w\cdot\nabla(\eta^2) + \nabla\cdot\xi,$$ where $\xi$ is $d$-dimensional space time white noise and $\mathfrak w$ is a fixed non-zero vector. In the critical dimension $d=2$ at stationarity, we show that this system exhibits superdiffusve behaviour: more specifically, its bulk diffusion coefficient behaves like $(\log t)^\frac23$, in a Tauberian sense, up to $\log\log\log t$ corrections. This confirms a prediction made in the physics literature and complements [G. Cannizzarro, M. Gubinelli, F. Toninelli, Gaussian Fluctuations for the stochastic Burgers equation in dimension $d\geq 2$, CMP, 2024], where the same equation was studied in the weak-coupling regime. Furthermore this model can be seen as a continuous analogue to [H.T. Yau, $(\log t)^\frac{2}{3}$ law of the two dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process, Annals of Mathematics, 2004].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of establishing the existence of the Ground States for the subcritical focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger energy on a domain made of a line and a plane intersecting at a point. The problem is physically motivated by the experimental realization of hybrid traps for Bose-Einstein Condensates, that are able to concentrate the system on structures close to the domain we consider. In fact, such a domain approximates the trap as the temperature approaches the absolute zero. The spirit of the paper is mainly pedagogical, so we focus on the formulation of the problem and on the explanation of the result, giving references for the technical points and for the proofs.</description>

      <title>Matroidal polynomials, their singularities, and applications to Feynman diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a matroid or flag of matroids we introduce several broad classes of polynomials satisfying Deletion-Contraction identities, and study their singularities.
  There are three main families of polynomials captured by our approach: matroidal polynomials on a matroid (including matroid basis polynomials, configuration polynomials, Tutte polynomials); flag matroidal polynomials on a flag matroid; and Feynman integrands. The last class includes under general kinematics the inhomogeneous Feynman diagram polynomials which naturally arise in the Lee--Pomeransky form of the Feynman integral attached to a Feynman diagram.
  Assuming that the primary underlying matroid is connected and of positive rank (and in the flag case, has rank at least two), we show: a) in positive characteristic, homogeneous matroidal polynomials are strongly $F$-regular; b) over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, the associated jet schemes of (flag) matroidal polynomials as well as those of Feynman integrands are irreducible. Consequently, all these polynomials have rational singularities (or are smooth).</description>

Abstract: Metastability thresholds lie at the heart of bootstrap percolation theory. Yet proving precise lower bounds is notoriously hard. We show that for two of the most classical models, two-neighbour and Frob\"ose, upper bounds are sharp to essentially arbitrary precision, by linking them to their local counterparts.
  In Frob\"ose bootstrap percolation, iteratively, any vertex of the square lattice that is the only healthy vertex of a $1\times1$ square becomes infected and infections never heal. We prove that if vertices are initially infected independently with probability $p\to0$, then with high probability the origin becomes infected after \[\exp\left(\frac{\pi^2}{6p}-\frac{\pi\sqrt{2+\sqrt2}}{\sqrt p}+\frac{O(\log^2(1/p))}{\sqrt[3]p}\right)\] time steps. We achieve this by proposing a new paradigmatic view on bootstrap percolation based on locality. Namely, we show that studying the Frob\"ose model is equivalent in an extremely strong sense to studying its local version. As a result, we completely bypass Holroyd's classical but technical hierarchy method, yielding the first term above and systematically used throughout bootstrap percolation for the last two decades. Instead, the proof features novel links to large deviation theory, eigenvalue perturbations and others.
  We also use the locality viewpoint to resolve the so-called bootstrap percolation paradox. Indeed, we propose and implement an exact (deterministic) algorithm which exponentially outperforms previous Monte Carlo approaches. This allows us to clearly showcase and quantify the slow convergence we prove rigorously.
  The same approach applies, with more extensive computations, to the two-neighbour model, in which vertices are infected when they have at least two infected neighbours and do not recover. We expect it to be applicable to a wider range of models and correspondingly conclude with a number of open problems.</description>

      <title>On the Durdevic approach to quantum principal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit and extend the Durdevic theory of complete calculi on quantum principal bundles. In this setting one naturally obtains a graded Hopf-Galois extension of the higher order calculus and an intrinsic decomposition of degree 1-forms into horizontal and vertical forms. This proposal is appealing, since it is consistently equipped with a canonical braiding and exactness of the Atiyah sequence is guaranteed. Moreover, we provide examples of complete calculi, including the noncommutative 2-torus, the quantum Hopf fibration and differential calculi on crossed product algebras.</description>

      <title>Curvature and Weitzenbock formula for spectral triples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Levi-Civita connection on the noncommutative differential one-forms of a spectral triple $(\B,\H,\D)$, we define the full Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci curvature tensor and scalar curvature. We give a definition of Dirac spectral triples and derive a general Weitzenbock formula for them. We apply these tools to $\theta$-deformations of compact Riemannian manifolds. We show that the Riemann and Ricci tensors transform naturally under $\theta$-deformation, whereas the connection Laplacian, Clifford representation of the curvature and the scalar curvature are all invariant under deformation.</description>

      <title>On average output entropy of a quantum channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe analytical properties of the average output entropy of a quantum channel as a function of a pair (channel, input ensemble). In particular, tight semicontinuity bounds for this function with the rank/energy constraints are obtained by using the modified semicontinuity bounds for the quantum conditional entropy of quantum-classical states and a special approximation technique.
  Several applications are considered. New semicontinuity and continuity bounds for the output Holevo information of a channel as a function of a pair (channel, input ensemble) are obtained. The semicontinuity bound for the entanglement of formation with the rank constraint obtained in [1] is improved.
  In the preliminary part, some results concerning ensembles of quantum states are presented. In particular, a new useful metric on the set of generalized ensembles is proposed and explored. The concept of passive energy of an ensemble introduced here plays an important role in the article.</description>

      <title>Shifted Witten classes and topological recursion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Witten $r$-spin class defines a non-semisimple cohomological field theory. Pandharipande, Pixton and Zvonkine studied two special shifts of the Witten class along two semisimple directions of the associated Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold using the Givental--Teleman reconstruction theorem. We show that the $R$-matrix and the translation of these two specific shifts can be constructed from the solutions of two differential equations that generalise the classical Airy differential equation. Using this, we prove that the descendant intersection theory of the shifted Witten classes satisfies topological recursion on two $1$-parameter families of spectral curves. By taking the limit as the parameter goes to zero for these families of spectral curves, we prove that the descendant intersection theory of the Witten $r$-spin class can be computed by topological recursion on the $r$-Airy spectral curve. We finally show that this proof suffices to deduce Witten's $r$-spin conjecture, already proved by Faber, Shadrin and Zvonkine, which claims that the generating series of $r$-spin intersection numbers is the tau function of the $r$-KdV hierarchy that satisfies the string equation.</description>

Abstract: We propose a specific class of matrices which participate in factorization problems that turn to be equivalent to constant and entwining (non-constant) pentagon, reverse-pentagon or Yang-Baxter maps, expressed in non-commutative variables. In detail, we show that factorizations of order $N=2$ matrices of this specific class are equivalent to the homogeneous normalization map. From order $N=3$ matrices, we obtain an extension of the homogeneous normalization map, as well as novel entwining pentagon, reverse-pentagon and Yang-Baxter maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is the study of the inverse point-source scattering problem, specifically in relation to a certain class of electric potentials. Our research provides a novel uniqueness result for the inverse problem with local data, obtained from the near field pattern. Our work improves the work of Caro and Garcia, who investigated both the direct problem and the inverse problem with global near field data for critically singular and $\delta$-shell potentials. The primary contribution of our research is the introduction of a Runge approximation result for the near field data on the scattering problem which, in combination with an interior regularity argument, enables us to establish a uniqueness result for the inverse problem with local data. Additionaly, we manage to consider a slightly wider class of potentials.</description>

      <title>Glassy word problems: ultraslow relaxation, Hilbert space jamming, and computational complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of local models of dynamics based on ``word problems'' from computer science and group theory, for which we can place rigorous lower bounds on relaxation timescales. These models can be regarded either as random circuit or local Hamiltonian dynamics, and include many familiar examples of constrained dynamics as special cases. The configuration space of these models splits into dynamically disconnected sectors, and for initial states to relax, they must ``work out'' the other states in the sector to which they belong. When this problem has a high time complexity, relaxation is slow. In some of the cases we study, this problem also has high space complexity. When the space complexity is larger than the system size, an unconventional type of jamming transition can occur, whereby a system of a fixed size is not ergodic, but can be made ergodic by appending a large reservoir of sites in a trivial product state. This manifests itself in a new type of Hilbert space fragmentation that we call fragile fragmentation. We present explicit examples where slow relaxation and jamming strongly modify the hydrodynamics of conserved densities. In one example, density modulations of wavevector $q$ exhibit almost no relaxation until times $O(\exp(1/q))$, at which point they abruptly collapse. We also comment on extensions of our results to higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We construct $R$-matrices (with a multidimensional spectral parameter) that include additive as well as non-additive parameters. They satisfy the colored Yang-Baxter equation. The solutions depend on a set of commuting operators. They change with the representation of the latter. The associated Yang-Baxter algebra and the spectrum of the transfer matrix are also studied.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Reducibility of $C^k$ Quasi-Periodic Cocycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an extreme $C^k$ reducibility theorem of quasi-periodic $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ cocycles in the local perturbative region, revealing both the essence of Eliasson [Commun.Math.Phys.1992] and Hou-You [Invent.Math.2012] in respectively the non-resonant and resonant cases. By paralleling further the reducibility process with the almost reducibility, we are able to acquire the least initial regularity as well as the least loss of regularity for the whole KAM iterations. This, in return, makes various spectral applications of quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators wide open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the link between the degree growth of integrable birational mappings of order higher than two and their singularity structures. The higher order mappings we use in this study are all obtained by coupling mappings that are integrable through spectral methods, typically belonging to the QRT family, to a variety of linearisable ones. We show that by judiciously choosing these linearisable mappings, it is possible to obtain higher order mappings that exhibit the maximal degree growth compatible with integrability, i.e. for which the degree grows as a polynomial of order equal to the order of the mapping. In all the cases we analysed, we found that maximal degree growth was associated with the existence of an unconfining singularity pattern. Several cases with submaximal growth but which still possess unconfining singularity patterns are also presented. In many cases the exact degrees of the iterates of the mappings were obtained by applying a method due to Halburd, based on the preimages of specific values that appear in the singularity patterns of the mapping, but we also present some examples where such a calculation appears to be impossible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the explicit bijection between the density of singular values and the density of eigenvalues for bi-unitarily invariant complex random matrix ensembles of finite matrix size we aim at finding the induced probability measure on $j$ eigenvalues and $k$ singular values that we coin $j,k$-point correlation measure. We fully derive all $j,k$-point correlation measures in the simplest cases for matrices of size $n=1$ and $n=2$. For $n&gt;2$, we find a general formula for the $1,1$-point correlation measure. This formula reduces drastically when assuming the singular values are drawn from a polynomial ensemble, yielding an explicit formula in terms of the kernel corresponding to the singular value statistics. These expressions simplify even further when the singular values are drawn from a P\'{o}lya ensemble and extend known results between the eigenvalue and singular value statistics of the corresponding bi-unitarily invariant ensemble.</description>
