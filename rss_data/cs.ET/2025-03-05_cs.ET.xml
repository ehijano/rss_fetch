      <title>Mapping Spiking Neural Networks to Heterogeneous Crossbar Architectures using Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in novel hardware devices and architectures allow Spiking Neural Network evaluation using ultra-low power, mixed-signal, memristor crossbar arrays. As individual network sizes quickly scale beyond the dimensional capabilities of single crossbars, networks must be mapped onto multiple crossbars. Crossbar sizes within modern Memristor Crossbar Architectures are determined predominately not by device technology but by network topology; more, smaller crossbars consume less area thanks to the high structural sparsity found in larger, brain-inspired SNNs. Motivated by continuing increases in SNN sparsity due to improvements in training methods, we propose utilizing heterogeneous crossbar sizes to further reduce area consumption. This approach was previously unachievable as prior compiler studies only explored solutions targeting homogeneous MCAs. Our work improves on the state-of-the-art by providing Integer Linear Programming formulations supporting arbitrarily heterogeneous architectures. By modeling axonal interactions between neurons our methods produce better mappings while removing inhibitive a priori knowledge requirements. We first show a 16.7-27.6% reduction in area consumption for square-crossbar homogeneous architectures. Then, we demonstrate 66.9-72.7% further reduction when using a reasonable configuration of heterogeneous crossbar dimensions. Next, we present a new optimization formulation capable of minimizing the number of inter-crossbar routes. When applied to solutions already near-optimal in area an 11.9-26.4% routing reduction is observed without impacting area consumption. Finally, we present a profile-guided optimization capable of minimizing the number of runtime spikes between crossbars. Compared to the best-area-then-route optimized solutions we observe a further 0.5-14.8% inter-crossbar spike reduction while requiring 1-3 orders of magnitude less solver time.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Enhanced Digital Twin Modeling: Trends, Methods, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twin technology is a transformative innovation driving the digital transformation and intelligent optimization of manufacturing systems. By integrating real-time data with computational models, digital twins enable continuous monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization, effectively bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds. Recent advancements in communication, computing, and control technologies have accelerated the development and adoption of digital twins across various industries. However, significant challenges remain, including limited data for accurate system modeling, inefficiencies in system analysis, and a lack of explainability in the interactions between physical and digital systems. The rise of large language models (LLMs) offers new avenues to address these challenges. LLMs have shown exceptional capabilities across diverse domains, exhibiting strong generalization and emergent abilities that hold great potential for enhancing digital twins. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent developments in LLMs and their applications to digital twin modeling. We propose a unified description-prediction-prescription framework to integrate digital twin modeling technologies and introduce a structured taxonomy to categorize LLM functionalities in these contexts. For each stage of application, we summarize the methodologies, identify key challenges, and explore potential future directions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-enhanced digital twins, we present an LLM-enhanced enterprise digital twin system, which enables automatic modeling and optimization of an enterprise. Finally, we discuss future opportunities and challenges in advancing LLM-enhanced digital twins, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in related fields.</description>

      <title>Weight transport through spike timing for robust local gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In both machine learning and in computational neuroscience, plasticity in functional neural networks is frequently expressed as gradient descent on a cost. Often, this imposes symmetry constraints that are difficult to reconcile with local computation, as is required for biological networks or neuromorphic hardware. For example, wake-sleep learning in networks characterized by Boltzmann distributions builds on the assumption of symmetric connectivity. Similarly, the error backpropagation algorithm is notoriously plagued by the weight transport problem between the representation and the error stream. Existing solutions such as feedback alignment tend to circumvent the problem by deferring to the robustness of these algorithms to weight asymmetry. However, they are known to scale poorly with network size and depth. We introduce spike-based alignment learning (SAL), a complementary learning rule for spiking neural networks, which uses spike timing statistics to extract and correct the asymmetry between effective reciprocal connections. Apart from being spike-based and fully local, our proposed mechanism takes advantage of noise. Based on an interplay between Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity, synapses can thereby recover the true local gradient. This also alleviates discrepancies that arise from neuron and synapse variability -- an omnipresent property of physical neuronal networks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our mechanism using different spiking network models. First, we show how SAL can significantly improve convergence to the target distribution in probabilistic spiking networks as compared to Hebbian plasticity alone. Second, in neuronal hierarchies based on cortical microcircuits, we show how our proposed mechanism effectively enables the alignment of feedback weights to the forward pathway, thus allowing the backpropagation of correct feedback errors.</description>

      <title>Generating Quantum Reservoir State Representations with Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to reservoir computation measurements using random matrices. We do so to motivate how atomic-scale devices could be used for real-world computational applications. Our approach uses random matrices to construct reservoir measurements, introducing a simple, scalable means of generating state representations. In our studies, two reservoirs, a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain and a five-qubit quantum circuit, perform time series prediction and data interpolation. The performance of the measurement technique and current limitations are discussed in detail, along with an exploration of the diversity of measurements provided by the random matrices. In addition, we explore the role of reservoir parameters such as coupling strength and measurement dimension, providing insight into how these learning machines could be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights the use of random matrices to measure simple quantum reservoirs for natural learning devices, and outlines a path forward for improving their performance and experimental realization.</description>

      <title>SocialEyes: Scaling mobile eye-tracking to multi-person social settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06345v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eye movements provide a window into human behaviour, attention, and interaction dynamics. Challenges in real-world, multi-person environments have, however, restrained eye-tracking research predominantly to single-person, in-lab settings. We developed a system to stream, record, and analyse synchronised data from multiple mobile eye-tracking devices during collective viewing experiences (e.g., concerts, films, lectures). We implemented lightweight operator interfaces for real-time-monitoring, remote-troubleshooting, and gaze-projection from individual egocentric perspectives to a common coordinate space for shared gaze analysis. We tested the system in a live concert and a film screening with 30 simultaneous viewers during each of two public events (N=60). We observe precise time-synchronisation between devices measured through recorded clock-offsets, and accurate gaze-projection in challenging dynamic scenes. Our novel analysis metrics and visualizations illustrate the potential of collective eye-tracking data for understanding collaborative behaviour and social interaction. This advancement promotes ecological validity in eye-tracking research and paves the way for innovative interactive tools.</description>

      <title>Exploring Advanced Techniques for Visual Question Answering: A Comprehensive Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) has emerged as a pivotal task in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, requiring models to understand and reason about visual content in response to natural language questions. Analyzing VQA datasets is essential for developing robust models that can handle the complexities of multimodal reasoning. Several approaches have been developed to examine these datasets, each offering distinct perspectives on question diversity, answer distribution, and visual-textual correlations. Despite significant progress, existing VQA models face challenges related to dataset bias, limited model complexity, commonsense reasoning gaps, rigid evaluation methods, and generalization to real world scenarios. This paper offers a detailed study of the original VQA dataset, baseline models and methods along with a comparative study of five advanced VQA models, ABC-CNN, KICNLE, Masked Vision and Language Modeling, BLIP-2, and OFA, each employing distinct methods to address these ongoing challenges.</description>
