      <title>Consumer Segmentation and Participation Drivers in Community-Supported Agriculture: A Choice Experiment and PLS-SEM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the global food system faces increasing challenges from sustainability, climate change, and food security issues, alternative food networks like Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) play an essential role in fostering stronger connections between consumers and producers. However, understanding consumer engagement with CSA is fragmented, particularly in Japan where CSA participation is still emerging. This study aims to identify potential CSA participants in Japan and validate existing theories on CSA participation through a quantitative analysis of 2,484 Japanese consumers. Using choice experiments, Latent Class Analysis, and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, we identified five distinct consumer segments. The "Sustainable Food Seekers" group showed the highest positive utility for CSA, driven primarily by "Food Education and Learning Opportunities" and "Contribution to Environmental and Social Issues." These factors were consistently significant across all segments, suggesting that many Japanese consumers value CSA for its educational and environmental benefits. In contrast, factors related to "Variety of Ingredients" were less influential in determining participation intentions. The findings suggest that promoting CSA in Japan may be most effective by emphasizing its role in environmental and social impact, rather than focusing solely on product attributes like organic certification, which is readily available in supermarkets. This reflects a key distinction between CSA adoption in Japan and in other cultural contexts, where access to organic produce is a primary driver. For "Sustainable Food Seekers," CSA offers a way to contribute to broader societal goals rather than just securing organic products.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models for a standard assessment mapping for sustainable communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to urban sustainability assessment through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline the use of the ISO 37101 framework to automate and standardise the assessment of urban initiatives against the six "sustainability purposes" and twelve "issues" outlined in the standard. The methodology includes the development of a custom prompt based on the standard definitions and its application to two different datasets: 527 projects from the Paris Participatory Budget and 398 activities from the PROBONO Horizon 2020 project. The results show the effectiveness of LLMs in quickly and consistently categorising different urban initiatives according to sustainability criteria. The approach is particularly promising when it comes to breaking down silos in urban planning by providing a holistic view of the impact of projects. The paper discusses the advantages of this method over traditional human-led assessments, including significant time savings and improved consistency. However, it also points out the importance of human expertise in interpreting results and ethical considerations. This study hopefully can contribute to the growing body of work on AI applications in urban planning and provides a novel method for operationalising standardised sustainability frameworks in different urban contexts.</description>

      <title>On the Opportunities of Large Language Models for Programming Process Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing educators and researchers have used programming process data to understand how programs are constructed and what sorts of problems students struggle with. Although such data shows promise for using it for feedback, fully automated programming process feedback systems have still been an under-explored area. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) have yielded additional opportunities for researchers in a wide variety of fields. LLMs are efficient at transforming content from one format to another, leveraging the body of knowledge they have been trained with in the process. In this article, we discuss opportunities of using LLMs for analyzing programming process data. To complement our discussion, we outline a case study where we have leveraged LLMs for automatically summarizing the programming process and for creating formative feedback on the programming process. Overall, our discussion and findings highlight that the computing education research and practice community is again one step closer to automating formative programming process-focused feedback.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Bias in Large Language Models during Role-Playing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational in modern language-driven applications, profoundly influencing daily life. A critical technique in leveraging their potential is role-playing, where LLMs simulate diverse roles to enhance their real-world utility. However, while research has highlighted the presence of social biases in LLM outputs, it remains unclear whether and to what extent these biases emerge during role-playing scenarios. In this paper, we introduce BiasLens, a fairness testing framework designed to systematically expose biases in LLMs during role-playing. Our approach uses LLMs to generate 550 social roles across a comprehensive set of 11 demographic attributes, producing 33,000 role-specific questions targeting various forms of bias. These questions, spanning Yes/No, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats, are designed to prompt LLMs to adopt specific roles and respond accordingly. We employ a combination of rule-based and LLM-based strategies to identify biased responses, rigorously validated through human evaluation. Using the generated questions as the benchmark, we conduct extensive evaluations of six advanced LLMs released by OpenAI, Mistral AI, Meta, Alibaba, and DeepSeek. Our benchmark reveals 72,716 biased responses across the studied LLMs, with individual models yielding between 7,754 and 16,963 biased responses, underscoring the prevalence of bias in role-playing contexts. To support future research, we have publicly released the benchmark, along with all scripts and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and Agency in Education: A Critical Scoping Review and Thematic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This scoping review examines the relationship between Generative AI (GenAI) and agency in education, analyzing the literature available through the lens of Critical Digital Pedagogy. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we collected 10 studies from academic databases focusing on both learner and teacher agency in GenAI-enabled environments. We conducted an AI-supported hybrid thematic analysis that revealed three key themes: Control in Digital Spaces, Variable Engagement and Access, and Changing Notions of Agency.
  The findings suggest that while GenAI may enhance learner agency through personalization and support, it also risks exacerbating educational inequalities and diminishing learner autonomy in certain contexts. This review highlights gaps in the current research on GenAI's impact on agency. These findings have implications for educational policy and practice, suggesting the need for frameworks that promote equitable access while preserving learner agency in GenAI-enhanced educational environments.</description>

      <title>Community-Based Resilience: Digital Technologies for Living within Planetary Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The world faces increasing challenges related to climate change and shifting geopolitical situations. The COVID 19 pandemic clearly illustrated the need for resilience not just within civil engineering but also within social and economic systems. While significant work has focused on applying digital technologies to solve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), less effort has been placed on the ability of digital technologies to enable humanity to continue to live effectively within the Planetary Boundaries. Within this paper, we perform a Systematic Literature Review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. Nine hundred and twenty papers were reviewed. Based on the Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we have outlined specific methods to apply digital technologies to enable humanity to live within PB. Critical capabilities provided by digital technologies, specifically the ability to create dynamic networks for enabling humanity to live within PB, are identified and illustrated in food and agriculture. The paper closes with a brief assessment of the concept's applicability to other Critical National Infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Potential of Global Human Expertise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving societal problems on a global scale requires the collection and processing of ideas and methods from diverse sets of international experts. As the number and diversity of human experts increase, so does the likelihood that elements in this collective knowledge can be combined and refined to discover novel and better solutions. However, it is difficult to identify, combine, and refine complementary information in an increasingly large and diverse knowledge base. This paper argues that artificial intelligence (AI) can play a crucial role in this process. An evolutionary AI framework, termed RHEA, fills this role by distilling knowledge from diverse models created by human experts into equivalent neural networks, which are then recombined and refined in a population-based search. The framework was implemented in a formal synthetic domain, demonstrating that it is transparent and systematic. It was then applied to the results of the XPRIZE Pandemic Response Challenge, in which over 100 teams of experts across 23 countries submitted models based on diverse methodologies to predict COVID-19 cases and suggest non-pharmaceutical intervention policies for 235 nations, states, and regions across the globe. Building upon this expert knowledge, by recombining and refining the 169 resulting policy suggestion models, RHEA discovered a broader and more effective set of policies than either AI or human experts alone, as evaluated based on real-world data. The results thus suggest that AI can play a crucial role in realizing the potential of human expertise in global problem-solving.</description>

      <title>What Makes An Expert? Reviewing How ML Researchers Define "Expert"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human experts are often engaged in the development of machine learning systems to collect and validate data, consult on algorithm development, and evaluate system performance. At the same time, who counts as an 'expert' and what constitutes 'expertise' is not always explicitly defined. In this work, we review 112 academic publications that explicitly reference 'expert' and 'expertise' and that describe the development of machine learning (ML) systems to survey how expertise is characterized and the role experts play. We find that expertise is often undefined and forms of knowledge outside of formal education and professional certification are rarely sought, which has implications for the kinds of knowledge that are recognized and legitimized in ML development. Moreover, we find that expert knowledge tends to be utilized in ways focused on mining textbook knowledge, such as through data annotation. We discuss the ways experts are engaged in ML development in relation to deskilling, the social construction of expertise, and implications for responsible AI development. We point to a need for reflection and specificity in justifications of domain expert engagement, both as a matter of documentation and reproducibility, as well as a matter of broadening the range of recognized expertise.</description>

      <title>Development of a Web-based Research Consortium Database Management System: Advancing Data-driven and Knowledge-based Project Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Central Luzon Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development Consortium (CLAARRDEC), comprising 29 member institutions, faces challenges in effectively monitoring and evaluating their R&amp;D activities. To address these challenges, they seek to harness digital technology for data management and real-time monitoring. This paper presents the development of a web-based database and real-time monitoring system aimed at enhancing data collection, storage, retrieval, and utilization within the consortium. The system consists of two key components: i) a data management module, designed to facilitate project data collection from member institutions, and ii) a real-time monitoring module for report generation and analytics at the CLAARRDEC main office. Successful deployment of the system not only fosters information sharing, collaboration, and informed decision-making but also empowers member institutions to monitor their own R&amp;D engagements. Furthermore, the system's potential extends beyond CLAARRDEC, as it could be utilized by other research consortia in the Philippines.</description>

      <title>A graph-based approach to extracting narrative signals from public discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narratives are key interpretative devices by which humans make sense of political reality. As the significance of narratives for understanding current societal issues such as polarization and misinformation becomes increasingly evident, there is a growing demand for methods that support their empirical analysis. To this end, we propose a graph-based formalism and machine-guided method for extracting, representing, and analyzing selected narrative signals from digital textual corpora, based on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). The formalism and method introduced here specifically cater to the study of political narratives that figure in texts from digital media such as archived political speeches, social media posts, political manifestos and transcripts of parliamentary debates. We conceptualize these political narratives as a type of ontological narratives: stories by which actors position themselves as political beings, and which are akin to political worldviews in which actors present their normative vision of the world, or aspects thereof. We approach the study of such political narratives as a problem of information retrieval: starting from a textual corpus, we first extract a graph-like representation of the meaning of each sentence in the corpus using AMR. Drawing on transferable concepts from narratology, we then apply a set of heuristics to filter these graphs for representations of 1) actors, 2) the events in which these actors figure, and 3) traces of the perspectivization of these events. We approach these references to actors, events, and instances of perspectivization as core narrative signals that initiate a further analysis by alluding to larger political narratives. By means of a case study of State of the European Union addresses, we demonstrate how the formalism can be used to inductively surface signals of political narratives from public discourse.</description>

      <title>Flexible Fairness-Aware Learning via Inverse Conditional Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equalized odds, as a popular notion of algorithmic fairness, aims to ensure that sensitive variables, such as race and gender, do not unfairly influence the algorithm's prediction when conditioning on the true outcome. Despite rapid advancements, current research primarily focuses on equalized odds violations caused by a single sensitive attribute, leaving the challenge of simultaneously accounting for multiple attributes largely unaddressed. We bridge this gap by introducing an in-processing fairness-aware learning approach, FairICP, which integrates adversarial learning with a novel inverse conditional permutation scheme. FairICP offers a theoretically justified, flexible, and efficient scheme to promote equalized odds under fairness conditions described by complex and multidimensional sensitive attributes. The efficacy and adaptability of our method are demonstrated through both simulation studies and empirical analyses of real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Decision-Making Behavior Evaluation Framework for LLMs under Uncertain Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When making decisions under uncertainty, individuals often deviate from rational behavior, which can be evaluated across three dimensions: risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion. Given the widespread use of large language models (LLMs) in decision-making processes, it is crucial to assess whether their behavior aligns with human norms and ethical expectations or exhibits potential biases. Several empirical studies have investigated the rationality and social behavior performance of LLMs, yet their internal decision-making tendencies and capabilities remain inadequately understood. This paper proposes a framework, grounded in behavioral economics, to evaluate the decision-making behaviors of LLMs. Through a multiple-choice-list experiment, we estimate the degree of risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion in a context-free setting for three commercial LLMs: ChatGPT-4.0-Turbo, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.0-pro. Our results reveal that LLMs generally exhibit patterns similar to humans, such as risk aversion and loss aversion, with a tendency to overweight small probabilities. However, there are significant variations in the degree to which these behaviors are expressed across different LLMs. We also explore their behavior when embedded with socio-demographic features, uncovering significant disparities. For instance, when modeled with attributes of sexual minority groups or physical disabilities, Claude-3-Opus displays increased risk aversion, leading to more conservative choices. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications and potential biases in deploying LLMs in decision-making scenarios. Therefore, this study advocates for developing standards and guidelines to ensure that LLMs operate within ethical boundaries while enhancing their utility in complex decision-making environments.</description>

Abstract: Recommender systems serve the dual purpose of presenting relevant content to users and helping content creators reach their target audience. The dual nature of these systems naturally influences both users and creators: users' preferences are affected by the items they are recommended, while creators may be incentivized to alter their content to attract more users. We define a model, called user-creator feature dynamics, to capture the dual influence of recommender systems. We prove that a recommender system with dual influence is guaranteed to polarize, causing diversity loss in the system. We then investigate, both theoretically and empirically, approaches for mitigating polarization and promoting diversity in recommender systems. Unexpectedly, we find that common diversity-promoting approaches do not work in the presence of dual influence, while relevancy-optimizing methods like top-$k$ truncation can prevent polarization and improve diversity of the system.</description>

      <title>Still More Shades of Null: An Evaluation Suite for Responsible Missing Value Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data missingness is a practical challenge of sustained interest to the scientific community. In this paper, we present Shades-of-Null, an evaluation suite for responsible missing value imputation. Our work is novel in two ways (i) we model realistic and socially-salient missingness scenarios that go beyond Rubin's classic Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing At Random (MAR) and Missing Not At Random (MNAR) settings, to include multi-mechanism missingness (when different missingness patterns co-exist in the data) and missingness shift (when the missingness mechanism changes between training and test) (ii) we evaluate imputers holistically, based on imputation quality, as well as on the predictive performance, fairness and stability of the models that are trained and tested on the data post-imputation.
  We use Shades-of-Null to conduct a large-scale empirical study involving 23,940 experimental pipelines, and find that while there is no single best-performing imputation approach for all missingness types, interesting trade-offs arise between predictive performance, fairness and stability, based on the combination of missingness scenario, imputer choice, and the architecture of the predictive model. We make Shades-of-Null publicly available, to enable researchers to rigorously evaluate missing value imputation methods on a wide range of metrics in plausible and socially meaningful scenarios.</description>

      <title>Plurals: A System for Guiding LLMs Via Simulated Social Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17213v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent debates raised concerns that language models may favor certain viewpoints. But what if the solution is not to aim for a 'view from nowhere' but rather to leverage different viewpoints? We introduce Plurals, a system and Python library for pluralistic AI deliberation. Plurals consists of Agents (LLMs, optionally with personas) which deliberate within customizable Structures, with Moderators overseeing deliberation. Plurals is a generator of simulated social ensembles. Plurals integrates with government datasets to create nationally representative personas, includes deliberation templates inspired by democratic deliberation theory, and allows users to customize both information-sharing structures and deliberation behavior within Structures. Six case studies demonstrate fidelity to theoretical constructs and efficacy. Three randomized experiments show simulated focus groups produced output resonant with an online sample of the relevant audiences (chosen over zero-shot generation in 75% of trials). Plurals is both a paradigm and a concrete system for pluralistic AI. The Plurals library is available at https://github.com/josh-ashkinaze/plurals and will be continually updated.</description>
