      <title>The final size and critical times of an SIVR epidemic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the impact of vaccination, we consider a SIVR (susceptible-infected-vaccinated-recovered) model which combines impulsive vaccination into the classical SIR model. The final size is firstly defined and estimated, and then the peak value and peak time are considered. Finally, the critical times for a given infected number is studied, and it can be used to define and estimate the stopping time. Our results extend those for the well-understood SIR model.</description>

      <title>Modelling the spread of two successive SIR epidemics on a configuration model network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stochastic model for two successive SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) epidemics in the same network structured population. Individuals infected during the first epidemic might have (partial) immunity for the second one. The first epidemic is analysed through a bond percolation model, while the second epidemic is approximated by a three-type branching process in which the types of individuals depend on their position in the percolation clusters used for the first epidemic. This branching process approximation enables us to calculate, in the large population limit and conditional upon a large outbreak in the first epidemic, a threshold parameter and the probability of a large outbreak for the second epidemic. A second branching process approximation enables us to calculate the fraction of the population that are infected by such a second large outbreak.
  We illustrate our results through some specific cases which have appeared previously in the literature and show that our asymptotic results give good approximations for finite populations.</description>

      <title>Predicting potato plant vigor from the seed tuber properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vigor of potato plants, defined as the canopy area at the end of the exponential growth stage, depends on the origin and physiological state of the seed tuber. Experiments carried out with six potato varieties in three test fields over three years show that there is a 73%-90% correlation in the vigor of the plants from the same seedlot grown in different test fields. However, these correlations are not always observed on the level of individual varieties and vanish or become negative when the seed tubers and young plants experience environmental stress. A comprehensive study of the association between the vigor and the seed tuber biochemistry has revealed that, while 50%-70% of the variation in the plant vigor is explained by the tuber data, the vigor is dominated by the potato genotype. Analysis of individual predictors, such as the abundance of a particular metabolite, indicates that the vigor enhancing properties of the seed tubers differ between genotypes. Variety-specific models show that, for some varieties, up to 30% of the vigor variation within the variety is explained by and can be predicted from the tuber biochemistry, whereas, for other varieties, the association between the tuber composition and the vigor is much weaker.</description>

      <title>Life at low Reynolds number isn't such a drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The following is an unedited version of two short articles that are forthcoming in Nature Chemical Engineering. Inspired by Purcell's classic lecture "Life at low Reynolds number", I discuss how scaling arguments, dimensional analysis, and fundamental concepts from chemical engineering science can be used to quantitatively describe microbial swimming -- thereby helping to better understand biological systems and inspiring new engineering advances in turn.</description>

      <title>Petri nets in epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides a geometric version of the next-generation method for obtaining the basic reproduction number of an epidemiological model. More precisely, we generalize the concept of the basic reproduction number for the theory of Petri nets. The motivation comes from observing that any epidemiological model has the basic structures found in the SIR model of Kermack-McKendrick. These are three substructures, also given by three Petri nets inside, representing the susceptible population, the infection process, and the infected individuals. The five assumptions of the next-generation matrix given by van den Driessche-Watmough can be described geometrically using Petri nets. Thus, the next-generation matrix results in a matrix of flows between the infection compartments. Besides that, we construct a procedure that associates with a system of ordinary differential equations under certain assumptions, a Petri net that is minimal. In addition, we explain how Petri nets extend compartmental models to include vertical transmission.</description>

      <title>Adaptive efficiency of information processing in immune-pathogen co-evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organisms have evolved immune systems that can counter pathogenic threats. The adaptive immune system in vertebrates consists of a diverse repertoire of immune receptors that can dynamically reorganize to specifically target the ever-changing pathogenic landscape. Pathogens in return evolve to escape the immune challenge, forming an co-evolutionary arms race. We introduce a formalism to characterize out-of-equilibrium interactions in co-evolutionary processes. We show that the rates of information exchange and entropy production can distinguish the leader from the follower in an evolutionary arms races. Lastly, we introduce co-evolutionary efficiency as a metric to quantify each population's ability to exploit information in response to the other. Our formalism provides insights into the conditions necessary for stable co-evolution and establishes bounds on the limits of information exchange and adaptation in co-evolving systems.</description>
