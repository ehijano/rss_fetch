      <title>Reaction-diffusion models of biological invasion: Open source computational tools, key concepts and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review provides open-access computational tools that support a range of mathematical approaches to analyse three related scalar reaction-diffusion models used to study biological invasion. Starting with the classic Fisher-Kolomogorov (Fisher-KPP) model, we illustrate how computational methods can be used to explore time-dependent partial differential equation (PDE) solutions in parallel with phase plane and regular perturbation techniques to explore invading travelling wave solutions moving with dimensionless speed $c \ge 2$. To overcome the lack of a well-defined sharp front in solutions of the Fisher-KPP model, we also review two alternative modeling approaches. The first is the Porous-Fisher model where the linear diffusion term is replaced with a degenerate nonlinear diffusion term. Using phase plane and regular perturbation methods, we explore the distinction between sharp- and smooth-fronted invading travelling waves that move with dimensionless speed $c \ge 1/\sqrt{2}$. The second alternative approach is to reformulate the Fisher-KPP model as a moving boundary problem on $0 &lt; x &lt; L(t)$, leading to the Fisher-Stefan model with sharp-fronted travelling wave solutions arising from a PDE model with a linear diffusion term. Time-dependent PDE solutions and phase plane methods show that travelling wave solutions of the Fisher-Stefan model can describe both biological invasion $(c &gt; 0)$ and biological recession $(c &lt; 0)$. Open source Julia code to replicate all computational results in this review is available on GitHub; we encourage researchers to use this code directly or to adapt the code as required for more complicated models.</description>

      <title>Clustering of chemically propelled nanomotors in chemically active environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic nanomotors powered by chemical reactions have been designed to act as vehicles for active cargo transport, drug delivery as well as a variety of other uses. Collections of such motors, acting in consort, can self-assemble to form swarms or clusters, providing opportunities for applications on various length scales. While such collective behavior has been studied when the motors move in a chemically inactive fluid environment, when the medium in which they move is a chemical network that supports complex spatial and temporal patterns, through simulation and theoretical analysis we show that collective behavior changes. Spatial patterns in the environment can guide and control motor collective states, and interactions of the motors with their environment can give rise to distinctive spatiotemporal motor patterns. The results are illustrated by studies of the motor dynamics in systems that support Turing patterns and spiral waves. This work is relevant for potential applications that involve many active nanomotors moving in complex chemical or biological environments.</description>
