      <title>Multi-Tier Tournaments: Matching and Scoring Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel system of matching and scoring players in tournaments, called Multi-Tier Tournaments, illustrated by chess and based on the following rules:
  1. Players are divided into skill-based tiers, based on their Elo ratings.
  2. Starting with one or more mini-tournaments of the least skilled players (Tier 1), the winner or winners -- after playing multiple opponents -- move to the next-higher tier.
  3. The winners progress to a final tier of the best-performing players from lower tiers as well as players with the highest Elo ratings.
  4. Performance in each tier is given by a player's Tournament Score (TS), which depends on his/her wins, losses, and draws (not on his/her Elo rating).
  Whereas a player's Elo rating determines in which mini-tournament he/she starts play, TS and its associated tie-breaking rules determine whether a player moves up to higher tiers and, in the final mini-tournament, wins the tournament. This combination of players' past Elo ratings and current TS's provides a fair and accurate measure of a player's standing among the players in the tournament. We apply a variation of Multi-Tier Tournaments to the top 20 active chess players in the world (as of February 2024). Using a dataset of 1209 head-to-head games, we illustrate the viability of giving lower-rated players the opportunity to progress and challenge higher-rated players. We also briefly discuss the application of Multi-Tier Tournaments to baseball, soccer, and other sports that emphasize physical rather than mental skills.</description>

      <title>Cohesion, Ideology, and Tolerance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agents with different ideologies often form alliances to achieve their goals. Paradoxically, ideologically similar agents are often opponents. In this paper, ideologically heterogeneous agents choose the ideological composition of their neighborhood, their tolerance, and invest into connections. The resulting weighted network describes allies, opponents, and strengths. Disputes with opponents determine benefits, which increase in an agent's strength and cohesion. Cohesive agents have fewer mutual allies with opponents. In equilibrium, the network is segregated when cohesion is effective enough and some agents tolerate ideologically distant types to oppose closer ones. Subsidizing connections dampens polarization in societies on the verge of segregation.</description>

      <title>Justified Fairness in House Allocation Problems: two Characterizations of Strategy-proof Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the house allocation problems with strict preferences, where monetary transfers are not allowed. We propose two properties in the spirit of justified fairness. Interestingly, together with other well-studied properties (strategy-proofness and non-bossiness), our two new properties identify serial dictatorships and sequential dictatorships, respectively.</description>

      <title>Soviet Mathematics and Economic Theory in the Past Century: An Historical Reappraisal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What are the effects of authoritarian regimes on scholarly research in economics? And how might economic theory survive ideological pressures? The article addresses these questions by focusing on the mathematization of economics over the past century and drawing on the history of Soviet science. Mathematics in the USSR remained internationally competitive and generated many ideas that were taken up and played important roles in economic theory. These same ideas, however, were disregarded or adopted only in piecemeal fashion by Soviet economists, despite the efforts of influential scholars to change the economic research agenda. The article draws this contrast into sharper focus by exploring the work of Soviet mathematicians in optimization, game theory, and probability theory that was used in Western economics. While the intellectual exchange across the Iron Curtain did help advance the formal modeling apparatus, economics could only thrive in an intellectually open environment absent under the Soviet rule.</description>

      <title>Learning in Repeated Interactions on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14265v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how long-lived, rational agents learn in a social network. In every period, after observing the past actions of his neighbors, each agent receives a private signal, and chooses an action whose payoff depends only on the state. Since equilibrium actions depend on higher order beliefs, it is difficult to characterize behavior. Nevertheless, we show that regardless of the size and shape of the network, the utility function, and the patience of the agents, the speed of learning in any equilibrium is bounded from above by a constant that only depends on the private signal distribution.</description>

      <title>Designing Simple Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Which mechanisms are simple to play? When is it easy for participants to see that a mechanism is incentive-compatible? I will start by explaining how and why economists came to ask these questions. Then I will discuss three recent answers, that capture different aspects of what makes a mechanism simple.</description>

      <title>Some Characterizations of TTC in Multiple-Object Reallocation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers exchange of indivisible objects when agents are endowed with and can consume any bundles. We focus on efficient allocation rules that satisfy a novel participation requirement, the weak endowment lower bound, and which defend against simple manipulation heuristics: drop strategies and truncation strategies. Based on these properties, we obtain characterizations of a generalized version of Top Trading Cycles (TTC) on several domains. On the lexicographic and conditionally lexicographic domains, TTC is characterized by Pareto efficiency, balancedness, the weak endowment lower bound, and truncation-proofness (or drop strategy-proofness). On the domain of responsive preferences, similar characterizations are obtained by restricting attention to rules that are ``individual-good-based'' and weakening Pareto efficiency to individual-good efficiency. For the Shapley-Scarf model, TTC is characterized by Pareto efficiency, individual rationality, and truncation-proofness. The lexicographic and conditionally lexicographic domains are maximal domains on which Pareto efficiency coincides with individual-good efficiency.</description>
