      <title>Thermodynamically Consistent Hybrid and Permutation-Invariant Neural Yield Functions for Anisotropic Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastic anisotropy in metals remains challenging to model. This is partly because conventional phenomenological yield criteria struggle to combine a highly descriptive, flexible representation with constraints, such as convexity, dictated by thermodynamic consistency. To address this gap, we employ architecturally-constrained neural networks and develop two data-driven frameworks: (i) a hybrid model that augments the Hill yield criterion with an Input Convex Neural Network (ICNN) to get an anisotropic yield function representation in the six-dimensional stress space and (ii) a permutation-invariant input convex neural network (PI-ICNN) that learns an isotropic yield function representation in the principal stress space and embeds anisotropy through linear stress transformations. We calibrate the proposed frameworks on a sparse Al-7079 extrusion experimental dataset comprising 12 uniaxial samples with measured yield stresses and Lankford ratios. To test the robustness of each framework, nine datasets were generated using k-fold cross-validation. These datasets were then used to quantitatively compare Hill-48, Yld2004-18p, pure ICNNs, the hybrid approach, and the PI-ICNN frameworks. While ICNNs and hybrid approaches can almost perfectly fit the training data, they exhibit significant over-fitting, resulting in high validation and test losses. In contrast, both PI-ICNN frameworks demonstrate better generalization capabilities, even outperforming Yld2004-18p on the validation and test data. These results demonstrate that PI-ICNNs unify physics-based constraints with the flexibility of neural networks, enabling the accurate prediction of both yield loci and Lankford ratios from minimal data. The approach opens a path toward rapid, thermodynamically consistent constitutive models for advanced forming simulations and future exploration of coupled hardening or microstructure-informed design.</description>

      <title>Noise, Adaptation, and Strategy: Assessing LLM Fidelity in Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in social science simulations. While their performance on reasoning and optimization tasks has been extensively evaluated, less attention has been paid to their ability to simulate human decision-making's variability and adaptability. We propose a process-oriented evaluation framework with progressive interventions (Intrinsicality, Instruction, and Imitation) to examine how LLM agents adapt under different levels of external guidance and human-derived noise. We validate the framework on two classic economics tasks, irrationality in the second-price auction and decision bias in the newsvendor problem, showing behavioral gaps between LLMs and humans.
  We find that LLMs, by default, converge on stable and conservative strategies that diverge from observed human behaviors. Risk-framed instructions impact LLM behavior predictably but do not replicate human-like diversity. Incorporating human data through in-context learning narrows the gap but fails to reach human subjects' strategic variability. These results highlight a persistent alignment gap in behavioral fidelity and suggest that future LLM evaluations should consider more process-level realism. We present a process-oriented approach for assessing LLMs in dynamic decision-making tasks, offering guidance for their application in synthetic data for social science research.</description>

      <title>QUEENS: An Open-Source Python Framework for Solver-Independent Analyses of Large-Scale Computational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing challenge in research and industrial engineering applications is the need for repeated, systematic analysis of large-scale computational models, for example, patient-specific digital twins of diseased human organs: The analysis requires efficient implementation, data, resource management, and parallelization, possibly on distributed systems. To tackle these challenges and save many researchers from annoying, time-consuming tasks, we present QUEENS (Quantification of Uncertain Effects in Engineering Systems), an open-source Python framework for composing and managing simulation analyses with arbitrary (physics-based) solvers on distributed computing infrastructures. Besides simulation management capabilities, QUEENS offers a comprehensive collection of efficiently implemented state-of-the-art algorithms ranging from routines for convergence studies and common optimization algorithms to more advanced sampling algorithms for uncertainty quantification and Bayesian inverse analysis. Additionally, we provide our latest cutting-edge research in multi-fidelity uncertainty quantification, efficient multi-fidelity Bayesian inverse analysis, and probabilistic machine learning. QUEENS adopts a Bayesian, probabilistic mindset but equally supports standard deterministic analysis without requiring prior knowledge of probability theory. The modular architecture allows rapid switching between common types of analyses and facilitates building sophisticated hierarchical algorithms. Encouraging natural incremental steps and scaling towards complexity allows researchers to consider the big picture while building towards it through smaller, manageable steps. The open-source repository is available at https://github.com/queens-py/queens.</description>

      <title>From Linear to Hierarchical: Evolving Tree-structured Thoughts for Efficient Alpha Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alpha mining, which discovers signals that predict asset returns, has long been attractive for automatic quantitative investment. This problem is typically formulated as a tree-based symbolic regression with handcrafted market data features and arithmetic operators. Unfortunately, existing symbolic methods are concerned with computational inefficiency and dependence on prior knowledge. Recent implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs) show that they can automatically generate executable codes for various tasks efficiently, thus can be considered as a new promising way for alpha mining. Specifically, LLMs-driven methods evolve a set of heuristics, including thoughts and codes, where the thoughts are usually represented as plain-text prompts of codes. Unfortunately, trivially adopting them in alpha mining ignores the fact that alphas are with hierarchical tree structures. This paper introduces Tree-structured thought Evolution (TreEvo), which evolves hierarchical reasoning ideas solely at the thought level. Experiments on four real-market datasets demonstrate that TreEvo can obtain better alphas with much less computational time and human expert efforts. And this superiority hardly holds without the tree-structured thoughts and the compatible evolutionary operators.</description>

      <title>Cost-optimized replacement strategies for water electrolysis systems affected by degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key factor in reducing the cost of green hydrogen production projects using water electrolysis systems is to minimize the degradation of the electrolyzer stacks, as this impacts the lifetime of the stacks and therefore the frequency of their replacement. To create a better understanding of the economics of stack degradation, we present a linear optimization approach minimizing the costs of a green hydrogen supply chain including an electrolyzer with degradation modeling. By calculating the levelized cost of hydrogen depending on a variable degradation threshold, the cost optimal time for stack replacement can be identified. We further study how this optimal time of replacement is affected by uncertainties such as the degradation scale, the load-dependency of both degradation and energy demand, and the costs of the electrolyzer. The variation of the identified major uncertainty degradation scale results in a difference of up to 9 years regarding the cost optimal time for stack replacement, respectively lifetime of the stacks. Therefore, a better understanding of the degradation impact is imperative for project cost reductions, which in turn would support a proceeding hydrogen market ramp-up.</description>

      <title>Sentiment-Aware Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization for Cryptocurrencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic cryptocurrency portfolio optimization strategy that integrates technical indicators and sentiment analysis to enhance investment decision-making. The proposed method employs the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) and 14-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) to capture market momentum, while sentiment scores are extracted from news articles using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model, with compound scores quantifying overall market tone. The large language model Google Gemini is used to further verify the sentiment scores predicted by VADER and give investment decisions. These technical indicator and sentiment signals are incorporated into the expected return estimates before applying mean-variance optimization with constraints on asset weights. The strategy is evaluated through a rolling-window backtest over cryptocurrency market data, with Bitcoin (BTC) and an equal-weighted portfolio of selected cryptocurrencies serving as benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a cumulative return of 38.72, substantially exceeding Bitcoin's 8.85 and the equal-weighted portfolio's 21.65 over the same period, and delivers a higher Sharpe ratio (1.1093 vs. 0.8853 and 1.0194, respectively). However, the strategy exhibits a larger maximum drawdown (-18.52%) compared to Bitcoin (-4.48%) and the equal-weighted portfolio (-11.02%), indicating higher short-term downside risk. These results highlight the potential of combining sentiment and technical signals to improve cryptocurrency portfolio performance, while also emphasizing the need to address risk exposure in volatile markets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pharmaceutical supply chain faces escalating cybersecurity challenges threatening patient safety and operational continuity. This paper examines the transformative potential of zero trust architecture for enhancing security and resilience within this critical ecosystem. We explore the challenges posed by data breaches, counterfeiting, and disruptions and introduce the principles of continuous verification, least-privilege access, and data-centric security inherent in zero trust. Real-world case studies illustrate successful implementations. Benefits include heightened security, data protection, and adaptable resilience. As recognized by researchers and industrialists, a reliable drug tracing system is crucial for ensuring drug safety throughout the pharmaceutical production process. One of the most pivotal domains within the pharmaceutical industry and its associated supply chains where zero trust can be effectively implemented is in the management of narcotics, high-health-risk drugs, and abusable substances. By embracing zero trust, the pharmaceutical industry fortifies its supply chain against constantly changing cyber threats, ensuring the trustworthiness of critical medical operations.</description>

      <title>Advancing rail safety: An onboard measurement system of rolling stock wheel flange wear based on dynamic machine learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time. Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime. The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2 %. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it, ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scattering Matrix Synthesis: Independent Region Decomposition for Hybrid Antenna--Scatterer Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified formulation for synthesizing the generalized scattering matrix (GS-matrix) of hybrid electromagnetic systems comprising arbitrary numbers of antennas and scatterers. The proposed method provides a modular region decomposition framework that enables efficient analysis of electromagnetic interactions between distinct structures, under the relaxed geometric condition that the constituents are separable by a plane. By leveraging the addition theorem of vector spherical wavefunctions (VSWFs), a compact matrix representation is derived to assemble the GS- and S-matrices of individual components into the overall system response. This formulation generalizes and extends prior methods developed for either multiple scattering or antenna array analysis, and is particularly suited to configurations where substructures may be repositioned or reused. Numerical examples are provided to validate the accuracy and versatility of the method, including scenarios involving tightly spaced components and rotational variations in substructure layout.</description>
