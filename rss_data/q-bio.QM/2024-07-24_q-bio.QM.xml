      <title>A statistical significance test for spatio-temporal receptive field estimates obtained using spike-triggered averaging of binary pseudo-random sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal receptive fields (STRF) of visual neurons are often estimated using spike-triggered averaging of binary pseudo-random stimulus sequences. The spike train of a visual neuron is recorded simultaneously with the stimulus presentation. The neuron's STRF is estimated by averaging the stimulus frames that coincide with spikes at fixed latencies. Although this is a widely used technique, an analytical method for determining the statistical significance of the estimated value of the STRF pixels seems to be lacking. Such a significance test would be useful for identifying the significant features of the STRF and investigating their relationship with experimental variables. Here, the distribution of the estimated STRF pixel values is derived for given spike trains, under the null hypothesis that spike occurrences and stimulus values are statistically independent. This distribution is then used for computing amplitude thresholds to determine the STRF pixels where the null hypothesis can be rejected at a desired two-tailed significance level. It is also proposed that the size of the receptive field may be inferred from the significant pixels. The application of the proposed method is illustrated on spike trains collected from individual mouse retinal ganglion cells.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Machine Learning Classification of Parkinsonian Disorders using Saccadic Eye Movements: A Development and Validation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16063v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discriminating between Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is difficult due to overlapping symptoms, especially early on. Saccades (rapid conjugate eye movements between fixation points) are affected by both diseases but conventional saccade analyses exhibit group level differences only. We hypothesized analyzing entire saccade raw time series waveforms would permit superior individual level discrimination between PD, PSP, and healthy controls (HC). 13,309 saccadic eye movements from 127 participants were analyzed using a novel, calibration-free waveform analysis and hierarchical machine learning framework. Individual saccades were classified based on which trained model could reconstruct each waveform with minimum error, indicating the most likely condition. A hierarchical classifier then predicted overall status (recently diagnosed and medication-naive 'de novo' PD, 'established' PD on antiparkinsonian medication, PSP, and healthy controls) by combining each participant's saccade results. This approach substantially outperformed conventional metrics, achieving high AUROCs distinguishing de novo PD from PSP (0.92-0.97), de novo PD from HC (0.72-0.89), and PSP from HC (0.90-0.95), while the conventional model showed limited performance (AUROC range: 0.45-0.75). This calibration-free waveform analysis sets a new standard for precise saccadic classification of PD, PSP, and HC, increasing potential for clinical adoption, remote monitoring, and screening.</description>

      <title>Diff4VS: HIV-inhibiting Molecules Generation with Classifier Guidance Diffusion for Virtual Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AIDS epidemic has killed 40 million people and caused serious global problems. The identification of new HIV-inhibiting molecules is of great importance for combating the AIDS epidemic. Here, the Classifier Guidance Diffusion model and ligand-based virtual screening strategy are combined to discover potential HIV-inhibiting molecules for the first time. We call it Diff4VS. An extra classifier is trained using the HIV molecule dataset, and the gradient of the classifier is used to guide the Diffusion to generate HIV-inhibiting molecules. Experiments show that Diff4VS can generate more candidate HIV-inhibiting molecules than other methods. Inspired by ligand-based virtual screening, a new metric DrugIndex is proposed. The DrugIndex is the ratio of the proportion of candidate drug molecules in the generated molecule to the proportion of candidate drug molecules in the training set. DrugIndex provides a new evaluation method for evolving molecular generative models from a pharmaceutical perspective. Besides, we report a new phenomenon observed when using molecule generation models for virtual screening. Compared to real molecules, the generated molecules have a lower proportion that is highly similar to known drug molecules. We call it Degradation in molecule generation. Based on the data analysis, the Degradation may result from the difficulty of generating molecules with a specific structure in the generative model. Our research contributes to the application of generative models in drug design from method, metric, and phenomenon analysis.</description>

      <title>Improving Prediction of Need for Mechanical Ventilation using Cross-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the intensive care unit, the capability to predict the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) facilitates more timely interventions to improve patient outcomes. Recent works have demonstrated good performance in this task utilizing machine learning models. This paper explores the novel application of a deep learning model with multi-head attention (FFNN-MHA) to make more accurate MV predictions and reduce false positives by learning personalized contextual information of individual patients. Utilizing the publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset, FFNN-MHA demonstrates an improvement of 0.0379 in AUC and a 17.8\% decrease in false positives compared to baseline models such as feed-forward neural networks. Our results highlight the potential of the FFNN-MHA model as an effective tool for accurate prediction of the need for mechanical ventilation in critical care settings.</description>

      <title>A discontinuous Galerkin method for the three-dimensional heterodimer model with application to prion-like proteins' dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurocognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, have a wide social impact. These proteinopathies involve misfolded proteins accumulating into neurotoxic aggregates. Mathematical and computational models describing the prion-like dynamics offer an analytical basis to study the diseases' evolution and a computational framework for exploring potential therapies. This work focuses on the heterodimer model in a three-dimensional setting, a reactive-diffusive system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the evolution of both healthy and misfolded proteins. We investigate traveling wave solutions and diffusion-driven instabilities as a mechanism of neurotoxic pattern formation. For the considered mathematical model, we propose a space discretization, relying on the Discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal/polyhedral grids, allowing high-order accuracy and flexible handling of the complicated brain's geometry. Further, we present a priori error estimates for the semi-discrete formulation and we perform convergence tests to verify the theoretical results. Finally, we conduct simulations using realistic data on a three-dimensional brain mesh reconstructed from medical images.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of brain networks detects regions disrupted by neurodegeneration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph theoretical methods have proven valuable for investigating alterations in both anatomical and functional brain connectivity networks during Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that representing brain networks in a suitable geometric space can better capture their connectivity structure. This study introduces a novel approach to characterize brain connectivity changes using low-dimensional, informative representations of networks in a latent geometric space. Specifically, the networks are embedded in the Poincar\'e disk model of hyperbolic geometry. Here, we define a local measure of distortion of the geometric neighborhood of a node following a perturbation. The method is applied to a brain networks dataset of patients with AD and healthy participants, derived from DWI and fMRI scans. We show that, compared with standard graph measures, our method identifies more accurately the brain regions most affected by neurodegeneration. Notably, the abnormality detection in memory-related and frontal areas are robust across multiple brain parcellation scales. Finally, our findings suggest that the geometric perturbation score could serve as a potential biomarker for characterizing disease progression.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in immune sequencing and experimental techniques are generating extensive T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data, enabling the development of models to predict TCR binding specificity. Despite the computational challenges due to the vast diversity of TCRs and epitopes, significant progress has been made. This paper discusses the evolution of the computational models developed for this task, with a focus on machine learning efforts, including the early unsupervised clustering approaches, supervised models, and the more recent applications of Protein Language Models (PLMs). We critically assess the most prominent models in each category, and discuss recurrent challenges, such as the lack of generalization to new epitopes, dataset biases, and biases in the validation design of the models.
  Furthermore, our paper discusses the transformative role of transformer-based protein models in bioinformatics. These models, pretrained on extensive collections of unlabeled protein sequences, can convert amino acid sequences into vectorized embeddings that capture important biological properties. We discuss recent attempts to leverage PLMs to deliver very competitive performances in TCR-related tasks. Finally, we address the pressing need for improved interpretability in these often opaque models, proposing strategies to amplify their impact in the field.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time Suite of Biological Cell Image Analysis Software for Computers, Smartphones, and Smart Glasses, Suitable for Resource-Constrained Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methods for personalizing medical treatment are the focal point of contemporary clinical research. In cancer care, for instance, we can analyze the effects of therapies at the level of individual cells. Complete characterization of treatment efficacy and evaluation of why some individuals respond to specific regimens, whereas others do not, requires additional approaches to genetic sequencing at single time points. Methods for the continuous analysis of changes in phenotype, such as morphology and motion tracking of cellular proteins and organelles over time frames spanning the minute-hour scales, can provide important insight to patient treatment options. The integration of measurements of intracellular dynamics and the contribution of multiple genetic pathways in degenerative diseases is vital for the development of biomarkers for the early detection of pathogenesis and therapy efficacy. We have developed a software suite (DataSet Tracker) for real-time analysis designed to run on computers, smartphones, and smart glasses hardware and suitable for resource-constrained, on-the-fly computing in microscopes without internet connectivity; a demo is available for viewing at datasetanalysis.com. Our objective is to present the community with an integrated, easy to use by all, tool for resolving the complex dynamics of the cytoskeletal meshworks, intracytoplasmic membranous networks, and vesicle trafficking. It is our goal to have this integrated tool approved for use in the clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Molecular Topological Profile (MOLTOP) -- Simple and Strong Baseline for Molecular Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the effectiveness of topological descriptors for molecular graph classification and design a simple, yet strong baseline. We demonstrate that a simple approach to feature engineering - employing histogram aggregation of edge descriptors and one-hot encoding for atomic numbers and bond types - when combined with a Random Forest classifier, can establish a strong baseline for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The novel algorithm, Molecular Topological Profile (MOLTOP), integrates Edge Betweenness Centrality, Adjusted Rand Index and SCAN Structural Similarity score. This approach proves to be remarkably competitive when compared to modern GNNs, while also being simple, fast, low-variance and hyperparameter-free. Our approach is rigorously tested on MoleculeNet datasets using fair evaluation protocol provided by Open Graph Benchmark. We additionally show out-of-domain generation capabilities on peptide classification task from Long Range Graph Benchmark. The evaluations across eleven benchmark datasets reveal MOLTOP's strong discriminative capabilities, surpassing the $1$-WL test and even $3$-WL test for some classes of graphs. Our conclusion is that descriptor-based baselines, such as the one we propose, are still crucial for accurately assessing advancements in the GNN domain.</description>
