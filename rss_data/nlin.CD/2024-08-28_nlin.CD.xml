      <title>Route to chaos and resonant triads interaction in a truncated Rotating Nonlinear shallow-water model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The route to chaos and phase dynamics in a rotating shallow-water model were rigorously examined using a five-mode Galerkin truncated system with complex variables. This system is valuable for investigating how large/meso-scales destabilize and evolve into chaos. Two distinct transitions into chaotic behaviour were identified as energy levels increased. The initial transition occurs through bifurcations following the Feigenbaum sequence. The subsequent transition, at higher energy levels, shows a shift from quasi-periodic states to chaotic regimes. The first chaotic state is mainly due to inertial forces governing nonlinear interactions. The second chaotic state arises from the increased significance of free surface elevation in the dynamics. A novel reformulation using phase and amplitude representations for each truncated variable revealed that phase components exhibit a temporal piece-wise locking behaviour, maintaining a constant value for a prolonged interval before an abrupt transition of $\pm\pi$, while amplitudes remain chaotic. It was observed that phase stability duration decreases with increased energy, leading to chaos in phase components at high energy levels. This is attributed to the nonlinear term in the equations, where phase components are introduced through linear combinations of triads with different modes. When locking durations vary across modes, the dynamics result in a stochastic interplay of multiple $\pi$ phase shifts, creating a stochastic dynamic within the coupled phase triads, observable even at minimal energy injections.</description>

      <title>Predicting multi-parametric dynamics of externally forced oscillators using reservoir computing and minimal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical systems are known to exhibit complex dynamical behavior from harmonic oscillations to chaotic motion. The dynamics undergo qualitative changes due to changes to internal system parameters like stiffness, and also due to changes to external forcing. Mapping out complete bifurcation diagrams numerically or experimentally is resource-consuming, or even infeasible. This study uses a data-driven approach to investigate how bifurcations can be learned from a few system response measurements. Particularly, the concept of reservoir computing (RC) is employed. As proof of concept, a minimal training dataset under the resource constraint problem of a Duffing oscillator with harmonic external forcing is provided as training data. Our results indicate that the RC not only learns to represent the system dynamics for the trained external forcing, but it also manages to provide qualitatively accurate and robust system response predictions for completely unknown \textit{multi-}parameter regimes outside the training data. Particularly, while being trained solely on regular period-2 cycle dynamics, the proposed framework can correctly predict higher-order periodic and even chaotic dynamics for out-of-distribution forcing signals.</description>

      <title>Torus and hyperchaos in 3D Lotka-Volterra map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the occurrence of a three-frequency quasiperiodic torus in a three-dimensional Lotka-Volterra map. Our analysis extends to the observation of a doubling bifurcation of a closed invariant curve, leading to a subsequent transition into a state of hyperchaos. The absorption of various saddle periodic orbits into the hyperchaotic attractor is demonstrated through distance computation, and we explore the dimensionality of both stable and unstable manifolds. Various routes to cyclic and disjoint quasiperiodic structures are presented. Specifically we showcase the transition from a saddle-node connection to a saddle-focus connection, leading to the formation of quasiperiodic closed cyclic disjoint curves, as revealed by the computation of one-dimensional unstable manifold. Additionally, we show an unusual transition from a period-two orbit to a period-six orbit and uncover the mechanism related to two subsequent bifurcations: a) subcritical Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, and (b) saddle-node bifurcation. Our approach involves the use of computational methods for constructing one-dimensional manifolds, extending saddle periodic orbits through a one-parameter continuation, and employing a multi-dimensional Newton-Raphson approach for pinpointing the saddle periodic orbits in the three-dimensional map.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and far-from-equilibrium equation of state of Bogoliubov waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bogoliubov waves emerge when the system is perturbed from its ground state in a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC). These waves can interact nonlinearly, leading to turbulent cascades. In the present work, the turbulence of random weakly nonlinear Bogoliubov waves on the background of a uniform condensate is considered theoretically, within the Wave Turbulence approach, and numerically, via numerical simulations of the 3-dimensional (3D) Gross-Pitaevskii model and the associated wave-kinetic equations. A new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum is found for the short Bogoliubov waves. An exact prefactor constant was found for the previously known Zakharov-Sagdeev spectrum of long (acoustic) Bogoliubov waves. The results are used to explain the BEC equation of state experimentally obtained in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new settings for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Structural Stability Hypothesis of Dual Unitary Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Having spectral correlations that, over small enough energy scales, are described by random matrix theory is regarded as the most general defining feature of quantum chaotic systems as it applies in the many-body setting and away from any semiclassical limit. Although this property is extremely difficult to prove analytically for generic many-body systems, a rigorous proof has been achieved for dual-unitary circuits -- a special class of local quantum circuits that remain unitary upon swapping space and time. Here we consider the fate of this property when moving from dual-unitary to generic quantum circuits focussing on the \emph{spectral form factor}, i.e., the Fourier transform of the two-point correlation. We begin with a numerical survey that, in agreement with previous studies, suggests that there exists a finite region in parameter space where dual-unitary physics is stable and spectral correlations are still described by random matrix theory, although up to a maximal quasienergy scale. To explain these findings, we develop a perturbative expansion: it recovers the random matrix theory predictions, provided the terms occurring in perturbation theory obey a relatively simple set of assumptions. We then provide numerical evidence and a heuristic analytical argument supporting these assumptions.</description>
