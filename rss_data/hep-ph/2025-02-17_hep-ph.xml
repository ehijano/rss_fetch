      <title>Modified Homotopic approach for diffractive production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the recent developments of the use of the homotopy method for solving the non-linear evolution equation for the diffractive production in deep inelastic scattering. We introduce part of the non-linear corrections in the linear term. This simplified non-linear evolution equation is solved analytically taking into account the initial and boundary conditions for the process. It turns out that these corrections are rather small and can be estimated in the regular iterative procedure.</description>

      <title>Wigner multiplets in QFT: dark sector and CPT-violating scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of elementary particles based on unitary irreducible representations of the Poincare group has been a cornerstone of modern Quantum Field Theory (QFT). While the Standard Model (SM) does not inherently include Dark Matter (DM), any fundamental DM candidate should still conform to this classification or its extensions. Beyond the standard representations, Wigner introduced a class of nontrivial states characterized by an additional discrete degree of freedom, known as the Wigner degeneracy. We systematically investigate the QFT of such Wigner degenerate multiplets, particularly focusing on the massive spin-1/2 case. We construct a theoretical framework where the two-fold Wigner spinor fields, \psi_{\pm\frac{1}{2}}(x), form a doublet representation. We analyze their transformation properties under discrete symmetries (C, P, and T), revealing novel mixing effects due to Wigner degeneracy and an emergent accidental U(2) global symmetry. Furthermore, we explore their Yukawa and gauge interactions, demonstrating that such interactions generally break the CPT symmetry. However, we derive conditions for the CPT conservation and discuss potential phenomenological consequences beyond the SM. These results provide new insights into the possible role of Wigner-degenerate states in fundamental physics, particularly in the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Custodial Naturalness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Custodial Naturalness is a new symmetry-based idea to explain the large separation between the electroweak~(EW) scale and ultraviolet completions of the Standard Model~(SM). Classical scale invariance is combined with an enhanced scalar-sector custodial symmetry and both are spontaneously broken by dimensional transmutation at a new intermediate scale. The SM-like Higgs boson is an elementary pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson~(pNGB) of the extended custodial symmetry, which naturally explains the suppression of the EW scale without a little hierarchy problem. We explain details of the general mechanism, its minimal realization and simplest extensions which populate Higgs-, gauge-, and neutrino portals and introduce candidates for particle Dark Matter~(DM). We show the stability of the mechanism under inclusion of new sources of explicit custodial symmetry violation, as well as under variations of boundary conditions at the high scale. Custodial Naturalness is experimentally testable -- including a specific correlation between the Higgs and top quark masses, as well as by the prediction of a new heavy $Z'$ gauge boson and a new dilaton-like scalar which are well-motivated targets for future colliders and Higgs factories. The cosmological evolution features a strongly supercooled phase transition implying that consequences of Custodial Naturalness may also be tested by gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Effective theories for nuclei at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the application of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC), an effective field theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), to describe high-energy nuclear interactions. We first provide an introduction to the methods and language of the CGC, its role in understanding gluon saturation in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and RHIC, and its relevance in various scattering processes such as Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS). The application of the CGC effective field theory to describe hadron-hadron collisions is discussed in the scope of asymmetric \textit{dilute-dense} collisions, and Heavy-Ion Collisions in the \textit{dense-dense} limit. The review covers theoretical foundations, recent advancements, and phenomenological applications, focusing on using the CGC to determine the initial conditions of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Tomography of Pions and Kaons in the QCD Vacuum: Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the pion and kaon transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM), a model of the QCD vacuum at low resolution. The relevant TMDs are factored into a constituent quark distribution times a rapidity dependent soft factor from staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed parton longitudinal momentum and transverse separation. The results are evolved to higher rapidities and higher resolution using the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) renormalization group evolution. The comparison to existing extractions of pion TMDs from Drell-Yan (DY) data is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Prospects for observing chiral symmetry breaking in lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak interactions in neutron $\beta$-decay exhibit parity violation through the preferential emission of right-handed antineutrinos. We identify this symmetry breaking with a reduction of phase space due to the small neutrino mass. During a brief interval of momentum exchange, a small mass neutrino puts the emission process close to the bifurcation horizon of Rindler space, doubly covered by Minkowski space ${\cal M}$ as dictated by the Equivalence Principle of general relativity. In the limit of arbitrarily small mass, this two-sheet covering effectively collapses into a single sheet, reducing the dimension of Dirac spinors from four to two, leaving neutrinos single-handed. This predicts a similar reduction to single-handed particle states in electrons created at TeV energies, which may be tested with the planned linear leptonic colliders. If confirmed, right-handed small mass neutrinos are expected to exist at sufficiently low energies.</description>

      <title>The nonfactorizable QED correction to the $\overline{B}_{s}$ ${\to}$ $D_{s}^{(\ast)} {\ell} \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the nonfactorizable QED corrections, the branching ratios and ratios of branching ratios $R(D_{s}^{({\ast})})$ for the semileptonic $\overline{B}_{s}$ ${\to}$ $D_{s}^{(\ast)} {\ell} \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ decays are reevaluated. It is found that (a) the QED contributions can enhance the branching ratios and reduce the ratios $R(D_{s}^{({\ast})})$. (b) The $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry holds basically well in the ratios $R(D)$-$R(D^{\ast})$ for the semileptonic charmed $\overline{B}_{u,d,s}$ decays. (c) The current theoretical uncertainties of branching ratios ${\cal B}(\overline{B}_{s} {\to} D_{s}^{\ast} {\ell} \bar{\nu}_{\ell})$ from the form factors are very large.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity study of a sapphire detector using Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Indian Coherent Neutrino-nucleus Scattering Experiment(ICNSE) has been proposed at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in India to measure the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process using electron antineutrinos produced from reactors. Phenomenological studies are performed to find out the sensitivity of sapphire detector for various fundamental physics parameters at an exposure of one year. Reactors of different core compositions, sizes, and thermal powers have been considered as sources of electron antineutrinos. The potential of the ICNSE to measure the weak mixing angle at a low energy regime has been extracted. Furthermore, the detector's capability has been investigated for examining the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos, including their magnetic moment. Additionally, an exploration has been conducted on the detector's sensitivity in restricting new interactions between neutrinos and electrons or nuclei, thereby constraining the parameter space related to light mediators. It is found that the ICNSE detector can put a stronger constraints on the scalar and vector mediators masses.</description>

      <title>Insights on the Scale of Leptogenesis from Neutrino Masses and Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the thermal leptogenesis scenario in the type-I seesaw framework featuring three heavy Majorana neutrinos with a hierarchical mass spectrum. We focus on low energy observables, specifically the lightest neutrino mass $m_{\nu}^{\rm lightest}$ and the neutrinoless double-beta decay effective mass parameter $m^{\rm eff}_{\beta\beta}$. In particular, we numerically calculate the minimum mass of the lightest heavy Majorana neutrino, $M_1^{\rm min}$, required for successful leptogenesis as a function of $m_{\nu}^{\rm lightest}$ and $m_{\beta\beta}^{\rm eff}$, considering both normal and inverted light neutrino mass orderings. Flavour effects are taken into account within the flavoured density matrix formalism. We also examine the interplay between fine-tuned cancellations in the seesaw relation and $M_1^{\rm min}$. Recent and forthcoming searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay, along with cosmological probes of the sum of neutrino masses, motivate this analysis, as they can provide key insights into the minimal scale of thermal leptogenesis and its broader implications.</description>

      <title>Nuclear modification of $B_c$ mesons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions based on a linear Boltzmann transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) of $B_c$ mesons in high-energy nuclear collisions provides a novel probe of heavy quark interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Based on a linear Boltzmann transport model that incorporates both Yukawa and string types of interactions between heavy quarks and the QGP, we study the production and evolution of heavy quarks and $B_c$ mesons within the same framework. A $B_c$ bound state dissociates while one of its constituent heavy quarks scatters with the QGP with momentum transfer greater than its binding energy. The medium-modified charm and bottom quarks can recombine into $B_c$ mesons, and the medium-modified bottom quarks can also fragment to $B_c$ mesons. We find that most primordial $B_c$ mesons generated from the initial hard collisions dissociate inside the QGP. The production of $B_c$ mesons is primarily driven by the recombination mechanism at low transverse momentum and fragmentation at high transverse momentum. The string interaction dominates over the Yukawa interaction in the nuclear modification of $B_c$ mesons. The participant number dependence of the $B_c$ meson $R_\mathrm{AA}$ is determined by the complicated interplay between the heavy quark yield, energy loss, and the QGP volume. We obtain a reasonable description of the $R_\mathrm{AA}$ of $B_c$ mesons in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, and provide predictions for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration in QC_2D from effective model using the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The order of the chiral phase transition in two-color and two-flavor QC$_2$D is investigated using the functional renormalization group (FRG) technique in an effective model setting. We calculate the $\beta$ function of all couplings in the dimensionally reduced Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional with Pauli-G\"ursey SU(4) symmetry. We compare results of the perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion approach with those obtained via the FRG, evaluated directly in $d=3$ dimensions. The perturbative results suggest that the fixed-point structure is more intricate than that of three-color QCD, a conclusion further supported by the FRG analysis. Both methods display an infrared stable $O(6)$ fixed point at infinite axial anomaly; however, the FRG approach also reveals the existence of $U_A(1)$ anomaly-free fixed points, which can become infrared stable if the anomaly in the underlying theory vanishes at the critical temperature. These findings imply that the phase transition can be of second order, consistent with earlier findings for three colors.</description>

      <title>C-parity, magnetic monopoles and higher frequency gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spontaneous breaking of $SO(10)$ grand unified symmetry to the left-right symmetric model $SU(3)_c \times SU(3)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ with C-parity also unbroken [$C$ converts $Q\to -Q$, where $Q$ is the electric charge operator in $SO(10)$.] This breaking produces the topologically stable GUT monopole as well as a GUT scale C-string. The subsequent breaking at an intermediate scale of C-parity produces domain walls bounded by C-strings, found by Kibble, Lazarides and Shafi. A limited number of inflationary $e$-foldings experienced during these breakings can yield an observable number density of primordial GUT monopoles. The C-strings also experience this inflationary phase, and the subsequent string-wall network decays through the emission of gravitational waves. We estimate the gravitational wave spectrum from these composite structures over a range of values of the domain wall tension $\sigma$. Depending on $\sigma$ the spectrum displays a peak in the higher frequency range between $10^2$ to $10^5$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Enhancing anomaly detection with topology-aware autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in high-energy physics is essential for identifying new physics beyond the Standard Model. Autoencoders provide a signal-agnostic approach but are limited by the topology of their latent space. This work explores topology-aware autoencoders, embedding phase-space distributions onto compact manifolds that reflect energy-momentum conservation. We construct autoencoders with spherical ($S^n$), product ($S^2 \otimes S^2$), and projective ($\mathbb{RP}^2$) latent spaces and compare their anomaly detection performance against conventional Euclidean embeddings. Our results show that autoencoders with topological priors significantly improve anomaly separation by preserving the global structure of the data manifold and reducing spurious reconstruction errors. Applying our approach to simulated hadronic top-quark decays, we show that latent spaces with appropriate topological constraints enhance sensitivity and robustness in detecting anomalous events. This study establishes topology-aware autoencoders as a powerful tool for unsupervised searches for new physics in particle-collision data.</description>

      <title>Pion condensation versus 2SC, speed of sound, and charge neutrality effects in the quark-meson diquark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the two-flavor quark-meson diquark model as a low-energy model for QCD at non-zero quark and isospin chemical potentials $\mu$ and $\mu_I$, and at zero temperature. We map out the phase diagram in the $\mu$-$\mu_I$ plane, which has four phases: a vacuum phase, a phase with condensed charged pions/Cooper pairs of $u$ and $\bar{d}$ quarks, a normal quark matter phase, and a color superconducting phase (2SC phase). %In the 2SC phase, we study the effects of imposing color and %electric charge neutrality. The global symmetry breaking $SU(3)_c\rightarrow SU(2)_c$ in the 2SC phase gives rise to a number of Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We classify them and briefly discuss their properties. We calculate the speed of sound $c_s$ in the two special cases, finite $\mu_I$ and $\mu=0$, and finite $\mu$ and $\mu_I=0$. In both cases, the speed of sound exhibits a maximum and approaches the conformal limit from above as the density increases. For non-zero isospin $\mu_I$, this behavior is in agreement with the speed of sound obtained from lattice simulations. In the 2SC phase, the behavior is qualitatively the same if we impose local charge neutrality. Finally, we discuss the possibility of having a mixed phase of negatively charged normal quark matter and positively charged 2SC matter with global color charge neutrality imposed on the latter.</description>

      <title>Recasting the ATLAS search for displaced hadronic jets in the ATLAS calorimeter with additional jets or leptons using surrogate models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note describes the validation of a new form of re-interpretation material provided by an ATLAS search for hadronically-decaying neutral long-lived particles in association with jets or leptons, using the full Run-2 dataset. This reference ATLAS analysis provided a set of machine-learning-based "surrogate models" which return the probability of an event being selected in a given channel of the analysis, using as input truth-level kinematic information (decay position, transverse momentum and decay products of the long-lived particles). In this document, we describe the surrogate model framework in detail, and how it responds to issues identified in other re-interpretation procedures. We describe independent validations of the surrogate models' performance in reproducing the original analysis results -- first using a standalone framework and then employing the HackAnalysis framework.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Attenuation Effects: Sensitivity Ceilings for Spin-Dependent and Spin-Independent Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct detection experiments aimed at uncovering the elusive nature of dark matter (DM) have made significant progress in probing ever lower cross-sections for DM-nucleon interactions. At the same time, an upper limit in the cross-section sensitivity region is present due to DM scattering in the Earth and atmosphere and as a result never reaching the detector. We investigate the impact of this effect for both spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions. In contrast to previous studies that assume a straight line path for DM scattering we employ a semi-analytic diffusion model that takes into account the impact of potentially large angle deviations prevalent for light DM masses. We find that for sufficiently low energy thresholds, this difference in modelling impacts the DM interaction cross-section sensitivity. This study evaluates the impact in the context of the QUEST-DMC experiment, which utilises surface-based detectors with superfluid Helium-3 bolometers to search for sub-GeV DM exploiting low energy threshold. At masses below 1 GeV$/c^2$ the deviation between the two frameworks becomes pronounced. The ceiling sensitivity limit for QUEST-DMC on spin-dependent DM-neutron cross-sections is $\sim 3 \times 10^{-24}$ cm$^2$ using the diffusive framework and approximately doubles with the straight-line path DM scattering. Similarly, for spin-independent DM-nucleon cross-sections, the ceiling limit is $\sim 7.5 \times 10^{-27}$ cm$^2$ under the diffusive framework and also increases about a factor of two with the straight-line path approximation, within the mass range of 0.025-5 GeV$/c^2$.</description>

      <title>Effective theory of light Dirac neutrino portal dark matter with observable ${\Delta N_{\rm eff}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of light Dirac neutrino portal dark matter (DM) in an effective field theory (EFT) setup. Dirac nature of light neutrino automatically includes its right chiral part $\nu_R$ which, in our setup, also acts like a portal between DM and the standard model (SM) particles. Considering a Dirac fermion singlet DM stabilised by an unbroken $Z_2$ symmetry, we write down all possible dimension-6 effective operators involving DM-$\nu_R$ as well as $\nu_R$-SM which conserve $Z_2$, global lepton number and SM gauge symmetries. DM thermalisation also ensures the thermalisation of $\nu_R$, leading to enhanced effective relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$, within reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We study the complementarity among DM and CMB related observations for different Lorentz structures of effective operators. We also propose two UV completions based on the popularly studied gauges $\rm B-L$ and left-right symmetric model frameworks.</description>

      <title>Searching for the $2^+$ partner of the $T_{cs0}(2870)$ in the $B^- \to D^- D^0 K^0_S$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $B^- \to D^- D^0 K^0_S$ reaction, recently analyzed by the LHCb collaboration, where a clear signal for the exotic $T_{cs0}(2870)$ state has been reported. We call the attention to a small peak in the $D^0 K^0_S$ mass distribution that could correspond to a state of the same nature as the $T_{cs0}(2870)$ ($D^* \bar K^*$ nature in the molecular picture) but with $J^P= 2^+$. In order to magnify the signal for the state, we calculate the moments of the angle-mass distribution, which are linear in the resonance signal, rather than quadratic for the angle integrated mass distribution. We find spectra for the moments with a strength far bigger than that for the angle integrated mass distribution, which should encourage the evaluation of these moments from the present measurements of the reaction.</description>

      <title>NA62e+: dark sector searches with high intensity positron beams in ECN3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark sector models present a rich phenomenology that requires high-intensity beams and precision detectors for thorough exploration. The NA62 experiment has already published several constraints on dark sector candidates, leveraging proton beam dump and meson decay techniques. This proposal seeks to significantly enhance NA62's discovery potential for dark sector candidates by using the positron-on-target technique. High intensity and high-energy positron beams, reaching up to $\sim$150 GeV energy, have already been produced at the SPS extracted beam lines. If a positron beam with an intensity in the range of 2$\times10^{14}$ positrons on target per year is delivered to the present K12 beam line, the NA62 detector would be ideal for searches of dark sector particles in both visible and invisible decay channels. Additionally, this approach would enable precision measurement of key standard model observable, including a detailed scan of $\sigma(e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$) and $\sigma(e^+e^-\to\mu^+\mu^-)$ at the di-pion and di-muon production threshold, with discovery potential for the True Muonium ($\mu^+\mu^-$) bound state.</description>

      <title>Early Galaxies from Rare Inflationary Processes and JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare Poisson processes (PP) during cosmic inflation can lead to signatures that are localized in position space and are not well captured by the standard two- or higher-point correlation functions of primordial density perturbations. As an example, PP can lead to localized overdense regions that are far denser than the ones produced through standard inflationary fluctuations. As a result, such overdense regions collapse earlier than expected based on the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and would host anomalously high-redshift galaxies. We describe some general aspects of such PP and consider a particular realization in the context of inflationary particle production. We then show that the masses and redshifts of the resulting galaxies can lie in a range discoverable by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and future surveys, while being consistent with existing constraints on the matter power spectrum and UV luminosity functions at lower redshifts.</description>

      <title>Modeling of acceleration in heavy-ion collisions: occurrence of temperature below the Unruh temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that extremely strong electric fields can be created in central collisions of heavy ions, due to which the Schwinger effect can be significant. A direct analogue of the electric field in hydrodynamics is the acceleration of the medium. Using the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) framework we model the Au-Au collisions at intermediate collision energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=4.5-11.5\,$GeV and obtain the spatial distribution of acceleration at different time moments. The present study demonstrates that extremely high acceleration of the order of 1 GeV may be generated in both central and non-central collisions, and that the distribution exhibits a core-corona structure. Consequently, in contrast to the case with an electric field, the Unruh effect is expected to be significant. It is demonstrated that for the confined phase the temperature is less than the Unruh temperature. Conversely, in the deconfined phase, the relationship is inverse. The obtained results thus support the prediction about the existence of states with $T&lt;T_U$ at the early stages of the collision and the associated complementary description of thermalization in terms of the novel phase transition at the Unruh temperature.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing neutrinoless double beta decay event kinematics in a xenon gas detector with vertex tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If neutrinoless double beta decay is discovered, the next natural step would be understanding the lepton number violating physics responsible for it. Several alternatives exist beyond the exchange of light neutrinos. Some of these mechanisms can be distinguished by measuring phase-space observables, namely the opening angle $\cos\theta$ among the two decay electrons, and the electron energy spectra, $T_1$ and $T_2$. In this work, we study the statistical accuracy and precision in measuring these kinematic observables in a future xenon gas detector with the added capability to precisely locate the decay vertex. For realistic detector conditions (a gas pressure of 10 bar and spatial resolution of 4 mm), we find that the average $\overline{\cos\theta}$ and $\overline{T_1}$ values can be reconstructed with a precision of 0.19 and 110 keV, respectively, assuming that only 10 neutrinoless double beta decay events are detected.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonians to all Orders in Perturbation Theory and Higher Loop Corrections in Single Field Inflation with PBHs Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the action and the interaction Hamiltonians to all orders in perturbation theory in the model of single field inflation with a transient ultra slow-roll phase. Employing the formalism of EFT of inflation, we obtain a compact non-perturbative expression for the interaction Hamiltonian in terms of the Goldstone field $\pi$ in the decoupling limit. In addition, we also present a non-linear relation between $\pi$ and the curvature perturbations to all orders in perturbation theory. These are powerful results which enable us to calculate the cosmological correlators and loop corrections to any order in perturbation theory. As a non-trivial example, we calculate the $L$-loop corrections on long CMB scale perturbations in the USR models which are used for PBHs formation. We show that the loop corrections scale like $(\Delta N {\cal P}_e L) ^L$ in which ${\cal P}_e$ is the peak of the power spectrum and $\Delta N$ is the duration of the USR phase. This indicates that the loop corrections grow quickly out of perturbative control for large values of $L$. In the conventional USR setup for PBHs formation with $\Delta N \simeq 2.5$, this happens at $L=4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10144v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model is constructed to predict the emission originating from axion-to-photon conversion in the strongly magnetized ultrarelativistic plasma of neutron stars. The acceleration and multiplicity of the charges are observed to shift the axion-induced spectral feature with respect to previous expectations. The frequency range of interest widens accordingly, and heavier dark matter axions may resonate in magnetospheric splits giving rise to detectable radio signals that could extend into the millimeter band. Ultimately, this work follows an affirmative answer to the question of whether neutron stars can give rise to any detectable high-frequency spectral feature that would allow us to probe axion dark matter of masses up to about a millielectronvolt. SGR 1745--2900 emerges as a particularly promising astrophysical laboratory for probing high-frequency axion dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00741v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons near rotating black holes can undergo significant growth through superradiant energy extraction, potentially reaching field values close to the Planck scale and transforming black holes into effective transducers for these fields. The interaction between boson fields and fermions may lead to parametric production or Schwinger pair production of fermions, with efficiencies significantly exceeding those of perturbative decay processes. Additionally, the spatial gradients of scalar clouds and the electric components of vector clouds can accelerate fermions, resulting in observable fluxes. This study considers both Standard Model neutrinos and dark sector fermions, which could contribute to boosted dark matter. Energy loss due to fermion emissions can potentially quench the exponential growth of the cloud, leading to a saturated state. This dynamic provides a framework for establishing limits on boson-neutrino interactions, previously constrained by neutrino self-interaction considerations. In the saturation phase, boson clouds have the capacity to accelerate fermions to TeV energies, producing fluxes that surpass those from atmospheric neutrinos near black holes. These fluxes open new avenues for observations through high-energy neutrino detectors like IceCube, as well as through dark matter direct detection efforts focused on targeted black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $pp \to W^{\pm} h, Zh$ processes at the LHC are studied in the framework of the inert doublet model (IDM). To quantify the effects of the IDM and their observability in these processes we revisit the NLO (QCD and EW) predictions in the Standard Model (SM) and their uncertainty. Taking all available current constraints on the parameter space of the IDM, we consider both the case of the IDM providing a good Dark Matter (DM) candidate within the freeze-out mechanism as well as when the DM restrictions are relaxed. In the former, deviations from the SM of only a few per mil in these cross sections at the LHC are found and may not be measured. In the latter, the deviations can reach a few percents and should be observable. Smaller discrepancies in this case require that the theoretical uncertainties be improved, in particular those arising from the parton distribution functions (PDFs). We stress the importance of the photon-induced real corrections and the need for further improvement in the extraction of the photon PDF. The analysis also showcases the development and exploitation of our automated tool for the computation of one-loop electroweak and QCD corrections for a New Physics model with internal tests such as those concerning the soft and collinear parts provided through both dipole subtraction and phase space slicing besides tests for ultra-violet finiteness and gauge-parameter independence.</description>

      <title>Lighting up the Photon Wigner Distribution via Dilepton Productions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of lepton pair production through photon-photon fusion processes in heavy-ion collisions. It is demonstrated that the dilepton production at a given impact parameter ($b_\perp$) with a fixed transverse momentum imbalance ($q_\perp$) can be factorized into a unified formula in terms of the Wigner photon distribution of heavy nuclei. We show that this framework provides a comprehensive description of all the relevant data from RHIC to the LHC, with a strong evidence that the quasi-real photon can be radiated not only from the nucleus as a whole, standing for the coherent contribution, but also from the sub-structures inside the nucleus, representing the incoherent contribution. Further predictions are made for the anisotropies in the correlations between $q_\perp$, $b_\perp$, and the dilepton transverse momentum ($P_\perp$). This will help us to constrain the photon Wigner distribution which plays a crucial role to study the gluonic matter of nucleus at small-$x$ through the diffractive photoproduction processes in heavy ion collision.</description>

      <title>Inhibition of splitting of the chiral and deconfinement transition due to rotation in QCD: the phase diagram of linear sigma model coupled to Polyakov loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of rigid rotation on the critical temperatures of deconfinement and chiral transitions in the linear sigma model coupled to quarks and the Polyakov loop. We point out the essential role of the causality condition, which requires that any point of the system should rotate slower than the velocity of light. We show that imposing this physical requirement leads to inhibition of the splitting between the chiral and confining transitions, which becomes negligibly small ({\Delta}T ~ 1 MeV or less) for experimentally relevant, slow angular velocities {\Omega} ~ 10 MeV of a 5-10 fm-sized systems. Moreover, the boundedness of the system has a much bigger effect on temperature splitting than the rotation itself: the splitting reaches 10 MeV in a small, one-fermi-sized non-rotating system. The temperature splitting may, however, become enhanced in an academic limit of ultra-relativistic regimes when the boundary of the system rotates at near-to-light velocities.</description>

      <title>Tridiagonal scalar mass matrix in the CP4 3HDM and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When parametrizing multi-Higgs potentials, it is desirable to express its coefficients via observables. This is routinely done for the 2HDM, but this approach often fails in more elaborate models. Here, we show that the scalar sector of the CP4 3HDM, an intriguing model based on an order-4 $CP$ symmetry, can also be parametrized in an observable-driven manner. The key feature that makes it work is the very special tridiagonal form of the $5\times 5$ neutral Higgs mass matrix. We propose a set of input observables and present an algorithm to reconstruct the coefficients of the potential through linear relations. Equipped with this procedure, we explore the scalar sector of the CP4 3HDM beyond the limitations of previous studies. In particular, we identify a viable and testable regime in which all additional Higgses lie in the 300-600 GeV range. This work offers a key ingredient for a future full phenomenological scan of this model.</description>

      <title>Primordial neutrinos and new physics: novel approach to solving neutrino Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how new physics influences the dynamics of cosmic neutrinos during their decoupling is crucial in light of upcoming precise cosmological observations and the need to reconcile cosmological and laboratory probes. Existing approaches to solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation are often model-dependent, computationally inefficient, and yield contradictory results. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel method to comprehensively study neutrino dynamics. We apply this method to several case studies, resolving the discrepancy in the literature about the impact of non-thermal neutrinos on $N_{\rm eff}$ and providing important insights about the role of decaying new physics particles on MeV plasma.</description>

      <title>Quark Stars as Hideouts For Color-spin-locked Quark Matter: Implications for Powering High-energy Electromagnetic Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15811v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of compact stars as hideouts for color-spin-locked (CSL) quark matter (QM) is investigated in both MIT bag model and Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Within the framework of NJL model, the idea of absolutely stable quark matter and the existence of conventional pure quark star (QS) are not supported; in addition, there appears to be no stable hybrid configuration above $2M_\odot$ as the hideout for CSL QM. The stable configurations of massive strange quark stars could be reproduced in the MIT bag model with QCD corrections being taken into account; moreover, they could act as the hiding place for the CSL QM. An interesting scenario is proposed that the phase transition to the CSL phase could occur in the cooling process. The CSL quark matter is an electromagnetic (EM) superconductor of Type-I, and a complete Meissner effect is expected. However, the analysis for this sizable superconductor indicates that most of the magnetic field is frozen inside the quark core with a critical strength, while in some special cases a small fraction could be expelled from a thin layer near the surface in a short time. The analysis on energetics and time scale suggests that this process could act as an inducement mechanism to power typical fast radio bursts, but as a single source of energy, it is unlikely to generate other EM emissions such as gamma-ray bursts and giant flares.</description>

      <title>Quantum Closures for Neutrino Moment Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A computationally efficient method for calculating the transport of neutrino flavor in simulations is to use angular moments of the neutrino one-body reduced density matrix, i.e., `quantum moments'. As with any moment-based radiation transport method, a closure is needed if the infinite tower of moment evolution equations is truncated. We derive a general parameterization of a quantum closure and the limits the parameters must satisfy in order for the closure to be physical. We then derive from multi-angle calculations the evolution of the closure parameters in two test cases which we then progressively insert into a moment evolution code and show how the parameters affect the moment results until the full multi-angle results are reproduced. This parameterization paves the way to setting prescriptions for genuine quantum closures adapted to neutrino transport in a range of situations.</description>

      <title>Line shape of the $J\psi \to \gamma \eta_{c}$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accurate description of the photon spectrum line shape is essential for extracting resonance parameters of the $\eta_c$ meson through the radiative transition $J/\psi \to \gamma \eta_{c}$. However, a persistent challenge remains in the form of a divergent tail at high photon energies, arising from the $E_{\gamma}^3$ factor in theoretical calculations. Various damping functions have been proposed to mitigate this effect in practical experiments, but their empirical nature lacks a rigorous theoretical basis. In this study, we introduce two key considerations: incorporating full-order contributions of the Bessel function in the overlap integral of charmonium wave functions and the phase space factor neglected in previous experimental studies. By accounting for these factors, we demonstrate a more rational and effective damping function of the divergent tail associated with the $E_{\gamma}^3$ term. We present the implications of these findings on experimental measurements and provide further insights through toy Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>How to Falsify String Theory at a Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The string landscape accommodates a broad range of possible effective field theories. This poses a challenge for extracting verifiable predictions as well as falsifiable signatures of string theory. Motivated by these considerations, in this work we observe that all known stringy Standard Models support only low-dimensional representations of the gauge group. While it is in principle possible to produce contrived models with higher-dimensional representations, these generically appear in a tower of states with lighter ones in lower-dimensional representations, i.e., not in isolation. With this in mind, we consider the phenomenologically well-motivated scenario given by adding a single Majorana field in a real, $n$-dimensional representation of $SU(2)_L$ with $n \geq 5$ \textit{and nothing else}. This scenario is not realized in any known string construction, and we conjecture that this is true of string theory in general. Detection of this scenario would thus amount to falsifying the (known) string landscape. We recast existing LHC searches for new electroweak states to extract updated bounds on this class of scenarios. Improved limits from future colliders and dark matter detection experiments provide additional routes to potentially falsifying string theory.</description>

      <title>Topological Sum Rules and Spectral Flows of Chiral and Gravitational Axion-like Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the structure of off-shell effective actions arising from chiral and gravitational anomalies, focusing on the $JJJ_A$ (axial-vector/vector/vector) and $J_A TT $ (axial-vector/stress-energy tensors) correlators, relevant in the analysis of anomaly-driven interactions in perturbation theory. Our approach relies on conformal field theory in momentum space, extended to chiral anomalies. The analysis centers on the presence of both particle poles and anomaly poles within these interactions, characterizing their behavior both in the conformal and non conformal limits. Through explicit computations, we show that universal sum rules in the longitudinal sector regulate these interactions for all kinematic conditions, extending previous analysis, and we discuss the resulting spectral flow, an area law of the absorptive part of the anomaly form factors as one moves away from or returns to the conformal point. These features are absent in the local effective action of anomaly interactions, commonly used in the description of axion-like particles. The spectral densities in both cases are shown to be self-similar. Our results further show that anomaly poles correspond to true particle poles only in the conformal limit, when the interaction describes a massless S-matrix process supported on a null-surface. Under these conditions, they can be effectively described by two kinetically mixed pseudoscalar fields propagating on the light-cone. These studies find application in polarized deeply inelastic scattering, axion-like dark matter and analogue systems such as topological materials.</description>

      <title>Constraining the equation of state in neutron-star cores via the long-ringdown signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimessenger signals from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are promising tools to infer the largely unknown properties of nuclear matter at densities that are presently inaccessible to laboratory experiments. The gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by BNS merger remnants, in particular, have the potential of setting tight constraints on the neutron-star equation of state (EOS) that would complement those coming from the late inspiral, direct mass-radius measurements, or ab-initio dense-matter calculations. To explore this possibility, we perform a representative series of general-relativistic simulations of BNS systems with EOSs carefully constructed so as to cover comprehensively the high-density regime of the EOS space. From these simulations, we identify a novel and tight correlation between the ratio of the energy and angular-momentum losses in the late-time portion of the post-merger signal, i.e., the ``long ringdown'', and the properties of the EOS at the highest pressures and densities in neutron-star cores. When applying this correlation to post-merger GW signals, we find a significant reduction of the EOS uncertainty at densities several times the nuclear saturation density, where no direct constraints are currently available. Hence, the long ringdown has the potential of providing new and stringent constraints on the state of matter in neutron stars in general and, in particular, in their cores.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating nucleon-nucleon correlations inherent to the strong nuclear force is one of the core goals in nuclear physics research. We showcase the unique opportunities offered by collisions of $^{16}$O nuclei at high-energy facilities to reveal detailed many-body properties of the nuclear ground state. We interface existing knowledge about the geometry of $^{16}$O coming from \textit{ab-initio} calculations of nuclear structure with transport simulations of high-energy $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions. Bulk observables in these processes, such as the elliptic flow or the fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum, are found to depend significantly on the input nuclear model and to be sensitive to realistic clustering and short-range repulsive correlations, effectively opening a new avenue to probe these features experimentally. This finding demonstrates collisions of oxygen nuclei as a tool to elucidate initial conditions of small collision systems while fostering connections with effective field theories of nuclei rooted in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

Abstract: Single-spin asymmetries observed in polarised deep-inelastic scattering are important probes of hadron structure. The Sivers asymmetry has been the focus of much attention in QCD phenomenology and is yet to be understood at the quark level. In this Letter, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the spatial distribution of a colour-Lorentz force acting on the struck quark in a proton. We determine a spin-independent confining force, as well as spin-dependent force distributions with local forces on the order of 3 GeV/fm. These distributions offer a complementary picture of the Sivers asymmetry in transversely polarised deep-inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>How new physics affects primordial neutrinos decoupling: Direct Simulation Monte Carlo approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological observations from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offer crucial insights into the Early Universe, enabling us to trace its evolution back to lifetimes as short as 0.01 seconds. Upcoming CMB spectrum measurements will achieve unprecedented precision, allowing for more accurate extraction of information about the primordial neutrinos. This provides an opportunity to test whether their properties align with the predictions of the standard cosmological model or indicate the presence of new physics that influenced the evolution of the MeV-temperature plasma. A key component in understanding how new physics may have affected primordial neutrinos is solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation. In this paper, we address this question by developing a novel approach -- neutrino Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC). We discuss it in-depth, highlighting its model independence, transparency, and computational efficiency -- features that current state-of-the-art methods lack. Then, we introduce a proof-of-concept implementation of the neutrino DSMC and apply it to several toy scenarios, showcasing key aspects of the primordial plasma's evolution in the presence of new physics.</description>

      <title>Disclosing the catalog pulsars dominating the Galactic positron flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic-ray flux of positrons is measured with high precision by the space-borne particle spectrometer AMS-02. The hypothesis that pulsars and their nebulae can significantly contribute to the excess of the AMS-02 positron flux has been consolidated after the observation of a $\gamma$-ray emission at GeV and TeV energies of a few degree size around a few sources, that provide indirect evidence that electron and positron pairs are accelerated to very high energies from these sources. By modeling the emission from pulsars in the ATNF catalog, we find that combinations of positron emission from cataloged pulsars and secondary production can fit the observed AMS-02 data. Our results show that a small number of nearby, middle-aged pulsars, particularly B1055-52, Geminga (J0633+1746), and Monogem (B0656+14), dominate the positron emission, contributing up to 80\% of the flux at energies above 100 GeV. From the fit to the data, we obtain a list of the most important sources for which we recommend multi-wavelength follow-up observations, particularly in the $\gamma$-ray and X-ray bands, to further constrain the injection and diffusion properties of positrons.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct Yang-Mills theory in the $\kappa$-space-time. We derive Yang-Mills equations in the $\kappa$-deformed space-time, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$, using the generalisation of Feynman's approach. We first derive the $\kappa$-deformed Wong's equation and using it, in the Jacobi identity involving velocities and coordinates of $\kappa$-deformed space-time, we derive the $\kappa$-deformed homogeneous Yang-Mills equations. We then construct the Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theory in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and show that it is invariant under SU(N) transformation. We also derive the expression for the force experienced by an isospin-carrying particle in the presence of Yang-Mills field in the $\kappa$-space-time.</description>

Abstract: The nova outburst can produce a large number of neutrinos, whether it is the nuclear reaction process during the explosion or the shock wave acceleration proton process. We study the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity of novae with CO white dwarf (WD) mass ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 $\rm M_{\odot}$ with different accretion rates $\dot{M}$, core temperatures $(T_{\mathrm{C}})$, and mixing degrees. We find that during the accretion phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by pp chains and plasma decay, and photon luminosity is greater than low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity. During the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by the CNO cycle and photon-neutrino, and the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity far exceeds the photon luminosity. We find that the more massive the WD, the shorter the cycle time and the higher the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. The higher the accretion rate, the lower the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. If the accretion mixing effect is not taken into account, the outburst interval becomes longer, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be increased. And for the cooler nova model $(T_{\mathrm{C}}=1\times10^{7}\rm K)$, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be lower during the accretion phase and higher at the TNR. We also predict the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum of the upcoming recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB). We estimate that the next T CrB outburst has a low-energy nuclear neutrino peak luminosity of $2.7\times10^{8}\ \rm L_{\nu,\odot}$ and a low-energy nuclear neutrino outburst duration of 88 days. In addition, we predict that the high-energy hadronic neutrino flux produced by T CrB nova can not be observed by the current-generation IceCube.</description>

      <title>Lattice techniques to investigate the strong $CP$ problem: lessons from a toy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have claimed that the strong $CP$ problem does not occur in QCD, proposing a new order of limits in volume and topological sectors when studying observables on the lattice. We study the effect of the topological term on a simple quantum mechanical rotor that allows a lattice description. We particularly focus on recent proposals to face the challenging problems that this study poses in lattice QCD and that are also present in the quantum rotor, such as topology freezing and the sign problem.</description>
