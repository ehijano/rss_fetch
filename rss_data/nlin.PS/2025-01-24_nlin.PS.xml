      <title>Quasi-fluxon bubble dynamics in a rapid oscillatory microwave field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we numerically study the dynamics of a two-dimensional quasi-fluxon bubble in an oscillatory regime stabilized by a localized annular force under a rapidly oscillating microwave field. The bubble exhibits two distinctly dynamical regimes. At first, the oscillation of the bubble wall scales up linearly with the microwave field frequency until it reaches a cutoff, after which it detaches from the external field, returning to its natural oscillation frequency. The amplitude of the quasi-fluxon oscillations is inversely proportional to the square of the microwave field frequency. Following a simplified model based on the Kapitza approach, we proved that this dynamical behavior is characteristic of systems with a harmonic potential subjected to a rapidly oscillating field. Possible applications of microwave detection are discussed.</description>

      <title>Stabilization and Destabilization of Multimode Solitons in Nonlinear Degenerate Multi-Pass Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical solitons in multimode nonlinear optical systems offer a unique platform for exploring the interplay of nonlinearity, dispersion, and spatial mode coupling, offering insights into complex nonlinear wave phenomena. Multi-pass cavities (MPCs) incorporating nonlinear Kerr media serve as prototypical systems, enabling high-efficiency supercontinuum generation and pulse compression. However, stabilizing femtosecond laser pulses in solid-medium-based MPCs (solid MPCs) under high Kerr nonlinearity remains a significant challenge due to multimode coupling, which disrupts beam stability. In this work, we address this challenge by investigating the stability of laser pulses in MPCs using Floquet analysis and first-order perturbation theory. We identify novel mode-coupling-suppression (MCS) medium lengths, where destructive interference among multimode wave components suppresses coupling and facilitates soliton stabilization. Under MCS conditions, we demonstrate stable beam propagation in solid MPCs with nonlinear phases up to 1.85{\pi} per pass, achieving 10-fold pulse compression with exceptional spatio-spectral homogeneity. Our findings offer valuable guidance for designing advanced MPCs with tailored Kerr media.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal interactions induce frequency shifts in superradiant lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiant lasers, which consist of incoherently driven atoms coupled to a lossy cavity, are a promising source of coherent light due to their stable frequency and superior narrow linewidth. We show that when a fraction of the atoms is not driven, a shift in the lasing frequency and a broadening of the linewidth occur, limiting the performance of a superradiant laser. We explain this behavior by identifying nonreciprocal interactions between driven and undriven atoms, i.e., competing alignment and antialignment of their dipoles. Our results have implications for the realization of superradiant lasers, establishing the relevance of nonreciprocal phenomena for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Wrinkling and imaging of thin curved sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin films or sheets subjected to external forces often undergo mechanical instability, leading to regular patterns of wrinkles, folds, and creases. As can be anticipated from the difficulty of flattening a curved globe, any natural curvature of the sheet will have a strong influence on these instabilities. Here, we develop a non-invasive synthetic schlieren imaging technique to image and reconstruct the surface of wrinkling curved sheets, confined to float on water. Our method circumvents the small-amplitude limit of related imaging techniques, and we demonstrate robust means to estimate the reconstruction accuracy. We then evaluate how the sign and magnitude of Gaussian curvature affects the wrinkling of thin curved sheets, and compare observations of the wrinkle wavelength, amplitude and domain structure with recent theoretical predictions. While generally validating model predictions, we find that the assumption of a conserved surface area during wrinkling should be treated with some care. The control of wrinkling behavior demonstrated here can have application in the design of liquid lenses, microfluidics, active textured surfaces, and flexible electronic components.</description>

      <title>Thermal lifetime of breathers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the lifetime of localized excitations in nonlinear lattices, called breathers, when a thermalized lattice is perturbed with localized energy delivered to a single site. We develop a method to measure the time it takes for the system to approach equilibrium based on a single scalar quantity, the participation number, and deduce the value corresponding to thermal equilibrium. We observe the time to achieve thermalization as a function of the energy of the excited site. We explore a variety of different physical system models. The result is that the lifetime of breathers increases exponentially with the breather energy for all the systems. This increase becomes observable when this energy is larger than approximately ten times the local average thermal energy. These results may provide a method to detect the existence of breathers in real systems.</description>
