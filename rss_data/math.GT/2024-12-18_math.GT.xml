      <title>Stable Andrews-Curtis Conjecture via Fake Surfaces and Zeeman Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an induction scheme that aims at establishing the stable Andrews-Curtis conjecture in the affirmative. The stable Andrews-Curtis conjecture is equivalent to the conjecture that every contractible fake surface is 3-deformable to a point. We prove that every contractible fake surface of complexity less than 6 is 3-deformable to a point by induction.</description>

      <title>Thistlethwaite Theorems for Knotoids and Linkoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Thistlethwaite theorem for links can be phrased as asserting that the Kauffman bracket of a link can be obtained from an evaluation of the Bollob\'as-Riordan polynomial of a ribbon graph associated to one of the link's Kauffman states. In this paper, we extend this result to knotoids, which are a generalization of knots that naturally arises in the study of protein topology. Specifically we extend the Thistlethwaite theorem to the twisted arrow polynomial of knotoids, which is an invariant of knotoids on compact, not necessarily orientable, surfaces. To this end, we define twisted knotoids, marked ribbon graphs, and their arrow- and Bollob\'as-Riordan polynomials. We also extend the Thistlethwaite theorem to the loop arrow polynomial of knotoids in the plane, and to spherical linkoids.</description>

      <title>Orbits by the up-down action of braid diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12553v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set of all virtual or classical braid diagrams forms a monoid and gives a natural monoid action on a direct product of ${\mathbb Z}$. We call this action the up-down action. In this paper, we determine the orbit of any tuple of ${\mathbb Z}$ under the up-down action of virtual or classical braid diagrams. Moreover, we determine the orbit for irreducible braid diagrams. We also consider the isotropy submonoid and give a condition for a braid diagram to admit an up-down coloring to its closure.</description>

      <title>Alterfold Theory and Topological Modular Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a topological paradigm in alterfold topological quantum field theory to explore various concepts, including modular invariants, $\alpha$-induction and connections in Morita contexts within a modular fusion category of non-zero global dimension over an arbitrary field. Using our topological perspective, we provide streamlined quick proofs and broad generalizations of a wide range of results. These include all theoretical findings by B\"{o}ckenhauer, Evans, and Kawahigashi on $\alpha$-induction. Additionally, we introduce the concept of double $\alpha$-induction for pairs of Morita contexts and define its higher-genus $Z$-transformation, which remains invariant under the action of the mapping class group. Finally, we establish a novel integral identity for modular invariance across multiple Morita contexts, unifying several known identities as special cases.</description>

      <title>Presentations of the braid group of the complex reflection group $G(d,d,n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the braid group associated to the complex reflection group $G(d,d,n)$ is an index $d$ subgroup of the braid group of the orbifold quotient of the complex numbers by a cyclic group of order $d$. We also give a compatible presentation of $G(d,d,n)$ and its braid group for each tagged triangulation of the disk with $n$ marked points on its boundary and an interior marked point (interpreted as a cone point of degree $d$) in such a way that the presentations of Brou\'{e}-Malle-Rouquier correspond to a special tagged triangulation.</description>

      <title>A Simple Characterization of Adequate Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Jones diameter of a link is twice its crossing number whenever the breadth of its Jones polynomial equals the difference between the crossing number and the Turaev genus. This implies that such link is adequate, as per the characterization provided in [5, Theorem 1.1]. By combining this with the result in [1, Theorem 3.2], we obtain a characterization of adequate links using these numerical link invariants. As an application, we provide a criterion to obstruct a link from being quasi-alternating. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound for the crossing number of certain classes of links, aiding in determining the crossing number of the link in specific cases.</description>

      <title>Solutions of tetrahedron equation from quantum cluster algebra associated with symmetric butterfly quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>
