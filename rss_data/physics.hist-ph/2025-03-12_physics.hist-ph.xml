      <title>Classical Mechanics as an Emergent Compression of Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correspondence principle states that classical mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics in the appropriate limits. However, beyond this heuristic rule, an information-theoretic perspective reveals that classical mechanics is a compressed, lower-information representation of quantum reality. Quantum mechanics encodes significantly more information through superposition, entanglement, and phase coherence, which are lost due to decoherence, phase averaging, and measurement, reducing the system to a classical probability distribution. This transition is quantified using Kolmogorov complexity, where classical systems require \( O(N) \) bits of information, while quantum descriptions require \( O(2^N) \), showing an exponential reduction in complexity. Further justification comes from Ehrenfest's theorem, which ensures that quantum expectation values obey Newton's laws, and path integral suppression, which eliminates non-classical trajectories when \( S \gg \hbar \). Thus, rather than viewing quantum mechanics as an extension of classical mechanics, we argue that classical mechanics is a lossy, computationally reduced encoding of quantum physics, emerging from a systematic loss of quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>How (Not) to Understand Weak Measurements of Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To-date, the most elaborated attempt to complete quantum mechanics by the addition of hidden variables is the de Broglie-Bohm (pilot wave) theory (dBBT). It endows particles with definite positions at all times. Their evolution is governed by a deterministic dynamics. By construction, however, the individual particle trajectories generically defy detectability in principle. Of late, this lore might seem to have been called into question in light of so-called weak measurements. Due to their characteristic weak coupling between the measurement device and the system under study, they permit the experimental probing of quantum systems without essentially disturbing them. It's natural therefore to think that weak measurements of velocity in particular offer to actually observe the particle trajectories. If true, such a claim would not only experimentally demonstrate the incompleteness of quantum mechanics: it would provide support of dBBT in its standard form, singling it out from an infinitude of empirically equivalent alternative choices for the particle dynamics. Here we examine this possibility. Our result is deflationary: weak velocity measurements constitute no new arguments, let alone empirical evidence, in favour of standard dBBT; One mustn't na\"ively identify weak and actual positions. Weak velocity measurements admit of a straightforward standard quantum mechanical interpretation, independent of any commitment to particle trajectories and velocities. This is revealed by a careful reconstruction of the physical arguments on which the description of weak velocity measurements rests. It turns out that for weak velocity measurements to be reliable, one must already presuppose dBBT in its standard form: in this sense, they can provide no new argument, empirical or otherwise, for dBBT and its standard guidance equation.</description>
