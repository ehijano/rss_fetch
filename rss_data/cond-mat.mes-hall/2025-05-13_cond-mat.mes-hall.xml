      <title>Coulomb Interaction-Stabilized Isolated Narrow Bands with Chern Numbers $\mathcal{C} &gt; 1$ in Twisted Rhombohedral Trilayer-Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects have been discovered in two-dimensional moir\'{e} materials when a topologically nontrivial band with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$ is partially doped. Remarkably, superlattice Bloch bands can carry higher Chern numbers that defy the Landau-level paradigm and may even host exotic fractionalized states with non-Abelian quasiparticles. Inspired by this exciting possibility, we propose twisted \textit{rhombohedral} trilayer-bilayer graphene at $\theta \sim 1.2^\circ$ as a field-tunable quantum anomalous Chern insulator that features spectrally-isolated, kinetically-quenched, and topologically-nontrivial bands with $\mathcal{C} = 2,3$ favorable for fractional phases once fractionally doped, as characterized by their quantum geometry. Based on extensive self-consistent mean-field calculations, we show that these phases are stabilized by Coulomb interactions and are robust against variations in dielectric environment, tight-binding hopping parameters, and lattice relaxation.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Sub-Wavelength Microwave Polarization Switch Implemented with Directed Surface Acoustic Waves in a Magnonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to switch the polarization of a transmitted electromagnetic wave from vertical to horizontal, or vice versa, is of great technological interest because of its many applications in long distance communication. Binary bits can be encoded in two orthogonal polarizations and transmitted securely from point to point. Polarization switches, however, are usually much larger than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. Consequently, most research in this area has focused on the optical regime where the wavelength is relatively short (~1 micron), so that the switch being much larger than the wavelength is not too inconvenient. However, this changes in the microwave regime where the wavelength is much larger (typically &gt; 1 cm). That makes a microwave ultra-sub-wavelength polarization switch very attractive. Here, we report such a switch made of an array of magnetostrictive nanomagnets (~100 nm lateral dimension) deposited on a piezoelectric substrate to make an "artificial magnonic crystal". A surface acoustic wave (SAW) launched in the substrate with suitable electrodes excites spin waves in the nanomagnets via phonon-magnon coupling, resulting in radiation of electromagnetic waves via magnon-photon coupling. The polarization of the beam radiated in a given direction at a given frequency can be rotated through ~90 degrees by changing the direction of SAW propagation in the substrate to implement the polarization switch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The processes of electron-electron scattering in a quantum well in a quantizing magnetic field are considered. The matrix of electron-electron scattering rates containing all types of transitions is calculated. This matrix is analysed, and the relative magnitude of the rates of transitions of different types is established. The behaviour of electron-electron scattering processes at changing the orientation of the quantising magnetic field is established.</description>

      <title>Modelling of time-dependent electrostatic effects and AFM-based surface conductivity characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) combined with electrical modes provides a powerful contactless approach to characterize material electrical properties at the nanoscale. However, conventional electrostatic models often overlook dynamic charge effects, which are particularly relevant for 2D materials deposited on insulating substrates. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework that extends traditional electrostatic models by incorporating charge dynamics, analyzing two key cases: quasi-ideal conductors and quasi-ideal insulators. Our model establishes a characteristic timescale, $\tau$, which governs charge redistribution and measurement reliability. Experimental validation using Graphene Oxide, Reduced Graphene Oxide, and lightly reduced GO demonstrates strong dependence of frequency shift on surface conductivity, confirming our predictions. Temperature-dependent measurements further reveal conductivity variations consistent with disordered electronic materials. These findings provide critical insight into the impact of finite surface conductivity on AFM-based techniques and establish a novel method for evaluating charge dynamics in individual flakes of 2D materials and propose an alternative, contactless method for estimating surface conductivity.</description>

      <title>Controllable creation of topological boundary states in topological-insulator-based Josephson corner junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in condensed matter systems have attracted great attention in the past two decades, due to their interesting physics and potential application in topological quantum computing (TQC). However, the topologically protected nature of MZMs still need more experimental verifications. In this study, we have realized controllable creation of a topological boundary state at the corner of topological insulator (TI)-based Josephson corner junctions. This state demonstrates protected existence across a broad region in parametric space, and exhibits a non-2{\pi}-period but 4{\pi}-period-compatible energy-phase relation. Our study suggests that TI-based Josephson junctions, as proposed in the Fu-Kane scheme of TQC, may provide a promising platform for hosting and braiding MZMs.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal electrodynamics of two-dimensional anisotropic magneto-plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hydrodynamic model, grounded in Madelung's formalism, to describe collective electronic motion in anisotropic materials. This model incorporates nonlocal contributions from the Thomas-Fermi quantum pressure and quantum effects arising from the Bohm potential. We derive analytical expressions for the magnetoplasmon dispersion and nonlocal optical conductivity. To demonstrate the applicability of the model, we examine electrons in the conduction band of monolayer phosphorene, an exemplary anisotropic two-dimensional electron gas. The dispersion of plasmons derived from our hydrodynamic approach is closely aligned with that predicted by ab~initio calculations. Then, we use our model to analyze few-layer black phosphorus, whose measured infrared optical response is hyperbolic. Our results reveal that the incorporation of nonlocal and quantum effects in the optical conductivity prevents black phosphorus from supporting hyperbolic surface plasmon polaritons. We further demonstrate that the predicted wavefront generated by an electric dipole exhibits a significant difference between the local and nonlocal descriptions for the optical conductivity. This study underscores the necessity of moving beyond local approximations when investigating anisotropic systems capable of hosting strongly confined plasmon-polaritons.</description>

      <title>Hall effect in slip flow of two-dimensional electron fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hall effect in high-mobility 2D mesoscopic samples with hydrodynamic electron transport is related to manifestation of non-dissipative Hall viscosity at classical magnetic fields. However, the latter can be obscured by the particular geometry of the electronic flow through constriction and boundary effects. In this work we consider the low-field Hall resistivity of the narrow channel with hydrodynamic electron transport. Using kinetic theory we show that the hydrodynamic Hall viscosity contribution is accompanied by the comparable ballistic contribution associated with the formation of Knudsen layers in the slip flow of 2D electron fluid. The studied ballistic correction is present at any specularity of the boundary reflection and lowers the magnitude of the total negative size-dependent correction to the bulk Hall resistivity. The obtained analytic expression for the total Hall resistivity can be used to estimate the boundary reflection coefficient in high-mobility structures.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of returning Thouless pump in a Berry dipole system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Thouless pump, a cornerstone of topological physics, enables unidirectional quantized wave/particle transport via geometric Berry phase engineering in periodically driven systems. While decades of research have been dedicated to monopole-mediated pumping, mechanisms governed by higher-order singularities like Berry dipoles remain unexplored. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of a Berry-dipole-mediated returning Thouless pump (RTP) in a 1D acoustic waveguide array achieved through adiabatic encircling of a Berry dipole singularity. During this adiabatic cycle, an initial edge-localized mode first delocalizes into the bulk and eventually returns to the original edge, marking the characteristic signature of the RTP. Notably, this RTP exhibits an interesting feature of pseudospin flipping, distinguishing it from previously proposed RTP models. The demonstrated RTP contrasts sharply with the well-studied monopole-governed pumps that feature unidirectional transport.</description>

      <title>Absolute measurement of the exchange interaction in an InSb quantum well using Landau-level tunnelling spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied InSb quantum well devices using Landau level tunneling spectroscopy through a three-terminal differential conductance technique. This method is similar to filled state scanning tunneling microscopy but uses a stationary contact instead of a mobile tip to analyze the two-dimensional electron system. Applying magnetic fields up to 15~T, we identified clear peaks in the differential current-voltage profiles, indicative of Landau level formation. By examining deviations from the expected Landau fan diagram, we extract an absolute value for the exchange-induced energy shift. Through an empirical analysis, we derive a formula describing the exchange shift as a function of both magnetic field strength and electron filling. Our findings indicate that the emptying of the $\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$ Landau levels causes an exchange interaction energy shift in the $\nu=1$ level. Unlike prior studies that infer level energies relative to one another and report oscillatory g-factor behavior, our method references the energy of the Landau levels above the filled states of the contact under a bias voltage, revealing that only the ground state Landau level experiences a measurable exchange shift.</description>

      <title>Elevated Hall Responses as Indicators of Edge Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate edge reconstruction scenarios in the $\nu = 1$ quantum Hall state, focusing on configurations with upstream and downstream charge and neutral modes. Our analysis shows that the coexistence of upstream charge and neutral modes in a multi-terminal geometry can cause pronounced deviations from the expected quantized values of electrical ($e^2/h$) and thermal ($\pi^2 k_\text{B}^{2}T/3h$) Hall conductance dictated by bulk-boundary correspondence. In particular, we find that both electrical and thermal Hall conductances can be significantly enhanced -- exceeding twice their unreconstructed values -- offering a clear diagnostic of edge reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of monolayer-CrTe$_2$: an antiferromagnetic 2D van der Waals material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic van der Waals materials are an important building block to realize spintronic functionalities in heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Yet, establishing their magnetic and electronic properties and the interrelationship between the magnetic ground state and electronic structure is often challenging because only a limited number of techniques can probe magnetism and electronic structure on length scales of tens to hundreds of nanometers. Chromium chalcogenides are a class of 2D magnetic materials for which a rich interplay between structure and magnetism has been predicted. Here, we combine angle-resolved photoemission and quasi-particle interference imaging to establish the electronic structure of a monolayer of CrTe$_2$ on graphite. From a comparison of model calculations with spectroscopic mapping using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy we establish the magnetic ground state and the low energy electronic structure. We demonstrate that the band structure of monolayer CrTe$_2$ is captured well by density functional theory (DFT) in a DFT+U framework when a Coulomb repulsion of $U=2.5\mathrm{eV}$ is accounted for.</description>

Abstract: The current work studies the electrocatalytic performance of NaNbO$_3$ microcubes decorated with WO$_3$ nanoparticles on Printex L6 at varying concentrations (1%, 3%, 5%, and 10% by weight) for H$_2$O$_2$ electrogeneration aiming for future use in electrochemical advanced oxidation processes for organic pollutant degradation H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration was studied using oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. Electrochemical results revealed an improvement in H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration for the NaNbO$_3$@WO$_3$/C materials compared to that achieved with Printex L6 carbon. Notably, the 5% NaNbO$_3$@WO$_3$/C electrocatalyst exhibited a higher ring current for oxygen reduction reaction and promoted a 2.1-electron transfer, facilitating a higher rate of H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration through the 2-electron mechanism. Also, enhancing oxygen-containing functional groups has shown the capability to thoroughly adjust characteristics and enhance active sites, increasing H$_2$O$_2$  electrogeneration. These findings suggest that 5% NaNbO$_3$@WO$_3$/C electrocatalysts hold promise for in situ hydrogen peroxide electrogeneration.</description>

      <title>Graphene-based magnetoelastic biosensor for COVID-19 serodiagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an innovative magnetoelastic (ME) biosensor using graphene functionalized with the SARS-CoV-2 N protein for antibody detection via magnetoelastic resonance. Graphene was chosen for its biocompatibility and high surface area, enabling efficient antigen adsorption, validated by techniques such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Changes in Raman bands (a $\sim 10~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ shift in the 2D band and an increase in the $I_D/I_G$ ratio from 0.03 to 0.60) confirmed non-covalent interactions and enhanced surface coverage with ~100 $\mu$g of N protein. Tests using human plasma (10 RT-PCR-positive and 10 negative samples) demonstrated a clear distinction between groups using graphene sensors functionalized with ~100 $\mu$g of N protein. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) validation corroborated the results. Optimization of protein concentration and biofunctionalization time highlighted the importance of homogeneous surface coverage for reproducibility of the graphene-based ME biosensor. The platform combines graphene's advantages with the wireless, real-time detection capabilities of ME sensors, offering low cost, high sensitivity, and potential for automation, with applications in point-of-care diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Colossal anomalous Stark shift in defect emission of undulated 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a strikingly new physical phenomenon that mirror symmetry breaking in undulated two-dimensional (2D) materials induces a colossal Stark shift in defect emissions, occurring without external electric field F, termed anomalous Stark effect. First-principles calculations of multiple defects in bent 2D hBN uncover the fundamental physical reasonings for this anomalous effect and reveal this arises due to strong coupling between flexoelectric polarization and defect dipole moment. This flexo-dipole interaction, similar to that in traditional Stark effect due to F, results in zero-phonon line (ZPL) shifts &gt;500 meV for defects like NBVN and CBVN at $\kappa$ = 1/nm, exceeding typical Stark shifts by 2-3 orders of magnitude. The large ZPL shifts variations with curvature and bending direction offers a method to identify nanotube chirality and explain the large variability in single photon emitters' wavelength in 2D materials, with additional implications for designing nano-electro-mechanical and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Recovery dynamics of a gap-engineered transmon after a quasiparticle burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionizing radiation impacts create bursts of quasiparticle density in superconducting qubits. These bursts severely degrade qubit coherence for a prolonged period of time and can be detrimental for quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally resolve quasiparticle bursts in 3D gap-engineered transmon qubits by continuously monitoring qubit transitions. Gap engineering allowed us to reduce the burst detection rate by a factor of a few. This modest reduction falls several orders of magnitude short of the reduction expected if the quasiparticles quickly thermalize to the cryostat temperature. We associate the limited effect of gap engineering with the slow thermalization of the phonons in our chips after the burst.</description>

      <title>Dynamic interfacial effects in ultrathin ferromagnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetization dynamics of an ultrathin Co (1.5 nm) /Py (1.5 nm) bilayer system from femtosecond (fs) to nanosecond (ns) timescales. Magnetization dynamics in the fs timescales is characterized as a highly non-equilibrium regime due to an ultrafast reduction of magnetization by laser excitation. On the other hand, the dynamics in the ns timescales is characterized as a close-to-equilibrium regime involving the excitation of coherent magnons. We demonstrate that the interfacial interaction between the Co and Py layers in these two non-equilibrium regimes across the timescales is dynamic and simultaneously influences the magnetization loss in the fs timescales and the magnon dynamics in the ns timescales. On ultrafast (fs) timescales, comparison between time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (TR-MOKE) measurements and temperature-based {\mu}T model simulations reveals that the bilayer exhibits demagnetization dynamics intermediate between those of its individual layers. When driven far from equilibrium by ultrashort laser pulse excitation, the magnetization dynamics of the individual Co and Py layers appear to remain decoupled and evolve independently in the initial stages of the ultrafast response. On the other hand, in the ns regime, the two individual layers of the bilayer precess together at the same frequency in a coupled manner as one effective single layer. Furthermore, by correlating the ultrafast demagnetization to precessional damping we attempt to bridge the two non-equilibrium regimes across fs to ns timescales. These results improve our understanding of magnetization dynamics across timescales in ultrathin exchanged-coupled ferromagnetic bilayers and provide valuable insights for the design of high-frequency and energy efficient spintronic device concepts.</description>

      <title>Runtime Quantum Advantage with Digital Quantum Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate experimentally that the bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm on IBM's 156-qubit devices can outperform simulated annealing (SA) and CPLEX in time-to-approximate solutions for specific higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems. We suitably select problem instances that are challenging for classical methods, running in fractions of minutes even with multicore processors. On the other hand, our counterdiabatic quantum algorithms obtain similar or better results in at most a few seconds on quantum hardware, achieving runtime quantum advantage. Our analysis reveals that the performance improvement becomes increasingly evident as the system size grows. Given the rapid progress in quantum hardware, we expect that this improvement will become even more pronounced, potentially leading to a quantum advantage of several orders of magnitude. Our results indicate that available digital quantum processors, when combined with specific-purpose quantum algorithms, exhibit a runtime quantum advantage even in the absence of quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Dominant orbital magnetization in the prototypical altermagnet MnTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is an unconventional form of antiferromagnetism characterized by momentum-dependent spin polarization of electronic states and zero net magnetization, arising from specific crystalline symmetries. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken time-reversal symmetry, altermagnets can exhibit finite net magnetization and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), phenomena typically associated with ferromagnets. Due to the dependence of AHE on magnetization, understanding the interplay between spin and orbital contributions to magnetization is essential for interpreting experiments and designing altermagnetic devices. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the intrinsic spin and orbital magnetization of the magnetic ground state of the prototypical altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe. We find that SOC induces weak ferromagnetism through spin canting, accompanied by a slight in-plane rotation of the N\'eel vector. Notably, we identify a significant net orbital magnetization of 0.176 {\mu}B per unit cell oriented along the z-axis, while the spin magnetization in the same direction is much smaller at 0.002 {\mu}B. By varying the chemical potential, we show that the spin magnetization is tunable through hole doping, whereas the orbital magnetization remains robust against carrier density changes. These results highlight the important role of orbital magnetization and establish its relevance for orbital-based phenomena in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement theory of ultra-thin films: electronic, thermal and superconducting properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of ultra-thin films with a thickness ranging from a few tens of nanometers to just about 1-2 nanometers. While these materials are still effectively 3D in many respects, traditional theories as well as ab initio methods struggle to describe their properties as measured in experiments. In particular, standard approaches to quantum confinement rely on hard-wall boundary conditions, which neglect the unavoidable, ubiquitous, atomic-scale irregularities of the interface. Recently, a unified theoretical approach to quantum confinement has been proposed which is able to effectively take the real nature of the interface into account, and can efficiently be implemented in synergy with microscopic theories. Its predictions for the electronic properties such as electrical conductivity of semiconductor thin films or critical temperature of superconducting thin films, have been successfully verified in comparison with experimental data. The same confinement principles lead to new laws for the phonon density of states and for the heat capacity of thin films, again in agreement with the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Ce(III) Ions in Hydroxyapatite: Nanoscale Environment Investigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of cerium-doped hydroxyapatite (Ce-HAp), a material of interest for biomedical applications due to the good biocompatibility of hydroxyapatite and the antioxidant activity of cerium ions. We employ advanced electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques, including continuous wave (CW) and pulsed X-band experiments, electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM), and electron-electron double resonance (ELDOR)-detected NMR (EDNMR) to investigate the local coordination and electron environment of cerium ions in the hydroxyapatite matrix. The experimental results are complemented by g-tensor calculation, which allows us to interpret the EPR spectra and identify the types of paramagnetic centers. Our results show that during the synthesis of hydroxyapatite powder by the chemical precipitation method using nitrates, cerium ions enter the structure mainly in the trivalent state and replace calcium ions in two nonequivalent positions. In addition to cerium ions, nitrate radicals are found in the HAp structure. Heat treatment reduces the amount of nitrate radicals and increases crystallinity. This work expands the understanding of the role of cerium in calcium phosphates and provides a methodological basis for the characterization of doped bioceramics using various EPR approaches.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional flat Landau levels in an inhomogeneous acoustic crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When electrons moving in two-dimensions (2D) are subjected to a strong uniform magnetic field, they form flat bands called Landau levels, which are the basis for the quantum Hall effect. Landau levels can also arise from pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs) induced by lattice distortions; for example, mechanically straining graphene causes its Dirac quasiparticles to form a characteristic set of unequally-spaced Landau levels, including a zeroth Landau level. In three-dimensional (3D) systems, there has thus far been no experimental demonstration of Landau levels or any other type of flat band. For instance, applying a uniform magnetic field to materials hosting Weyl quasiparticles, the 3D generalizations of Dirac quasiparticles, yields bands that are non-flat in the direction of the field. Here, we report on the experimental realization of a flat 3D Landau level in an acoustic crystal. Starting from a lattice whose bandstructure exhibits a nodal ring, we design an inhomogeneous distortion corresponding to a specific pseudomagnetic vector potential (PVP) that causes the nodal ring states to break up into Landau levels, with a zeroth Landau level that is flat along all three directions. These findings point to the possibility of using nodal ring materials to generate 3D flat bands, to access strong interactions and other interesting physical regimes in 3D.</description>

      <title>Radio-frequency cascade readout of coupled spin qubits fabricated using a 300~mm wafer process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01241v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced semiconductor manufacturing offers a promising path to scaling up silicon-based quantum processors by improving yield, uniformity, and integration. Individual spin qubit control and readout have been demonstrated in quantum dots fabricated on 300 mm wafer metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes, yet quantum processors require two-qubit interactions to operate. Here, we use a 300 mm natural silicon MOS process customised for spin qubits and demonstrate coherent control of two electron spins using the exchange interaction, forming the basis for entangling gates such as $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We measure gate dephasing times of up to $T_2^{*}\approx500$ ns with a quality factor of 10. For readout, we introduce a novel dispersive readout technique, the radio-frequency electron cascade, that simplifies the qubit unit cell while providing high gain. This method achieves a signal-to-noise ratio of 6 within an integration time of 46 ${\mu}$s, the highest-performing dispersive readout demonstration in a planar MOS process. The combination of sensitive dispersive readout with industrial-grade manufacturing marks a crucial step towards large-scale integration of silicon quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: The realization of electron-spin resonance at the single-atom level using scanning tunneling microscopy has opened new avenues for coherent quantum sensing and quantum state manipulation at the ultimate size limit. This allows to build many-body Hamiltonians and the study of their complex physical behavior. Recently, a novel qubit platform has emerged from this field, raising questions about the driving mechanism from single-atom magnets. In this work, we demonstrate how single-atom magnets can be used to drive a nearby single spin qubit efficiently. We show that the modulation of exchange coupling is the primary driving force, which successfully reproduces Rabi rates in the tens of MHz range, consistent with experimental data, while also addressing critical aspects related to the optimization of experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Skew Scattering and Giant Nonreciprocal Magneto-Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skew scattering is the well-known dominant mechanism for anomalous Hall transport in highly conductive systems. However, despite extensive research, the primary mechanism governing nonlinear (nonreciprocal) magneto-transport in clean samples remains unknown. This theoretical gap has impeded the development of design principles for efficient nonreciprocal devices. Here, we unveil a hitherto unexplored effect in nonreciprocal magneto-transport from cooperative action of Lorentz force and skew scattering. The significance of this Lorentz skew scattering mechanism lies in that it dominates both longitudinal and transverse responses in highly conductive systems, and it exhibits a scaling behavior distinct from all known mechanisms. At low temperature, it shows a cubic scaling in linear conductivity, whereas the scaling becomes quartic at elevated temperature when phonon scattering kicks in. Applying our developed microscopic theory to surface transport in topological crystalline insulator SnTe and bulk transport in Weyl semimetals leads to significant results, suggesting a new route to achieve giant transport nonreciprocity in high-mobility materials with topological band features.</description>

      <title>Controlling particle-hole symmetry of fractional quantum hall states in trilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed experimental study of the particle-hole symmetry (PHS) of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states about half filling in a multiband system. Specifically, we focus on the lowest Landau level of the monolayer-like band of Bernal stacked trilayer graphene (TLG). In pristine TLG, the excitation energy gaps, Land\'e g-factor, effective mass, and disorder broadening of the odd-denominator FQH states are identical to their hole-conjugate counterpart. This precise PH symmetry stems from the lattice mirror symmetry that precludes Landau-level mixing. Introducing a non-zero displacement field \(D\) disrupts this mirror symmetry, facilitating the hybridization between the monolayer-like and bilayer-like Landau levels. This inter-band coupling enhances the Landau level mixing factor $\eta$ and activates three-body interactions -- both of which explicitly break the PHS of FQHs. As a result, conventional FQHs are completely destabilized, offering a route to engineer symmetry breaking of FQHs in a controlled way. We establish that the PHS breaking in TLG is of extrinsic origin and is fundamentally distinct from the intrinsic, interaction-driven symmetry breaking observed in the lowest Landau levels of single-layer and bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>The role of Berry curvature derivatives in the optical activity of time-invariant crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum geometry and topology are fundamental concepts of modern condensed matter physics, underpinning phenomena ranging from the quantum Hall effect to protected surface states. The Berry curvature, a central element of this framework, is well established for its key role in electronic transport, whereas its impact on the optical properties of crystals remains comparatively unexplored. Here, we derive a relation between optical activity, defined by the gyration tensor, and the k-derivatives of the Berry curvature at optical resonances in the Brillouin zone. We systematically determine which of these derivatives are non-zero or constrained by symmetry across all time-reversal-invariant crystal classes. In particular, we analytically demonstrate that circular dichroism emerges in chiral crystal classes as a result of a non-zero Berry curvature k-derivative along the optical axis, and we interpret this finding based on the conservation of angular momentum in light-matter interactions. This work establishes a quantum-geometric framework for optical activity in solids and it opens new routes to probe quantum geometry via linear and nonlinear optics.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the problem of transmission of quasiparticles through a rectangular potential barrier, for semimetals featuring quadratic-in-momentum band-crossings at a nodal point. Although this was considered in Annals of Physics 419 (2020) 168235, the solutions corresponding to evanescent waves were missed, leading to a partial fulfillment of the boundary conditions required to determine the piecewise-continuous wavefunctions. In this paper, our aim is to correct those shortcomings, recompute the transmission coefficients, and show the resulting behaviour of the conductivity and the Fano factor for some representative parameter values.</description>

Abstract: A deep understanding of the correlation between electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is crucial to the development of quantum devices in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). In this work, we first establish a fully quantum mechanical approach for transport through a NEMS device, which is valid for arbitrary bias voltages, temperatures, and electro-mechanical couplings. We find an anomalous current-electric field characteristics at a low bias, where the current decreases with a rising electric field, associated with the backward tunneling of electrons for a weak mechanical damping. We reveal that this intriguing behavior arises from a combined effect of mechanical motion and Coulomb blockade, where the rapid increase of backward tunneling events at a large oscillation amplitude suppresses the forward current due to prohibition of double occupation. In the opposite limit of strong damping, the oscillator dissipates its energy to the environment and relaxes to the ground state rapidly. Electrons then transport via the lowest vibrational state such that the net current and its corresponding noise have a vanishing dependence on the electric field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the orbital magneto-electric effect (OME) -- the generation of a steady-state orbital angular momentum density -- is partly the result of a nonequilibrium dipole moment generated via Zitterbewegung and proportional to the quantum metric. For tilted massive Dirac fermions this dipole gives the only contribution to the OME in the insulating case, while the intrinsic and extrinsic OMEs occur for different electric field orientations, yielding an experimental detection method. Our results suggest quantum metric engineering as a route towards maximizing orbital torques.</description>

      <title>Interface-Bound States and Majorana Zero Modes in Lateral Heterostructures of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$ with Proximity-Induced Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the emergence of interface-bound states, particularly Majorana zero modes (MZMs), in a lateral heterostructure composed of two three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs), Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$, under the influence of proximity-induced superconductivity from niobium (Nb) contacts. We develop an advanced two-dimensional Dirac model for the topological surface states (TSS), incorporating spatially varying chemical potentials and s-wave superconducting pairing. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism, we derive analytical solutions for the bound states and compute the local density of states (LDOS) at the interface, revealing zero-energy modes characteristic of MZMs. The topological nature of these states is rigorously analyzed through winding numbers and Pfaffian invariants, and their robustness is explored under various physical perturbations, including gating effects. Our findings highlight the potential of this heterostructure as a platform for topological quantum computing, with detailed predictions for experimental signatures via tunneling spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Non-linear flow of two-dimensional viscous electron fluid in moderate magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, the inter-particle interaction can lead to the formation of a viscous electron fluid and realization of the hydrodynamic regime of electron transport. Here a nonlinear model of the electron hydrodynamic transport is constructed based on the accounting of pair correlations in the electron dynamics. When describing these systems within the framework of classical kinetics, such correlations represent subsequent ``extended'' collisions of the same electrons temporarily joined into pairs. We study their influence on stationary magnetotransport for large-amplitude fluid flows in long samples. Current profiles in the nonlinear regime and the corresponding differential magnetoresistance are calculated. Pair correlations lead to a characteristic nonmonotonic dependence of the differential resistance on magnetic field. We compare our results with experimental data on magnetoresistance of 2D electrons in high-purity GaAs quantum wells; our model can be responsible for a part of the observed features of the differential magnetoresistance.</description>

      <title>Fractional Wannier Orbitals and Tight-Binding Gauge Fields for Kitaev Honeycomb Superlattices with Flat Majorana Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional excitations hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and quantum technologies. However, constructing lattice models for their dynamics under gauge fields remains a formidable challenge due to inherent obstructions. Here, we introduce a novel and systematic framework for deriving low-energy lattice models of fractional orbitals coupled to tight-binding gauge fields. Departing from conventional geometric approaches, our method systematically eliminates the high-energy states via virtual hopping, thereby deriving the gauge potential and quantum metric through a superexchange-like mechanism. We demonstrate the framework by constructing Wannier orbitals for Majorana states and a tight-binding $Z_2$ gauge field across various flux crystalline phases in the Kitaev spin model on a honeycomb lattice. Our study reveals a striking phase transition between two non-trivial topological phases characterized by gapless flat-band with extensive degeneracy. Furthermore, we develop a gauge-invariant mean-field theory for interacting Majorana orbitals, leading to a correlation-induced fractional Chern state. Our work establishes a general framework for gauge-mediated tight-binding models and a gauge-invariant mean-field theory for interacting fractional orbitals that can be readily extended to $U(1)$, $SU(N)$ lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of Strongly Interacting Dipolar Excitons in Moir\'e Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e lattices created in two-dimensional heterostructures exhibit rich many-body physics of interacting electrons and excitons and, at the same time, suggest promising optoelectronic applications. Here, we study the cooperative radiance of moir\'e excitons that is demonstrated to emerge from the deep subwavelength nature of the moir\'e lattice and the strong excitonic on-site interaction. In particular, we show that the static dipole-dipole interaction between interlayer excitons can strongly affect their cooperative optical properties, suppressing superradiance of disordered states while enhancing superradiance of ordered phases of moir\'e excitons. Moreover, we show that doping permits direct control of optical cooperativity, e.g., by generating supperradiant dynamics of otherwise subradiant states of excitons. Our results show that interlayer moir\'e excitons offer a unique platform for exploring cooperative optical phenomena in strongly interacting many-body systems, thus, holding promise for applications in quantum nonlinear optics.</description>

Abstract: As "2D" materials (i.e. materials just a few atoms thick) continue to gain prominence, understanding their symmetries is critical for unlocking their full potential. In this work, we present comprehensive tables that tabulate the rod group symmetries of all crystallographic lines in all 80 layer groups, which describe the symmetries of 2D materials. These tables are analogous to the scanning tables for space groups found in Volume E of the International Tables for Crystallography, but are specifically tailored for layer groups and their applications to 2D materials. This resource will aid in the analysis of line defects, such as domain walls, which play a crucial role in determining the properties and functionality of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Ultra-strong coupling of two ferromagnets via Meissner currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet trilayer sandwiched between two superconductors (S/F/I/F/S heterostructure). It is well-known that a conceptually similar S/F/S system is a platform for implementing ultra-strong magnon-photon coupling. Here, we demonstrate that in such S/F/I/F/S heterostructure, ultra-strong magnon-magnon coupling between the two F layers also appears. The strength of this interaction is many times greater than the strength of the usual dipole-dipole interaction. It is mediated via Meissner currents excited in the superconductor layers by the magnon stray fields. The strength of the magnon-magnon coupling is anisotropic, and its anisotropy is opposite to the anisotropy of the magnon-photon coupling, which allows them to be separated. Both couplings become much stronger when the temperature drops below the critical temperature of the superconductor layers. It enables the implementation of an efficient tuning of the wavenumber in the S/F/I/F/S heterostructures controlled by temperature in a wide range of frequencies. Overall, the rich and tunable spectrum of S/F/I/F/S multilayers opens broad prospects for their application in magnonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simultaneously cool $\gtrsim$100 mechanical modes of a membrane with a photothermally modified optical cavity driven by a single blue-detuned laser. In contrast to radiation pressure and bolometric forces applied directly to the mechanical system, this cooling effect does not depend on the sign of detuning, allowing for single-laser stabilization (i.e., simultaneous positive optical spring and damping) that is especially effective at room temperature and high laser power. We also provide intuition about the competing thermal processes, and propose two simple modifications to the mirror coatings that can strongly enhance this effect.</description>

      <title>Ferroaxial order of the monolayer ice in martyite</title>

Abstract: Ice Ih, the most stable phase of water at ambient pressure, is a stacking of the honeycomb network of water molecules H2O. What if one layer of ice is exfoliated and confined to a two-dimensional (2D) sheet? Martyite Zn3(V2O7)(OH)2 2H2O, a mineral with the honeycomb lattice of H2O in the porous framework, is an ideal system for studying such monolayer ice. Due to the geometrical frustration and 2D nature, H2O molecules are dynamically disordered at room temperature. In this study, we reveal disorder-order transitions of H2O in martyite using single-crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD results visualize the formation of hydrogen-bonded toroidal H2O hexamers, leading to the ferroaxial order below 200 K. Combined with the molecular dynamics simulations, we discuss the formation process of the H2O hexamers and how they compromise the molecular arrangement towards lower temperatures. Our results unveil the ground state of monolayer ice, a fundamental knowledge to understand the polymorphism of H2O.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface plasmons or phonons propagating on a two-dimensional (2D) material can exhibit coupling with resonant excitations in its substrate, and the resulting coupled modes were extensively studied. Similar coupling of edge modes propagating along a boundary of 2D material with the substrate excitations remains unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the edge-substrate hybrid modes using the exact Wiener-Hopf analytical approach. We analyze dispersions, decay rate, and confinement of such hybrid modes both without magnetic field (plasmon-phonon and phonon-phonon hybrid modes) and in quantizing magnetic field where edge magnetoplasmons hybridize with substrate phonons. The hybrid modes are predicted to occur in THz and far-IR ranges for several combinations of quasi-2D materials (single- and bilayer graphene, quantum wells, thin-film semiconductors) and substrates with polar-phonon resonances.</description>

      <title>Identifying optimal magnetic field configurations for decoherence mitigation of boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy center in 2D hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as a promising quantum sensor. However, its sensitivity is constrained due to ubiquitous nuclear spins in the environment. The nuclear spins, hyperfine coupled with the central electron spin, effectively behave as magnetic field fluctuators, leading to rapid decoherence. Here, we explore the effectiveness of static magnetic field strength and orientation in realizing peculiar subspaces that can lead to enhanced spin coherence. Specifically, using detailed numerical simulations of the spin Hamiltonian, we identify specific field configurations that minimize energy gradients and, consequently, are expected to facilitate decoherence suppression. We also develop an approximate analytical model based on the perturbation theory that accurately predicts these low-gradient subspaces for magnetic fields aligned with the electron spin quantization axis, applicable not only to boron vacancies but to any spin-1 electronic system coupled to nearby nuclear spins. Furthermore, to stimulate experimental validation, we estimate coherence lifetimes as a function of various bias field configurations and demonstrate that significant decoherence suppression can indeed be achieved in certain regions. These findings and the developed methodology offer valuable insights for mitigating decoherence in a low-field regime.</description>

      <title>Generation of magnetic chiral solitons, skyrmions, and hedgehogs with electric fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric-field controls of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs) have recently been discussed from the microscopic viewpoint. Since the DMI plays a critical role in generating topological spin textures (TSTs) such as the chiral soliton, the magnetic skyrmion, and the magnetic hedgehog, electric-field controls of these TSTs have become an important issue. This paper shows that such electric-field-induced DMI indeed creates and annihilates TSTs by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for many-body spin systems at finite temperatures. We show that when a strong electric field is applied in a proper way to one- or two-dimensional ferromagnets, the Hamiltonians are changed into the well-known spin models for the chiral soliton or the skyrmion lattice, and the TST states emerge. We utilize a machine-learning method to count the number of generated TSTs. In the three-dimensional (3D) case, we demonstrate the electric-field induction of a magnetic hedgehog structure as follows: Applying a strong enough electric field along a proper direction to a skyrmion-string state (a triple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state) at low but finite temperatures, we find that the field-induced DMI can drive a quadruple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state with hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs. This result indicates that we have succeeded in constructing a simple 3D short-range interacting spin model hosting a magnetic hedgehog structure.</description>
