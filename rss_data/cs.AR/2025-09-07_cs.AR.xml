      <title>Memristor-Based Neural Network Accelerators for Space Applications: Enhancing Performance with Temporal Averaging and SIRENs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristors are an emerging technology that enables artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators with high energy efficiency and radiation robustness -- properties that are vital for the deployment of AI on-board spacecraft. However, space applications require reliable and precise computations, while memristive devices suffer from non-idealities, such as device variability, conductance drifts, and device faults. Thus, porting neural networks (NNs) to memristive devices often faces the challenge of severe performance degradation. In this work, we show in simulations that memristor-based NNs achieve competitive performance levels on on-board tasks, such as navigation \&amp; control and geodesy of asteroids. Through bit-slicing, temporal averaging of NN layers, and periodic activation functions, we improve initial results from around $0.07$ to $0.01$ and $0.3$ to $0.007$ for both tasks using RRAM devices, coming close to state-of-the-art levels ($0.003-0.005$ and $0.003$, respectively). Our results demonstrate the potential of memristors for on-board space applications, and we are convinced that future technology and NN improvements will further close the performance gap to fully unlock the benefits of memristors.</description>

      <title>HEEPidermis: a versatile SoC for BioZ recording</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological impedance (BioZ) is an information-packed modality that allows for non-invasive monitoring of health and emotional state. Currently, most research involving tissue impedance is based on bulky or fixed-purpose hardware, which limits the scope of research and the possibilities of experiments. In this work, we present HEEPidermis: a System-on-Chip (SoC) which integrates all the blocks needed for tissue impedance measurement, including two 8-bit, arbitrary-signal current DACs, two VCO-based ADCs, and a RISC-V CPU to enable on-chip feature extraction for closed-loop operation. An event-based sub-sampler improves storage and energy efficiency for long-term recording. In addition to the versatile SoC, the digital back-end and behavioral models of the analog front-end are open-source, allowing fast system-level simulations or repurposing. The SoC was taped out on TSMC 65 nm LP process.</description>

      <title>Distributed-HISQ: A Distributed Quantum Control Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of a scalable Quantum Control Architecture (QCA) faces two primary challenges. First, the continuous growth in qubit counts has rendered distributed QCA inevitable, yet the nondeterministic latencies inherent in feedback loops demand cycleaccurate synchronization across multiple controllers. Existing synchronization strategies -- whether lock-step or demand-driven -- introduce significant performance penalties. Second, existing quantum instruction set architectures are polarized, being either too abstract or too granular. This lack of a unifying design necessitates recurrent hardware customization for each new control requirement, which limits the system's reconfigurability and impedes the path toward a scalable and unified digital microarchitecture.
  Addressing these challenges, we propose Distributed-HISQ, featuring: (i) HISQ, A universal instruction set that redefines quantum control with a hardware-agnostic design. By decoupling from quantum operation semantics, HISQ provides a unified language for control sequences, enabling a single microarchitecture to support various control methods and enhancing system reconfigurability. (ii) BISP, a booking-based synchronization protocol that can potentially achieve zero-cycle synchronization overhead. The feasibility and adaptability of Distributed-HISQ are validated through its implementation on a commercial quantum control system targeting superconducting qubits. We performed a comprehensive evaluation using a customized quantum software stack. Our results show that BISP effectively synchronizes multiple control boards, leading to a 22.8% reduction in average program execution time and a $\sim$5$\times$ reduction in infidelity when compared to an existing lock-step synchronization scheme.</description>

      <title>Mainframe-Style Channel Controllers for Modern Disaggregated Memory Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or "far" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.
  However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.
  In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.</description>
