      <title>Evidence for Variable Accretion onto PDS 70 c and Implications for Protoplanet Detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the processes of planet formation and accretion in young systems is essential to unraveling the initial conditions of planetary systems. The PDS 70 system, which hosts two directly imaged protoplanets, provides a unique laboratory for studying these phenomena, particularly through H-alpha emission a commonly used accretion tracer. We present multi-epoch observations and examine the variability in accretion signatures within this system, focusing on PDS 70 b and c. Using Hubble Space Telescope narrowband H-alpha imaging from 2020 and 2024, we achieve high signal-to-noise ratio detections of these planets and reveal significant changes in H-alpha flux. For PDS 70 c, the H-alpha flux more than doubled between 2020 and 2024. The trend is consistent with the one identified in recently published MagAO-X data, further confirming that PDS 70 c has become significantly brighter in H between 2023 March and 2024 May. The observed variability suggests dynamic accretion processes, possibly modulated by circumplanetary disk properties or transient accretion bursts. High-amplitude variability in PDS 70 c motivates simultaneous monitoring of multiple accretion tracers to probe the mechanisms of mass growth of gas giant planets. We quantify the impact of variability on the detectability of protoplanets in imaging surveys and emphasize the need for continued and regular monitoring to accurately assess the occurrence and characteristics of young, forming planets.</description>

      <title>Three Years of High-Contrast Imaging of the PDS 70 b and c Exoplanets at H{\alpha} with MagAO-X: Evidence of Strong Protoplanet H{\alpha} Variability and Circumplanetary Dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 3 years of high-contrast imaging of the PDS 70 b and c accreting protoplanets with the new extreme AO system MagAO-X as part of the MaxProtoPlanetS survey of H$\alpha$ protoplanets. In 2023 and 2024 our sharp (25-27 mas FWHM); well AO corrected (20-26% Strehl), deep (2-3.6hr) images detect compact (r~30 mas; r~3 au) circumplanetary disks (CPDs) surrounding both protoplanets. Starlight scattering off the dusty outer edges of these CPDs is the likely source of the bright compact continuum light detected within ~30 mas of both planets in our simultaneously obtained continuum 668 nm filter images. After subtraction of contaminating continuum and PSF residuals with pyKLIP ADI and SDI we obtained high-contrast ASDI H$\alpha$ images of both planets in 2022, 2023 and 2024. We find the H$\alpha$ line flux of planet b fell by (8.1$\pm$1.6)x10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ a factor of 4.6 drop in flux from 2022 to 2023. In March 2024, planet b continued to be faint with just a slight 1.6x rise to an H$\alpha$ line flux of (3.64$\pm$0.87)x10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$. For c we measure a significant increase of (2.74$\pm$0.51)x10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ from 2023 to 2024 which is a factor of 2.3x increase. So both protoplanets have recently experienced significant H$\alpha$ variability with ~1 yr sampling. In 2024, planet c is brighter than b: as c is brightening and b generally fading. We also tentatively detect one new point source "CC3" inside the inner disk (~49 mas; at PA~295 deg; 2024) with orbital motion roughly consistent with a ~5.6 au orbit.</description>

      <title>Bolide infrasound signal morphology and yield estimates: A case study of two events detected by a dense acoustic sensor network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two bolides (2 June 2016 and 4 April 2019) were detected at multiple regional infrasound stations with many of the locations receiving multiple detections. Analysis of the received signals was used to estimate the yield, location and trajectory, and the type of shock that produced the received signal. The results from the infrasound analysis were compared with ground truth information that was collected through other sensing modalities. This multi-modal framework offers an expanded perspective on the processes governing bolide shock generation and propagation. The majority of signal features showed reasonable agreement between the infrasound-based interpretation and the other observational modalities, though the yield estimate from the 2019 bolide was significantly lower using the infrasound detections. There was also evidence suggesting that one of the detections was from a cylindrical shock that was initially propagating upward, which is unusual though not impossible.</description>

      <title>The 4-400 GHz Survey for the 32 Class II Disks in the Taurus Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have compiled the $\sim$4-400 GHz broad spectra of 32 Class II protoplanetary disks in the Taurus-Auriga region, which represents the brightest one-third of sources detected in the submillimeter band in this region. The spectra at &gt;20 GHz frequency can be described with a piecewise function: (1) a power law with a spectral index $\sim$2 at &gt;200 GHz, (2) a power law with spectral index in the range 0.3-4.2 at 20-50 GHz, and (3) a transition region in between these two power laws which can be characterized by a sigmoid function. This suggests that the flux densities at &gt;200 GHz and &lt;50 GHz are dominated by distinct emission components. At &gt;200 GHz, the emission is likely dominated by the optically thick dust thermal emission in the bulk of the disks. In some sources that were not detected at 6.8 GHz or 10 GHz, embedded high-density dust substructures may contribute to a significant fraction of the flux densities at 30-50 GHz, and the spectral indices are mostly consistent with 2.0. Although, at 30-50 GHz, free-free and/or synchrotron emission may be significant, and some sources in our sample have spectral indices &lt; 2.0. Based on these results, we hypothesize that high-density dust substructures (e.g., vortices) are often found in resolved Class II protoplanetary disks, and are a precursor to the formation of kilometer-sized planetesimals and rocky planets. They may not present high contrast at &gt;200 GHz frequencies owing to the high optical depth. To probe these dust substructures, high angular resolution observations at &lt;100 GHz are necessary to distinguish them from free-free and synchrotron emission sources. Otherwise, in the analyses of the spatially unresolved spectra, one needs to simultaneously constrain the flux densities of free-free, synchrotron, and dust emission with the observations at $\sim$5-50 GHz.</description>

      <title>TOI-512: Super-Earth transiting a K-type star discovered by TESS and ESPRESSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the goals of the ESPRESSO guaranteed time observations (GTOs) at the ESO 8.2m telescope is to follow up on candidate planets from transit surveys such as the TESS mission. High-precision radial velocities are required to characterize small exoplanets. Aims. We intend to confirm the existence of a transiting super-Earth around the bright (V=9.74) K0-type star TOI-512 (TIC 119292328) and provide a characterization. Combining photometric data from TESS and 37 high-resolution spectroscopic observations from ESPRESSO in a joint Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, we determined the planetary parameters of TOI-512b and characterized its internal structure. We find that TOI-512b is a super-Earth, with a radius of $1.54 \pm 0.10$ R$_\oplus$ and mass of $3.57_{-0.55}^{+0.53}$~M$_\oplus$, on a $7.19_{-6.1\cdot 10^{-5}}^{+7\cdot 10^{-5}}$ day orbit. This corresponds to a bulk density of $5.62_{-1.28}^{+1.59}$ g cm$^{-3}$. Our interior structure analysis presents a small inner core representing $0.13^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ of the solid mass fraction for the planet, surrounded by a mantle with a mass fraction of $0.69^{+0.20}_{-0.22}$, and an upper limit of the water layer of $0.16$. The gas mass below $10^{-8.93}$ indicates a very small amount of gas on the planet. We find no evidence of the second candidate found by the TESS pipeline, TOI-512.02, neither in TESS photometry, nor in the ESPRESSO radial velocities. The low stellar activity makes it an interesting transmission spectroscopy candidate for future-generation instruments.</description>

      <title>Enceladus and Jupiter as exoplanets: the opposition surge effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets and moons in our Solar System have strongly peaked reflected light phase curves at opposition. In this work, we produce a modified reflected light phase curve model and use it to fit the Cassini phase curves of Jupiter and Enceladus. This opposition effect is caused by shadow hiding (SH; particles or rough terrain cast shadows which are not seen at zero phase) and coherent backscattering (CB; incoming light constructively interferes with outgoing light). We find tentative evidence for CB preference in Jupiter compared to SH, and no evidence of preference in Enceladus. We show that the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of Jupiter's opposition peak is an order of magnitude larger than that of Enceladus and conclude that this could be used as a solid-surface indicator for exoplanets. We investigate this and show that modelling the opposition peak FWHM in solid-surface exoplanets would be unfeasible with JWST or the Future Habitable Worlds Observatory due to the very large signal-to-noise required over a small phase range.</description>

      <title>H$\alpha$ Variability of AB Aur b with the Hubble Space Telescope: Probing the Nature of a Protoplanet Candidate with Accretion Light Echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant planets generate accretion luminosity as they form. Much of this energy is radiated in strong H$\alpha$ line emission, which has motivated direct imaging surveys at optical wavelengths to search for accreting protoplanets. However, compact disk structures can mimic accreting planets by scattering emission from the host star. This can complicate the interpretation of H$\alpha$ point sources, especially if the host star itself is accreting. We describe an approach to distinguish accreting protoplanets from scattered-light disk features using "accretion light echoes." This method relies on variable H$\alpha$ emission from a stochastically accreting host star to search for a delayed brightness correlation with a candidate protoplanet. We apply this method to the candidate protoplanet AB Aur b with a dedicated Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 program designed to sequentially sample the host star and the candidate planet in H$\alpha$ while accounting for the light travel time delay and orbital geometry of the source within the protoplanetary disk. Across five epochs spanning 14 months, AB Aur b is over 20 times more variable than its host star; AB Aur's H$\alpha$ emission changes by 15% while AB Aur b varies by 330%. These brightness changes are not correlated, which rules out unobstructed scattered starlight from the host star as the only source of AB Aur b's H$\alpha$ emission and is consistent with tracing emission from an independently accreting protoplanet, inner disk shadowing effects, or a physically evolving compact disk structure. More broadly, accretion light echoes offer a novel tool to explore the nature of protoplanet candidates with well-timed observations of the host star prior to deep imaging in H$\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Catching the wisps: Stellar mass-loss limits from low-frequency radio observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The winds of low-mass stars carry away angular momentum and impact the atmospheres of surrounding planets. Determining the properties of these winds is necessary to understand the mass-loss history of the star and the evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres. Due to their tenuous nature, the winds of low-mass main-sequence stars are difficult to detect. The few existing techniques for measuring these winds are indirect, with the most common inference method for winds of low-mass stars being astrospheric Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption combined with complex hydrodynamical modelling of the interaction between the stellar wind and the interstellar medium. Here, we employ a more direct method to place upper limits on the mass-loss rates of low-mass stars by combining observations of low-frequency coherent radio emission, the lack of free-free absorption, and a simple stellar wind model. We determine upper limits on the mass-loss rate for a sample of 19 M dwarf stars detected with the LOFAR telescope at 120--168 MHz, reaching a sensitivity within an order of magnitude of the solar mass-loss rate for cold stars with a surface magnetic field strength of $\sim$100 G. The sensitivity of our method does not depend on distance or spectral type, allowing us to find mass-loss rate constraints for stars up to spectral type M6 and out to a distance of 50 pc, later and farther than previous measurements. With upcoming low-frequency surveys with both LOFAR and the Square Kilometre Array, the number of stars with mass-loss rate upper limits determined with this method could reach $\sim$1000.</description>

      <title>Search Capability for Near-Earth Objects with the Wide Field Survey Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), with a powerful sky survey capability in the northern hemisphere, will play an important role in asteroid searching and monitoring. However, WFST is not a telescope dedicated to near-Earth asteroids (NEOs) searching. In order to improve the efficiency of finding NEOs on the premise of meeting the needs of other scientific research, we ran mock observations for WFST to study its search capability for NEOs. The NEO population model, the WFST detection model and site conditions are taken into account in our simulations. Based on the original scheduling scheme, we present two new schemes. Compared to the original scheme, the optimized scheme can improve the search capability of known and unknown NEOs by 100\% and 50\%. We also emphasized the importance of trailing loss and proposed an improved effective field of view model. In addition, it is predicted that adopting the clear-day ratio of 0.7 and the optimized scheme, during one year of regular survey, for NEOs with absolute magnitude from 17 to 25, WFST can provide tracklets for about 1800 NEOs if their orbits are known, and in the case of blind search, more than 600 NEOs can be found by WFST. The new schemes provide valuable reference and suggestions for the WFST's regular survey strategy.</description>

      <title>Habitable Zone and Atmosphere Retention Distance (HaZARD) Stellar-evolution-dependent loss models of secondary atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major open question in exoplanet research is whether secondary atmospheres are rare around Earth-sized rocky exoplanets. In this work we determine the distance at which an Earth-sized planet orbiting a variety of stellar hosts could retain a CO2- or N2-dominated atmosphere and compare this atmospheric retention distance (ARD) with that of the liquid-water HZ. We combined planetary atmosphere models with stellar evolution models. The atmospheric models produced by the thermochemical Kompot code allowed us to calculate the Jeans escape rates for different stellar masses, rotation rates, and ages. These loss rates allowed us to determine the closest distance a planet is likely to retain a CO2- or N2-dominated atmosphere. Using stellar rotation evolution models, we modelled how these retention distances evolve as the X-ray and ultraviolet activity of the star evolves. We find that the overlap of the HZ and the ARD occurs earlier around slowly rotating stars. Additionally, we find that HZ planets orbiting stars with masses under 0.4 M_\odot are unlikely to retain any atmosphere, due to the lower spin-down rate of these fully convective stars. We also show that the initial rotation rate of the star can impact the likelihood of a planet retaining an atmosphere, as an initially fast-rotating star maintains high levels of short-wavelength irradiance for much longer. The orbits of all Earth-like rocky exoplanets observed by JWST in cycles 1 and 2, including HZ planets, fall outside the ARD. Our results will have implications for future target selections of small exoplanet observing programmes with JWST or future instruments such as the Ariel space mission.</description>
