      <title>Equivariant scaling asymptotics for Poisson and Szeg\H{o} kernels on Grauert tube boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,\kappa)$ be a closed and connected real-analytic Riemannian manifold, acted upon by a compact Lie group of isometries $G$. We consider the following two kinds of equivariant asymptotics along a fixed Grauer tube boundary $X^\tau$ of $(M,\kappa)$.
  1): Given the induced unitary representation of $G$ on the eigenspaces of the Laplacian of $(M,\kappa)$, these split over the irreducible representations of $G$. On the other hand, the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian of $(M,\kappa)$ admit a simultaneous complexification to some Grauert tube. We study the asymptotic concentration along $X^\tau$ of the complexified eigenfunctions pertaining to a fixed isotypical component.
  2): There are furthermore an induced action of $G$ as a group of CR and contact automorphisms on $X^\tau$, and a corresponding unitary representation on the Hardy space $H(X^\tau)$. The action of $G$ on $X^\tau$ commutes with the homogeneous \lq geogesic flow\rq\, and the representation on the Hardy space commutes with the elliptic self-adjoint Toeplitz operator induced by the generator of the goedesic flow. Hence each eigenspace of the latter also splits over the irreducible representations of $G$. We study the asymptotic concentration of the eigenfunctions in a given isotypical component.
  We also give some applications of these asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Extension of Chekanov-Eliashberg algebra using annuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an SFT-type invariant for Legendrian knots in the standard contact $\mathbb{R}^3$. The invariant is a deformation of the Chekanov-Eliashberg differential graded algebra. The differential consists of a part that counts index zero $J$-holomorphic disks with up to two positive punctures, annuli with one positive puncture, and a string topological part. We describe the invariant and demonstrate its invariance combinatorially from the Lagrangian knot projection, and compute some simple examples where the deformation is non-vanishing.</description>

      <title>Morse homology and equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop methods for calculating equivariant homology from equivariant Morse functions on a closed manifold with the action of a finite group. We show how to alter $G$-equivariant Morse functions to a stable one, where the descending manifold from a critical point $p$ has the same stabilizer group as $p$, giving a better-behaved cell structure on $M$. For an equivariant, stable Morse function, we show that a generic equivariant metric satisfies the Morse--Smale condition.
  In the process, we give a proof that a generic equivariant function is Morse, and that equivariant, stable Morse functions form a dense subset in the $C^0$-topology within the space of all equivariant functions.
  Finally, we give an expository account of equivariant homology and cohomology theories, as well as their interaction with Morse theory. We show that any equivariant Morse function gives a filtration of $M$ that induces a Morse spectral sequence, computing the equivariant homology of $M$ from information about how the stabilizer group of a critical point acts on its tangent space. In the case of a stable Morse function, we show that this can be further reduced to a Morse chain complex.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity-free representations and coisotropic actions of certain nilpotent Lie groups over quasi-symmetric Siegel domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multiplicity-free representations of nilpotent Lie groups over a quasi-symmetric Siegel domain, with a focus on certain two-step nilpotent Lie groups. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the multiplicity-freeness property. Specifically, we establish the equivalence between the disjointness of irreducible unitary representations realized over the domain, the multiplicity-freeness of the unitary representation on the space of $L^2$ holomorphic functions, and the coisotropicity of the group action.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Reduction in Infinite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a theory of symplectic reduction in the infinite-dimensional setting, covering both the regular and singular case. Extending the classical work of Marsden, Weinstein, Sjamaar and Lerman, we address challenges unique to infinite dimensions, such as the failure of the Darboux theorem and the absence of the Marle-Guillemin-Sternberg normal form. Our novel approach centers on a normal form of only the momentum map, for which we utilize new local normal form theorems for smooth equivariant maps in the infinite-dimensional setting. This normal form is then used to formulate the theory of singular symplectic reduction in infinite dimensions. We apply our results to important examples like the Yang-Mills equation and the Teichm\"uller space over a Riemann surface.</description>

      <title>Torus bundle Liouville domains are stably Weinstein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.07615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop explicit local operations that may be applied to Liouville domains, with the goal of simplifying the dynamics of the Liouville vector field. These local operations, which are Liouville homotopies, are inspired by the techniques used by Honda and Huang in [HH19] to show that convex hypersurfaces are $C^0$-generic in contact manifolds. As an application, we use our operations to show that certain Liouville-but-not-Weinstein domains constructed by Huang in [Hua20] are stably Weinstein.</description>

      <title>Magnetic curvature and existence of a closed magnetic geodesic on low energy levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ endowed with a magnetic form ${\sigma}$ and its Lorentz operator ${\Omega}$ we associate an operator $M^{\Omega}$, called the magnetic curvature operator. Such an operator encloses the classical Riemannian curvature of the metric $g$ together with terms of perturbation due to the magnetic interaction of ${\sigma}$. From $M^{\Omega}$ we derive the magnetic sectional curvature $Sec^{\Omega}$ and the magnetic Ricci curvature $Ric^{\Omega}$ which generalize in arbitrary dimension the already known notion of magnetic curvature previously considered by several authors on surfaces. On closed manifolds, under the assumption of $Ric^{\Omega}$ being positive on an energy level below the Ma\~n\'e critical value, with a Bonnet-Myers argument, we establish the existence of a contractible periodic orbit. In particular, when ${\sigma}$ is nowhere vanishing, this implies the existence of a contractible periodic orbit on every energy level close to zero. Finally, on closed oriented even dimensional manifolds, we discuss about the topological restrictions which appear when one requires $Sec^{\Omega}$ to be positive.</description>

      <title>Characterizing symplectic capacities on ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a long-standing conjecture that all symplectic capacities which are equal to the Gromov width for ellipsoids coincide on a class of convex domains in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. It is known that they coincide for monotone toric domains in all dimensions. In this paper, we study whether requiring a capacity to be equal to the $k^{th}$ Ekeland-Hofer capacity for all ellipsoids can characterize it on a class of domains. We prove that for $k=n=2$, this holds for convex toric domains, but not for all monotone toric domains. We also prove that for $k=n\ge 3$, this does not hold even for convex toric domains.</description>

      <title>Singularities of Lagrangian Immersions and its Applications in Lagrangian Floer Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the singularities of Lagrangian immersions into Cartesian product of surfaces. After applying a Hamiltonian isotopy in the Weinstein tubular neighbourhood of the Lagrangian immersion, the singular points of the Lagrangian immersion can be expressed locally as fold points with finitely many cusp points. This result has applications in comparing two Lagrangian Floer complexes associated to curves on surfaces related by a certain Lagrangian correspondence and the quilt Floer complex induced by these three Lagrangian immersions.</description>
