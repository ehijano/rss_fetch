      <title>Environment-Induced Exciton Renormalization in the Photosystem II Reaction Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein electrostatics tune excitation energies in the Photosystem II reaction center (PSII-RC), yet a fully quantum-mechanical many-body description of how the surrounding protein environment renormalizes excitons has remained computationally inaccessible. The Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) within many-body perturbation theory accurately describes excitonic physics through an explicit electron-hole interaction, but is prohibitively expensive for systems containing thousands of valence electrons. Here, we show that for sufficiently large systems the BSE becomes simpler to solve when treated with modern stochastic sampling techniques, as atomistic interactions self-average. In this regime, the effective electron-hole interaction mediated by the environment is governed by collective $k$-dependent polarization. These insights enable an ab initio study of the PSII-RC in which all six chlorins forming the hexameric dye core are treated explicitly together with a roughly seven Angstrom local protein environment. We directly compare the low-lying optical excitations of the isolated chromophore hexamer (1276 valence electrons) and the protein-dye cluster (3238 valence electrons). For $Q_y$ excitations near 680 nm, inclusion of the protein environment induces polarization-dependent energy shifts, redistributes spectral weight, and alters exciton delocalization and pigment character. Lateral and transverse asymmetries in the low-lying excited states are captured at the BSE level of theory. These results establish that we now have the tools for many-body calculations of biological nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Continuous Local Symmetry: Connection to Reactivity and Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most beautiful yet mysterious concepts in science. In chemical systems, presence of local symmetries at specific fragments often serve as driving forces behind many physicochemical properties, including stability, spectroscopy, and reactivity. Moreover, degree of symmetry varies continuously with molecular dynamics and intermolecular interactions, making it a hidden but decisive factor. In this study, we propose a theoretical framework to quantify continuous degrees of symmetry and chirality localized within constrained regions of a molecular environment. Application of this method to reaction sites of dendralene molecules reveals strong correlations between local symmetry and molecular stability, parity-dependent behavior, and Diels-Alder reactivity. Additionally, representations of local chirality fields in porphyrins uncover unique signatures accounting for the chirality recognition power. Overall, these findings highlight the potentials of local symmetries within a molecular framework on predicting chemical properties.</description>

      <title>Electron Attachment Induced Shape Resonances in AT Base Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examined the influence of base pairing and {\pi}-{\pi} stacking interactions on electron attachment induced resonances in adenine-thymine base pair. Resonance positions and widths were computed using the DLPNO based equation of motion coupled-cluster method combined with the Pad\'e approach. We identified seven {\pi}* shape resonances in both linear and stacked AT geometries, consistent with the total number found for isolated adenine and thymine. Natural orbital analysis shows that low energy resonances exhibit more electron density delocalized over both nucleobases. This delocalization is more pronounced in the stacked AT geometry and leads to significant stabilization of the resonance states.</description>

      <title>Density Functional Theory Predictions of Derivative Thermodynamic Properties of a Confined Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluids in nanopores are of importance for many engineering applications, including energy storage in supercapacitors, hydrocarbons recovery from unconventional sources, or water desalination. Thermodynamic properties of fluids confined in nanopores differ from the properties of the same fluids in bulk. Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely used for modeling thermodynamics of confined fluids. However, it is rarely used for calculations of derivative thermodynamic properties. Here we use a rather simple DFT model for argon based on the Percus-Yevick equation, and showed that with standard parametrization it fails to predict derivative properties. However, slight adjustment in parameters leads to quantitative predictions of isothermal compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient at a selected temperature. Using the adjusted parameterization we performed the calculations of compressibility of argon confined in carbon slit pores of various sizes, and demonstrated that the compressibility of argon in confinement is lower than that in bulk and is pore size dependent. We confirmed the DFT predictions using the Monte Carlo molecular simulations. In addition to isothermal compressibility, we calculated the thermal expansion coefficient of confined argon. Our calculations showed that it behaves similar to compressibility -- it is always lower than the bulk value and gradually increases for smaller pore sizes. For several selected pore sizes we verified the DFT calculations by Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, our results suggest that the classical DFT can be utilized for calculations of derivative thermodynamic properties of confined fluids, which are computationally challenging to predict using molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Coupled Cluster con M\=oLe: Molecular Orbital Learning for Neural Wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is the most widely used method for calculating molecular properties; however, its accuracy is often insufficient for quantitative predictions. Coupled-cluster (CC) theory is the most successful method for achieving accuracy beyond DFT and for predicting properties that closely align with experiment. It is known as the ''gold standard'' of quantum chemistry. Unfortunately, the high computational cost of CC limits its widespread applicability. In this work, we present the Molecular Orbital Learning (M\=oLe) architecture, an equivariant machine learning model that directly predicts CC's core mathematical objects, the excitation amplitudes, from the mean-field Hartree-Fock molecular orbitals as inputs. We test various aspects of our model and demonstrate its remarkable data efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization to larger molecules and off-equilibrium geometries, despite being trained only on small equilibrium geometries. Finally, we also examine its ability to reduce the number of cycles required to converge CC calculations. M\=oLe can set the foundations for high-accuracy wavefunction-based ML architectures to accelerate molecular design and complement force-field approaches.</description>

      <title>Transient Plastic Spin Labeling with Chlorine Dioxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plastic waste, being one of the most important problems for humankind, poses severe threats to ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. Tracing, quantifying, and identifying types of plastic waste is of crucial importance to understand its environmental pathways and develop targeted strategies for reduction, recycling, and remediation. To contribute to addressing this global issue, we investigated the spin-labeling capabilities of aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO$_2$) radicals upon introduction into poly(ethylene terephthalate) and utilized electron spin resonance spectroscopy for detection. The technique is capable of identifying plastic species as the unpaired electron of the radical molecule is strongly sensitive to its local environment through its coupling parameters. Temperature-dependent measurements revealed that the molecules are immobilized at low temperatures and exhibit well-resolved anisotropic and hyperfine spectra that are quantitatively described by a model spin Hamiltonian. Even above the melting point of water, some degrees of freedom remain blocked as a result of the polymer matrix. Furthermore, employing a time-series measurement at room temperature enabled us to determine the diffusion coefficient of the molecule in the polymer.</description>

Abstract: A potential energy curve (PEC) accurate to a fraction of 1 ppm ($1:10^6$) is computed for the $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{u}^+$ state of He$_2$ endowed with relativistic and QED corrections. The nuclear Schr\"odinger equation is solved on this PEC with diagonal Born-Oppenheimer and non-adiabatic mass corrections to obtain highly accurate rotational-vibrational levels. The computed rovibrational intervals and fine-structure splittings, spanning over several orders of magnitude in energy, are found to be in remarkable agreement with available high-resolution spectroscopy data.</description>

Abstract: We report the potential energy curve, the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer, non-adiabatic mass, relativistic, and leading-order QED corrections for the ground electronic state of the helium dimer cation; the higher-order QED and finite-nuclear size effects are also estimated. The computations are carried out with an improved error control and over a much broader configuration range compared to earlier work [D. Ferenc, V. I. Korobov, and E. M\'atyus, Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 213001 (2020)]. As a result, all rovibrational bound states are reported with an estimated accuracy of 0.005 cm$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Molecular Graphs with Geometries via Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate molecular property predictions require 3D geometries, which are typically obtained using expensive methods such as density functional theory (DFT). Here, we attempt to obtain molecular geometries by relying solely on machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) models. To this end, we first curate a large-scale molecular relaxation dataset comprising 3.5 million molecules and 300 million snapshots. Then MLIP pre-trained models are trained with supervised learning to predict energy and forces given 3D molecular structures. Once trained, we show that the pre-trained models can be used in different ways to obtain geometries either explicitly or implicitly. First, it can be used to obtain approximate low-energy 3D geometries via geometry optimization. While these geometries do not consistently reach DFT-level chemical accuracy or convergence, they can still improve downstream performance compared to non-relaxed structures. To mitigate potential biases and enhance downstream predictions, we introduce geometry fine-tuning based on the relaxed 3D geometries. Second, the pre-trained models can be directly fine-tuned for property prediction when ground truth 3D geometries are available. Our results demonstrate that MLIP pre-trained models trained on relaxation data can learn transferable molecular representations to improve downstream molecular property prediction and can provide practically valuable but approximate molecular geometries that benefit property predictions.

      <title>A Bottom-Up Field-Theoretic Framework via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: Generalized Mode Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiscale simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems, yet particle-based simulations become prohibitively expensive at time and length scales beyond the molecular level. Field-theoretic simulations offer an attractive alternative, but most existing formulations rely on top-down approximations and are not systematically connected to atomistic interactions. Here, we present a hierarchical bottom-up framework for constructing auxiliary field representations of molecular liquids directly from microscopic models. We introduce a hierarchical coarse-graining framework that constructs field-theoretic models directly from atomistic liquids. The method first maps atomistic interactions to coarse-grained center-of-mass potentials and regularizes short-range divergences through a perturbative expansion in reciprocal space. Building on the auxiliary field formulation developed in polymer field-theoretic simulations, we then generalize the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to arbitrary pair potentials by separating positive and negative Fourier modes and introducing two auxiliary fields. The resulting generalized mode theory extends bottom-up field-theoretic modeling beyond positive-definite kernels and is compatible with existing field-theoretic sampling strategies. By combining formal derivations with numerical regularization and mode-truncation procedures, this work provides the theoretical foundation for scalable, bottom-up field-theoretic simulations of molecular systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an iterative algorithm to retrieve accurate real space information from gas phase ultrafast diffraction measurements with missing data at low momentum transfer. The algorithm operates in a manner similar to phase retrieval algorithms which transform signals back and forth between the signal domain and the Fourier transform domain and apply constraints to retrieve the missing phase. Our algorithm retrieves missing data that is not accessible experimentally by applying a real-space constraint that requires only an approximate a-priori knowledge of the shortest and longest internuclear distances in the molecule. We demonstrate successful retrieval of the missing data in simulated data and in experimentally measured electron diffraction signals of photo-dissociated iodobenzene molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07329v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and are often history dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization histories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimensional projection defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using a gradient-enhanced Gaussian Process with the inverse multiquadric kernel, whose posterior variance contours delineate data-supported regions from extrapolated ones. A rotated coordinate frame decomposes the RMSD plane into reaction progress and orthogonal distance. We show the utility of the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, where a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements, along with the ratification of the visualization for more complex reactions, a Grignard rearrangement, and a conrotatory bicyclobutane ring opening.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond science is an emerging topic where chirality plays a central role. Here we demonstrate subjecting iodoacetylene, a geometrically achiral molecule, to a pair of simulated non-ionizing ultrafast circularly polarized laser pulses at the highest time resolution to date, by two orders of magnitude (3.87 attoseconds), of the continuously-valued S and R electronic chirality assignments. We partner the only vector-based quantum chemical physics theory enabling full symmetry-breaking with electronic and nuclear dynamics simulations: the former does not require charge density differences or special symmetry positions. The resulting 'easy' and 'hard' directions of the total electronic charge density motion are quantified as a cardioid-like morphology for the duration of the simulated laser pulses and toroidal afterwards. Future research directions include determination of the underlying mechanism governing chiral induced spin selectivity, in addition to application to chiral spin selective phenomena in opto-spintronics and exotic superconductors, partnered with orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT).</description>

      <title>Regularity Priors for the Linear Atomic Cluster Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials enable large systems to be simulated for long time scales at near ab-initio accuracy. This accuracy is achieved by fitting extremely flexible model architectures to high quality reference data. In practice, this flexibility can cause unwanted behavior such as jagged predicted potential energy surfaces and generally poor out-of-distribution behavior. We investigate a general strategy for incorporating prior beliefs on the regularity of the target energy into linear Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) models and explore to what extent this approach improves the quality of the fitted models. Our main focus is an over-regularisation that replicates the Gaussian broadening used in Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors within the ACE framework. Numerical tests indicate that the exact form of the prior is non-critical but that including such a prior leads to significant improvement in test errors, consistent repulsion at close-approach, eliminates spurious false minima in the potential energy and enhances stability during molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

Abstract: Population dynamics in fields such as molecular biology, epidemiology, and ecology exhibit highly stochastic and non-linear behavior. In gene regulatory systems in particular, oscillations and multistability are especially common. Despite this, none of the currently available stochastic models for population dynamics are both accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions. A prominent model in this field, the Linear Noise Approximation (LNA), is computationally efficient for tasks such as simulation, sensitivity analysis, and parameter estimation; however, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time predictions. Other models may achieve greater accuracy across a broader range of systems, but they sacrifice computational efficiency and analytical tractability. This paper demonstrates that, with specific modifications, the LNA can accurately capture non-linear dynamics in population processes. We introduce a new framework based on centre manifold theory, a classical concept from non-linear dynamical systems. This approach enables the identification of simple, system-specific modifications to the LNA, tailored to classes of qualitatively similar non-linear dynamical systems. With these modifications, the LNA can achieve accurate long-term simulations without compromising computational efficiency. We apply our methodology to classes of oscillatory and bi-stable systems, and present multiple examples from molecular population dynamics that demonstrate accurate long-term simulations alongside significant improvements in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Electron-electrolyte coupling in AC transport through nanofluidic channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport properties of nanofluidic channels are usually studied under constant (DC) voltage or pressure driving. However, the frequency response under sinusoidal (AC) drivings offers rich insights into the time-dependent transport mechanisms. Inspired by recent electrochemical approaches, we investigate the couplings between ionic and electronic transport under AC driving. We show that conduction electrons of the channel walls participate in ionic current via capacitive electrochemical coupling, defining a critical frequency and length scale where electron-dominated conductivity emerges. We further analyze how electron-ion coupling modifies electro-osmotic flows, and demonstrate that fluctuation-induced momentum transfer between the electrolyte and wall electrons produces distinct AC transport signatures depending on the charge carrier polarity. Altogether, we establish a frequency-dependent transport matrix that couples ionic, electronic and hydrodynamic flows. These findings establish AC nanofluidic transport as a powerful probe of interfacial phenomena under confinement, and suggest new directions for engineering nanofluidic functionalities through electron-electrolyte coupling.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab initio auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is a systematically improvable many-body method, but its application to extended solids has been severely limited by unfavorable computational scaling and memory requirements that obstruct direct access to the thermodynamic and complete-basis-set limits. By combining tensor hypercontraction with $\mathbf{k}$-point symmetry, we reduce the computational and memory scaling of ab initio AFQMC for solids to $\mathcal O(N^3)$ and $\mathcal O(N^2)$, respectively, with an arbitrary basis, comparable to diffusion Monte Carlo. This enables direct and simultaneous thermodynamic-limit and complete-basis-set AFQMC calculations across insulating, metallic, and strongly correlated solids, without embedding, local approximations, empirical finite-size corrections, or composite schemes. Our results establish AFQMC as a general-purpose, systematically improvable alternative to diffusion Monte Carlo and coupled-cluster methods for predictive ab initio simulations of solids, enabling accurate energies and magnetic observables within a unified framework.</description>
