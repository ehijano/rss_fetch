      <title>Factor Engine: A Python Library for Systematic Financial Factor Computation and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factor Engine is a high-performance, open-source Python library designed for the systematic computation and analysis of financial factors. Built around a modular and extensible API that leverages Python decorators, Factor Engine enables users to define custom factors with ease and integrates seamlessly with the modern data science ecosystem. To assess its practical effectiveness, we compare the mispricing factors computed by Factor Engine to those generated using a reference Stata implementation, finding that both approaches yield highly similar results and comparable performance in backtesting analyses. Furthermore, we experimentally apply these factors within machine learning workflows for trading strategy development, illustrating their practical utility and potential for quantitative finance research.</description>

      <title>Application of Quasi Monte Carlo and Global Sensitivity Analysis to Option Pricing and Greeks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) techniques are applied for pricing and hedging representative financial instruments of increasing complexity. We compare standard Monte Carlo (MC) vs QMC results using Sobol' low discrepancy sequences, different sampling strategies, and various analyses of performance. We find that QMC outperforms MC in most cases, including the highest-dimensional simulations, showing faster and more stable convergence. Regarding greeks computation, we compare standard approaches, based on finite differences (FD) approximations, with adjoint methods (AAD) providing evidences that, when the number of greeks is small, the FD approach combined with QMC can lead to the same accuracy as AAD, thanks to increased convergence rate and stability, thus saving a lot of implementation effort while keeping low computational cost. Using GSA, we are able to fully explain our findings in terms of reduced effective dimension of QMC simulation, allowed in most cases, but not always, by Brownian Bridge discretization or PCA construction. We conclude that, beyond pricing, QMC is a very effcient technique also for computing risk measures, greeks in particular, as it allows to reduce the computational effort of high dimensional Monte Carlo simulations typical of modern risk management.</description>

      <title>A Computational Framework for Financial Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial structures such as securitisations, insurance contracts, and other hierarchical claims systems can be interpreted as deterministic allocation mechanisms acting on stochastic inflow processes. This paper develops a general computational representation of such structures by separating the stochastic generation of inflows from the deterministic rules governing their distribution across positions. Allocation rules, trigger conditions, and priority relations are expressed as explicit, state-dependent operators mapping realised inflows to payments under each scenario. This representation enables financial structures to be analysed as computable economic systems whose performance and risk characteristics can be evaluated consistently across alternative configurations within a unified stochastic environment. While motivated by applications in structured finance, the framework applies more broadly to contractual and institutional arrangements in which uncertain resources are allocated across ordered claims. By providing a unified computational architecture for representing and comparing such mechanisms, the approach supports systematic analysis of structural design, risk distribution, and contractual transparency under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Evaluating LLMs in Finance Requires Explicit Bias Consideration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into financial workflows, but evaluation practice has not kept up. Finance-specific biases can inflate performance, contaminate backtests, and make reported results useless for any deployment claim. We identify five recurring biases in financial LLM applications. They include look-ahead bias, survivorship bias, narrative bias, objective bias, and cost bias. These biases break financial tasks in distinct ways and they often compound to create an illusion of validity. We reviewed 164 papers from 2023 to 2025 and found that no single bias is discussed in more than 28 percent of studies. This position paper argues that bias in financial LLM systems requires explicit attention and that structural validity should be enforced before any result is used to support a deployment claim. We propose a Structural Validity Framework and an evaluation checklist with minimal requirements for bias diagnosis and future system design.

      <title>Constrained Portfolio Optimization via Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with XY-Mixers and Trotterized Initialization: A Hybrid Approach for Direct Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization under strict cardinality constraints is a combinatorial challenge that defies classical convex optimization techniques, particularly in the context of "Direct Indexing" and ESG-constrained mandates. In the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) offers a promising hybrid approach. However, standard QAOA implementations utilizing transverse field mixers often fail to strictly enforce hard constraints, necessitating soft penalties that distort the energy landscape. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of a constraint-preserving QAOA formulation against Simulated Annealing (SA) and Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP). We implement a specific QAOA ansatz utilizing a Dicke state initialization and an XY-mixer Hamiltonian that strictly preserves the Hamming weight of the solution, ensuring only valid portfolios of size K are explored. Furthermore, we introduce a Trotterized parameter initialization schedule inspired by adiabatic quantum computing to mitigate the "Barren Plateau" problem. Backtesting on a basket of 10 US equities over 2025 reveals that our QAOA approach achieves a Sharpe Ratio of 1.81, significantly outperforming Simulated Annealing (1.31) and HRP (0.98). We further analyze the operational implications of the algorithm's high turnover (76.8%), discussing the trade-offs between theoretical optimality and implementation costs in institutional settings.</description>

      <title>Orderbook Feature Learning and Asymmetric Generalization in Intraday Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate probabilistic forecasting of intraday electricity prices is critical for market participants to inform trading decisions. Existing studies rely on specific domain features, such as Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and the last price. However, the rich information in the orderbook remains underexplored. Furthermore, these approaches are often developed within a single country and product type, making it unclear whether the approaches are generalizable. In this paper, we extract 384 features from the orderbook and identify a set of powerful features via feature selection. Based on selected features, we present a comprehensive benchmark using classical statistical models, tree-based ensembles, and deep learning models across two countries (Germany and Austria) and two product types (60-min and 15-min). We further perform a systematic generalization study across countries and product types, from which we reveal an asymmetric generalization phenomenon: models trained on more liquid markets or products transfer well to less liquid ones, whereas the reverse transfer leads to substantial performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Do Whitepaper Claims Predict Market Behavior? Evidence from Cryptocurrency Factor Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20336v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates whether cryptocurrency whitepaper narratives align with empirically observed market factor structure. We construct a pipeline combining zero-shot NLP classification of 38 whitepapers across 10 semantic categories with CP tensor decomposition of hourly market data (49 assets, 17,543 timestamps). Using Procrustes rotation and Tucker's congruence coefficient (phi), we find weak alignment between claims and market statistics (phi = 0.246, p = 0.339) and between claims and latent factors (phi = 0.058, p = 0.751). A methodological validation comparison (statistics versus factors, both derived from market data) achieves significance (p &lt; 0.001), confirming the pipeline detects real structure. The null result indicates whitepaper narratives do not meaningfully predict market factor structure, with implications for narrative economics and investor decision-making. Entity-level analysis reveals specialized tokens (XMR, CRV, YFI) show stronger narrative-market correspondence than broad infrastructure tokens.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Merton's Strategies via Policy Randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Merton's expected utility maximization problem in an incomplete market, characterized by a factor process in addition to the stock price process, where all the model primitives are unknown. The agent under consideration is a price taker who has access only to the stock and factor value processes and the instantaneous volatility. We propose an auxiliary problem in which the agent can invoke policy randomization according to a specific class of Gaussian distributions, and prove that the mean of its optimal Gaussian policy solves the original Merton problem. With randomized policies, we are in the realm of continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) recently developed in Wang et al. (2020) and Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2022b, 2023), enabling us to solve the auxiliary problem in a data-driven way without having to estimate the model primitives. Specifically, we establish a policy improvement theorem based on which we design both online and offline actor-critic RL algorithms for learning Merton's strategies. A key insight from this study is that RL in general and policy randomization in particular are useful beyond the purpose for exploration -- they can be employed as a technical tool to solve a problem that cannot be otherwise solved by mere deterministic policies. At last, we carry out both simulation and empirical studies in a stochastic volatility environment to demonstrate the decisive outperformance of the devised RL algorithms in comparison to the conventional model-based, plug-in method.</description>

      <title>Multi-period Mean-Buffered Probability of Exceedance in Defined Contribution Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate multi-period mean-risk portfolio optimization for long-horizon Defined Contribution plans, focusing on buffered Probability of Exceedance (bPoE), a more intuitive, dollar-based alternative to Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We formulate both pre-commitment and time-consistent Mean-bPoE and Mean-CVaR portfolio optimization problems under realistic investment constraints (e.g., no leverage, no short selling) and jump-diffusion dynamics. These formulations are naturally framed as bilevel optimization problems, with an outer search over the shortfall threshold and an inner optimization over rebalancing decisions. We establish an equivalence between the pre-commitment formulations through a one-to-one correspondence of their scalarization optimal sets, while showing that no such equivalence holds in the time-consistent setting. We develop provably convergent numerical schemes for the value functions associated with both pre-commitment and time-consistent formulations of these mean-risk control problems.
  Using nearly a century of market data, we find that time-consistent Mean-bPoE strategies closely resemble their pre-commitment counterparts. In particular, they maintain alignment with investors' preferences for a minimum acceptable terminal wealth level-unlike time-consistent Mean-CVaR, which often leads to counterintuitive control behavior. We further show that bPoE, as a strictly tail-oriented measure, prioritizes guarding against catastrophic shortfalls while allowing meaningful upside exposure, making it especially appealing for long-horizon wealth security. These findings highlight bPoE's practical advantages for Defined Contribution investment planning.</description>

      <title>ASRI: An Aggregated Systemic Risk Index for Cryptocurrency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Aggregated Systemic Risk Index (ASRI), comprising four weighted sub-indices: Stablecoin Concentration Risk (30%), DeFi Liquidity Risk (25%), Contagion Risk (25%), and Regulatory Opacity Risk (20%). Using data from DeFi Llama, Federal Reserve FRED, and on-chain analytics, we validate against four historical crises (Terra/Luna, Celsius/3AC, FTX, SVB). Event study analysis detects significant abnormal signals for all four (t-statistics 5.47-32.64, p &lt; 0.01), with threshold-based detection achieving 30-day average lead time for three of four events. Walk-forward validation confirms 4/4 out-of-sample detection (18-day average lead), ruling out look-ahead bias. A three-regime HMM identifies distinct risk states with &gt;97% persistence; structural stability tests pass (Chow p = 0.993). Benchmarking against Diebold-Yilmaz connectedness shows equivalent detection (75%) with higher precision (33.5% vs. 22.4%). Out-of-sample specificity testing on 2024-2025 data confirms zero false positives, correctly classifying the $1.5B Bybit hack as non-systemic. ASRI captures DeFi-specific vulnerabilities -- composability risk, flash loan exposure, and tokenized RWA linkages -- that SRISK and CoVaR cannot accommodate.</description>

      <title>The Extremity Premium: Sentiment Regimes and Adverse Selection in Cryptocurrency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index and Bitcoin daily data, we document that sentiment extremity predicts excess uncertainty beyond realized volatility. Extreme fear and extreme greed regimes exhibit significantly higher spreads than neutral periods -- a phenomenon we term the "extremity premium." Extended validation on the full Fear &amp; Greed history (February 2018--January 2026, N = 2,896) confirms the finding: within-volatility-quintile comparisons show a significant premium (p &lt; 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.21), Granger causality from uncertainty to spreads is strong (F = 211), and placebo tests reject the null (p &lt; 0.0001). The effect replicates on Ethereum and across 6 of 7 market cycles. However, the premium is sensitive to functional form: comprehensive regression controls absorb regime effects, while nonparametric stratification preserves them. We interpret this as evidence that sentiment extremity captures volatility-regime interactions not fully represented by parametric controls -- consistent with, but not conclusively separable from, the F&amp;G Index's embedded volatility component. An agent-based model reproduces the pattern qualitatively. The results suggest that intensity, not direction, drives uncertainty-linked liquidity withdrawal in cryptocurrency markets, though identification of "pure" sentiment effects from volatility remains an open challenge.</description>

      <title>Same Returns, Different Risks: How Cryptocurrency Markets Process Infrastructure vs Regulatory Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether cryptocurrency markets differentiate between infrastructure failures and regulatory enforcement at the return level, complementing a companion conditional variance analysis that finds 5.7 times larger volatility impacts from infrastructure events (p = 0.0008). Using event-level block bootstrap inference on 31 events across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano (2019-2025), we find no statistically significant difference in cumulative abnormal returns between infrastructure failures (-7.6%) and regulatory enforcement (-11.1%): the difference of +3.6 pp has p = 0.81 with 95% CI [-25.3%, +30.9%]. This null acquires substantive meaning alongside the companion's highly significant variance result: the same events that produce indistinguishable return responses generate dramatically different volatility signatures. Markets differentiate shock types through the risk channel -- the second moment -- rather than expected returns. The block bootstrap methodology, which resamples entire events to preserve cross-sectional correlation, reveals that prior parametric approaches systematically understate uncertainty by inflating degrees of freedom. Results are robust across eight specifications including permutation tests, leave-one-out analysis, and the Ibragimov-Mueller few-cluster test.</description>
