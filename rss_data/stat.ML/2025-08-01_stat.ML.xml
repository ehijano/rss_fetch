      <title>A Smoothing Newton Method for Rank-one Matrix Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the phase retrieval problem, which involves recovering a rank-one positive semidefinite matrix from rank-one measurements. A recently proposed algorithm based on Bures-Wasserstein gradient descent (BWGD) exhibits superlinear convergence, but it is unstable, and existing theory can only prove local linear convergence for higher rank matrix recovery. We resolve this gap by revealing that BWGD implements Newton's method with a nonsmooth and nonconvex objective. We develop a smoothing framework that regularizes the objective, enabling a stable method with rigorous superlinear convergence guarantees. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate this superior stability while maintaining fast convergence.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport Learning: Balancing Value Optimization and Fairness in Individualized Treatment Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individualized treatment rules (ITRs) have gained significant attention due to their wide-ranging applications in fields such as precision medicine, ridesharing, and advertising recommendations. However, when ITRs are influenced by sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or age, they can lead to outcomes where certain groups are unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged. To address this gap, we propose a flexible approach based on the optimal transport theory, which is capable of transforming any optimal ITR into a fair ITR that ensures demographic parity. Recognizing the potential loss of value under fairness constraints, we introduce an ``improved trade-off ITR," designed to balance value optimization and fairness while accommodating varying levels of fairness through parameter adjustment. To maximize the value of the improved trade-off ITR under specific fairness levels, we propose a smoothed fairness constraint for estimating the adjustable parameter. Additionally, we establish a theoretical upper bound on the value loss for the improved trade-off ITR. We demonstrate performance of the proposed method through extensive simulation studies and application to the Next 36 entrepreneurial program dataset.</description>

      <title>DICOM De-Identification via Hybrid AI and Rule-Based Framework for Scalable, Uncertainty-Aware Redaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to medical imaging and associated text data has the potential to drive major advances in healthcare research and patient outcomes. However, the presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files presents a significant barrier to the ethical and secure sharing of imaging datasets. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework developed by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines rule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification for comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data.
  Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit and inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of synthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we employ an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text, extract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the NER pipeline for final redaction. Crucially, uncertainty quantification provides confidence measures for AI-based detections to enhance automation reliability and enable informed human-in-the-loop verification to manage residual risks.
  This uncertainty-aware deidentification framework achieves robust performance across benchmark datasets and regulatory standards, including DICOM, HIPAA, and TCIA compliance metrics. By combining scalable automation, uncertainty quantification, and rigorous quality assurance, our solution addresses critical challenges in medical data de-identification and supports the secure, ethical, and trustworthy release of imaging data for research.</description>

      <title>Scaled Beta Models and Feature Dilution for Dynamic Ticket Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach is presented for identifying distinct signatures of performing acts in the secondary ticket resale market by analyzing dynamic pricing distributions. Using a newly curated, time series dataset from the SeatGeek API, we model ticket pricing distributions as scaled Beta distributions. This enables accurate parameter estimation from incomplete statistical data using a hybrid of quantile matching and the method of moments. Incorporating the estimated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters into Random Forest classifiers significantly improves pairwise artist classification accuracy, demonstrating the unique economic signatures in event pricing data. Additionally, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that incorporating zero-variance (constant-value) features into Random Forest models acts as an implicit regularizer, enhancing feature variety and robustness. This regularization promotes deeper, more varied trees in the ensemble, improving the bias-variance tradeoff and mitigating overfitting to dominant features. These findings are validated on both the new ticket pricing dataset and the standard UCI ML handwritten digits dataset.</description>

      <title>Formal Bayesian Transfer Learning via the Total Risk Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In analyses with severe data-limitations, augmenting the target dataset with information from ancillary datasets in the application domain, called source datasets, can lead to significantly improved statistical procedures. However, existing methods for this transfer learning struggle to deal with situations where the source datasets are also limited and not guaranteed to be well-aligned with the target dataset. A typical strategy is to use the empirical loss minimizer on the source data as a prior mean for the target parameters, which places the estimation of source parameters outside of the Bayesian formalism. Our key conceptual contribution is to use a risk minimizer conditional on source parameters instead. This allows us to construct a single joint prior distribution for all parameters from the source datasets as well as the target dataset. As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty quantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over indicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset. We show how a particular instantiation of our prior leads to a Bayesian Lasso in a transformed coordinate system and discuss computational techniques to scale our approach to moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate that recently proposed minimax-frequentist transfer learning techniques may be viewed as an approximate Maximum a Posteriori approach to our model. Finally, we demonstrate superior predictive performance relative to the frequentist baseline on a genetics application, especially when the source data are limited.</description>

      <title>Spatiodynamic inference using vision-based generative modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological systems commonly exhibit complex spatiotemporal patterns whose underlying generative mechanisms pose a significant analytical challenge. Traditional approaches to spatiodynamic inference rely on dimensionality reduction through summary statistics, which sacrifice complexity and interdependent structure intrinsic to these data in favor of parameter identifiability. This imposes a fundamental constraint on reliably extracting mechanistic insights from spatiotemporal data, highlighting the need for analytical frameworks that preserve the full richness of these dynamical systems. To address this, we developed a simulation-based inference framework that employs vision transformer-driven variational encoding to generate compact representations of the data, exploiting the inherent contextual dependencies. These representations are subsequently integrated into a likelihood-free Bayesian approach for parameter inference. The central idea is to construct a fine-grained, structured mesh of latent representations from simulated dynamics through systematic exploration of the parameter space. This encoded mesh of latent embeddings then serves as a reference map for retrieving parameter values that correspond to observed data. By integrating generative modeling with Bayesian principles, our approach provides a unified inference framework to identify both spatial and temporal patterns that manifest in multivariate dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Overcoming error-in-variable problem in data-driven model discovery by orthogonal distance regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent proliferation of machine learning methods like SINDy that promise automatic discovery of governing equations from time-series data, there remain significant challenges to discovering models from noisy datasets. One reason is that the linear regression underlying these methods assumes that all noise resides in the training target (the regressand), which is the time derivative, whereas the measurement noise is in the states (the regressors). Recent methods like modified-SINDy and DySMHO address this error-in-variable problem by leveraging information from the model's temporal evolution, but they are also imposing the equation as a hard constraint, which effectively assumes no error in the regressand. Without relaxation, this hard constraint prevents assimilation of data longer than Lyapunov time. Instead, the fulfilment of the model equation should be treated as a soft constraint to account for the small yet critical error introduced by numerical truncation. The uncertainties in both the regressor and the regressand invite the use of orthogonal distance regression (ODR). By incorporating ODR with the Bayesian framework for model selection, we introduce a novel method for model discovery, termed ODR-BINDy, and assess its performance against current SINDy variants using the Lorenz63, Rossler, and Van Der Pol systems as case studies. Our findings indicate that ODR-BINDy consistently outperforms all existing methods in recovering the correct model from sparse and noisy datasets. For instance, our ODR-BINDy method reliably recovers the Lorenz63 equation from data with noise contamination levels of up to 30%.</description>

      <title>Directional Ensemble Aggregation for Actor-Critics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA), an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static ensemble strategies.</description>

      <title>Barycentric subspace analysis of network-valued data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain data are naturally modeled by networks or weighted graphs, be they arterial networks or mobility networks. When there is no canonical labeling of the nodes across the dataset, we talk about unlabeled networks. In this paper, we focus on the question of dimensionality reduction for this type of data. More specifically, we address the issue of interpreting the feature subspace constructed by dimensionality reduction methods. Most existing methods for network-valued data are derived from principal component analysis (PCA) and therefore rely on subspaces generated by a set of vectors, which we identify as a major limitation in terms of interpretability. Instead, we propose to implement the method called barycentric subspace analysis (BSA), which relies on subspaces generated by a set of points. In order to provide a computationally feasible framework for BSA, we introduce a novel embedding for unlabeled networks where we replace their usual representation by equivalence classes of isomorphic networks with that by equivalence classes of cospectral networks. We then illustrate BSA on simulated and real-world datasets, and compare it to tangent PCA.</description>

      <title>Optimised Feature Subset Selection via Simulated Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio, which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability, and performance are crucial.</description>

Abstract: The analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition offers a systematic method to understand the interaction effects that contribute to a specific decision output. In this paper we introduce Neural-ANOVA, an approach to decompose neural networks into the sum of lower-order models using the functional ANOVA decomposition. Our approach formulates a learning problem, which enables fast analytical evaluation of integrals over subspaces that appear in the calculation of the ANOVA decomposition. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to provide insights into the approximation properties compared to other regression approaches from the literature.</description>

      <title>Tensor Product Neural Networks for Functional ANOVA Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15215v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpretability for machine learning models is becoming more and more important as machine learning models become more complex. The functional ANOVA model, which decomposes a high-dimensional function into a sum of lower dimensional functions (commonly referred to as components), is one of the most popular tools for interpretable AI, and recently, various neural networks have been developed for estimating each component in the functional ANOVA model. However, such neural networks are highly unstable when estimating each component since the components themselves are not uniquely defined. That is, there are multiple functional ANOVA decompositions for a given function. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network which guarantees a unique functional ANOVA decomposition and thus is able to estimate each component stably and accurately. We call our proposed neural network ANOVA Tensor Product Neural Network (ANOVA-TPNN) since it is motivated by the tensor product basis expansion. Theoretically, we prove that ANOVA-TPNN can approximate any smooth function well. Empirically, we show that ANOVA-TPNN provide much more stable estimation of each component and thus much more stable interpretation when training data and initial values of the model parameters vary than existing neural networks do.</description>

      <title>Disparate Conditional Prediction in Multiclass Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.03234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose methods for auditing multiclass classifiers for fairness under multiclass equalized odds,by estimating the deviation from equalized odds when the classifier is not completely fair. We generalize to multiclass classifiers the measure of Disparate Conditional Prediction (DCP), originally suggested by Sabato &amp; Yom-Tov (2020) for binary classifiers. DCP is defined as the fraction of the population for which the classifier predicts with conditional prediction probabilities that differ from the closest common baseline. We provide new local-optimization methods for estimating the multiclass DCPunder two different regimes,one in which the conditional confusion matrices for each protected sub-population are known, and one in which these cannot be estimated, for instance, because the classifier is inaccessible or because good-quality individual-level data is not available. These methods can be used to detect classifiers that likely treat a significant fraction of the population unfairly. Experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the methods.

      <title>Insights into Closed-form IPM-GAN Discriminator Guidance for Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are a state-of-the-art generative modeling framework that transform noise to images via Langevin sampling, guided by the score, which is the gradient of the logarithm of the data distribution. Recent works have shown empirically that the generation quality can be improved when guided by classifier network, which is typically the discriminator trained in a generative adversarial network (GAN) setting. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the effect of the GAN discriminator on Langevin-based sampling, and show that the IPM-GAN optimization can be seen as one of smoothed score-matching, wherein the scores of the data and the generator distributions are convolved with the kernel function associated with the IPM. The proposed approach serves to unify score-based training and optimization of IPM-GANs. Based on these insights, we demonstrate that closed-form kernel-based discriminator guidance, results in improvements (in terms of CLIP-FID and KID metrics) when applied atop baseline diffusion models. We demonstrate these results on the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) and latent diffusion model (LDM) settings on various standard datasets. We also show that the proposed approach can be combined with existing accelerated-diffusion techniques to improve latent-space image generation.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the commonly utilized windowed Anderson acceleration (AA) algorithm for fixed-point methods, $x^{(k+1)}=q(x^{(k)})$. It provides the first proof that when the operator $q$ is linear and symmetric the windowed AA, which uses a sliding window of prior iterates, improves the root-linear convergence factor over the fixed-point iterations. When $q$ is nonlinear, yet has a symmetric Jacobian at a fixed point, a slightly modified AA algorithm is proved to have an analogous root-linear convergence factor improvement over fixed-point iterations. Simulations verify our observations. Furthermore, experiments with different data models demonstrate AA is significantly superior to the standard fixed-point methods for Tyler's M-estimation.</description>

      <title>Deciphering interventional dynamical causality from non-intervention complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01621</link>

Abstract: Detecting and quantifying causality is a focal topic in the fields of science, engineering, and interdisciplinary studies. However, causal studies on non-intervention systems attract much attention but remain extremely challenging. Delay-embedding technique provides a promising approach. In this study, we propose a framework named Interventional Dynamical Causality (IntDC) in contrast to the traditional Constructive Dynamical Causality (ConDC). ConDC, including Granger causality, transfer entropy and convergence of cross-mapping, measures the causality by constructing a dynamical model without considering interventions. A computational criterion, Interventional Embedding Entropy (IEE), is proposed to measure causal strengths in an interventional manner. IEE is an intervened causal information flow but in the delay-embedding space. Further, the IEE theoretically and numerically enables the deciphering of IntDC solely from observational (non-interventional) time-series data, without requiring any knowledge of dynamical models or real interventions in the considered system. In particular, IEE can be applied to rank causal effects according to their importance and construct causal networks from data. We conducted numerical experiments to demonstrate that IEE can find causal edges accurately, eliminate effects of confounding, and quantify causal strength robustly over traditional indices. We also applied IEE to real-world tasks. IEE performed as an accurate and robust tool for causal analyses solely from the observational data. The IntDC framework and IEE algorithm provide an efficient approach to the study of causality from time series in diverse non-intervention complex systems.</description>

      <title>Kandinsky Conformal Prediction: Beyond Class- and Covariate-Conditional Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a powerful distribution-free framework for constructing prediction sets with coverage guarantees. Classical methods, such as split conformal prediction, provide marginal coverage, ensuring that the prediction set contains the label of a random test point with a target probability. However, these guarantees may not hold uniformly across different subpopulations, leading to disparities in coverage. Prior work has explored coverage guarantees conditioned on events related to the covariates and label of the test point. We present Kandinsky conformal prediction, a framework that significantly expands the scope of conditional coverage guarantees. In contrast to Mondrian conformal prediction, which restricts its coverage guarantees to disjoint groups -- reminiscent of the rigid, structured grids of Piet Mondrian's art -- our framework flexibly handles overlapping and fractional group memberships defined jointly on covariates and labels, reflecting the layered, intersecting forms in Wassily Kandinsky's compositions. Our algorithm unifies and extends existing methods, encompassing covariate-based group conditional, class conditional, and Mondrian conformal prediction as special cases, while achieving a minimax-optimal high-probability conditional coverage bound. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach through empirical evaluation on real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proper scoring rules have been a subject of growing interest in recent years, not only as tools for evaluation of probabilistic forecasts but also as methods for estimating probability distributions. In this article, we review the mathematical foundations of proper scoring rules including general characterization results and important families of scoring rules. We discuss their role in statistics and machine learning for estimation and forecast evaluation. Furthermore, we comment on interesting developments of their usage in applications.</description>

      <title>GrokAlign: Geometric Characterisation and Acceleration of Grokking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key challenge for the machine learning community is to understand and accelerate the training dynamics of deep networks that lead to delayed generalisation and emergent robustness to input perturbations, also known as grokking. Prior work has associated phenomena like delayed generalisation with the transition of a deep network from a linear to a feature learning regime, and emergent robustness with changes to the network's functional geometry, in particular the arrangement of the so-called linear regions in deep networks employing continuous piecewise affine nonlinearities. Here, we explain how grokking is realised in the Jacobian of a deep network and demonstrate that aligning a network's Jacobians with the training data (in the sense of cosine similarity) ensures grokking under a low-rank Jacobian assumption. Our results provide a strong theoretical motivation for the use of Jacobian regularisation in optimizing deep networks -- a method we introduce as GrokAlign -- which we show empirically to induce grokking much sooner than more conventional regularizers like weight decay. Moreover, we introduce centroid alignment as a tractable and interpretable simplification of Jacobian alignment that effectively identifies and tracks the stages of deep network training dynamics.

      <title>Two-dimensional Parallel Tempering for Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines.</description>

      <title>TPP-SD: Accelerating Transformer Point Process Sampling with Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose TPP-SD, a novel approach that accelerates Transformer temporal point process (TPP) sampling by adapting speculative decoding (SD) techniques from language models. By identifying the structural similarities between thinning algorithms for TPPs and speculative decoding for language models, we develop an efficient sampling framework that leverages a smaller draft model to generate multiple candidate events, which are then verified by the larger target model in parallel. TPP-SD maintains the same output distribution as autoregressive sampling while achieving significant acceleration. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our approach produces samples from identical distributions as standard methods, but with 2-6$\times$ speedup. Our ablation studies analyze the impact of hyperparameters such as draft length and draft model size on sampling efficiency. TPP-SD bridges the gap between powerful Transformer TPP models and the practical need for rapid sequence sampling.</description>

      <title>AdaptHetero: Machine Learning Interpretation-Driven Subgroup Adaptation for EHR-Based Clinical Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interpretation (MLI) has primarily been leveraged to build clinician trust and uncover actionable insights in EHRs. However, the intrinsic complexity and heterogeneity of EHR data limit its effectiveness in guiding subgroup-specific modeling. We propose AdaptHetero, a novel MLI-driven framework that transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance for tailoring model training and evaluation across subpopulations within individual hospital systems. Evaluated on three large-scale EHR datasets: GOSSIS-1-eICU, WiDS, and MIMIC-IV, AdaptHetero consistently identifies heterogeneous model behaviors in predicting ICU mortality, in-hospital death, and hidden hypoxemia. By integrating SHAP-based interpretation and unsupervised clustering, the framework enhances the identification of clinically meaningful subgroup-specific characteristics, leading to improved predictive performance and optimized clinical deployment.</description>
