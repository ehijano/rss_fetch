      <title>Graded Projection Recursion (GPR): A Framework for Controlling Bit-Complexity of Algebraic Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recursive algorithms that use algebraic packing may appear to achieve reduced computational complexity that does not reflect the dominating bit-complexity, i.e., the implemented performance would not exhibit the claimed scaling. This paper introduces Graded Projection Recursion (GPR), a formal framework designed to address this problem by defining a rigorous mechanism that provably controls bit growth if specific conditions are satisfied.
  We use GPR to develop a matrix multiplication algorithm that is model-honest and achieves a true near-quadratic bit-complexity. This framework also provides a general GPR Substitution Principle recipe for accelerating a significant class of related algorithms in a provably rigorous way.</description>

      <title>Revealing POMDPs: Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis for Parity Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a central model for uncertainty in sequential decision making. The most basic objective is the reachability objective, where a target set must be eventually visited, and the more general parity objectives can model all omega-regular specifications. For such objectives, the computational analysis problems are the following: (a) qualitative analysis that asks whether the objective can be satisfied with probability 1 (almost-sure winning) or probability arbitrarily close to 1 (limit-sure winning); and (b) quantitative analysis that asks for the approximation of the optimal probability of satisfying the objective. For general POMDPs, almost-sure analysis for reachability objectives is EXPTIME-complete, but limit-sure and quantitative analyses for reachability objectives are undecidable; almost-sure, limit-sure, and quantitative analyses for parity objectives are all undecidable. A special class of POMDPs, called revealing POMDPs, has been studied recently in several works, and for this subclass the almost-sure analysis for parity objectives was shown to be EXPTIME-complete. In this work, we show that for revealing POMDPs the limit-sure analysis for parity objectives is EXPTIME-complete, and even the quantitative analysis for parity objectives can be achieved in EXPTIME.</description>

      <title>Parameterized complexity of scheduling unit-time jobs with generalized precedence constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the parameterized complexity of scheduling unit-time jobs on parallel, identical machines under generalized precedence constraints for minimization of the makespan and the sum of completion times. In our setting, each job is equipped with a Boolean formula (precedence constraint) over the set of jobs. A schedule satisfies a job's precedence constraint if setting earlier jobs to true satisfies the formula. Our definition generalizes several common types of precedence constraints: classical and-constraints if every formula is a conjunction, or-constraints if every formula is a disjunction, and and/or-constraints if every formula is in conjunctive normal form. We prove fixed-parameter tractability when parameterizing by the number of predecessors. For parameterization by the number of successors, however, the complexity depends on the structure of the precedence constraints. If every constraint is a conjunction or a disjunction, we prove the problem to be fixed-parameter tractable. For constraints in disjunctive normal form, we prove W[1]-hardness. We show that the and/or-constrained problem is NP-hard, even for a single successor. Moreover, we prove NP-hardness on two machines if every constraint is a conjunction or a disjunction. This result not only proves para-NP-hardness for parameterization by the number of machines but also complements the polynomial-time solvability on two machines if every constraint is a conjunction (Coffman and Graham 1972) or if every constraint is a disjunction (Berit 2005).</description>

      <title>A Complexity Analysis of the c-Closed Vertex Deletion Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph is $c$-closed when every pair of nonadjacent vertices has at most $c-1$ common neighbors. In $c$-Closed Vertex Deletion, the input is a graph $G$ and an integer $k$ and we ask whether $G$ can be transformed into a $c$-closed graph by deleting at most $k$ vertices. We study the classic and parameterized complexity of $c$-Closed Vertex Deletion. We obtain, for example, NP-hardness for the case that $G$ is bipartite with bounded maximum degree. We also show upper and lower bounds on the size of problem kernels for the parameter $k$ and introduce a new parameter, the number $x$ of vertices in bad pairs, for which we show a problem kernel of size $\mathcal{O}(x^3 + x^2\cdot c))$. Here, a pair of nonadjacent vertices is bad if they have at least $c$ common neighbors. Finally, we show that $c$-Closed Vertex Deletion can be solved in polynomial time on unit interval graphs with depth at most $c+1$ and that it is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the neighborhood diversity of $G$.</description>

      <title>Taming Barren Plateaus in Arbitrary Parameterized Quantum Circuits without Sacrificing Expressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13408v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have enabled a wide range of applications on near-term quantum devices. However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our method by modifying a commonly used PQC for thermal-state preparation. The results show that {barren plateaus are effectively eliminated} in this class of circuits with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers, whereas the original ansatz suffers from severe gradient vanishing.</description>

      <title>Rankwidth of Graphs with Balanced Separations: Expansion for Dense Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every graph of rankwidth at least $72r$ contains an induced subgraph whose minimum balanced cutrank is at least $r$, which implies a vertex subset where every balanced separation has $\mathbb{F}_2$-cutrank at least $r$. This implies a novel relation between rankwidth and a well-linkedness measure, defined entirely by balanced vertex cuts. As a byproduct, our result supports the notion of rank-expansion as a suitable candidate for measuring expansion in dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Determination Problems for Orbit Closures and Matrix Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational problems concerning the orbit of a point under the action of a matrix group occur throughout computer science, including in program analysis, complexity theory, quantum computation, and automata theory. In many cases the focus extends beyond orbits proper to orbit closures under a suitable topology. Typically one starts from a group and a set of points and asks questions about the orbit closure of the set under the action of the group, e.g., whether two given orbit closures intersect.
  In this paper we consider a collection of what we call determination problems concerning matrix groups and orbit closures. These problems begin with a given variety and seek to understand whether and how it arises either as an algebraic matrix group or as an orbit closure. The how question asks whether the underlying group is $s$-generated, meaning it is topologically generated by $s$ matrices for a given number $s$. Among other applications, problems of this type have recently been studied in the context of synthesising loops subject to certain specified invariants on program variables.
  Our main result is a polynomial-space procedure that inputs a variety and a number $s$ and determines whether the given variety arises as an orbit closure of a point under an $s$-generated commutative algebraic matrix group. The main tools in our approach are structural properties of commutative algebraic matrix groups and module theory. We leave open the question of determining whether a variety is an orbit closure of a point under an $s$-generated algebraic matrix group (without the requirement of commutativity).</description>

      <title>Unbounded-width CSPs are Untestable in a Sublinear Number of Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bounded-degree query model, introduced by Goldreich and Ron (\textit{Algorithmica, 2002}), is a standard framework in graph property testing and sublinear-time algorithms. Many properties studied in this model, such as bipartiteness and 3-colorability of graphs, can be expressed as satisfiability of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). We prove that for the entire class of \emph{unbounded-width} CSPs, testing satisfiability requires $\Omega(n)$ queries in the bounded-degree model. This result unifies and generalizes several previous lower bounds. In particular, it applies to all CSPs that are known to be $\mathbf{NP}$-hard to solve, including $k$-colorability of $\ell$-uniform hypergraphs for any $k,\ell \ge 2$ with $(k,\ell) \neq (2,2)$.
  Our proof combines the techniques from Bogdanov, Obata, and Trevisan (\textit{FOCS, 2002}), who established the first $\Omega(n)$ query lower bound for CSP testing in the bounded-degree model, with known results from universal algebra.</description>

      <title>Seeding with Differentially Private Network Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16590v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In public health interventions such as distributing preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention, decision makers often use seeding algorithms to identify key individuals who can amplify intervention impact. However, building a complete sexual activity network is typically infeasible due to privacy concerns. Instead, contact tracing can provide influence samples, observed sequences of sexual contacts, without full network reconstruction. This raises two challenges: protecting individual privacy in these samples and adapting seeding algorithms to incomplete data. We study differential privacy guarantees for influence maximization when the input consists of randomly collected cascades. Building on recent advances in costly seeding, we propose privacy-preserving algorithms that introduce randomization in data or outputs and bound the privacy loss of each node. Theoretical analysis and simulations on synthetic and real-world sexual contact data show that performance degrades gracefully as privacy budgets tighten, with central privacy regimes achieving better trade-offs than local ones.</description>

      <title>Model Counting for Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas (DQBF) generalize QBF by explicitly specifying which universal variables each existential variable depends on, instead of relying on a linear quantifier order. The satisfiability problem of DQBF is NEXP-complete, and many hard problems can be succinctly encoded as DQBF. Recent work has revealed a strong analogy between DQBF and SAT: k-DQBF (with k existential variables) is a succinct form of k-SAT, and satisfiability is NEXP-complete for 3-DQBF but PSPACE-complete for 2-DQBF, mirroring the complexity gap between 3-SAT (NP-complete) and 2-SAT (NL-complete).
  Motivated by this analogy, we study the model counting problem for DQBF, denoted #DQBF. Our main theoretical result is that #2-DQBF is #EXP-complete, where #EXP is the exponential-time analogue of #P. This parallels Valiant's classical theorem stating that #2-SAT is #P-complete. As a direct application, we show that first-order model counting (FOMC) remains #EXP-complete even when restricted to a PSPACE-decidable fragment of first-order logic and domain size two.
  Building on recent successes in reducing 2-DQBF satisfiability to symbolic model checking, we develop a dedicated 2-DQBF model counter. Using a diverse set of crafted instances, we experimentally evaluated it against a baseline that expands 2-DQBF formulas into propositional formulas and applies propositional model counting. While the baseline worked well when each existential variable depends on few variables, our implementation scaled significantly better to larger dependency sets.</description>
