      <title>Panoptic: True Joint mmWave Communication and Sensing with Compressive Sidelobe Forming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of communication and sensing functions within mmWave systems has gained attention due to the potential for enhanced passive sensing and improved communication reliability. State-of-the-art techniques separate these two functions in frequency, use of hardware, or time, i.e., sending known preambles for channel sensing or unknown symbols for communications. In this paper, we introduce Panoptic, a novel system architecture for integrated communication and sensing sharing the same hardware, frequency, and time resources. Panoptic jointly detects unknown symbols and channel components from data-modulated signals. The core idea is a new beam manipulation technique, which we call compressive sidelobe forming, that maintains a directional mainlobe toward the intended communication nodes while acquiring unique spatial information through pseudorandom sidelobe perturbations. We implemented Panoptic on 60 GHz mmWave radios and conducted extensive over-the-air experiments. Our results show that Panoptic achieves reflector angular localization error of less than 2\deg while at the same time supporting mmWave data communication with a negligible BER penalty when compared with conventional communication-only mmWave systems.</description>

      <title>Sensing With Random Communication Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication-centric Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has been recognized as a promising methodology to implement wireless sensing functionality over existing network architectures, due to its cost-effectiveness and backward compatibility to legacy cellular systems. However, the inherent randomness of the communication signal may incur huge fluctuations in sensing capabilities, leading to unfavorable detection and estimation performance. To address this issue, we elaborate on random ISAC signal processing methods in this article, aiming at improving the sensing performance without unduly deteriorating the communication functionality. Specifically, we commence by discussing the fundamentals of sensing with random communication signals, including the performance metrics and optimal ranging waveforms. Building on these concepts, we then present a general framework for random ISAC signal transmission, followed by an in-depth exploration of time-domain pulse shaping, frequency-domain constellation shaping, and spatial-domain precoding methods. We provide a comprehensive overview of each of these topics, including models, results, and design guidelines. Finally, we conclude this article by identifying several promising research directions for random ISAC signal transmission.</description>

      <title>A Novel Angle-Delay-Doppler Estimation Scheme for AFDM-ISAC System in Mixed Near-field and Far-field Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed multi-chirp waveform, affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), is considered as a potential candidate for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, acquiring accurate target sensing parameter information becomes challenging due to fractional delay and Doppler shift occurrence, as well as effects introduced by the coexistence of near-field (NF) and far-field (FF) targets associated with large-scale antenna systems. In this paper, we propose a novel angle-delay-Doppler estimation scheme for AFDM-ISAC system in mixed NF and FF scenarios. Specifically, we model the received ISAC signals as a third-order tensor that admits a low-rank CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) format. By employing the Vandermonde nature of the factor matrix and the spatial smoothing technique, we develop a structured CP decomposition method that guarantees the condition for uniqueness. We further propose a low-complexity estimation scheme to acquire target sensing parameters with fractional values, including angle of arrival/departure (AoA/AoD), delay and Doppler shift accurately. We also derive the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) as a benchmark and analyze the complexity of our proposed scheme. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Oriented Adaptive Resource Allocation Designs for OFDM-ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing - integrated sensing and communication (OFDM-ISAC) has emerged as a key enabler for future wireless networks, leveraging the widely adopted OFDM waveform to seamlessly integrate wireless communication and radar sensing within a unified framework. In this paper, we propose adaptive resource allocation strategies for OFDM-ISAC systems to achieve optimal trade-offs between diverse sensing requirements and communication quality-of-service (QoS). We first develop a comprehensive resource allocation framework for OFDM-ISAC systems, deriving closed-form expressions for key sensing performance metrics, including delay resolution, Doppler resolution, delay-Doppler peak sidelobe level (PSL), and received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce two novel resource allocation algorithms tailored to distinct sensing objectives. The resolution-oriented algorithm aims to maximize the weighted delay-Doppler resolution while satisfying constraints on PSL, sensing SNR, communication sum-rate, and transmit power. The sidelobe-oriented algorithm focuses on minimizing delay-Doppler PSL while satisfying resolution, SNR, and communication constraints. To efficiently solve the resulting non-convex optimization problems, we develop two adaptive resource allocation algorithms based on Dinkelbach's transform and majorization-minimization (MM). Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed sensing-oriented adaptive resource allocation strategies in enhancing resolution and sidelobe suppression. Remarkably, these strategies achieve sensing performance nearly identical to that of a radar-only scheme, which dedicates all resources to sensing. These results highlight the superior performance of the proposed methods in optimizing the trade-off between sensing and communication objectives within OFDM-ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>A Survey of New Mid-Band/FR3 for 6G: Channel Measurement, Characterization and Modeling in Outdoor Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new mid-band (6-24 GHz) has attracted significant attention from both academia and industry, which is the spectrum with continuous bandwidth that combines the coverage benefits of low frequency with the capacity advantages of high frequency. Since outdoor environments represent the primary application scenario for mobile communications, this paper presents the first comprehensive review and summary of multi-scenario and multi-frequency channel characteristics based on extensive outdoor new mid-band channel measurement data, including UMa, UMi, and O2I. Specifically, a survey of the progress of the channel characteristics is presented, such as path loss, delay spread, angular spread, channel sparsity, capacity and near-field spatial non-stationary characteristics. Then, considering that satellite communication will be an important component of future communication systems, we examine the impact of clutter loss in air-ground communications. Our analysis of the frequency dependence of mid-band clutter loss suggests that its impact is not significant. Additionally, given that penetration loss is frequency-dependent, we summarize its variation within the FR3 band. Based on experimental results, comparisons with the standard model reveal that while the 3GPP TR 38.901 model remains a useful reference for penetration loss in wood and glass, it shows significant deviations for concrete and glass, indicating the need for further refinement. In summary, the findings of this survey provide both empirical data and theoretical support for the deployment of mid-band in future communication systems, as well as guidance for optimizing mid-band base station deployment in the outdoor environment. This survey offers the reference for improving standard models and advancing channel modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) enables efficient spectrum utilization and reduces hardware costs for beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G networks, facilitating intelligent applications that require both high-performance communication and precise sensing capabilities. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the evolution of ISAC over the years. We examine the expansion of the spectrum across RF and optical ISAC, highlighting the role of advanced technologies, along with key challenges and synergies. We further discuss the advancements in network architecture from single-cell to multi-cell systems, emphasizing the integration of collaborative sensing and interference mitigation strategies. Moreover, we analyze the progress from single-modal to multi-modal sensing, with a focus on the integration of edge intelligence to enable real-time data processing, reduce latency, and enhance decision-making. Finally, we extensively review standardization efforts by 3GPP, IEEE, and ITU, examining the transition of ISAC-related technologies and their implications for the deployment of 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Interference Mitigation and Spectral Efficiency Enhancement in a Multi-BD Symbiotic Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a framework designed to mitigate direct-link interference (DLI) and inter-backscatter device interference (IBDI) in multi-backscatter orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based symbiotic radio (SR) systems. The framework employs OFDM signal designs with strategic allocation of null subcarriers and incorporates two backscatter modulation techniques: on-off frequency shift keying (OFSK) and multiple frequency shift keying (MFSK) for symbiotic backscatter communication (SBC). Additionally, we propose Fully-Orthogonal and Semi-Orthogonal multiple access schemes to facilitate SBC alongside primary communication. The Fully-Orthogonal scheme maintains orthogonality between direct link and SBC signals, thereby ensuring interference-free SBC, albeit at a reduced spectral efficiency. In contrast, the Semi-Orthogonal schemes eliminate IBDI but permit partial DLI, striking a balance between reliability and spectral efficiency. To address the partial DLI inherent in Semi-Orthogonal schemes, successive interference cancellation (SIC) is employed at the receiver, enhancing SBC reliability. To tackle channel estimation challenges in SBC within the SR system, we implement non-coherent detection techniques at the receiver. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated based on average bit error rate (BER) and sum-rate metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our schemes. We provide analytical results for the system's detection performance under both proposed modulation techniques and multiple access schemes, which are subsequently validated through extensive simulations. These simulations indicate a notable error-rate reduction of up to $10^{-3}$ at $20$ dB with the Fully-Orthogonal scheme with MFSK.</description>

      <title>xApp Conflict Mitigation with Scheduler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open RAN (O-RAN) fosters multi-vendor interoperability and data-driven control but simultaneously introduces the challenge of managing pre-trained xApps that can produce conflicting actions. Although O-RAN specifications mandate offline training and validation to prevent untrained models, operational conflicts remain likely under dynamic, context-dependent conditions. This work proposes a scheduler-based conflict mitigation framework to address these challenges without requiring training xApps together or further xApp re-training. By examining an indirect conflict involving power and resource block allocation xApps and employing an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) approach to train both xApps and the scheduler, we illustrate that a straightforward A2C-based scheduler improves performance relative to independently deployed xApps and conflicting cases. Notably, augmenting the system with baseline xApps and allowing the scheduler to select from a broader pool yields the best results, underscoring the importance of adaptive scheduling mechanisms. These findings highlight the context-dependent nature of conflicts in automated network management, as two xApps may conflict under certain conditions but coexist under others. Consequently, the ability to dynamically update and adapt the scheduler to accommodate diverse operational intents is vital for future network deployments. By offering dynamic scheduling without re-training xApps, this framework advances practical conflict resolution solutions while supporting real-world scalability.</description>

      <title>Conformal Robust Beamforming via Generative Channel Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to outage-constrained beamforming optimization rely on statistical assumptions about channel distributions and estimation errors. However, the resulting outage probability guarantees are only valid when these assumptions accurately reflect reality. This paper tackles the fundamental challenge of providing outage probability guarantees that remain robust regardless of specific channel or estimation error models. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage framework: (i) construction of a channel uncertainty set using a generative channel model combined with conformal prediction, and (ii) robust beamforming via the solution of a min-max optimization problem. The proposed method separates the modeling and optimization tasks, enabling principled uncertainty quantification and robust decision-making. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the framework in achieving model-agnostic outage guarantees.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Optimization and Transfer Learning for Cellular Network Antenna Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach for large-scale cellular network optimization, using a production cellular network in London as a case study and employing Sionna ray tracing for site-specific channel propagation modeling. We optimize base station antenna tilts and half-power beamwidths, resulting in more than double the 10\%-worst user rates compared to a 3GPP baseline. In scenarios involving aerial users, we identify configurations that increase their median rates fivefold without compromising ground user performance. We further demonstrate the efficacy of model generalization through transfer learning, leveraging available data from a scenario source to predict the optimal solution for a scenario target within a similar number of iterations, without requiring a new initial dataset, and with a negligible performance loss.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Design of 3GPP Handover Parameters with Bayesian Optimization and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobility management in dense cellular networks is challenging due to varying user speeds and deployment conditions. Traditional 3GPP handover (HO) schemes, relying on fixed A3-offset and time-to-trigger (TTT) parameters, struggle to balance radio link failures (RLFs) and ping-pongs. We propose a data-driven HO optimization framework based on high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HD-BO) and enhanced with transfer learning to reduce training time and improve generalization across different user speeds. Evaluations on a real-world deployment show that HD-BO outperforms 3GPP set-1 and set-5 benchmarks, while transfer learning enables rapid adaptation without loss in performance. This highlights the potential of data-driven, site-specific mobility management in large-scale networks.</description>

      <title>Cellular Network Design for UAV Corridors via Data-driven High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of designing cellular networks for uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) corridors through a novel data-driven approach. We assess multiple state-of-the-art high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HD-BO) techniques to jointly optimize the cell antenna tilts and half-power beamwidth (HPBW). We find that some of these approaches achieve over 20dB gains in median SINR along UAV corridors, with negligible degradation to ground user performance. Furthermore, we explore the HD-BO's capabilities in terms of model generalization via transfer learning, where data from a previously observed scenario source is leveraged to predict the optimal solution for a new scenario target. We provide examples of scenarios where such transfer learning is successful and others where it fails. Moreover, we demonstrate that HD-BO enables multi-objective optimization, identifying optimal design trade-offs between data rates on the ground versus UAV coverage reliability. We observe that aiming to provide UAV coverage across the entire sky can lower the rates for ground users compared to setups specifically optimized for UAV corridors. Finally, we validate our approach through a case study in a real-world cellular network, where HD-BO identifies optimal and non-obvious antenna configurations that result in more than double the rates along 3D UAV corridors with negligible ground performance loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog computing has been recently revived due to its potential for energy-efficient and highly parallel computations. In this paper, we investigate analog computers that linearly process microwave signals, named microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs), and their applications in signal processing for communications. We model a MiLAC as a multiport microwave network with tunable impedance components, which enables the execution of mathematical operations by reconfiguring the microwave network and applying input signals at its ports. We demonstrate that a MiLAC can efficiently compute the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator, widely used in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications beamforming and detection, with remarkably low computational complexity, unachievable through digital computing. Specifically, the LMMSE estimator can be computed with complexity growing with the square of its input size, rather than the cube, with revolutionary applications to gigantic MIMO beamforming and detection.</description>

      <title>Bi-Linear Homogeneity Enforced Calibration for Pipelined ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pipelined analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are key enablers in many state-of-the-art signal processing systems with high sampling rates. In addition to high sampling rates, such systems often demand a high linearity. To meet these challenging linearity requirements, ADC calibration techniques were heavily investigated throughout the past decades. One limitation in ADC calibration is the need for a precisely known test signal. In our previous work, we proposed the homogeneity enforced calibration (HEC) approach, which circumvents this need by consecutively feeding a test signal and a scaled version of it into the ADC. The calibration itself is performed using only the corresponding output samples, such that the test signal can remain unknown. On the downside, the HEC approach requires to accurately scale the test signal, impeding an on-chip implementation. In this work, we provide a thorough analysis of the HEC approach, including limitations such as the effects of an inaccurately scaled test signal. Furthermore, the bi-linear homogeneity enforced calibration (BL-HEC) approach is introduced and suggested to account for an inaccurate scaling and, therefore, to facilitate an on-chip implementation. In addition, a comprehensive stability analysis of the BL-HEC approach is carried out. Finally, we verify our concept with behavioral Matlab simulations and measurements conducted on 24 integrated ADCs.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and Low-Complexity Beamforming Design for Near-Field Physical Layer Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) have emerged as a key enabler in achieving the unprecedented performance requirements of future wireless networks, leading to a significant increase in the range of the near-field region. This transition necessitates the spherical wavefront model for characterizing the wireless propagation rather than the far-field planar counterpart, thereby introducing extra degrees of freedom (DoFs) to wireless system design. In this paper, we explore the beam focusing-based physical layer security (PLS) in the near field, where multiple legitimate users and one eavesdropper are situated in the near-field region of the XL-array base station (BS). First, we consider a special case with one legitimate user and one eavesdropper to shed useful insights into near-field PLS. In particular, it is shown that 1) Artificial noise (AN) is crucial to near-field security provisioning, transforming an insecure system to a secure one; 2) AN can yield numerous security gains, which considerably enhances PLS in the near field as compared to the case without AN taken into account. Next, for the general case with multiple legitimate users, we propose an efficient low-complexity approach to design the beamforming with AN to guarantee near-field secure transmission. Specifically, the low-complexity approach is conceived starting by introducing the concept of interference domain to capture the inter-user interference level, followed by a three-step identification framework for designing the beamforming. Finally, numerical results reveal that 1) the PLS enhancement in the near field is pronounced thanks to the additional spatial DoFs; 2) the proposed approach can achieve close performance to that of the computationally-extensive conventional approach yet with a significantly lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Robust 3D Multi-Source Localization with a Movable Antenna Array via Sparse Signal Processing</title>

Abstract: Accurately localizing multiple sources is a critical task with various applications in wireless communications, such as emergency services, including natural post-disaster search and rescue operations. However, scenarios where the receiver is moving have not been sufficiently addressed in recent studies. This paper tackles the angle of arrival (AOA) 3D-localization problem for multiple sparse signal sources with a moving receiver, which has a limited number of antennas that may be outnumbered by the sources. First, an energy detector algorithm is proposed to leverage signal sparsity for eliminating noisy samples. Subsequently, an iterative algorithm is developed to refine and estimate the AOAs accurately, initialized with previously estimated source locations and coarse elevation and azimuth AOAs obtained via the two-dimensional multiple signal classification (2D-MUSIC) method. To this end, we introduce a sparse recovery algorithm to exploit signal sparsity, followed by a phase smoothing algorithm to refine the estimates. The K-SVD algorithm is then applied to the smoothed output to accurately determine the elevation and azimuth AOAs of the sources. For localization, a new multi-source 3D-localization algorithm is proposed to estimate source positions using the refined AOA estimates over a sequence of time windows. Extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A Novel Massive Random Access in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems for High-Speed Mobility with OTFS Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the research of next-generation wireless communication technologies, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is emerging as a promising technique for high-speed mobile environments due to its superior efficiency and robustness in doubly selective channels. Additionally, the cell-free architecture, which eliminates the issues associated with cell boundaries, offers broader coverage for radio access networks. By combining cell-free network architecture with OTFS modulation, the system may meet the demands of massive random access required by machine-type communication devices in high-speed scenarios. This paper explores a massive random access scheme based on OTFS modulation within a cell-free architecture. A transceiver model for uplink OTFS signals involving multiple access points (APs) is developed, where channel estimation with fractional channel parameters is approximated as a block sparse matrix recovery problem. Building on existing superimposed and embedded preamble schemes, a hybrid preamble scheme is proposed. This scheme leverages superimposed and embedded preambles to respectively achieve rough and accurate active user equipment (UEs) detection (AUD), as well as precise channel estimation, under the condition of supporting a large number of access UEs. Moreover, this study introduces a generalized approximate message passing and pattern coupling sparse Bayesian learning with Laplacian prior (GAMP-PCSBL-La) algorithm, which effectively captures block sparse features after discrete cosine transform (DCT), delivering precise estimation results with reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and provides superior performance compared to other existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Transform on Graphs: Let There Be Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past years, many signal processing operations have been successfully adapted to the graph setting. One elegant and effective approach is to exploit the eigendecomposition of a graph shift operator (GSO), such as the adjacency or Laplacian operator, to define a graph Fourier transform when projecting graph signals on the corresponding basis. However, the extension of this scheme to directed graphs is challenging since the associated GSO is non-symmetric and, in general, not diagonalizable. Here, we build upon a recent framework that adds a minimal number of edges to allow diagonalization of the GSO and thus provide a proper graph Fourier transform. Furthermore, we show that such minimal addition of edges creates a cycle cover and that it is essential for the phase analysis of a signal throughout the graph. Concurrently, we propose a generalization of the Hilbert transform interpreted over the newfound cycle cover, which re-establishes intuitions from traditional Hilbert Transform, equivalent to the generalized Hilbert Transform on a single cycle. This generalization leads to a number of simple and elegant recipes to effectively exploit the phase information of graph signals provided by the graph Fourier transform. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated on several examples.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Aided Channel Estimation: Zone-Specific Subspace Prediction and Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective channel estimation in sparse and high-dimensional environments is essential for next-generation wireless systems, particularly in large-scale MIMO deployments. This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages digital twins (DTs) as priors to enable efficient zone-specific subspace-based channel estimation (CE). Subspace-based CE significantly reduces feedback overhead by focusing on the dominant channel components, exploiting sparsity in the angular domain while preserving estimation accuracy. While DT channels may exhibit inaccuracies, their coarse-grained subspaces provide a powerful starting point, reducing the search space and accelerating convergence. The framework employs a two-step clustering process on the Grassmann manifold, combined with reinforcement learning (RL), to iteratively calibrate subspaces and align them with real-world counterparts. Simulations show that digital twins not only enable near-optimal performance but also enhance the accuracy of subspace calibration through RL, highlighting their potential as a step towards learnable digital twins.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sensor Placement Using Combinations of Hybrid Measurements for Source Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on static source localization employing different combinations of measurements, including time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA), received-signal-strength (RSS), angle-of-arrival (AOA), and time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements. Since sensor-source geometry significantly impacts localization accuracy, the strategies of optimal sensor placement are proposed systematically using combinations of hybrid measurements. Firstly, the relationship between sensor placement and source estimation accuracy is formulated by a derived Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Secondly, the A-optimality criterion, i.e., minimizing the trace of the CRB, is selected to calculate the smallest reachable estimation mean-squared-error (MSE) in a unified manner. Thirdly, the optimal sensor placement strategies are developed to achieve the optimal estimation bound. Specifically, the specific constraints of the optimal geometries deduced by specific measurement, i.e., TDOA, AOA, RSS, and TOA, are found and discussed theoretically. Finally, the new findings are verified by simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Surface data imputation with stochastic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spurious measurements frequently occur in surface data from technical components. Excluding or ignoring these spurious points may lead to incorrect surface characterization if these points inherit features of the surface. Therefore, data imputation must be applied to ensure that the estimated data points at spurious measurements do not deviate strongly from the true surface and its characteristics. Traditional surface data imputation methods rely on simple assumptions and ignore existing knowledge of the surface, resulting in suboptimal estimates. In this paper, we propose the use of stochastic processes for data imputation. This approach, which originates from surface texture simulation, allows a straightforward integration of a priori knowledge. We employ Gaussian processes with both stationary and non-stationary covariance structures to address missing values in surface data. In addition, we apply the method to a real-world scenario in which a spurious turned profile is obtained from an actual measurement. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method fills the missing values by maintaining the surface characteristics, particularly when surface features are missing.</description>

      <title>Quantized symbolic time series approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in numerous science and engineering domains, e.g., signal processing, bioinformatics, and astronomy. Previous work has verified the efficacy of symbolic time series representation in a variety of engineering applications due to its storage efficiency and numerosity reduction. The most recent symbolic aggregate approximation technique, ABBA, has been shown to preserve essential shape information of time series and improve downstream applications, e.g., neural network inference regarding prediction and anomaly detection in time series.
  Motivated by the emergence of high-performance hardware which enables efficient computation for low bit-width representations, we present a new quantization-based ABBA symbolic approximation technique, QABBA, which exhibits improved storage efficiency while retaining the original speed and accuracy of symbolic reconstruction. We prove an upper bound for the error arising from quantization and discuss how the number of bits should be chosen to balance this with other errors.
  An application of QABBA with large language models (LLMs) for time series regression is also presented, and its utility is investigated. By representing the symbolic chain of patterns on time series, QABBA not only avoids the training of embedding from scratch, but also achieves a new state-of-the-art on Monash regression dataset. The symbolic approximation to the time series offers a more efficient way to fine-tune LLMs on the time series regression task which contains various application domains. We further present a set of extensive experiments performed across various well-established datasets to demonstrate the advantages of the QABBA method for symbolic approximation.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Enabled Large AI Models for CSI Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for channel state information (CSI) feedback. While recent research primarily focuses on improving feedback accuracy on a specific dataset through novel architectures, the underlying mechanism of AI-based CSI feedback remains unclear. This study explores the mechanism through analyzing performance across diverse datasets, with findings suggesting that superior feedback performance stems from AI models' strong fitting capabilities and their ability to leverage environmental knowledge. Building on these findings, we propose a prompt enabled large AI model (LAM) for CSI feedback. The LAM employs powerful transformer blocks and is trained on extensive datasets from various scenarios. Meanwhile, the channel distribution (environmental knowledge) -- represented as the mean of channel magnitude in the angular-delay domain -- is incorporated as a prompt within the decoder to further enhance reconstruction quality. Simulation results confirm that the proposed prompt-enabled LAM significantly improves feedback accuracy and generalization performance while reducing data collection requirements in new scenarios.</description>
