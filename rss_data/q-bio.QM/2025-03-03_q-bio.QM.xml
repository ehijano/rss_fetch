      <title>Modeling cell differentiation in neuroblastoma: insights into development, malignancy, and treatment relapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroblastoma is a paediatric extracranial solid cancer that arises from the developing sympathetic nervous system and is characterised by an abnormal distribution of cell types in tumours compared to healthy infant tissues. In this paper, we propose a new mathematical model of cell differentiation during sympathoadrenal development. By performing Bayesian inference of the model parameters using clinical data from patient samples, we show that the model successfully accounts for the observed differences in cell type heterogeneity among healthy adrenal tissues and four common types of neuroblastomas. Using a phenotypically structured model, we show that alterations in healthy differentiation dynamics are related to cell malignancy, and tumour volume growth. We use this model to analyse the evolution of malignant traits in a tumour. Our findings suggest that normal development dynamics make the embryonic sympathetic nervous system more robust to perturbations and accumulation of malignancies, and that the diversity of differentiation dynamics found in the neuroblastoma subtypes lead to unique risk profiles for neuroblastoma relapse after treatment.</description>

      <title>Evolution and Pathogenicity of SARS-CoVs: A Microcanonical Analysis of Receptor-Binding Motifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution and global impact of coronaviruses, notably SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, underscore the importance of understanding their molecular mechanisms in detail. This study focuses on the receptor-binding motif (RBM) within the Spike protein of these viruses, a critical element for viral entry through interaction with the ACE2 receptor. We investigate the sequence variations in the RBM across SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and its early variants of concern (VOCs). Utilizing multicanonical simulations and microcanonical analysis, we examine how these variations influence the folding dynamics, thermostability, and solubility of the RBMs. Our methodology includes calculating the density of states (DoS) to identify structural phase transitions and assess thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, we solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to model the solubility of the RBMs in aqueous environments. This methodology is expected to elucidate structural and functional differences in viral evolution and pathogenicity, likely improving targeted treatments and vaccines.</description>

      <title>Contextualizing biological perturbation experiments through language</title>

Abstract: High-content perturbation experiments allow scientists to probe biomolecular systems at unprecedented resolution, but experimental and analysis costs pose significant barriers to widespread adoption. Machine learning has the potential to guide efficient exploration of the perturbation space and extract novel insights from these data. However, current approaches neglect the semantic richness of the relevant biology, and their objectives are misaligned with downstream biological analyses. In this paper, we hypothesize that large language models (LLMs) present a natural medium for representing complex biological relationships and rationalizing experimental outcomes. We propose PerturbQA, a benchmark for structured reasoning over perturbation experiments. Unlike current benchmarks that primarily interrogate existing knowledge, PerturbQA is inspired by open problems in perturbation modeling: prediction of differential expression and change of direction for unseen perturbations, and gene set enrichment. We evaluate state-of-the-art machine learning and statistical approaches for modeling perturbations, as well as standard LLM reasoning strategies, and we find that current methods perform poorly on PerturbQA. As a proof of feasibility, we introduce Summer (SUMMarize, retrievE, and answeR, a simple, domain-informed LLM framework that matches or exceeds the current state-of-the-art. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/genentech/PerturbQA.</description>

      <title>Atomas: Hierarchical Alignment on Molecule-Text for Unified Molecule Understanding and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecule-and-text cross-modal representation learning has emerged as a promising direction for enhancing the quality of molecular representation, thereby improving performance in various scientific fields, including drug discovery and materials science. Existing studies adopt a global alignment approach to learn the knowledge from different modalities. These global alignment approaches fail to capture fine-grained information, such as molecular fragments and their corresponding textual description, which is crucial for downstream tasks. Furthermore, it is incapable to model such information using a similar global alignment strategy due to data scarcity of paired local part annotated data from existing datasets. In this paper, we propose Atomas, a multi-modal molecular representation learning framework to jointly learn representations from SMILES string and text. We design a Hierarchical Adaptive Alignment model to concurrently learn the fine-grained fragment correspondence between two modalities and align these representations of fragments in three levels. Additionally, Atomas's end-to-end training framework incorporates the tasks of understanding and generating molecule, thereby supporting a wider range of downstream tasks. In the retrieval task, Atomas exhibits robust generalization ability and outperforms the baseline by 30.8% of recall@1 on average. In the generation task, Atomas achieves state-of-the-art results in both molecule captioning task and molecule generation task. Moreover, the visualization of the Hierarchical Adaptive Alignment model further confirms the chemical significance of our approach.

      <title>Immunocto: a massive immune cell database auto-generated for histopathology</title>

Abstract: With the advent of novel cancer treatment options such as immunotherapy, studying the tumour immune micro-environment (TIME) is crucial to inform on prognosis and understand potential response to therapeutic agents. A key approach to characterising the TIME may be through combining (1) digitised microscopic high-resolution optical images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained tissue sections obtained in routine histopathology examinations with (2) automated immune cell detection and classification methods. In this work, we introduce a workflow to automatically generate robust single cell contours and labels from dually stained tissue sections with H&amp;E and multiplexed immunofluorescence (IF) markers. The approach harnesses the Segment Anything Model and requires minimal human intervention compared to existing single cell databases. With this methodology, we create Immunocto, a massive, multi-million automatically generated database of 6,848,454 human cells and objects, including 2,282,818 immune cells distributed across 4 subtypes: CD4$^+$ T cell lymphocytes, CD8$^+$ T cell lymphocytes, CD20$^+$ B cell lymphocytes, and CD68$^+$/CD163$^+$ macrophages. For each cell, we provide a 64$\times$64 pixels$^2$ H&amp;E image at $\mathbf{40}\times$ magnification, along with a binary mask of the nucleus and a label. The database, which is made publicly available, can be used to train models to study the TIME on routine H&amp;E slides. We show that deep learning models trained on Immunocto result in state-of-the-art performance for lymphocyte detection. The approach demonstrates the benefits of using matched H&amp;E and IF data to generate robust databases for computational pathology applications.</description>

      <title>Kinetic-Diffusion-Rotation Algorithm for Dose Estimation in Electron Beam Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods are state-of-the-art when it comes to dosimetric computations in radiotherapy. However, the execution time of these methods suffers in high-collisional regimes. We address this problem by introducing a kinetic-diffusion particle tracing scheme. This algorithm, first proposed in the context of neutral transport in fusion energy, relies on explicit simulation of the kinetic motion in low-collisional regimes and dynamically switches to motion based on a random walk in high-collisional regimes. The random walk motion maintains the first two moments (mean and variance) of the kinetic motion. We derive an analytic formula for the mean kinetic motion and discuss the addition of a multiple scattering distribution to the algorithm. In contrast to neutral transport, the radiation transfer setting does not readily admit to an analytical expression for the variance of the kinetic motion, and we therefore resort to the use of a lookup table. We test the algorithm for dosimetric computations in radiation therapy on a 2D CT scan of a lung patient. Using a simple particle model, our Python implementation of the algorithm is nearly 33 times faster than an equivalent kinetic simulation at the cost of a small modeling error.</description>

      <title>An introduction to statistical models used to characterize species-habitat associations with animal movement data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding species-habitat associations is fundamental to ecological sciences and for species conservation. Consequently, various statistical approaches have been designed to infer species-habitat associations. Due to their conceptual and mathematical differences, these methods can yield contrasting results. We describe and compare commonly used statistical models that relate animal movement data to environmental data, including resource selection functions (RSF), step-selection functions (SSF), and hidden Markov models (HMMs). We demonstrate differences in assumptions and highlighting advantages and limitations of each method. Additionally, we provide guidance on selecting the most appropriate statistical method based on the scale of the data and intended inference. To illustrate the varying ecological insights derived from each model, we apply them to the movement track of a single ringed seal in a case study. We demonstrate that each model yields varying ecological insights. For example, while the selection coefficient values from RSFs appear to show a stronger positive relationship with prey diversity than those of the SSFs, when we accounted for the autocorrelation in the data none of these relationships with prey diversity were statistically significant. The HMM reveals variable associations with prey diversity across different behaviors. Notably, the three models identified different important areas. This case study highlights the critical significance of selecting the appropriate model as an essential step in the process of identifying species-habitat relationships and specific areas of importance. Our review provides the foundational information required for making informed decisions when choosing the most suitable statistical methods to address specific questions, such as identifying protected zones, understanding movement patterns, or studying behaviours.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach to Multi-Fiber Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification in Diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is the primary imaging modality used to study brain microstructure in vivo. Reliable and computationally efficient parameter inference for common dMRI biophysical models is a challenging inverse problem, due to factors such as variable dimensionalities (reflecting the unknown number of distinct white matter fiber populations in a voxel), low signal-to-noise ratios, and non-linear forward models. These challenges have led many existing methods to use biologically implausible simplified models to stabilize estimation, for instance, assuming shared microstructure across all fiber populations within a voxel. In this work, we introduce a novel sequential method for multi-fiber parameter inference that decomposes the task into a series of manageable subproblems. These subproblems are solved using deep neural networks tailored to problem-specific structure and symmetry, and trained via simulation. The resulting inference procedure is largely amortized, enabling scalable parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification across all model parameters. Simulation studies and real imaging data analysis using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) demonstrate the advantages of our method over standard alternatives. In the case of the standard model of diffusion, our results show that under HCP-like acquisition schemes, estimates for extra-cellular parallel diffusivity are highly uncertain, while those for the intra-cellular volume fraction can be estimated with relatively high precision.</description>

      <title>Hybrid deep learning-based strategy for the hepatocellular carcinoma cancer grade classification of H&amp;E stained liver histopathology images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common type of liver cancer whose early-stage diagnosis is a common challenge, mainly due to the manual assessment of hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images, which is a time-consuming process and may lead to variability in decision-making. For accurate detection of HCC, we propose a hybrid deep learning-based architecture that uses transfer learning to extract the features from pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models and a classifier made up of a sequence of fully connected layers. This study uses a publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC)database (n=491) for model development and database of Kasturba Gandhi Medical College (KMC), India for validation. The pre-processing step involves patch extraction, colour normalization, and augmentation that results in 3920 patches for the TCGA dataset. The developed hybrid deep neural network consisting of a CNN-based pre-trained feature extractor and a customized artificial neural network-based classifier is trained using five-fold cross-validation. For this study, eight different state-of-the-art models are trained and tested as feature extractors for the proposed hybrid model. The proposed hybrid model with ResNet50-based feature extractor provided the sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC of 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, and 1.00, respectively on the TCGA database. On the KMC database, EfficientNetb3 resulted in the optimal choice of the feature extractor giving sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC of 96.97, 98.85, 96.71, 96.71, and 0.99, respectively. The proposed hybrid models showed improvement in accuracy of 2% and 4% over the pre-trained models in TCGA-LIHC and KMC databases.</description>
