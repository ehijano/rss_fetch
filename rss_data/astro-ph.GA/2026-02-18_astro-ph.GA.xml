      <title>Intracluster globular clusters as tracers of the mass assembly of the Hydra I galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In galaxy clusters, hierarchical assembly predicts the formation of stellar substructures and intracluster light (ICL), a diffuse stellar component tracing the global cluster potential. Because these features are extremely faint, alternative tracers such as globular clusters (GCs) provide a powerful tool to study cluster assembly. We use deep VLT/FORS $V$- and $I$-band imaging to investigate the GC population in the nearby Hydra I galaxy cluster ($\sim 45.7$ Mpc). GC candidates were selected from the $VI$ colour-magnitude diagram and divided into blue and red subpopulations. We find a clear spatial dichotomy: red GCs are concentrated around the massive central galaxies NGC 3311 and NGC 3309, while blue GCs are more extended and offset from the centre, coinciding with a secondary peak of X-ray-emitting gas. In the central regions, GC spatial distributions further depend on stellar population properties: young metal-rich GCs are more extended and may be linked to ram-pressure stripping, whereas old metal-poor GCs are more centrally concentrated, possibly originating from disrupted dwarf galaxies. Comparing the GC number density profiles to the surface brightness profile of NGC 3311, we find that the red GCs closely follow the galaxy light, while the blue population significantly deviates from it and traces the global gravitational potential of the cluster. This is also reflected in the specific frequency of blue GCs, which is approximately $\sim 5\times$ higher in the ICL-dominated outskirts than in the inner regions dominated by red GCs. Finally, we present a novel method to constrain the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function of the cluster using GC specific frequencies and colour distributions, yielding a past faint-end slope of $\alpha=-1.81^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ compared to $\alpha=-1.41^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ today, consistent with high-redshift observations and cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Barium Stars Across the Milky Way: Probing Their Origins via the GALAH Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barium stars are unusually enriched in barium ([Ba/Fe] &gt;= 1.0 dex) and not predicted by current Galactic chemical evolution models. Previous observations of barium stars have found evidence that they form through mass transfer from a companion asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star or through radiative levitation. The chemical abundance and kinematic information of barium stars may help constrain AGB stellar nucleosynthesis, binary star evolution, and internal evolutionary processes that affect surface abundances. Using ~450,000 stars from the GALactic Archaeology with Hermes (GALAH) survey, we identify nearly 3000 new barium-rich stars and separate them into hot (Teff &gt; 6000 K) and cool (Teff &lt; 6000 K) populations. Cross-matching with Gaia DR3, we find that 47.7% of our barium stars within 1 kpc have elevated re-normalized unit weight error (RUWE &gt;= 1.4), compared to 16.3% of a comparable sample of the GALAH field, suggesting multiplicity plays an important role in the formation of both populations of barium stars. A subset of hot barium stars exhibit low RUWE (RUWE &lt; 1.2) and [alpha/Fe] &lt; -0.2, supporting radiative levitation as an origin as well. We determine Galactic memberships using both kinematics and chemistry and find that barium stars exist in the thin disk, thick disk, and halo though they are slightly more prevalent at lower metallicities. Overall, we show evidence for barium stars produced by mass transfer and for those produced by radiative levitation, with both formation mechanisms occurring ubiquitously across the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The diverse nature of spiral arms in the Auriga Superstars cosmological hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical nature and formation mechanism(s) of galactic spiral arms remain long-standing problems in astrophysics. Most theoretical work is based on analytic calculations or idealised simulations, which has yielded several theories of spiral structure. The radial profile of the spiral arm rotation speed - the pattern speed - is a key observable prediction of these theories. However, observations that infer spiral pattern speeds reveal a mixed picture with no clear consensus. Here, we expand on theoretical efforts by examining the pattern speed profiles in the Auriga Superstars set of high-resolution cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulatons of Milky Way-mass spiral disc galaxies. These simulations combine galaxy formation in a cosmological environment with the high dynamical fidelity afforded by an $\sim 800$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ star particle resolution, giving $\sim 100$ million star particles in the disc. We show that several different spiral arm theories are realised among our simulations, including large-scale kinematic density waves, manifold spirals, dynamic (co-rotating) spirals, and overlapping modes. In particular, we demonstrate that a strong tidal interaction leads to clear kinematic density waves, and that manifold spirals are present in a strongly-barred galaxy. Interestingly, we find that the same galaxy may show qualitative evolution of their spiral pattern speed profiles, indicating that the nature of spiral arms can evolve on potentially sub-Gigayear timescales. Our results demonstrate that in the absence of a strong external encounter or a strong bar, galactic spiral structure is highly transitional and complex with no clear long-lived underlying wave.</description>

      <title>The dependence of triggering mechanisms on radio AGN sub-types: the role of galaxy mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powerful, radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) are associated with one of the most important forms of AGN feedback, and understanding how they are triggered is key to properly incorporating them into models of galaxy evolution. Here, we present the results of a deep Isaac Newton Telescope/Wide Field Camera imaging survey which, when combined with Gemini/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph South images, gives a 98 per cent complete sample of 112 3CR radio galaxies with redshifts $z$ &lt; 0.3, alongside a stellar mass matched control sample. Our results provide strong evidence for significant differences ($\sim$3$\sigma$) between the triggering mechanisms of the different sub-types of powerful radio AGN. The high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs) show a high rate of morphological disturbance (62$^{+6}_{-7}$ per cent) -- an excess of $\sim$4$\sigma$ compared with the control sample -- consistent with them being predominantly triggered in galaxy mergers and interactions. In contrast, the low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) show a much lower rate of morphological disturbance (36$^{+7}_{-6}$ per cent), consistent with the control sample, and suggesting a different dominant triggering mechanism, such as the accretion of gas from the hot X-ray haloes of the host galaxies or galaxy clusters. We also demonstrate that, when considering the radio morphology, the FRII HERG sources preferentially reside in disturbed morphologies, a difference of $\sim$3$\sigma$ to the FRII LERG objects. This suggests that the FRII LERG sources do not solely represent a `switched-off' phase in the HERG lifecycle of the same parent galaxy population as the FRII HERGs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circumgalactic gas around massive galaxies generally has a volume-filling component -- an atmosphere -- with a temperature determined by the potential-well depth of the galaxy's halo. If the atmosphere is near hydrostatic equilibrium and is stable to convection, then it can remain nearly homogeneous, as long as it is not too dense. But if its density is great enough, it becomes prone to producing a rain of cold clouds that fall toward the galaxy's center and accrete onto its central black hole. Here we explain how relatively weak magnetic fields enhance a galactic atmosphere's tendency to produce cold clouds and how the cold gas becomes organized into vertically elongated, highly magnetized filaments descending at sub-Keplerian speeds. It is intended to complement recent numerical simulations of the process and to serve as a guide to interpreting both simulations and observations of the filamentary gas in hot galactic atmospheres.</description>

      <title>AGN in massive galaxies identified via optical broadband variability: lessons from VST-COSMOS for future LSST science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of 56 massive (M$_{\rm{\star}}$ &gt; 10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) galaxies at $z&lt;1$ that host AGN, detected via their broadband optical variability in the VST-COSMOS survey. VST-COSMOS provides a nearly-identical single visit depth ($r$ $\sim$ 24.6 mag) and temporal baseline (eleven years) as the forthcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), albeit in a much smaller 1 deg$^2$ footprint (four orders of magnitude smaller than that of the LSST). We compare the properties (morphologies, the presence of interactions, rest-frame colours and environment) of our AGN to galaxies in a control sample, which are drawn from the non-variable population and matched in redshift and stellar mass to their AGN counterparts. The fraction of AGN with early-type morphology ($\sim$55 per cent) and the fraction that is interacting ($\sim$23 per cent) are similar to what is observed in the controls, suggesting that these AGN are not primarily triggered by interactions. Similarly, the AGN and controls do not show strong differences in their rest-frame $(u-z)$ colours or local environment, suggesting that neither the recent star formation histories nor the surroundings of the AGN are strongly atypical of the general galaxy population. This study provides a glimpse into forthcoming AGN science using the LSST. With vastly improved statistics, LSST will offer unprecedented insights into AGN demographics, host-galaxy evolution and the processes that fuel supermassive black holes, potentially reshaping our understanding of their place in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms Affecting Galaxies Nearby and Environmental Trends (MAGNET)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [ABRIDGED] Galaxy evolution is shaped by internal and external mechanisms that regulate the baryon cycle and star formation activity. We present a theoretical framework based on the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) semi-analytic model. We extracted portions of simulated volumes that include isolated galaxies, pairs, group, and filament members at z ~ 0, specifically avoiding massive clusters. Galaxies were classified using both intrinsic (halo-based) and observational (2D projected) parameterizations, reconstructing their environmental histories from z = 2 and identifying mergers, tidal interactions, ram pressure stripping (RPS), and starvation. 2D information decreases isolated and group fractions while doubles pairs. More than half of galaxies remain unaffected by the investigated processes since z = 2. Among affected galaxies, mergers dominate at high stellar masses (40-60% at log(M*/Msun) &gt; 10.5). Tidal interactions are less frequent, and their incidence increases with stellar mass. RPS dominates in groups and filaments at intermediate masses (~50%), while starvation ranges from 20 to 30%. The incidence of the different mechanisms depends strongly on both mass and environment, though their imprints on global properties are often subtle. Distinct evolutionary pathways emerge: log(M*/Msun) &lt; 9.5, galaxies in groups and filaments have a faster mass growth than galaxies in the other environments, especially those undergoing starvation, mergers and, to less extent, RPS. Differences are reduced moving to higher masses, where no clear dependence on physical mechanism emerge, even though at these masses a clear star formation suppression is evident in mergers and starved galaxies. This theoretical investigation provides essential context for the recently started multi-wavelength program Mechanisms Affecting Galaxies Nearby and Environmental Trends (MAGNET), which we introduce here.</description>

      <title>Bridging Scales in Black Hole Accretion and Feedback: Subgrid Prescription from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how supermassive black holes (BHs) couple to their host galaxies across a vast spatial and temporal dynamic range remains a central challenge in galaxy evolution. Using the multizone framework -- designed to capture bidirectional inflow--outflow from the event horizon to the Bondi scale -- we present a suite of long-duration GRMHD simulations spanning BH spins $|a_\ast|=0$--0.9 and Bondi radii $R_B/r_g=4\times10^2$--$2\times10^6$. From these simulations we derive spin-dependent subgrid prescriptions from first principles, applicable to hot accretion flows with low-Eddington ratios ($f_{\rm Edd}\lesssim10^{-3}$), for adoption in cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models. We provide compact analytic fits for the time-averaged accretion rate $\dot M(R_B,a_\ast)$ and feedback power $\dot E_{\rm fb}(R_B,a_\ast)$ with respect to the Bondi rate $\dot{M}_B$, which are largely insensitive to the initial gas configuration and magnetic field strength. To capture intrinsic time-variability, we also quantify the full distributions of $\dot M$ and feedback efficiency $\eta$, both well described by lognormal statistics, with widths that increase toward larger $R_B$. We further measure self-consistent spin evolution in the hot accretion mode, finding that the spin-up parameter varies as $s(a_\ast)\simeq -3.7\,a_\ast$, which implies a very long spindown timescale $t_s\simeq 12(10^{-3}/f_{\rm Edd})\,{\rm Gyr}$. Thus, BH spins are effectively frozen during phases of quiescent accretion. Compared to conventional small-domain GRMHD calculations, our simulations, which reach dynamical equilibrium across horizon-to-galaxy scales, yield systematically different long-term accretion, feedback, and spin properties, cautioning against direct extrapolation from small-scale GRMHD simulations when constructing galactic-scale subgrid models.</description>

      <title>Aligned and misaligned metallicity gradients in young stars and star-forming regions in the EAGLE discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disc galaxies exhibit radial metallicity gradients in both their stellar and gaseous components. The star-forming gas (SFG) in HII regions and young stars (YSs) trace the recent evolutionary history of the galaxy. We aim to assess the extent to which the joint analysis of metallicity gradient alignment in YSs and SFG can constrain the recent evolutionary history of galaxies. Using the high-resolution run of the EAGLE project, we derived radial, azimuthally averaged oxygen abundance profiles for YSs (age &lt; 2 Gyr) and SFG and measured their gradients as the slopes of linear fits to these profiles. We classified galaxies into four groups based on the signs (N for negative and P for positive) of the slopes: NN, NP, PP, and PN (the first letter is for YSs and the second for SFG). We found that galaxies with NN, NP, PP, and PN combinations of metallicity profiles reflect different evolutionary paths over the past ~ 2 Gyr. NN galaxies exhibit sustained inside-out growth accompanied by high star formation efficiency, whereas NP and PP systems show evidence of recent or ongoing feedback-driven disruption, with PP galaxies likely being predominantly shaped by supernova feedback. PN galaxies, by contrast, show evidence of past violent events followed by gradient recovery, highlighting the interplay between inflows, feedback, and gas cooling in shaping metallicity distributions. The degree of alignment between the stellar and gas metallicity gradients provides a way to time the occurrence of significant events in the evolutionary history of galaxies, which contribute through a combination of gas inflows, star formation triggering, and metal mixing. They could also serve as probes of sub-grid physics when observations provide suitable comparison datasets. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>WISDOM Project - XXVII. Giant molecular clouds of the lenticular galaxy NGC 1387: similarities with spiral galaxy clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular gas is crucial to understanding star formation and galaxy evolution, but the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) of early-type galaxies (ETGs) have rarely been studied. Here, we present analyses of the spatially resolved GMCs of the lenticular galaxy NGC 1387, exploiting high spatial resolution (0.15" or 14 pc) 12CO(2-1) line observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We identify 1285 individual GMCs and measure the fundamental properties (radius, velocity dispersion, and molecular gas mass) of each with a modified version of the CPROPStoo package. Unusually for an ETG, the GMCs of NGC 1387 follow scaling relations very similar to those of the Milky Way disc and Local Group galaxy clouds, and most are virialised. GMCs with large masses and radii and/or small galactocentric distances have their angular momenta aligned with the large-scale galactic rotation, while other GMCs do not. These results show that ETGs have more diversified GMC properties than previously thought. We discuss potential reasons for such diversity, and viewing-angle dependency is a plausible candidate.</description>

      <title>Exploring Chaotic Motion of a Particle in the Centre of a Galaxy with a Prolate Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of galaxies are known to have supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at their core, which have a tremendous gravitational pull on the objects around them. When embedded within extended matter distributions such as prolate, shell-like halos, they give rise to complex gravitational fields that often drive nearby particles into chaotic orbits. The inherently nonlinear nature of such motion, shaped by general relativity, makes direct analysis highly challenging. To overcome this, pseudo-Newtonian potentials are used to approximate relativistic effects within a Newtonian framework. In this study, we model the central SMBH using the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov (1996) potential to mimic the rotational effects of a Kerr-like black hole. The surrounding prolate halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution, represented through a multipole expansion including dipole and quadrupole components. Poincare sections and the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (MLE) reveal how the SMBH-halo system drives both order and chaos, with the SMBH spin modulating the dynamics by enhancing or suppressing chaos depending on its direction and magnitude.</description>

      <title>Coupled Map Lattice for Astronomical Object Formation: A Scenario for Evolution from Star to Disk, Arms, and Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new dynamic formation model of a star, a disk, arms, and companions using a coupled map lattice (CML), a complex systems approach. This CML simulates the viscoelastic and chaotic dynamics and evolution of gas clumps containing a little dust with a minimal set of one Eulerian procedure for the flow formation of gas clumps due to gravitational interaction, and one Lagrangian procedure for the collision and mixture of gas clumps due to viscoelastic advection. Despite its simplicity, this CML successfully obtains four typical astronomical objects consistent with protoplanetary disk observations: a central star, Keplerian disk, spiral arms, and even stellar, substellar, and planetary companions. All these formation processes are truly dynamic, with the central star "starring" in them, and they are not based on the conventional disk gravitational instability but on the central star gravitational instability with high-dimensional chaotic gas ejection, namely the chaotic itinerancy. Of particular note is the process in which diverse companions are formed due to the rapid density increase caused by the intersection of spiral arms. This suggests a novel companion formation scenario that should be called "arm-crossing companion formation" with a view to planet formation, which may overcome the radial drift barrier and angular momentum problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a comprehensive survey conducted among members of the Spanish Astronomical Society (Sociedad Espanola de Astronomia, SEA) to assess well-being, professional satisfaction, and family-work balance of researchers in astronomy. The survey addressed multiple aspects of professional life, including happiness, career stability, publication pressure, and access to childcare services during scientific meetings. Responses were examined across gender and career stages to identify trends and sources of dissatisfaction.</description>

      <title>Searching for Extragalactic Exoplanets: A Survey of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy Stream with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date no exoplanets have been detected outside the Milky Way, and their extragalactic occurrence rates are poorly constrained. Using available data from TESS we perform the first transit survey of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream using 15,176 main sequence stars identified as likely members. We calculate an upper limit of $&lt;$1.01% for hot Jupiters with radii of 1-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods of 0.6-10 days after detecting zero planets. We compare our calculated occurrence rate upper limits to the upper limits found in the Milky Way globular clusters M4 and 47 Tuc. Our 1-$\sigma$ occurrence rate upper limit of $&lt;$0.37% for the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream, for planets with radii of 1.5-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods $&lt;$10 days, is lower than the $&lt;$0.57% upper limit measured in 47 Tuc. Similarly, our 2 sigma upper limit of $&lt;$0.78% for planets with radii of 1.4-2 $_{Jup}$ and periods $&lt;$8 days is below the $&lt;$0.81% upper limit measured in M4. We predict that a future analysis of TESS data with a high detection efficiency for hot Jupiter transit depths would require $\eta_{extragalactic}$ $\geq$ 11,467 target stars to detect a planet of extragalactic origin. Therefore, we predict that a future investigation of TESS data which includes additional extragalactic stellar streams will be able to either detect the first extragalactic origin planet or provide evidence that older, lower metallicity extragalactic environments may experience a lower hot Jupiter occurrence rate than is observed for the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Measuring Pulsar Distances from Chirping Orbital Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed orbital period time derivative (or orbital "chirp") of a millisecond binary pulsar (MSP) encodes information about both the intrinsic properties of the binary system and its environment. Orbital chirp has contributions from intrinsic energy loss due to gravitational wave emission, kinematic effects due to motion in the plane of the sky, and dynamical effects due to galactic acceleration, with the latter two contributions depending on the MSP distance. We use orbital chirp data to infer distances to 21 MSPs; and for four of which we obtain smaller uncertainties than those reported in previous distance measurements. We incorporate multiple realistic galactic acceleration models to assess the sensitivity of the inferred distances to the choice of galactic gravitational potential, finding a significant dependence for four MSPs.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the Tip of the Red Giant Branch and measuring Magellanic Cloud distances to 2% exclusively with Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have calibrated the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) using our recent catalog of homogeneous, high-accuracy Globular Cluster (GC) distances. The GC distances were determined by a global joint fit to optical period-Wesenheit relations of their member RR Lyrae stars and type-II Cepheids, anchored by trigonometric parallaxes; all data taken from the ESA Gaia mission's (early) third data release (GDR3). Using I-band measurements in 48 GCs from P. Stetson's database, we determined $M_{I,0} = -3.948^{+0.037}_{-0.034}$ mag (1.6% in distance). Calibrating the TRGB using Gaia's homogeneous, space-based RP photometry of 53 GCs, we found $M_{RP,0} = -3.807^{+0.041}_{-0.035}$ mag (1.8%). The stated uncertainties include statistical and systematic effects, including the correlated nature of the GC distances. The robustness of our calibrations is demonstrated via tests against small-number statistics and analysis choices. Specifically, we found no significant metallicity effect for our sample of old, low-metallicity GCs. We measured $\sim 2\%$ distances to the Large (LMC) and Small Magellanic Clouds (SMC), $18.447^{+0.036}_{-0.042}$ mag ($48.9 \pm 0.9$ kpc) and $18.898^{+0.049}_{-0.054}$ mag ($60.2 \pm 1.4$ kpc), respectively, using a single well calibrated photometric system: RP (spectro-)photometry from GDR3. Our new TRGB distances, whose absolute scale derives from Gaia parallaxes, are fully independent of the well-known detached eclipsing binary (DEB) distances and agree with them to within the uncertainties. Combining our new TRGB and existing DEB distances, we illustrate how additional constraints may be incorporated in the Local Distance Network and obtain $H_0 = 73.52 \pm 0.80$ km/s/Mpc. Expected improvements due to the upcoming fourth Gaia data release are discussed.</description>

      <title>A homogeneous view of asymptotic giant branch carbon stars as seen by Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon stars on the asymptotic giant branch are major contributors to galactic dust enrichment, with gas mass-loss rates up to 1e-4 Msun/yr. We present a homogeneous spectral energy distribution analysis of the Gaia DR3 Golden Sample of carbon stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. Our dataset includes 14,747 sources with multi-band photometry from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE, combined with recent distance and extinction estimates. For a subsample of 2,494 Mira variables, we model multi-band light curves to derive accurate mean magnitudes.
  Stellar and circumstellar parameters are obtained by fitting observations with a large grid of synthetic spectra computed with the DUSTY radiative transfer code using COMARCS atmospheres. We derive effective temperature, optical depth, and gas mass-loss rate for each source. The distributions peak around Teff = 3150 K, with mass-loss rates spanning 1e-11 to 1e-4 Msun/yr and inner dust temperatures near 1000 K. We find a correlation between variability amplitude and mass-loss rate.
  This framework provides a statistically robust view of carbon stars across environments with different metallicities. Apparent environmental dependencies are influenced by luminosity distributions and selection effects rather than purely intrinsic metallicity differences. The combined Gaia and WISE selection limits the detection of both highly obscured and faint Magellanic Cloud sources, but the observed trends remain significant within the sampled populations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian parameter study of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 7469</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimessenger observation of the Seyfert-starburst composite galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 7469 indicate a characteristic feature in the radio band (the so-called mm-bump) as well as indication of high-energy neutrinos by the AGN corona. Moreover, also the starburst ring of these sources is bright in the radio and hence, a potential source of $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos.
  We aim to explain the non-thermal features of these two sources with our homogeneous steady-state Seyfert-starburst composite model, which we refined in this work. Hereby, we account for stochastic diffuse acceleration and energy losses within the corona and $\gamma\gamma$-pair attenuation of the escaping $\gamma$-rays. Since the non-thermal features of Seyfert sources contribute only marginally to the electromagnetic spectrum, only few data points can be assigned to the starburst ring or the AGN corona. Hence, prior information on the physical parameters is incorporated within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to avoid overfitting.
  Based on this Bayesian parameter study we show, that the non-thermal features of NGC 1068 can be explained well. Still a more detailed treatment of the spatial inhomogeneities in the central region of the AGN could further improve the fit results. This manifests itself even more clearly in the case of NGC 7469, where the mm-bump needs to emerge from a coronal size $R_{\rm c}&gt;100\,\mathcal{R}_{\rm s}$, whereas (TeV-PeV)-neutrino emission requires $R_{\rm c}&lt; 10\,\mathcal{R}_{\rm s}$. Similar to what has previously been shown in other wavebands, our analysis highlights that the spatial extension of the so-called AGN corona depends the considered energy of the messenger. Hence, it seems that there is not a unique edge of the corona and a substantial progress in the understanding of these phenomena is expected if future analysis account for these spatial inhomogeneities.</description>

      <title>The Montreal Open Clusters and Associations (MOCA) Database: A Census of Nearby Associations, Open Clusters, and Young Substellar Objects within 500 pc of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Montreal Open Clusters and Associations database (MOCAdb), a public MySQL database with a Python interface. MOCAdb provides a census of memberships for 10259 associations and open clusters within 500 pc of the Sun, with a comprehensive compilation of literature measurements such as spectral types, kinematics, rotation periods, activity indices, spectral indices, and photometry. All known substellar objects are cataloged in MOCAdb, along with 2943 public spectra, to enable the characterization of substellar association members. MOCAdb also features periodically updated calculations such as Galactic UVW space velocities. We use this compilation to construct mappings between independent association definitions, and to update the BANYAN $\Sigma$ membership classification tool, which now includes 8125 associations. The BANYAN $\Sigma$ model construction is improved to account for heterogeneous and correlated errors and to capture complex association shapes using Gaussian mixture models. Combined with Gaia DR3, this enabled us to identify 11535 yet unrecognized candidate members of young associations within 500 pc, mostly M dwarfs. Our results corroborate a recent observation that systematics up to $\approx$4 km/s remain in Gaia DR3 radial velocities for A-type stars. We present an updated census of age-calibrated exoplanets and substellar objects: 134 age-calibrated exoplanet systems (plus 121 TESS exoplanet candidates), 99 of which did not appear to have known memberships so far, and 455 substellar (L0 or later) candidate members of young associations, 196 of which appear newly recognized. We bring the total of candidate isolated planetary-mass objects to 101, 53 of which are newly recognized candidate members.</description>

      <title>Between Plateaus and Slopes: A Data-Driven Exploration of Spectral Diversity Across Type IIP/L Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type II supernovae (SNe II) have been traditionally separated into several subgroups based on their photometric and spectroscopic properties, but whether these represent distinct progenitors or a continuous distribution remains debated. Over the past decade, growing observational evidence has suggested a possible continuity between slow- (IIP) and fast-declining (IIL) SNe. We investigate the continuity of the SNe IIP/L subclasses through a data-driven statistical analysis of spectral time series, aiming to determine whether significant correlations exist between overall spectral shapes and light-curve decline rates. We introduce a novel standardization method for SN II spectra. After empirically flattening the spectra via continuum normalization, we interpolate the resulting "feature spectra" onto a fixed grid of epochs using Gaussian Process regression. The interpolated spectra are then analyzed using Principal Component Analysis to explore correlations. We find that SNe IIP and IIL form a continuum spectroscopically, though some clustering remains. The spectral diversity is characterized mainly by two components: one continuous group with well-defined P-Cygni profiles and another with "less-regular" features likely driven by enhanced circumstellar material (CSM) interaction. Our results reveal that the spectral diversity of SNe IIP/L diminishes over time. We confirm observational correlations: steeper light-curve declines correspond to weaker spectral features, indicating that SNe IIL tend to show weaker emission and, in some cases, a lack of distinct absorption lines. These trends seemingly break down by enhanced CSM interaction that affects the P-Cygni profiles. Our data-driven method reveals underlying spectral correlations and supports a continuous distribution between IIP and IIL subtypes. This method paves the way for more refined classification algorithms.</description>

      <title>Nearest Neighbour-Based Statistics for 21cm-Galaxy Cross-Correlations in the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 21cm radiation from neutral hydrogen serves as a direct probe of the Epoch of Reionization. However, both its detection and physical interpretation are severely hindered by contamination from astrophysical foreground emission and instrumental noise that are several orders of magnitude brighter than the signal of interest. A promising way to tackle these challenges is to cross-correlate the 21cm signal with other independent tracers of large-scale structure, most notably high-redshift galaxies. Besides validating putative 21cm detections, such joint analyses are expected to provide independent insights into the properties of ionizing sources and the evolving morphology of ionized regions during reionization. The 21cm signal, however, is intrinsically highly non-Gaussian, limiting the effectiveness of conventional two-point cross-correlation statistics, which capture information only up to the second order. In this work, we therefore investigate the utility of k-nearest-neighbour cumulative distribution functions (kNN CDF), which encode information from the joint clustering at all orders, as an alternative framework for probing 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations. Using self-consistently simulated mock 21cm fields and a catalog of line-emitting galaxies at z = 7, we conducted a proof-of-concept study comparing the kNN CDF formalism and the two-point cross-correlation approach. We find that the kNN CDF statistics outperform the two-point statistics in detecting 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations, even in the presence of instrumental noise and aggressive foreground filtering. Moreover, at a fixed global ionized fraction, it is even able to differentiate between reionization models that remain indistinguishable using two-point statistics. These results demonstrate the power and unexplored potential of exploiting higher-order statistics for extracting maximal information from 21cm-galaxy synergies.</description>

Abstract: The co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) underpins our understanding of galaxy evolution, but different methods to measure SMBH masses have only infrequently been cross-checked. We attempt to identify targets to cross-check two of the most accurate methods, megamaser and cold molecular gas dynamics. Three promising galaxies are selected from all those with existing megamaser SMBH mass measurements. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) 12CO(2-1) and 230-GHz continuum observations with angular resolutions of about 0.5". Every galaxy has an extended rotating molecular gas disc and 230-GHz continuum source(s), but all also have irregularities and/or non-axisymmetric features: NGC1194 is highly inclined and has disturbed and lopsided central 12CO(2-1) emission; NGC3393 has a nuclear disc with fairly regular but patchy 12CO(2-1) emission with little gas near the kinematic major axis, faint emission in the very centre and two brighter structures reminiscent of a nuclear ring and/or spiral; NGC5765B has a strong bar and very bright 12CO(2-1) emission concentrated along two bisymmetric offset dust lanes and two bisymmetric nuclear spiral arms. 12CO(2-1) and 12CO(3-2) observations with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope are compared with the ALMA observations. Because of the disturbed gas kinematics and the impractically long integration times required for higher angular resolution observations, none of the three galaxies is suitable for a future SMBH mass measurement. Nonetheless, increasing the number of molecular gas observations of megamaser galaxies is valuable, and the ubiquitous disturbances suggest a link between large-scale gas properties and the existence of megamasers.</description>

      <title>The HST-Hyperion Survey: Companion Fraction and Overdensity in a z ~ 2.5 Proto-supercluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of the galaxy merger and interaction activity within the Hyperion Proto-supercluster at z~2.5 in an effort to assess the occurrence of galaxy mergers and interactions in contrast to the coeval field and their impact on the build up of stellar mass in high density environments at higher-z. For this work, we utilize data from the Charting Cluster Construction with VUDS and ORELSE Survey (C3VO) along with extensive spectroscopic and photometric datasets available for the COSMOS field, including the HST-Hyperion Survey. To evaluate potential merger and interaction activity, we measure the fraction of galaxies with close kinematic companions ($f_{ckc}$) both within Hyperion and the coeval field by means of a Monte Carlo (MC) methodology developed in this work that probabilistically employs our entire combined spectroscopic and photometric dataset. We validate our $f_{ckc}$ MC methodology on a simulated lightcone built from the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly semi-analytic model, and we determine correction factors that account for the underlying spectroscopic sampling rate of our dataset. We find that galaxies in Hyperion have close kinematic companions $\gtrsim 2.5\times$ more than galaxies in the field and measure a corrected $f_{ckc}=59_{-10}^{+9}$% for Hyperion and a corrected $f_{ckc}=23_{-1.8}^{+1.7}$% for the surrounding field; a $&gt;3\sigma$ difference. This increase in $f_{ckc}$ indicates an enhancement in the merger and interaction activity within Hyperion and matches the trend seen in other structures. The rate of merger and interactions within the field implied from our field $f_{ckc}$ measurement is well aligned with values measured from other observations in similar redshift ranges. The enhanced $f_{ckc}$ measured within Hyperion suggests that merger and interaction activity play an important role in the mass growth of galaxies in denser environments at higher z.</description>

      <title>The Diversity and Evolution of Dust Attenuation Curves from Redshift z ~ 1 to 9</title>

Abstract: The UV-optical dust attenuation curve is key to interpreting the intrinsic properties of galaxies and provides insights into the nature of dust grains and their geometry relative to stars. In this work, we constrain the UV-optical slope of the stellar attenuation curve using a spectroscopic-redshift sample of ~3800 galaxies at z~1-9, to characterize the diversity and redshift evolution of stellar attenuation curves and to gain insight into dust production and evolution at high redshifts. The sample is constructed from three JWST/NIRCam grism surveys in GOODS and A2744 fields, with a wealth of JWST/NIRCam and HST photometry. With constraints from spectroscopic redshifts and emission line fluxes, we use the Prospector SED fitting code with a flexible dust model. We find that the attenuation curve slope varies strongly with Av at all redshifts, becoming flatter at higher attenuation. We find no strong correlation between attenuation curve slope and size or axis ratio, and the trends with stellar mass and star-formation rate are largely driven by their correlation with Av. We find strong evidence that at fixed Av, the curve becomes flatter with increasing redshift. On average, the attenuation curves derived here are shallower than those at z~0 and than the SMC curve. The highest redshift galaxies at z=7-9 (124 galaxies, a significantly larger sample than in previous studies) show slopes even flatter than the Calzetti curve, implying reduced UV obscuration and lower IR luminosities than expected from an SMC dust curve, by as large as an order of magnitude. Hydrodynamical simulations that couple dust growth to gas chemical enrichment successfully reproduce the different loci of high- and low-redshift galaxies in the slope-Av diagram, suggesting that dust in high-redshift galaxies is increasingly dominated by large grains produced in supernova ejecta with limited ISM processing at early times.</description>

      <title>A hybrid active galactic nucleus feedback model with spinning black holes, winds and jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a hybrid active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback model that features three accretion disc states (the thick, thin, and slim discs at low, moderate, and super-Eddington accretion rates, respectively), and two feedback modes: thermal isotropic and kinetic jets. The model includes black hole (BH) spin evolution due to gas accretion, BH mergers, jet spindown, and Lense-Thirring torques. The BH spin determines the jet directions and affects the feedback efficiencies. The model is implemented in the SWIFT code and coupled with the COLIBRE galaxy formation model. We present the first results from hybrid AGN feedback simulations run as part of the COLIBRE suite, focusing on the impact of new parameters and calibration efforts. Using the new hybrid AGN feedback model, we find that AGN feedback affects not just massive galaxies, but all galaxies down to $M_*\approx10^8$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$. BH spins are predicted to be near-maximal for intermediate-mass BHs ($M_\mathrm{BH}\in[10^6,10^8]$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$), and lower for other BH masses. These trends are in good agreement with observations. The intergalactic medium is hotter and impacted on larger scales in the hybrid AGN feedback simulations compared to those using purely thermal feedback. In the hybrid AGN simulations, we predict that half of the cumulative injected AGN energy is in thermal and the other half in jet form, broadly independent of BH mass and redshift. Jet feedback is important at all redshifts and dominates over thermal feedback at $z&lt;0.5$ and $z&gt;1.5$, but only mildly.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI-MRS view of the metal-poor galaxy CGCG 007-025: the spatial location of PAHs and very highly ionized gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key diagnostics of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium and are widely used to trace star formation in the mid-infrared (mid-IR). The relative strengths of mid-IR PAH emission features (e.g., 6.2, 7.7, 11.3 um) are sensitive to both the size and ionization state of the molecules and can be strongly influenced by the local radiation field. However, at low metallicities ( Z &lt; 0.2 Zsun), detecting PAHs remains notoriously difficult, likely reflecting a combination of suppressed formation and enhanced destruction mechanisms. We present new JWST/MIRI MRS observations of the metal-poor (Z = 0.1 Zsun) dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. We confirm the tentative PAH detection previously reported from Spitzer data and, for the first time, identify a compact (approx. 50 pc) PAH-emitting region nearly co-spatial with the newly detected [NeV](I.P. = 97 eV) emission and the galaxy's most metal-poor, strongly star-forming region. The 11.3 and 12.7 um PAH features are detected, while no emission is found from the other typically brighter features, suggesting a PAH population dominated by large, neutral molecules resilient to hard ionizing fields. When compared with models, mid-IR line ratios involving [NeIII], [OIV], and [NeV] can only be reproduced by a combination of star formation and AGN ionization, with the latter contributing 4--8%. The [OIV] and [NeV] luminosities exceed what massive stars or shocks can produce, highlighting a puzzling scenario in line with recent JWST observations of similar galaxies. This work provides a crucial reference for studying the physical conditions of the dust and star formation in low-metallicity starburst regions, environments typical of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation dynamos in supersonic turbulence at ${\rm Pm} \gtrsim 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuation dynamos provide a robust mechanism for amplifying weak seed magnetic fields in turbulent astrophysical plasmas. However, their behaviour in the highly compressible regimes characteristic of the interstellar medium remains incompletely understood. Using high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of supersonic turbulence with rms Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} \approx 11$, we explore fluctuation dynamos across magnetic Prandtl numbers ${\rm Pm} = 1-10$. At ${\rm Pm}=1$, dynamo growth is slower and saturates at lower magnetic-to-kinetic energy ratios, with amplification in the kinematic phase dominated by compression rather than line stretching. In contrast, at ${\rm Pm}=10$, vortical stretching emerges as the dominant mechanism, yielding faster growth, higher saturation levels, and stronger suppression of density--magnetic field correlations by magnetic pressure. This transition is reflected in the correlation coefficient between density and magnetic field strength, which is strongly positive at ${\rm Pm}=1$ but decreases significantly at higher ${\rm Pm}$. Across all runs, the ratio of velocity-to-magnetic integral scales is $\sim 3.4$, in the saturated phase, independent of ${\rm Pm}$, while the ratio of viscous to resistive dissipation scales increases with the increase in ${\rm Pm}$. Synthetic Faraday rotation measures reveal coherence lengths of $\sim$one-fourth to one-third of the forcing scale across the range of ${\rm Pm}$ explored. Using these coherence scales, we discuss the potential contribution of fluctuation dynamos to Faraday rotation expected from turbulent, gas-rich young disk galaxies.</description>

      <title>Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA). VI. The Formation of Low-mass Multiple Systems in High-mass Cluster-forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most stars form in multiple systems, with profound implications in numerous astronomical phenomena intrinsically linked to multiplicity. However, our knowledge about the process on how multiple stellar systems form is incomplete and biased toward nearby molecular clouds forming only low-mass stars, which are unrepresentative of the stellar population in the Galaxy. Most stars form within dense cores in clusters alongside high-mass stars (&gt;8 M$_{\odot}$), as likely the Sun did. Here we report deep ALMA 1.33 mm dust continuum observations at ~160 au spatial resolution, revealing 72 low-mass multiple systems embedded in 23 high-mass cluster-forming regions, as part of the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) survey. We find that the companion separation distribution presents a distinct peak at ~1200 au, in contrast to the one at ~4000 au observed in nearby low-mass regions. The shorter fragmentation scale can be explained by considering the higher pressure exerted by the surrounding medium, which is higher than the one in low-mass regions, due to the larger turbulence and densities involved. Because the peak of the companion separation distribution occurs at much larger scales than the expected disk sizes, we argue that the observed fragmentation is produced by turbulent core fragmentation. Contrary as predicted, the multiplicity fraction remains constant as the stellar density increases. We propose that in the extremely dense environments where high-mass stars form, dynamical interactions play an important role in disrupting weakly bound systems.</description>

      <title>WLM: Dynamics of an isolated Dwarf Irregular Galaxy Under Ram Pressure in the Local Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: WLM is an archetypal dwarf irregular galaxy that has not experienced interactions with major Local Group galaxies within the past 8 Gyr. It has recently been shown that WLM is losing its gas due to ram pressure forces exerted by the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we explore how ram pressure may also affect the WLM gas kinematics, and we show that its dynamics is especially perturbed at its outskirts, explaining the asymmetric rotation between the approaching and receding sides. Moreover, we have been able to decompose WLM in two main components, a compact one with a solid-body rotation that resembles a bar-like structure, and a more extended one with a characteristic double-horn profile suggesting an edge-on disk. The former is relatively unaffected by ram pressure while the latter has its dynamics considerably affected by ram pressure. This study shows that mass estimates of a dwarf galaxy like WLM should account for a full modeling of its dynamical components, especially accounting for its asymmetric rotation curve.</description>

      <title>First statistical constraints on galactic scale outflows properties traced by their extended Mg II emission with MUSE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxies evolve within vast gaseous halos that fuel star formation and carry signatures of feedback-driven outflows. Deep integral field data have enabled the study of MgII halos, which trace galaxy-scale outflows in emission, but their faintness has limited studies to single-object analyses. Here, we present the first statistical study of MgII-emitting halos using deep MUSE observations of 47 star-forming galaxies at $0.7&lt;z&lt;2.0$. Building on our previous work, where we developed and applied an outflow modeling framework for a single MgII halo, we now extend this approach to a larger sample, enabling robust population-level insights on the properties of circumgalactic outflows traced by their extended MgII emission. We detect extended emission out to tens of kiloparsecs and model the outflows as an ensemble of radially accelerating shells. Galaxies with MgII outflows tend to have higher SFRs, sSFRs, and younger stellar populations, consistent with star-formation-driven winds. The observations are consistent with winds that accelerate linearly with radius, from launching velocities of ~60 km/s up to maximum velocities that correlate with stellar mass and reach ~490 km/s. Their inner regions are highly opaque, and we find a tentative trend between stellar mass and central optical depth. The opening angle of the outflow shows some dependency on the host-galaxy stellar mass, with less massive galaxies showing primarily wide opening angles, and more massive galaxies showing a broader range of values, with both wide and narrow opening angles. The distribution of the spatial extent of MgII halos exhibits a clear peak at half-light radius (HLR) of ~5 kpc, with an extended tail of larger HLR values, up to ~20 kpc. Compact halo sizes (HLR $&lt; 8$ kpc) correlate with stellar mass, but extended halos do not, which could suggest a difference in the powering mechanism between compact and extended halos.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Direct Method for Chemical Abundances in High-z Galaxies with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unprecedented rest-frame UV and optical coverage provided by JWST enables simultaneous constraints on the electron density (n$_{\rm e}$) and temperature (T$_{\rm e}$) of ionized gas in galaxies at z&gt;5. We present a self-consistent direct method based on multiple OIII]1661,66) and [OIII] ($\lambda$4363, and $\lambda$5007) transitions to characterize the physical conditions of the high-ionization zone. This new approach is insensitive to a wide range of n$_{\rm e}$ due to the high critical densities of the OIII] and [OIII] transitions. Applying this technique to six galaxies at z=5-9, we find electron densities up to n$_{\rm e}$$\sim 3\times 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of T$_{\rm e}$ $\sim 20,000$ K in systems at $z&gt;6$. Accounting for these self-consistent densities changes the derived T$_{\rm e}$ and modifies the inferred metallicities by up to 0.29 dex relative to previous estimates. We discuss the reported N/O overabundances in the high-$z$ galaxies from our sample, which arise entirely from the high N$^{3+}$/H$^{+}$ values inferred from NIV] lines. We point out that a T$_{\rm e}$-stratification, in which the N$^{3+}$ zone has a slightly higher T$_{\rm e}$ than T$_{\rm e}$([OIII]), could substantially reduce the inferred N/O. Quantitatively, if T$_{\rm e}$(N$^{3+}$) were 10\% higher than T$_{\rm e}$([OIII]), this could induce a systematic overestimation of N$^{3+}$/O$^{2+}$ of nearly 50\%. Classical N/O diagnostics such as N$^{+}$/O$^{+}$, due to their critical densities, can significantly impact the inferred N/O abundance in the presence of high-density gas, whereas N$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ place these galaxies closer to $z\sim0$ systems in the N/O-O/H plane. Future JWST programs with larger and more diverse samples will be essential to test the universality and robustness of these results.</description>

      <title>Dark-to-black super accretion as a mechanism for early supermassive black hole growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of supermassive black holes with masses $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$ challenges conventional formation scenarios based on baryonic accretion and mergers within the first few hundred million years. We propose an alternative channel in which ultralight scalar dark matter undergoes dark-to-black conversion via quasi-bound state depletion around black hole seeds. We estimate the accretion rate of the scalar field as a function of the boson mass parameter $\mu$ and the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$, and integrate this rate over cosmological timescales. Our results show that once a critical value of $\mu M_{\rm BH}$ is reached, scalar field accretion becomes highly efficient, enabling substantial black hole growth even from relatively small initial seed masses. For boson masses $\mu \sim 10^{-19}-10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV}$, black hole seeds of $10^2-10^5 M_\odot$ can reach $10^6-10^8 M_\odot$ within $\sim 10^8$ yr. This dark-to-black mechanism provides a natural pathway for the rapid formation of massive black holes in the early universe, offering a potential probe of the microphysical nature of dark matter.</description>
