      <title>Cluster and anti-cluster production in heavy-ion collisions and pA reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate light cluster and anti-cluster production in heavy-ion collisions from SIS to RHIC energies within the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics (PHQMD) microscopic transport approach which propagates (anti-)baryons using n-body QMD dynamics. In PHQMD the clusters are formed dynamically by potential interactions between baryons - and recognized by the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm - as well as by kinetic reactions in case of deuterons. We present the novel PHQMD results for different observables such as excitation functions of the multiplicity of deuterons, anti-deuterons and tritons, as well as their transverse momentum spectra. Moreover, we investigate the system size dependence of proton and deuteron production in p+A collisions and show the PHQMD results for p+A collisions (A = Be, Al, Cu, Au) at 14 AGeV/c, as well as for asymmetric Au+A collisions (A = Al, Cu, Pb) at a bombarding energy of about 10 AGeV.</description>

      <title>Dumbbell shapes in the super-asymmetric fission of heavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have calculated the fission fragments' mass distributions for several isotopes of heavy and super-heavy nuclei from uranium to flerovium within an improved scission point model. For all considered nuclei, in addition to the standard mass-asymmetric fission mode we have found the mass super-asymmetric mode with the mass of heavy fragments equal 190. For the actinide nuclei, the probability of super-asymmetric fission is by 6 orders of magnitude smaller than for standard asymmetric fission. For the superheavy nuclei this probability is only by 2 orders of magnitude smaller. In all cases, the super-asymmetric scission shapes are dumbbells with the heavy fragment close to a sphere. We have estimated the stability of the light fragment concerning the variation of the neck and found out that sequential ternary fission is not favored energetically. The calculations were carried out with nuclear shape described by generalized Cassinian ovals with 6 deformation parameters, $\alpha, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4$ and $\alpha_5$. The configuration at the moment of the neck rupture was defined by fixing $\alpha=0.98$. This value corresponds to a neck radius $r_{neck}\approx$ 1.5 fm.</description>

      <title>Inelastic electron scattering-induced nuclear excitation rates and dynamics in $^{229}$Th</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate the excitation rates and population dynamics of $^{229}$Th nuclei induced by inelastic electron scattering, focusing on how electron energy, flux, and ionic charge state influence the excitation process of the nuclei. Using the Dirac Hartree-Fock-Slater method, we calculate cross sections for both the isomeric state (8.36 eV) and the second-excited state (29.19 keV) of $^{229}$Th over a wide range of ionic charge states and electron energies. Our results demonstrate that these factors significantly impact the nuclear excitation efficiency. The effect of indirect excitation through the second-excited state on enhancing the accumulation of nuclei in the isomeric state cannot be ignored. By applying rate equations to model the temporal evolution of nuclear populations, we show that under optimal conditions, up to 10\% of $^{229}$Th$^{4+}$ ions can be accumulated in the isomeric state. These findings provide important insights for optimizing electron-nucleus interactions, contributing to the development of $^{229}$Th-based nuclear clocks and relevant precision measurement applications.</description>

      <title>Clusterization in nuclear states at the edge of stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open quantum system eigenstate in the vicinity of low-energy decay channel may mimic its features, in particular the characteristic clustering properties of the decay channel. This generic mechanism of clusterization, the so-called mimicry mechanism of clusterization, is discussed here on example of the ground state wave function of $^8$Be. At higher excitation energies, when the density of states and reaction channels is high, the quantal aspects in the clusterization process disappear and the statistical mechanism of clusterization which is rooted in the Central Limit Theorem, begin to dominate.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic factor calculations in the \textit{ab initio} no-core shell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence properties of spectroscopic factors in the \textit{ab initio} no-core shell model are hereby investigated. For this, we consider nuclear energies and spectroscopic factors in $A = 6$ and 7 isotopes, using the chiral forces NNLO$_{\rm opt}$ and N$^3$LO. While low-lying spectrum energy demonstrates remarkable convergence with the increase of model space within the no-core shell model, the spectroscopic factor exhibits no definitive convergence trend and seems independent of the employed nuclear interaction. The use of spectroscopic factors issued from the no-core shell model to calculate cross-sections of knockout reaction might then be questionable. The results are compared with that of the standard shell model and \textit{ab initio} Monte Carlo calculations.</description>

      <title>Modification of the Jet Energy-Energy Correlator in Cold Nuclear Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute medium corrections to the energy-energy correlator (EEC) for jets in electron-nucleus collisions at leading order in the QCD coupling and the interaction of the jet with the medium. We derive an analytical expression for the modification of the EEC as a function of the opening angle and show that the modification is strongest at large angles within the jet cone. We obtain explicit results for the dependence of the modification on the jet energy, the scattering power of cold nuclear matter, and the path length within the medium. We extend our calculations to gluon jets in proton-nucleus collisions and compare our results with recent preliminary data for proton-lead collisions at the LHC. We also discuss the role of comovers on the EEC in p+Pb collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real nature of nucleon-hyperon and hyperon-hyperon interaction is best understood by theoretical study of single lambda hypernuclei. Variational Monte-Carlo calculations have been done on some light lambda hypernuclei using realistic NN, NNN ; phenomenological {\Lambda}N and {\Lambda}NN interactions. The results obtained for different interactions show the role of {\Lambda}N and {\Lambda}NN interactions. These interactions have been found to be important for the stability of the hypernuclear systems.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories for collective excitations of atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective modes emerge as the relevant degrees of freedom that govern low-energy excitations of atomic nuclei. These modes - rotations, pairing rotations, and vibrations - are separated in energy from non-collective excitations, making it possible to describe them in the framework of effective field theory. Rotations and pairing rotations are the remnants of Nambu-Goldstone modes from the emergent breaking of rotational symmetry and phase symmetries in finite deformed and finite superfluid nuclei, respectively. The symmetry breaking severely constrains the structure of low-energy Lagrangians and thereby clarifies what is essential and simplifies the description. The approach via effective field theories exposes the essence of nuclear collective excitations and is defined with a breakdown scale in mind. This permits one to make systematic improvements and to estimate and quantify uncertainties. Effective field theories of collective excitations have been used to compute spectra, transition rates, and other matrix elements of interest. In particular, predictions of the nuclear matrix element for neutrinoless double beta decay then come with quantified uncertainties. This review summarizes these results and also compares the approach via effective field theories to well-known models and ab initio computations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the equation-of-state from low energy heavy-ion collisions within the PHQMD microscopic approach with momentum-dependent potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the equation-of-state (EoS) of nuclear matter on collective observables, the directed ($v_1$) and the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of nucleons and light clusters in heavy-ion collisions at GeV beam energies employing the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics (PHQMD) microscopic transport approach. Here the clusters are formed dynamically during the entire heavy-ion collision by potential interaction between nucleons, including additionally deuteron production by hadronic kinetic reactions. We employ three different EoS - realized via potential interactions: two static EoS, dubbed 'soft' and 'hard', which differ in the compressibility modulus, as well as a soft momentum dependent EoS, adjusted to pA elastic scattering data. We find that the momentum dependent potential has different consequences for rapidity and transverse momentum spectra than for flow coefficients. We obtain the best description of the HADES and FOPI data on the directed and elliptic flow coefficients of protons and light clusters applying a momentum dependent EoS. Moreover, we observe a scaling behavior of $v_2$ versus $p_T$ with atomic number $A$. Finally we demonstrate that flow observables can help to identify the cluster production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Parametrization of GPDs from t-channel string exchange in AdS spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a string-based parametrization for nucleon quark and gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) that is valid for all skewness. Our approach leverages conformal moments, representing them as the sum of spin-j nucleon A-form factor and skewness-dependent spin-j nucleon D-form factor, derived from t-channel string exchange in AdS spaces consistent with Lorentz invariance and unitarity. This model-independent framework, satisfying the polynomiality condition due to Lorentz invariance, uses Mellin moments from empirical data to estimate these form factors. With just five Regge slope parameters, our method accurately produces various nucleon quark GPD types and symmetric nucleon gluon GPDs through pertinent Mellin-Barnes integrals. Our isovector nucleon quark GPD is in agreement with existing lattice data, promising to improve the empirical extraction and global analysis of nucleon GPDs in exclusive processes, by avoiding the deconvolution problem at any skewness, for the first time.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magic and Computational Complexity in the Neutrino Sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum magic in systems of dense neutrinos undergoing coherent flavor transformations, relevant for supernova and neutron-star binary mergers. Mapping the three-flavor-neutrino system to qutrits, the evolution of quantum magic is explored in the single scattering angle limit for a selection of initial tensor-product pure states for $N_\nu \le 8$ neutrinos. For $|\nu_e\rangle^{\otimes N_\nu}$ initial states, the magic, as measured by the $\alpha=2$ stabilizer Renyi entropy $M_2$, is found to decrease with radial distance from the neutrino sphere, reaching a value that lies below the maximum for tensor-product qutrit states. Further, the asymptotic magic per neutrino, $M_2/N_\nu$, decreases with increasing $N_\nu$. In contrast, the magic evolving from states containing all three flavors reaches values only possible with entanglement, with the asymptotic $M_2/N_\nu$ increasing with $N_\nu$. These results highlight the connection between the complexity in simulating quantum physical systems and the parameters of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Seebeck effect of the QGP medium using a novel relaxation time approximation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The highly energetic particle medium formed in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision displays a notable difference in temperatures between its central and peripheral regions. This temperature gradient can generate an electric field within the medium, a phenomenon referred to as the Seebeck effect. We have estimated the Seebeck coefficient for a dense quark-gluon plasma medium by using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the recently developed novel relaxation time approximation (RTA) model within the kinetic theory framework. This study explores the Seebeck coefficient of individual quark flavors as well as the entire partonic medium, with the emphasis on its dependence on the temperature and the chemical potential. Our observation indicates that, for given current quark masses, the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient for each quark flavor as well as for the partonic medium decreases as the temperature rises and increases as the chemical potential increases. Furthermore, we have investigated the Seebeck effect by considering the partonic interactions described in perturbative thermal QCD within the quasiparticle model. In addition, we have presented a comparison between our findings and the results of the standard RTA model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, in ideal-spin hydrodynamics, the components of the spin tensor follow damped wave equations. The damping rate is related to nonlocal collisions of the particles in the fluid, which enter at first order in $\hbar$ in a semi-classical expansion. This rate provides an estimate for the timescale of spin equilibration and is computed by considering a system of spin-1/2 fermions interacting via a quartic self-interaction as well as via (screened) one-gluon exchange. It is found that the relaxation times of the components of the spin tensor can become very large compared to the usual dissipative timescales of the system. Our results suggest that the spin degrees of freedom in a heavy-ion collision may not be in equilibrium by the time of freeze-out, and thus should be treated dynamically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between initial spatial anisotropy and final state momentum anisotropy in heavy ion collisions through the analysis of elliptic flow ($\nu_2$) as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$). Building upon previous studies on thermalization in heavy ion collisions using transverse momentum distributions, we extend the analysis to the $p_T$ dependence of $\nu_2$ in Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions. By employing a two-component model to extract the thermal and hard scattering contributions to the elliptic flow, we aim to gain further insights into the role of quantum entanglement in the rapid thermalization and collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).</description>

      <title>Rotating Neutron Stars with the Relativistic Ab Initio Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) of extremely dense matter is crucial for understanding the properties of rotating neutron stars. Starting from the widely used realistic Bonn potentials rooted in a relativistic framework, we derive EOSs by performing the state-of-the-art relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) calculations in the full Dirac space. The self-consistent and simultaneous consideration of both positive- and negative-energy states (NESs) of the Dirac equation allows us to avoid the uncertainties present in calculations where NESs are treated using approximations. To manifest the impact of rotational dynamics, several structural properties of neutron stars across a wide range of rotation frequencies and up to the Keplerian limit are obtained, including the gravitational and baryonic masses, the polar and equatorial radii, and the moments of inertia. Our theoretical predictions align well with the latest astrophysical constraints from the observations on massive neutron stars and joint mass-radius measurements. The maximum mass for rotating configurations can reach up to $2.93M_{\odot}$ for Bonn A potential, while the radius of a $1.4M_\odot$ neutron star for non-rotating case can be extended to around 17 km through the constant baryonic mass sequences. Relations with good universalities between the Keplerian frequency and static mass as well as radius are obtained, from which the radius of the black widow PSR J0952-0607 is predicted to be less than 19.58 km. Furthermore, to understand how rotation deforms the equilibrium shape of a neutron star, the eccentricity is also calculated. The approximate universality between the eccentricity at the Keplerian frequency and the gravitational mass is found.</description>

      <title>Imaging Shapes of Atomic Nuclei in High-Energy Nuclear Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic nuclei are self-organized, many-body quantum systems bound by strong nuclear forces within femtometer-scale space. These complex systems manifest a variety of shapes, traditionally explored using non-invasive spectroscopic techniques at low energies. However, at these energies, their instantaneous shapes are obscured by long-timescale quantum fluctuations, making direct observation challenging. Here we introduce the ``collective flow assisted nuclear shape imaging'' method, which images the nuclear global shape by colliding them at ultrarelativistic speeds and analyzing the collective response of outgoing debris. This technique captures a collision-specific snapshot of the spatial matter distribution within the nuclei, which, through the hydrodynamic expansion, imprints patterns on the particle momentum distribution observed in detectors. We benchmark this method in collisions of ground state Uranium-238 nuclei, known for their elongated, axial-symmetric shape. Our findings show a large deformation with a slight deviation from axial symmetry in the nuclear ground state, aligning broadly with previous low-energy experiments. This approach offers a new method for imaging nuclear shapes, enhances our understanding of the initial conditions in high-energy collisions and addresses the important issue of nuclear structure evolution across energy scales.</description>

      <title>Neutrino emission in cold neutron stars: Bremsstrahlung and modified urca rates reexamined</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino emission in cold neutron stars is dominated by the modified urca (murca) process and nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. The standard emission rates were provided by Friman and Maxwell in 1979, effectively based on a chiral Lagrangian framework with pion and rho meson exchange, supplemented by Landau parameters to describe short-range interactions. We reevaluate these rates within the same framework, correcting several errors and removing unnecessary simplifications, notably the triangular approximation - where the Fermi momenta of protons and leptons negligible compared to that of neutrons - in MURCA, and quantify their importance. The impact of rho meson exchange, previously argued to cancel with interference effects, is actually quite relevant. Altogether, the cooling rates are reduced by as much as a factor 2. We provide comprehensive analytical formulas encompassing all contributions, designed for straightforward numerical implementation. Our results are particularly relevant for studies of physics beyond the standard model, where the emission of new particles - such as axions - is typically computed within the same framework we adopt here.</description>

      <title>Recent theoretical developments in quarkonia production in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quarkonia are golden probes of heavy ion collisions that have attracted much attention from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. This paper will review recent theoretical studies on quarkonium thermal properties, with a particular focus on the heavy quark finite-temperature potential obtained by Lattice QCD and other approaches. Moreover, it will examine the advancements in the real-time evolution of quarkonia in heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang-zero ratios for locating a critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to numerically determine the location of a critical point in general systems using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros. This method makes use of the fact that the ratios of Lee-Yang zeros on various spatial volumes intersect at the critical point. While the method is similar to the Binder-cumulant analysis, it is advantageous in suppressing the finite-volume effects arising from the mixing of variables in general systems. We show that the method works successfully for numerically locating the CP in the three-dimensional three-state Potts model with a nonzero external field.</description>
