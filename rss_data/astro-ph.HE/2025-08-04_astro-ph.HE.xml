      <title>2D End-to-End Modeling of Kilonovae from Binary Neutron-Star Merger Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the kilonova emission resulting from outflows produced in a three-dimensional (3D) general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnant. We map the outflows into the FLASH hydrodynamics code to model their expansion in axisymmetry, and study the effects of employing different $r$-process heating rates. Except for the highest heating rate prescription, we find no significant differences with respect to overall ejecta dynamics and morphology compared to the simulation without heating. Once homologous expansion is attained, typically after $\sim$ 2s for these ejecta, we map the outflows to the Sedona radiative transfer code and compute the spectral evolution of the kilonova and broadband light curves in various LSST bands. The kilonova properties depend on the remnant lifetime, with peak luminosities and peak timescales increasing for longer-lived remnants that produce more massive ejecta. For all models, there is a strong dependence of both the bolometric and broadband light curves on the viewing angle. While the short-lived (12ms) remnant produces higher luminosities when viewed from angles closer to the pole, longer-lived remnants (240ms and 2.5s) are more luminous when viewed from angles closer to the equator. Our results highlight the importance of self-consistent, long-term modeling of merger ejecta, and taking viewing-angle dependence into account when interpreting observed kilonova light curves. We find that magnetized outflows from a HMNS -- if it survives long enough -- could explain blue kilonovae, such as the blue emission seen in AT2017gfo.</description>

      <title>Exploring IceCube Neutrino Alerts with the HAWC Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While much work has gone into associating neutrino emission with various sources, very few sources have emerged. With the recent publication of IceCube Event Catalog (IceCat-1), the IceCube neutrino observatory has released a list of the most promising astrophysical neutrino events since operations began in 2010. Using the archival data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma-ray observatory, we perform a coincidence search for gamma rays and neutrinos using a Bayesian Block algorithm with the public IceCube alerts from IceCat-1 and the Astrophysical Multi-messenger Observatory Network (AMON). Of the 350 alerts considered, 25 detections were found, with 1 coinciding with the flaring HAWC source Markarian 421, an active galactic nuclei. We present the performance of this method and a discussion of physics implications.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Physical Origin of GRB 240825A: A Long GRB Lacking a Bright Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of GRB 240825A, a bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected by Fermi and Swift, with a prompt duration ($T_{\rm 90}$ ~ 4 sec in 50-300 keV) near the boundary separating short and long GRBs, prompting a detailed investigation into its classification and progenitor. Using classical prompt metrics (duration, minimum variability timescale (MVT), lag, and spectral hardness) and modern classification techniques (machine-learning (ML) based t-SNE, support vector machine, energy-hardness-duration, and $\epsilon \equiv E_{\gamma,\mathrm{iso},52} / E_{p,z,2}^{5/3}$), we find GRB 240825A exhibits hybrid characteristics. The short MVT (13.830 $\pm$ 1.574 ms), rest-frame duration, and ML-based classification indicate a merger-like or ambiguous nature, while its energetics and position on the Amati relation favor a collapsar origin. We conducted deep optical and NIR photometric and spectroscopic late-time search for an associated supernova (SN)/kilonova (KN) and the host galaxy using 10.4 m GTC and 8.4 m binocular LBT telescopes. No bright SN (like SN 1998bw) is detected down to stringent limits (e.g., $m_r &gt; 26.1$ mag at 17.59 days), despite a redshift of $z$ = 0.659 measured from GTC spectroscopy. Host galaxy SED modeling with Prospector indicates a massive, dusty, and star-forming galaxy-typical of collapsar GRB hosts, though with low sSFR and large offset. We compare these findings with hybrid events like GRB 211211A, GRB 230307A, GRB 200826A, including SNe-GRBs, and conclude that GRB 240825A likely originated from a massive star collapse, with the associated supernova obscured by a dusty host environment or low luminosity SN with absolute magnitude M$_{V}$ fainter than -18.0. This study emphasizes the need for multiwavelength follow-up and a multi-layered classification to determine GRB progenitors.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulations of Polarized Radiative Transfer in Neutron Star Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft X-ray emission from neutron stars affords powerful diagnostic tools for uncovering their surface and interior properties, as well as their geometric configurations. In the atmospheres of neutron stars, the presence of magnetic fields alters the photon-electron scattering cross sections, resulting in non-trivial angular dependence of intensity and polarization of the emergent signals. This paper presents recent developments of our Monte Carlo simulation, MAGTHOMSCATT, which tracks the complex electric field vector for each photon during its transport. Our analysis encompasses the anisotropy and polarization characteristics of X-ray emission for field strengths ranging from non-magnetic to extremely magnetized regimes that are germane to magnetars. In the very low field domain, we reproduced the numerical solution to the radiative transfer equation for non-magnetic Thomson scattering, and provided analytical fits for the angular dependence of the intensity and the polarization degree. These fits can be useful for studies of millisecond pulsars and magnetic white dwarfs. By implementing a refined injection protocol, we show that, in the magnetar regime, the simulated intensity and polarization pulse profiles of emission from extended surface regions becomes invariant with respect to the ratio of photon ($\omega$) and electron cyclotron ($\omega_{\rm B}$) frequencies once $\omega / \omega_{\rm B} \lesssim 0.01$. This circumvents the need for simulations pertinent to really high magnetic field strengths, which are inherently slower. Our approach will be employed elsewhere to model observational data to constrain neutron star geometric parameters and properties of emitting hot spots on their surfaces.</description>

      <title>A 50 s quasi-periodic oscillation in the early X-ray afterglow of GRB 220711B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally believed that long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from the core collapse of rapidly spinning massive stars and at least some of them are powered by hyper-accreting black holes. However, definite proofs about the progenitor and central engine of these GRBs have not been directly observed in the past. Here we report the existence of a Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) signature with periodic frequency $\sim$0.02 Hz in the early X-ray afterglow phase of GRB 220711B. Such a low-frequency QPO likely signals the precession of a relativistic jet launched from a GRB hyper-accreting black hole central engine. The energy injection signature from the \textbf{late} X-ray observations (from $5\times 10^2s\sim 1\times10^4s$) is consistent with the precession hypothesis. The prompt $\gamma$-ray light curve does not show any QPO signature, suggesting that the X-ray flaring emission in the early afterglow phase and prompt emission likely originate from different accretion processess, indicating that the progenitor stars of GRBs have a core-envelope structure with a stratified angular momentum distribution and the late-time accretion disk likely has a misalignment with respect to the rotation axis of the black hole. Such a misalignment is not expected in a canonical collapsar model. As a result, the QPO signature in GRB 220711B may reveal a new formation channel of long GRBs, possibly a stellar-merger-induced core collapse, with the orbital angular momentum of the binary misaligned with the spin axis of the collapsing star.</description>

      <title>Signature of a magnetar central engine with precession motion in the X-ray emission of GRB 220711B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-ray light curve of long-duration GRB 220711B, is characterized by a multi-peaked structure with a duration lasting $\sim$105 seconds. More interestingly, the X-ray afterglow light curve is composed of a plateau emission smoothly connected with a $\sim t^{-2}$ segment overlapping some flares followed by an extremely steep decay. By analysing the light curves of both prompt emission and X-ray afterglow, no high-confidence-level quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals are found in the light curves of the prompt emission (e.g., BAT and GBM), but it is found that a QPO signal at $\sim$ 50 s above 6$\sigma$ confidence level indeed exist in the X-ray afterglow. Here, we propose that a supra-massive magnetar as the central engine of GRB 220711B with precession motion is a good interpretation of the features of the X-ray emission. The initial plateau emission and followed decay segment, as well as the extremely steep-decay segment, are consistent with the physical process of supra-massive magnetar spin-down and then collapse into black hole. Moreover, the QPO signal in the X-ray emission can be explained as an effect of the precession motion of the magnetar. If this is the case, one can derive various magnetar parameters such as the initial period ($P_{{\rm{0}}}$) and surface magnetic field strength ($B_{{\rm{p}}}$) within a pseudo-redshift range of [1.08, 4.27]. By considering beaming corrections with jet opening angle $5^{\circ}$, we find that $P_{{\rm{0}}}$ and $B_{{\rm{p}}}$ lie within the range of [1.87, 6.25] ms and [$1.47\times 10^{16}$, $3.09\times 10^{16}$] G, respectively. The parameter of $B_{{\rm{p}}}$ is slightly larger than that of other typical long-duration GRBs, but $P_{{\rm{0}}}$ fall in a reasonable range.</description>

      <title>A Joint Search for the Electromagnetic Counterpart to the Gravitational-Wave Binary Black-Hole Merger Candidate S250328ae with the Dark Energy Camera and the Prime Focus Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first detection of an optical counterpart to a gravitational wave signal revealed that collaborative efforts between instruments with different specializations provide a unique opportunity to acquire impactful multi-messenger data. We present results of such a joint search with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) for the optical counterpart of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA event S250328ae, a binary black hole merger candidate of high significance detected at a distance of 511$\pm$82 Mpc and localized within an area of 3 (15) square degrees at 50% (90%) confidence. We observed the 90% confidence area with DECam and identified 36 high-confidence transient candidates after image processing, candidate selection, and candidate vetting. We observed with PFS to obtain optical spectra of DECam candidates, Swift-XRT candidates, and potential host galaxies of S250328ae. In total, 3897 targets were observed by seven pointings covering ~50% of the 90% confidence area. After template fitting and visual inspection, we identified 12 SNe, 159 QSOs, 2975 galaxies, and 131 stars. With the joint observations of DECam and PFS, we found variability in 12 SNe, 139 QSOs, 37 galaxies, and 2 stars. We do not identify any confident optical counterparts, though the association is not ruled out for three variable candidates that are not observed by PFS and 6 QSO candidates without clear variability if the optical counterpart of S250328ae is faint. Despite the lack of confident optical counterparts, this paper serves as a framework for future collaborations between wide-field imagers and multi-object spectrographs to maximize multi-messenger analyses.</description>

      <title>Extreme anisotropies in deep layers of an exploding star: overabundance of Cr in the northeastern jet of Cassiopeia A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae drive nucleosynthesis under extreme thermodynamic conditions, and complex mechanisms are at work prompting the transport of heavy elements from deep stellar interiors into outer layers. We present spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of Cassiopeia A's (Cas A) northeastern (NE) jet using the archival 1 Ms Chandra/ACIS observations, and focusing on three fingers of the jet. We report the highest Cr/Fe mass ratio (Cr/Fe $\sim0.14$) ever observed in Cas A, localized in a compact region within the southernmost finger in the NE jet. Comparisons with nucleosynthesis models indicate that the NE jet originated approximately at the boundary separating the complete Si burning layer from the incomplete Si-burning layer. We also find that mixing from different layers is needed to explain the chemical composition of the three fingers in the NE jet. We also detect significant differences in the physical and chemical properties among the three fingers analyzed of the NE jet. In particular, we find that, unlike the other two, the southernmost finger originated from a slightly more peripheral region of the explosion. Moreover, while the northern and central fingers lie almost in the plane of the sky, the southernmost finger is moving in a different direction, showing a velocity along the line of sight of $\sim2100$ km s$^{-1}$ towards the observer, with a tilt angle of $\sim16$\textdegree. These findings highlight the NE jet's role in ejecting material from the deepest explosive burning layers, providing new insights into the asymmetries originating in the inner layers of core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>Effects of inhomogenuity and anisotropy of radiation field on production and absorption of high energy radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geometrical effects affecting the production and absorption of gamma-ray radiation emitted in inverse Compton scattering in the synchrotron-self-Compton process. We evaluate the effect of the anisotropy of the radiation field seen by the scattering electrons homogeneously distributed in the emission region. Next, we also consider inhomogeneous distribution of electrons and investigate the effect of it in the spherically symmetric emission region. We also study a cylindrical shape of the emission region and its effect on the isotropy of the emitted radiation. We obtain simple numerical factors that scale the emission for different assumptions about the geometry of the emission region and the distribution of the emitting electrons. For a 3D Gaussian spatial distribution of the electrons we obtain 0.222 times lower flux than for homogeneous emission region. Finally, we also evaluate the absorption of the radiation produced in the different scenarios, and compare the full calculations with the two most commonly assumed simplifications. We find that for cases when the absorption is lesser than by one order of magnitude, the full calculations for homogeneous sphere can be well approximated with homogeneously-emitting slab, while the absorption in the case of 3D Gaussian distribution of electrons is significantly weaker.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation from GRB 221009A Using the DisCan Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz symmetry is a cornerstone of modern physics, and testing its validity remains a critical endeavor. In this work, we analyze the photon time-of-flight and time-shift data from LHAASO observations of Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 221009A to search for signatures of Lorentz violation. We employed the DisCan (dispersion cancellation) method with various information entropies as cost functions, designating the results obtained with Shannon entropy as our representative outcome. This choice is attributed to the parameter-free statistical properties of Shannon entropy, which has demonstrated remarkable stability as we continually refine and enhance our methodology. In the absence of more detailed data and physical context, it provides more stable and reliable results. We constrain the energy scale associated with Lorentz invariance violation. Our results yield 95\% confidence level lower limits of $E_{\text{QG},1} &gt; 5.4 \times 10^{19} \, \text{GeV}$ (subluminal) and $E_{\text{QG},1} &gt; 2.7 \times 10^{19} \, \text{GeV}$ (superluminal) for the linear case ($n$=1), and $E_{\text{QG},2} &gt; 10.0 \times 10^{12} \, \text{GeV}$ (subluminal) and $E_{\text{QG},2} &gt; 2.4 \times 10^{12} \, \text{GeV}$ (superluminal) for the quadratic case ($n$=2). Subsequently, we incorporated WCDA photons and the Knuth binning method to further optimize and complement our approach, while also performing filter using information entropies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that employing different information entropy measures as cost functions does not alter the order of magnitude of these constraints.</description>

      <title>The X-ray$-$UV Luminosity Relation of eROSITA Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-linear relation between the UV and X-ray luminosity in quasars has been studied for decades. However, as we lack a comprehensive model able to explain it, its investigation still relies on observational efforts. This work focuses on optically selected quasars detected by eROSITA. We present the properties of the sources collected in the eROSITA early data release (eFEDS) and those resulting from the first six months of eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1). We focus on the subset of quasars bright enough in the optical/UV band to avoid an ''Eddington bias'' towards X-ray brighter-than-average spectral energy distributions. The final samples include 1,248 and 519 sources for eFEDS and eRASS1, up to redshift $z\approx3$ and $z\approx1.5$, respectively. We found that the X-ray$-$UV luminosity relation shows no significant evolution with redshift, and its slope is in perfect agreement with previous compilations of quasar samples. The intrinsic dispersion of the relation is about 0.2 dex, which is small enough for possible cosmological applications. However, the limited redshift range and statistics of the current samples do not allow us to obtain significant cosmological constraints yet. We show how this is going to change with the future releases of the eROSITA data.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity signatures in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's BNS and NSBH binaries</title>

Abstract: Measurement of eccentricity in low-mass binary systems through gravitational waves is crucial to distinguish between various formation channels. Detecting eccentricity in these systems is challenging due to a lack of accurate eccentric waveform models and the high computational cost of Bayesian inferences. We access the eccentricities of six previously observed low-mass gravitational wave events using publicly available data from the first four observing runs of the LIGO and Virgo collaboration. We analyze the events using the new eccentric waveform model, SEOBNRv5EHM, and compare our results with the existing model, TEOBResumS-Dali. We also present the first eccentricity constraints for GW190814. To improve accuracy, we include higher-order modes in both models and optimize inference using efficient marginalization and parallelization techniques. We find that GW200105 exhibits non-negligible eccentricity, with a measured eccentricity of $e=0.135^{+0.019}_{-0.088}$ at 20 Hz (90% credible level) for TEOBResumS-Dali and $e=0.125^{+0.029}_{-0.082}$ for SEOBNRv5EHM, given a uniform eccentricity prior from 0 to 0.2. This provides moderate support for the eccentric hypothesis, with a Bayes factor of $\sim10-15$ in favor of the eccentric model. With a uniform log prior on eccentricity, the Bayes factor is reduced to 2.35. The remaining five sources are consistent with low eccentricity, with 90% upper limits from $e \leq 0.011$ to $e \leq 0.066$. We find no support for non-negligible eccentricity in GW190814.</description>

      <title>Forming Double Neutron Stars using Detailed Binary Evolution Models with POSYDON: Comparison to the Galactic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With over two dozen detections in the Milky Way, double neutron stars (DNSs) provide a unique window into massive binary evolution. We use the POSYDON binary population synthesis code to model DNS populations and compare them to the observed Galactic sample. By tracing their origins to underlying single and binary star physics, we place constraints on the detailed evolutionary stages leading to DNS formation. Our study reveals a bifurcation within the well-known common envelope formation channel for DNSs, which naturally explains an observed split in the orbital periods of the Galactic systems. The two sub-channels are defined by whether the donor star has a helium core (Case B mass transfer) or a carbon-oxygen core (Case C) at the onset of the common envelope, with only the helium core systems eventually merging due to gravitational wave-modulated orbital decay. However, producing DNSs through both sub-channels requires either a generous core definition of $\simeq$ 30% H-fraction or a high common envelope ejection efficiency of $\alpha_{\rm CE}\gtrsim1.2$. By testing different supernova kick velocity models, we find that galactic DNSs are best reproduced using a prescription that favors low velocity kicks ($\lesssim 50 \, \rm km/s$), in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, our models indicate that merging DNSs are born from a stripped progenitor with a median pre-supernova envelope mass $\sim$ 0.2$M_{\odot}$. Our results highlight the value of detailed evolutionary models for improving our understanding of exotic binary star formation.</description>

      <title>Implication of neutron star observations to the origin of nucleon mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of neutron star observations for understanding the origin of nucleon mass using a framework that combines three complementary approaches: the equation of state based on parity doublet structure for hadronic matter below $2n_0$, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model for quark matter above $5n_0$, and a model-independent analysis of the intermediate density region based on fundamental physical principles. By systematically exploring parameter spaces and comparing theoretical predictions with recent observational constraints, we establish constraints on the chiral invariant mass. Our results suggest that more than a half of the nucleon mass originates from sources beyond spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, challenging conventional understanding of nucleon mass generation. These constraints arise solely from fundamental physical principles and observational data, independent of specific assumptions about the nature of the quark-hadron transition, providing robust insights into the microscopic origin of hadron masses.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Normal Modes and Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Black Hole Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of curvature parameters and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Probing scalar field with generic extreme mass-ratio inspirals around Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The future space-based gravitational wave observatories are expected to provide unprecedented opportunities to explore intricate characteristics of black hole binaries, particularly for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass compact object slowly inspirals into a supermassive black hole. These systems are very prominent sources for testing gravity in the strong gravity fields and for probing potential deviations from general relativity, including those arising from the presence of fundamental scalar fields. In this work, we examine the impact of a scalar charge carried by the inspiraling object within the context of EMRIs. We focus on generic orbits that present both eccentricity and inclination to evaluate how these parameters affect the modifications induced by the scalar charge to the gravitational wave signal. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of orbital inclination, in particular, enhances the detectability of scalar field effects by introducing richer waveform features that deviate from the purely general relativistic case. The interplay among scalar charge, eccentricity and inclination provides a more complete sampling of the black hole spacetime, suggesting that EMRIs with such generic orbits represent compelling systems for stringently constraining or discovering new fundamental fields through future gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>The SN 1987A Cooling Bound on Dark Matter Absorption in Electron Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new supernova (SN 1987A) cooling bounds on sub-MeV fermionic dark matter with effective couplings to electrons. These bounds probe the parameter space relevant for direct detection experiments in which dark matter can be absorbed by the target material, showing strong complementarity with indirect searches and constraints from dark matter overproduction. Crucially, our limits exclude the projected sensitivity regions of current and upcoming direct detection experiments. Since these conclusions are a priori not valid for light mediators, we extend our analysis to this case. We show that sub-GeV mediators can be produced resonantly both in supernova cores and in the early Universe, altering the SN 1987A analysis for effective couplings. Still, a combination of supernova cooling constraints and limits from dark matter overproduction excludes the entire parameter space relevant for direct detection in this case.</description>

      <title>CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) Sensitivity Estimation and Performance Optimization using Geant4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) aims to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the 25-100 keV X-ray band using a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow us to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star by providing high-sensitivity polarization measurements. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop innovative CubeSat technologies and missions. As part of CUSPs Phase B study, which began in December 2024 and will continue for one year, we present the development status of the Geant4 based simulator to accurately simulate the detectors response and initial results on the sensitivity of the instrument. Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the physical interactions of the source photons with the detector and the passive materials. We implemented a detailed CUSP Mass Model within Geant4 to simulate and estimate the instruments sensitivity, correcting the geometric effects of the instrument. We also evaluated the effect of backscattering shielding on the sensitivity to optimize the mass model of the instrument.</description>

      <title>The First Photometric Evidence of a Transient/Variable Source at z&gt;5 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered 79 transients out to $z$$\sim$4.8 through the JADES Transient Survey (JTS), but the JTS did not find any $z$$&gt;$5 transients. Here, we present the first photometric evidence of a $z$$&gt;$5 transient/variable source with JWST. The source, AT 2023adya, resides in a $z_{\mathrm{spec}}$$=$5.274 galaxy in GOODS-N, which dimmed from $m_{\rm F356W}$$=$26.05$\pm$0.02 mag to 26.24$\pm$0.02 mag in the rest-frame optical over approximately two rest-frame months, producing a clear residual signal in the difference image ($m_{\rm F356W}$$=$28.01$\pm$0.17 mag; SN$_\mathrm{var}$$=$6.09) at the galaxy center. Shorter-wavelength bands (F090W/F115W) show no rest-frame ultraviolet brightness change. Based on its rest-frame V-band absolute magnitude of M$_\mathrm{V}$$=$$-$18.48 mag, AT 2023adya could be any core-collapse supernova (SN) subtype or an SN Ia. However, due to low SN Ia rates at high redshift, the SN Ia scenario is unlikely. Alternatively, AT 2023adya may be a variable active galactic nucleus (AGN). However, the JWST NIRCam/Grism spectrum shows no broad H$\alpha$ emission line (FWHM$=$130$\pm$26 km s$^{-1}$), disfavoring the variable AGN scenario. It is also unlikely that AT 2023adya is a tidal disruption event (TDE) because the TDE models matching the observed brightness changes have low event rates. Although it is not possible to determine AT 2023adya's nature based on the two-epoch single-band photometry alone, this discovery indicates that JWST can push the frontier of transient/variable science past $z$$=$5 and towards the epoch of reionization.</description>

      <title>Ti\={a}ngu\={a}n ($\zeta$ Tau) as a binary system consisting of a Be-star and an accreting White Dwarf: opening a gate to understanding enigmatic $\gamma$ Cas analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analogues of $\gamma$ Cassiopea are binary early type Be stars which are X-ray bright with hard thermal spectra. The nature of companions in these stars and mechanisms of their X-ray emission remain enigmatic. Among the proposed ideas is the presence of an accretion disc around a white dwarf (WD) companion to the Be star donor. We use radiative transfer models including reflection physics in order to calculate the synthetic spectra of such systems, and assume that the hottest plasma is thermal and is located in the accretion disc boundary layer. The models are used to analyse the XMM-Newton observations of the $\gamma$ Cas analogue $\zeta$ Tau (a.k.a. Ti\={a}ngu\={a}n). Comparisons with X-ray-emitting symbiotic systems, particularly $\delta$- and $\beta/\delta$-type systems, support the idea that the hard X-ray emission in $\zeta$ Tau is best explained by a WD accreting material expelled from the Be star. The plasma temperature and luminosity of the boundary layer associated with the accretion disc are used to estimate a mass accretion rate of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} \approx 4\times 10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, implying a nova recurrence time above 10$^{5}$ yr. Our analysis advances the understanding the production of hard X-ray emission in $\gamma$ Cas analogues, further supporting the idea of accreting WDs as companions of Be-stars in these systems.</description>

      <title>A Torus Remnant Revealed by the Infrared Echo of Tidal Disruption Event AT 2019qiz: Implications for the Missing Energy and Quasiperiodic Eruption Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AT 2019qiz is the first standard optical tidal disruption event (TDE) with detection of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), providing strong evidence for TDE-QPE association. Moreover, it belongs to the rare subset of optical TDEs with prominent infrared (IR) echoes revealed by the multi-epoch photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The IR light curve shows an early bump, followed by a steady rise until the second-to-last epoch, after which it appears to enter a plateau phase. The dust temperature decreased until the fourth epoch and remains approximately constant for the subsequent five epochs. We have fitted the last five epochs using a convex dust ring model, resulting in an inner radius $&gt;1.2$pc. Such a large radius greatly exceeds the inner radius of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) torus for a $10^6\,M_{\odot}$ black hole and thus could be a torus remnant with the inner part having vanished, further supporting the unified scenario of recently faded AGNs, TDEs, and QPEs. Consequently, a connection between QPEs and IR-bright TDEs is naturally expected. Moreover, the echo requires at least a peak bolometric luminosity of $(6.6, 9.5, 1.0)\times 10^{44} \,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ assuming silicate, silicon carbide, and graphite dust grains, respectively, all of which are significantly higher than the peak optical blackbody luminosity. It adds to the accumulating evidence that the missing energy of TDEs may lie in the unobservable extreme UV. This work highlights the unique value of IR echoes in the study of TDEs and QPEs, and a promising prospect in the era of the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor, the successor to WISE.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization of reflected thermal emission</title>

Abstract: X-ray thermal emission is inherent in neutron-star and black-hole X-ray binary systems. Within these systems, it may reflect from optically thick matter, which will create characteristic observable X-ray spectro-polarimetric features. We compute rest-frame reflection spectra and the corresponding energy-dependent linear polarization degree and angle for (un)polarized single-temperature black-body spectra impinging on a partially ionized constant-density optically thick slab. We use a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation that takes into account scattering, absorption, and spectral lines, with a non-LTE radiative transfer pre-computation of the ionization structure of the slab in photo-ionization equilibrium. We discuss the impact of the reflector's ionization and of the incident spectral shape on the obtained energy dependence of polarization. Despite the presence of highly polarized absorption features and low-polarized spectral lines, an underlying scattering-induced increase of polarization degree with energy in mid to hard X-rays naturally arises due to multiple Compton-scattering energy shifts. Such re-processing effect is particularly apparent in 2-8 keV for steep incident X-ray spectra reflecting from highly-ionized optically thick media. Integration of the resulting local reflection tables in specific large-scale reflection geometries occurring in X-ray binary systems, including relativistic effects, will be presented in a follow-up paper. Nonetheless, we anticipate that the obtained local energy-dependent features will imprint at large distances from the source to the observed X-ray polarization, and could contribute to the observed increase of total polarization degree with energy in 2-8 keV in many accreting systems by the IXPE mission.</description>

Abstract: Metallicity plays a crucial role in the evolution of massive stars and their final core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions. Integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy can provide a spatially resolved view of SN host galaxies and serve as a powerful tool to study SN metallicities. While early transient surveys targeted on high star formation rate and metallicity galaxies, recent untargeted, wide-field surveys (e.g., ASAS-SN, ZTF) have discovered large numbers of SNe without this bias. In this work, we construct a large sample of SNe discovered by wide-field untargted searches, consisting of 166 SNe of Types II(P), IIn, IIb, Ib and Ic at $z \leq 0.02$ with VLT/MUSE observations. This is currently the largest CCSN sample with IFU observations. With the strong-line method, we reveal the spatially-resolved metallicity maps of the SN host galaxies and acquire accurate metallicity measurements for the SN sites, finding a range from $12 + \log(\text{O/H}) = 8.1$ to 8.7 dex. And the metallicity distributions for different SN types are very close to each other, with mean and median values of 8.4--8.5 dex. Our large sample size narrows the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty down to only 0.05 dex. The apparent metallicity differences among SN types are all within $\sim$1$\sigma$ uncertainties and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are all consistent with being randomly drawn from the same reference distribution. This suggests that metallicity plays a minor role in the origin of different CCSN types and some other metallicity-insensitive processes, such as binary interaction, dominate the distinction of CCSN types.</description>

      <title>Fastest spinning millisecond pulsars: indicators for quark matter in neutron stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rotating hybrid stars, with a particular emphasis on the effect of a deconfinement phase transition on their properties at high spin. Our analysis is based on a hybrid equation of state (EoS) with a phase transition from hypernuclear matter to color-superconducting quark matter, where both phases are described within a relativistic density functional approach. By varying the vector meson and diquark couplings in the quark matter phase, we obtain different hybrid star sequences with varying extension of the quark matter core, ensuring consistency with astrophysical constraints from mass, radius and tidal deformability measurements. As a result, we demonstrate the impact of an increasing rotational frequency on the maximum gravitational mass, the central energy density of compact stars, the appearance of the quasi-radial oscillations and non-axisymmetric instabilities. We demonstrate that for the most favorable parameter sets with a strong vector coupling, hybrid star configurations with color superconducting quark matter core can describe the fastest spinning and heaviest galactic neutron star (NS) J0952-0607, while it is out of reach for the purely hadronic hypernuclear star configuration. We also revise the previously proposed empirical relation between the Kepler frequency, gravitational mass, and radius of non-rotating NSs, obtained based on the assumption that all NSs, up to the heaviest, are hadronic. We show how the phase transition to quark matter alters this relation and, consequently, the constraints on the dense matter EoS. Our findings reveal that incorporating the hybrid EoS has significant implications for the constraints on the properties of strongly interacting matter and NSs, placing the upper limit on $R_{1.4} \leq 14.90$ km and $R_{0.7}&lt;11.49$ km (considering 716 Hz frequency limit from J1748+2446ad) and $R_{1.4}\leq$11.90~km (for 1000 Hz).</description>

      <title>Angular Distribution of Gamma Rays Produced in Proton-Proton Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of how high-energy proton-proton collisions produce gamma rays through the decays of pions and other secondaries is needed to correctly interpret astrophysical observations with the Fermi-LAT telescope. In the existing literature on cosmic-ray collisions with gas, the focus is on the gamma-ray yield spectrum, $d N_\gamma/dE$. However, in some situations, the joint energy and angular distribution can be observed, so one needs instead $d^2 N_\gamma/dE \, d\Omega$. We provide calculations of this distribution over the energy range from the pion production threshold to $100~{\rm GeV}$, basing our results on FLUKA simulations. We provide the results in tabular form and provide a Python tool on GitHub to aid in utilization. We also provide an approximate analytic formula that illuminates the underlying physics. We discuss simplified examples where this angular dependence can be observed to illustrate the necessity of taking the joint distribution into account.</description>

      <title>TESSELLATE: Piecing Together the Variable Sky With TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TESSELLATE, a dedicated pipeline for performing an untargeted search documenting all variable phenomena captured by the TESS space telescope. Building on the TESSreduce difference imaging pipeline, TESSELLATE extracts calibrated and reduced photometric data for every full frame image in the TESS archive. Using this data, we systematically identify transient, variable and non-sidereal signals across timescales ranging from minutes to weeks. The high cadence and wide field of view of TESS enables us to conduct a comprehensive search of the entire sky to a depth of ~17 $m_i$. Based on the volumetric rates for known fast transients, we expect there to be numerous Fast Blue Optical Transients and Gamma Ray Burst afterglows present in the existing TESS dataset. Beyond transients, TESSELLATE can also identify new variable stars and exoplanet candidates, and recover known asteroids. We classify events using machine learning techniques and the work of citizen scientists via the Zooniverse Cosmic Cataclysms project. Finally, we introduce the TESSELLATE Sky Survey: a complete, open catalog of the variable sky observed by TESS.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts and Electromagnetic Transition Radiation on Gravitational Shockwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a gravitational shockwave hits a magnetar it creates perturbations of the magnetar magnetic field in a form of a transition radiation. We argue that this radiation can be a novel candidate to explain the origin of fast radio bursts (FRB). A unique feature of the transition radiation on the shockwaves is that normal components of its Maxwell strength `remember' only the spatial `profile' of the shock, not the form of the signal. This fact allows us to determine completely a characteristic initial problem for the perturbations with Cauchy data defined on a null hypersurface just behind the shockwave front. The computations are carried by modeling magnetar as a magnetic dipole. As an illustration we consider shockwaves created by ultrarelativistic objects of two types, by compact sources or by cosmic strings. In the both cases the duration of the engine pulse is determined by an impact distance between the magnetar and the source. We present the angular distribution of the transition radiation flux and show that it is consistent with properties of the FRB engine.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration recently announced the detection of a neutrino with energy 220 PeV. One possible source of such ultra-high-energy particles is the rapid emission of energetic Hawking radiation from a primordial black hole (PBH) near the end of its evaporation lifetime. The mass distribution for PBHs features a power-law tail for small masses; a small subset of PBHs would be undergoing late-stage evaporation today. We find that recent high-energy neutrino events detected by the IceCube and KM3NeT Collaborations, with energies ${\cal O} (1 - 10^2) \, {\rm PeV}$, are consistent with event-rate expectations if a significant fraction of the dark matter consists of PBHs.</description>

      <title>Rotating Supermassive Pop III Stars On The Main Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the first billion years of cosmic history challenges conventional theories of black hole formation and growth. Simultaneously, recent JWST observations revealing exceptionally high nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios in galaxies at high redshifts raise critical questions about rapid chemical enrichment mechanisms operating in the early universe. Supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses of 1000 to 10000 M$_{\odot}$ are promising candidates to explain these phenomena, but existing models have so far neglected the pivotal role of stellar rotation. Here, we present the first comprehensive evolutionary models of rotating Pop III SMSs computed using the GENEC stellar evolution code, including detailed treatments of rotation-induced chemical mixing, angular momentum transport, and mass loss driven by the $\Omega\Gamma$ limit. We demonstrate that rotation significantly enlarges the convective core and extends stellar lifetimes by up to 20%, with moderate enhancement of mass-loss rates as stars approach critical rotation thresholds. Our results further indicate that the cores of SMSs rotate relatively slowly (below $\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$), resulting in dimensionless spin parameters $a* &lt; 0.1$ for intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) remnants that are notably lower than theoretical maximum spins. These findings highlight rotation as a key factor in determining the structural evolution, chemical yields, and black hole spin properties of SMSs, providing critical insights to interpret observational signatures from the high-redshift universe.</description>
