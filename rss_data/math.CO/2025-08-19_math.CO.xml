      <title>Undecidability of Translational Tiling with 2 Polycubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that it is undecidable whether a set of two polycubes can tile $\mathbb{Z}^3$ by translation. The proof involves a new technique that allows us to simulate two disconnected polycubes with two connected polycubes. By expanding this technique to higher dimensions, we also prove that a set of disconnected tiles in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ can be simulated by the same number of connected tiles in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ for $n \geq 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11766v1 Announce Type: new

In this article, we will consider the types of partitions with restrictions on consecutive parts. We will show that such partitions are separable integer partition classes and then give the generating functions for such partitions.</description>

      <title>$K$-analogues of Hivert's divided difference operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several families of polynomials of combinatorial and representation theoretic interest (notably the Schur polynomials $s_\lambda$, Demazure characters $\mathfrak{D}_a$, and Demazure atoms $\mathfrak{A}_a$) can be defined in terms of divided difference operators. Hivert (2000) defines "fundamental analogues" of these divided difference operators, and Hivert and Hicks-Niese show in arXiv:2406.02420 that the polynomials that arise from those fundamental operators in analogous ways to the three families of polynomials above are respectively the fundamental quasisymmetric functions $F_a$ from (1984), the fundamental slides $\mathfrak{F}_a$ of Assaf and Searles from arXiv:1603.09744, and the fundamental particles $\mathfrak{P}_a$ of Searles from arXiv:1707.01172. Lascoux (2001) defines $K$-analogues of the divided difference operators, and in arXiv:1908.07364, Buciumas, Scrimshaw, and Weber show that the polynomials arising in corresponding ways from the $K$-theoretic divided difference operators are respectively the Grothendieck polynomials $\overline{s}_\lambda$, the combinatorial Lascoux polynomials $\overline{\mathfrak{D}}_a$ from arXiv:1611.08777, and the combinatorial Lascoux atoms $\overline{\mathfrak{A}}_a$ from arXiv:1611.08777, as conjectured by Monical in arXiv:1611.08777. We define $K$-analogues of Hivert's fundamental divided difference operators and show that the polynomials arising in the corresponding ways from our new operators are respectively the multifundamentals $\overline{F}_a$ of Lam and Pylyavskyy from arXiv:0705.2189, the fundamental glides $\overline{\mathfrak{F}}_a$ from of Pechenik and Searles from arXiv:1611.02545, and the kaons $\overline{\mathfrak{P}}_a$ of Monical, Pechenik, and Searles from arXiv:1806.03802.</description>

      <title>Cassini-Catalan Determinants via Ramanujan's Theta Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the classical Cassini and Catalan identities for Fibonacci numbers arise naturally from a single quadratic theta-function identity of Ramanujan. Expanding the identity $\psi(q)\psi(q^{3})=\psi(q^{4})\varphi(q^{6})+q\,\varphi(q^{2})\psi(q^{12})$ via the Jacobi triple product and equating coefficients yields the unified $q$-determinant $F_{n+r}(q)F_{n-r}(q)-F_{n}(q)^{2}=(-q)^{\,n-r}F_{r}(q)^{2}$, $n\ge r\ge 1$, where $\psi(q)$ and $\varphi(q)$ are Ramanujan's theta functions with $q$ a complex parameter in the unit disc $(\lvert q \rvert &lt; 1)$ and $F_n(q)$ denotes the Carlitz $q$-Fibonacci polynomials. The radial limit $q\to1^{-}$ recovers Cassini's formula ($r=1$) and Catalan's one-parameter extension, while the same derivation with an auxiliary weight produces new partition-refined versions. The argument uses only standard $q$-series algebra (triple-product expansions, $q$-Pochhammer cancellations, and coefficient extraction), providing a transparent modular explanation of the alternating sign $(-1)^{\,n-r}$ in Catalan's identity through the level-6 provenance of $\varphi$ and $\psi$. Beyond unifying Cassini\textendash Catalan in a single framework, the method lifts seamlessly to higher-order recurrences, giving a template for Tribonacci-type determinants and suggesting congruence phenomena obtained from modular dissections and root-of-unity limits. The results place familiar Fibonacci determinants within Ramanujan's analytic landscape, indicate routes to combinatorial bijections that mirror the analytic cancellations, and connect with themes in modern $q$-series\textemdash ranging from colored partition identities to quantum-modular and exactly solvable models\textemdash thereby highlighting both the explanatory power and the ongoing relevance of Ramanujan's theta identities.</description>

      <title>Derivatives of padded Schubert polynomials through pipe dreams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, Hamaker, Pechenik, Speyer, and Weigandt showed that a certain differential operator $\nabla$ expands positively in the basis of Schubert polynomials. For $\pi$ a dominant permutation, Gaetz and Tung showed an analogous positivity result holds for a dual differential operator $\Delta$ acting on $\pi$-padded Schubert polynomials. In this paper, we provide a new proof of the result of Gaetz and Tung using the combinatorics of pipe dreams.</description>

      <title>Higher and extended Jacobi polynomials for codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Jacobi polynomial generalizations of several classical invariants in coding theory over finite fields, specifically, the higher and extended weight enumerators, and we establish explicit correspondences between the resulting Jacobi polynomials. Moreover, we present the Jacobi analogue of MacWilliams identity for both higher and extended weight enumerators. We also present that the higher Jacobi polynomials for linear codes whose subcode supports form $t$-designs can be uniquely determined from the higher weight enumerators of the codes via polarization technique. Finally, we demonstrate how higher Jacobi polynomials can be computed from harmonic higher weight enumerators with the help of Hahn polynomials.</description>

      <title>Vertex energy distributions in regular graph structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy of a vertex $v_i$ in a graph $G$ is defined as $\mathcal{E}_G(v_i) = |A|_{ii}$, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix of $G$, $A^*$ denotes the conjugate transpose of $A$, and $|A| = (AA^*)^{1/2}$. The total energy of the graph, $\mathcal{E}(G)$, is then the sum of the energies of all vertices: $\mathcal{E}(G) = \mathcal{E}_G(v_1) + \mathcal{E}_G(v_2) + \dots + \mathcal{E}_G(v_n)$. In this paper, we compute the vertex energy for several well-known regular graphs, including the Frucht graph, Desargues graph, Tutte-Coxeter graph, Heawood graph, Shrikhande graph, and Petersen graph.</description>

      <title>Spectral Tur\'an-type problem in non-$r$-partite graphs: Forbidden generalized book graph $B_{r,k}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$, a graph is said to be $H$-free if it does not contain $H$ as a subgraph. A graph is color-critical when it has an edge whose removal leads to a reduction in its chromatic number. For a graph $H$ with a chromatic number of \(r + 1\), we use \(\text{spex}_{r + 1}(n, H)\) to represent the maximum spectral radius among non-$r$-partite $H$-free graphs of order $n$. The set of all non-$r$-partite $H$-free graphs of order $n$ that have a spectral radius of \(\text{spex}_{r + 1}(n, H)\) is denoted as \(\text{SPEX}_{r + 1}(n, H)\). For \(r\geq2\) and \(k\geq1\), we define \(B_{r,k}\) as the graph constructed by connecting each vertex of \(K_r\) to every vertex of an independent set with size $k$. We refer to \(B_{r,k}\) as a book graph (in the case of \(r = 2\)) or a generalized book graph (when \(r\geq3\)). It should be noted that \(B_{r,k}\) is a color-critical graph with a chromatic number of \(r + 1\). Lin, Ning, and Wu (2021) identified the unique extremal graph within \(\text{SPEX}_3(n, B_{2,1})\); Li and Peng (2023) determined the unique extremal graph in \(\text{SPEX}_{r + 1}(n, B_{r,1})\) for all \(r\geq2\). Quite recently, Liu and Miao (2025) specified the unique extremal graph in \(\text{SPEX}_3(n, B_{2,k})\) for all \(k\geq2\). Inspired by these remarkable results, this paper, relying on spectral stability theory, local structure characterization, along with the theory of characteristic equations and Rayleigh quotient equations, aims to determine the unique extremal graph in \(\text{SPEX}_{r + 1}(n, B_{r,k})\) for \(r\geq3\), \(k\geq1\), and sufficiently large $n$. This work partially addresses an open problem put forward in [38].</description>

      <title>A New Proof of Fine's Identity using Wildberger's Polynomial Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1959, N. J. Fine showed that the sum of the multinomial coefficients corresponding to the partitions of a natural number $n$ into $r$ parts is a binomial coefficient: $$ \sum_{\substack{k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + {}\ldots = r \\ k_1 + 2k_2 + 3k_3 + {}\ldots = n }} \binom{r}{k_1, k_2, k_3, \ldots } = \binom{n - 1}{r - 1} $$ Fine gives a rather pithy proof, though we're still stuck on the part that says, ``We begin with an important though obvious remark.'' In 2025, Wildberger and Rubine gave the series solution to the general polynomial, derived from a non-associative algebra of roofed, subdivided polygons they call \textit{subdigons}. We generalize subdigons to \textit{tubdigons}, which include 2-gons, and count tubdigons of a given type two ways: through a simple counting argument (backed up by the combinatorics literature) and by using Wildberger's polynomial formula to solve the polynomial implied by the multiset specification of tubdigons. Comparing corresponding terms yields Fine's Identity.</description>

      <title>The spectral Tur\'{a}n problem: Characterizing spectral-consistent graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\rm EX}(n,H)$ and ${\rm SPEX}(n,H)$ denote the families of $n$-vertex $H$-free graphs with the maximum size and the maximum spectral radius, respectively. A graph $H$ is said to be spectral-consistent if ${\rm SPEX}(n,H)\subseteq {\rm EX}(n,H)$ for sufficiently large $n$. A fundamental problem in spectral extremal graph theory is to determine which graphs are spectral-consistent.
  Cioab\u{a}, Desai and Tait [European J. Combin. 99 (2022) 103420] proposed the following conjecture: Let $H$ be any graph such that the graphs in ${\rm EX}(n,H)$ are Tur\'{a}n graph plus $O(1)$ edges. Then $H$ is spectral-consistent. Wang, Kang and Xue [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 159 (2023) 20--41] confirmed this conjecture, along with a stronger result.
  In this paper, we continue to explore the spectral-consistent problem. We prove that for any finite graph $H$, if $\mathcal{M}(H)$ is matching-good, then $H$ is spectral-consistent. This provides a weaker condition than the one presented by Wang, Kang, and Xue for guaranteeing that $H$ is spectral-consistent. This result allows us to characterize spectral-consistency for several important classes of forbidden graphs $H$: generalized color-critical graphs (including the Petersen graph and the dodecahedron graph), and the odd-ballooning of trees or complete bipartite graphs. Moreover, we provide a concise proof for a spectral-consist result by Chen, Lei and Li [European J. Combin. 130 (2025) 104226]. Additionally, we propose problems for future research.</description>

      <title>A reflection principle for nonintersecting paths and lozenge tilings with free boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Okada and Stembridge's Pfaffian formula for the enumeration of families of nonintersecting paths with fixed starting points and unfixed ending points has been widely used to resolve many challenging problems in enumerative combinatorics. In this paper, we present a new formula that complements Okada and Stembridge's Pfaffian formula. The proof is based on a formula for the square of the sum of maximum minors of matrices obtained from Okada's formula. The combinatorial interpretation of the new formula gives a reflection principle for nonintersecting paths. It implies that the enumeration of families of nonintersecting paths with unfixed ending points can be resolved by enumerating families of nonintersecting paths with fixed ending points instead. Using this formula, we also show that the enumeration of lozenge tilings of a large family of regions with free boundaries can be deduced from those without free boundaries. We then provide several applications of this result, including 1) a new family of regions whose tiling generating function is given by a simple product formula, 2) a simpler proof of a factorization theorem for lozenge tilings of hexagons with holes, and 3) new determinant formulas for the volume generating functions of shifted plane partitions of a shifted shape and symmetric plane partitions of a symmetric shape.</description>

      <title>Non-r-partite graphs without complete split subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Simonovits' chromatic critical edge theorem shows that for sufficiently large $n$, if $H$ is an edge-color-critical graph with $\chi(H)=p+1\ge 3$, then the Tur\'an graph $T_{n,p}$ is the unique extremal graph with respect to ${\rm ex}(n,H)$. Denote by ${\rm EX}_{r+1}(n,H)$ and ${\rm SPEX}_{r+1}(n,H)$ the family of $n$-vertex $H$-free non-$r$-partite graphs with the maximum size and with the spectral radius, respectively. Li and Peng [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 37 (2023) 2462--2485] characterized the unique graph in $\mathrm{SPEX}_{r+1}(n,K_{r+1})$ for $r\geq 2$ and showed that $\mathrm{SPEX}_{r+1}(n,K_{r+1})\subseteq \mathrm{EX}_{r+1}(n,K_{r+1})$. It is interesting to study the extremal or spectral extremal problems for color-critical graph $H$ in non-$r$-partite graphs. For $p\geq 2$ and $q\geq 1$, we call the graph $B_{p,q}:=K_p\nabla qK_1$ a complete split graph (or generalized book graph). In this note, we determine the unique spectral extremal graph in $\mathrm{SPEX}_{r+1}(n,B_{p,q})$ and show that $\mathrm{SPEX}_{r+1}(n,B_{p,q})\subseteq \mathrm{EX}_{r+1}(n,B_{p,q})$ for sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>On the Metric Dimension of Generalized Petersen Graphs $P(n,3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metric dimension of a graph $G$ is defined as the minimum number of vertices in a subset $S\subset V(G)$ such that all other vertices are uniquely determined by their distances to the vertices in $S$, and is denoted by $\dim(G)$. In this paper, we study the metric dimension of generalized Petersen graphs $P(n,3)$. The notions of good and bad vertices, which are introduced in Imran et al. (2014, Ars. Combinatoria 117, 113-130), are instrumental in determining the lower bound of the metric dimension for certain types of graphs. We propose an approach, based on these notions, to determine the lower bound of $\dim(P(n,3))$. Moreover, we shall prove that $\dim(P(n,3))=4$, where $n\equiv2,3,4,5 \,\,(\text{mod}\,\, 6)$ and is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Perfect tilings with the generalised triangle in $k$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denote by $T_k$ the generalised triangle, a $k$-uniform hypergraph on vertex set $\{1,2,\dots,2k-1\}$ with three edges $\{1,\dots,k-1,k\}$,$\{1,\dots,k-1,k+1\}$ and $\{k,k+1,\dots,2k-1\}$. Recently, Bowtell, Kathapurkar, Morrison and Mycroft [arXiv: 2505.05606] established the exact minimum codegree threshold for perfect $T_3$-tilings in $3$-graphs. In this paper, we extend their result to all $k \geq 3$, determining the optimal minimum codegree threshold for perfect $T_k$-tilings in $k$-graphs. Our proof uses the lattice-based absorption method, as is usual, but develops a unified and effective approach to build transferrals for all uniformities, which is of independent interest. Additionally, we establish an asymptotically tight minimum codegree threshold for a rainbow variant of the problem.</description>

      <title>Nucleation-free independent graphs with implied nonedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give inductive constructions of independent graphs that contain implied nonedges but do not contain any non-trivial rigid subgraphs, or \emph{nucleations}: some of the constructions and proofs apply to 3-dimensional abstract rigidity matroids with their respective definitions of nucleations and implied nonedges. The first motivation for the inductive constructions of this paper, which generate an especially intractable class of flexible circuits, is to illuminate further obstacles to settling Graver's maximality conjecture that the 3-dimensional generic rigidity matroid is isomorphic to Whiteley's cofactor matroid (the unique maximal matroid in which all graphs isomorphic to $K_5$ are circuits). While none of the explicit examples we provide refutes the maximality conjecture (since their properties hold in both matroids) the construction schemes are useful regardless whether the conjecture is true or false, e.g. for constructing larger (counter)examples from smaller ones. The second motivation is to make progress towards a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding independence in the abovementioned maximal matroid. Nucleation-free graphs with implied nonedges, such as the families constructed in this paper, are the key obstacles that must be dealt with for improving the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity of rows of triangular arrays satisfying a certain super-recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrences of the form \begin{equation*}
  T(n,k) = (\alpha n+\beta k +\gamma) \ T(n-1,k) + (\alpha'n+\beta'k+\gamma')\ T(n-1,k-1)+\delta_{n,0}\delta_{k,0}. \end{equation*} show up as the recurrence for many well-studied combinatorial sequences such as the Stirling numbers of first and second kind, the Lah numbers, Eulerian numbers etc. Recently, many of these sequences have received generalisations that obey a recurrence of the form \begin{equation*}
  T(n,k) = (\alpha n+\beta k +\gamma)^l \ T(n-1,k) + (\alpha'n+\beta'k+\gamma')^l\ T(n-1,k-1)+\delta_{n,0}\delta_{k,0}. \end{equation*} where $l$ is a positive integer. Many of these generalised sequences also satisfy properties such as unimodality, log-concavity, gamma-nonnegativity, real-rootedness that the original sequences satisfy. In this article, we give sufficient conditions for rows of triangular arrays, arising from the recurrence stated above, to be log-concave. We show that our sufficient condition is satisfied by many of the classical examples, thereby giving a new unified approach to proving their log-concavity. This sufficient condition also confirms a conjecture of Tankosic about the log-concavity of generalised Lah numbers.
  Our main technique will be to interpret the triangular array $(T(n,k))$ as weighted lattice paths and produce an injection that is increasing in weight. Finally, we introduce a two-parameter generalisation of the Eulerian numbers analogous to the generalised Stirling and Lah counterparts. We prove that this sequence is palindromic and make some remarks about their gamma-nonnegativity and real-rootedness.</description>

      <title>Tur\'{a}n number of books in non-bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{ex}(n, H)$ be the Tur\'{a}n number of $H$ for a given graph $H$. A graph is color-critical if it contains an edge whose removal reduces its chromatic number. Simonovits' chromatic critical edge theorem states that if $H$ is color-critical with $\chi(H)=k+1$, then there exists an $n_0(H)$ such that ex$(n, H)=e(T_{n,k})$ and the Tur\'{a}n graph $T_{n,k}$ is the only extremal graph provided $n\geq n_0(H).$ A book graph $B_{r+1}$ is a set of $r+1$ triangles with a common edge, where $r\geq0$ is an integer. Note that $B_{r+1}$ is a color-critical graph with $\chi(B_{r+1})=3$. Simonovits' theorem implies that $T_{n,2}$ is the only extremal graph for $B_{r+1}$-free graphs of sufficiently large order $n$. Furthermore, Edwards and independently Khad\v{z}iivanov and Nikiforov completely confirmed Erd\H{o}s' booksize conjecture and obtained that ex$(n, B_{r+1})=e(T_{n,2})$ for $n\geq n_0(B_{r+1})=6r$. Recently, Zhai and Lin [J. Graph Theory 102 (2023) 502-520] investigated the problem of booksize from a spectral perspective.
  Note that the extremal graph $T_{n,2}$ is bipartite. Motivated by the above elegant results, we in this paper focus on the Tur\'{a}n problem of non-bipartite $B_{r+1}$-free graphs of order $n$. For $r = 0,$ Erd\H{o}s proved a nice result: If $G$ is a non-bipartite triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices, then $e(G)\leq\big\lfloor\frac{(n-1)^{2}}{4}\big\rfloor+1$. For general $r\geq1,$ we determine the exact value of Tur\'{a}n number of $B_{r+1}$ in non-bipartite graphs and characterize all extremal graphs provided $n$ is sufficiently large. An interesting phenomenon is that the Tur\'{a}n numbers and extremal graphs are completely different for $r=0$ and general $r\geq1.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all spherical 2-designs that arise as orbits of finite group actions on real inner product spaces. Although it is well known that such designs can occur in representations without trivial components, we give a complete characterization of the orbits that satisfy the second-moment condition. In particular, we show that these orbits correspond to projections of compact group orbits within the regular representation, and we provide an explicit classification via isotypic decomposition and moment conditions. This approach unifies geometric and representation-theoretic viewpoints on highly symmetric point configurations.</description>

      <title>On transitive permutation groups with exponential graph growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a finite connected graph and $G$ a vertex-transitive group of its automorphisms. The pair $(\Gamma, G)$ is said to be locally-$L$ if the permutation group induced by the action of the vertex-stabiliser $G_v$ on the set of neighbours of a vertex $v$ in $\Gamma$ is permutation isomorphic to $L$. The maximum growth of $|G_v|$ as a function of $|V\Gamma|$ for locally-$L$ pairs $(\Gamma,G)$ is called the graph growth of $L$. We prove that if $L$ is a transitive permutation group on a set $\Omega$ admitting a nontrivial block $B$ such that the pointwise stabiliser of $\Omega\setminus B$ in $L$ is nontrivial, then the graph growth of $L$ is exponential. This generalises several results in the literature on transitive permutation groups with exponential graph growth.</description>

Abstract: We study the derangement graph $\Gamma_n$ whose vertex set consists of all permutations of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, where two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding permutations differ at every position. It is well-known that $\Gamma_n$ is a Cayley graph, Hamiltonian and Hamilton-connected. In this paper, we prove that for $n \geq 4$, the derangement graph $\Gamma_n$ is edge pancyclic. Moreover, we extend this result to two broader classes of Cayley graphs defined on symmetric group.</description>

      <title>A Poisson Type Operator Deformed by Generalized Fibonacci Numbers and Its Combinatorial Moment Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter deformation of the classical Poisson distribution from the viewpoint of noncommutative probability theory, by defining a $(q,t)$-Poisson type operator (random variable) on the $(q,t)$-Fock space \cite{Bl12} (See also \cite{BY06, AY20}). From the analogous viewpoint of the classical Poisson limit theorem in probability theory, we are naturally led to a family of orthogonal polynomials, which we call the $(q,t)$-Charlier polynomials. These generalize the $q$-Charlier polynomials of Saitoh-Yoshida \cite{SY00a, SY00b} and reflect deeper combinatorial symmetries through the additional deformation parameter $t$. A central feature of this paper is the derivation of a combinatorial moment formula of the $(q,t)$-Poisson type operator and the $(q,t)$-Poisson distribution. This is accomplished by means of a card arrangement technique, which encodes set partitions together with crossing and nesting statistics. The resulting expression naturally exhibits a duality between these statistics, arising from a structure rooted in generalized Fibonacci numbers. Our approach provides a concrete framework where methods in combinatorics and theory of orthogonal polynomials are used to investigate the probabilistic properties arising from the $(q,t)$-deformation.</description>

      <title>The generalizations of Erd\H{o}s matching conjecture for $t$-matching number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Define a \textit{$t$-matching} of size $m$ in a $k$-uniform family as a collection $\{A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_m\} \subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ such that $|A_i \cap A_j| &lt; t$ for all $1 \leq i &lt; j \leq m$. Let $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$. The \textit{$t$-matching number} of $\mathcal{F}$, denoted by $\nu_t(\mathcal{F})$, is the maximum size of a $t$-matching contained in $\mathcal{F}$. We study the maximum cardinality of a family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq\binom{[n]}{k}$ with given $t$-matching number, which is a generalization of Erd\H{o}s matching conjecture, and we additionally prove a stability result. We also determine the second largest maximal structure with $\nu_t(\mathcal{F})=s$, extending work of Frankl and Kupavskii \cite{frankl2016two}. Finally, we obtain the extremal $G$-free induced subgraphs of generalized Kneser graph, generalizing Alishahi's results in \cite{alishahi2018extremal}.</description>

      <title>New $r$-Euler--Mahonian statistics involving Denert's statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we proved the equidistribution of the pairs of permutation statistics $(r\textsf{des},r\textsf{maj})$ and $(r\textsf{exc},r\textsf{den})$. Any pair of permutation statistics that is equidistributed with these pairs is said to be $r$-Euler--Mahonian. Several classes of $r$-Euler--Mahonian statistics were established by Huang--Lin--Yan and Huang--Yan. Inspired by their bijections, we provide a new bijective proof of the classical result that $(\textsf{exc},\textsf{den})$ is Euler--Mahonian. Using this bijection, we further show that $(\textsf{exc}_{r},\textsf{den})$ is $r$-Euler--Mahonian, where $\textsf{exc}_{r}$ denotes the number of $r$-level excedances (i.e., excedances at least $r$). Furthermore, by extending our bijection, we establish a more general result that encompasses all the aforementioned results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An abstract simplicial complex $\mathbf{F}$ is a non-uniform hypergraph without isolated vertices, whose edge set is closed under taking subsets. The extremal number $\mathrm{ex}(n,\mathbf{F})$ is the maximum number of edges in an $\mathbf{F}$-free simplicial complex on $n$ vertices. This extremal number is naturally related to the generalised Tur\'an numbers of certain underlying hypergraphs. Making progress in a problem raised by Conlon, Piga, and Sch\"ulke, we find large classes of simplicial complexes whose extremal numbers are determined by the respective generalised hypergraph Tur\'an numbers. We also provide simplicial complexes for which such a relation does not hold.</description>

      <title>On saturated triangulation-free convex geometric graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A convex geometric graph is a graph whose vertices are the corners of a convex polygon P in the plane and whose edges are boundary edges and diagonals of the polygon. It is called triangulation-free if its non-boundary edges do not contain the set of diagonals of some triangulation of P. Aichholzer et al. (2010) showed that the maximum number of edges in a triangulation-free convex geometric graph on n vertices is ${{n}\choose{2}}-(n-2)$, and subsequently, Keller and Stein (2020) and (independently) Ali et al. (2022) characterized the triangulation-free graphs with this maximum number of edges.
  We initiate the study of the saturation version of the problem, namely, characterizing the triangulation-free convex geometric graphs which are not of the maximum possible size, but yet the addition of any edge to them results in containing a triangulation. We show that, surprisingly, there exist saturated graphs with only g(n) = O(n log n) edges. Furthermore, we prove that for any $n &gt; n_0$ and any $g(n)\leq t \leq {{n}\choose{2}}-(n-2)$, there exists a saturated graph with n vertices and t edges. In addition, we obtain a complete characterization of all saturated graphs whose number of edges is ${{n}\choose{2}}-(n-1)$, which is 1 less than the maximum.</description>

      <title>Configured spaces and their M\"obius polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An arbitrary dependence structure between a finite family of events of a probability space defines a hypergraph structure. We study the converse operation, starting from a hypergraph structure, to determine a canonical probability space with events indexed by the vertices and that satisfy the prescribed dependence structure; we also require that events that are not mutually independent must be mutually exclusive. Such a hypergraph structure, we call a configuration.
  Requiring furthermore that all events are given the same positive probability $t$, converts this problem to the study of a family of M\"obius polynomials, which we call the relative M\"obius polynomials (or independence polynomial) of the configuration. This study was very much already complete in the case where the configuration actually derives from a graph structure, but remained open in the general case.
  We show the existence and uniqueness of an optimal real $t$, optimal in the sense that the events cover a subset of maximal probability. We base our study on a new formula for the derivative of the M\"obius polynomial.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $d$-distance (independent) domination in trees and in bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $d$-distance $p$-packing domination number $\gamma_d^p(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum size of a set of vertices of $G$ which is both a $d$-distance dominating set and a $p$-packing. In 1994, Beineke and Henning conjectured that if $d\ge 1$ and $T$ is a tree of order $n \geq d+1$, then $\gamma_d^1(T) \leq \frac{n}{d+1}$. They supported the conjecture by proving it for $d\in \{1,2,3\}$. In this paper, it is proved that $\gamma_d^1(G) \leq \frac{n}{d+1}$ holds for any bipartite graph $G$ of order $n \geq d+1$, and any $d\ge 1$. Trees $T$ for which $\gamma_d^1(T) = \frac{n}{d+1}$ holds are characterized. It is also proved that if $T$ has $\ell$ leaves, then $\gamma_d^1(T) \leq \frac{n-\ell}{d}$ (provided that $n-\ell \geq d$), and $\gamma_d^1(T) \leq \frac{n+\ell}{d+2}$ (provided that $n\geq d$). The latter result extends Favaron's theorem from 1992 asserting that $\gamma_1^1(T) \leq \frac{n+\ell}{3}$. In both cases, trees that attain the equality are characterized and relevant conclusions for the $d$-distance domination number of trees derived.</description>

      <title>The linear programming optimum for packings in classical association schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Association schemes are central objects in algebraic combinatorics, with the classical schemes lying at their core. These classical association schemes essentially consist of the Hamming and Johnson schemes, and their $q$-analogs: bilinear forms scheme, alternating bilinear forms scheme, Hermitian forms scheme, $q$-Johnson scheme, and polar space schemes. Each of them gives rise to a distance-regular graph on a vertex set $X$, naturally endowed with the path metric. We study $d$-codes in these schemes, that is, subsets $Y$ of $X$ in which every pair of distinct elements has path distance at least $d$. A powerful tool for deriving upper bounds on the size of $d$-codes is the linear programming method. In the case of the Hamming and Johnson schemes, the linear program has been studied since the 1970s, but its optimum is still unknown. We determine the optimum of the linear program for nearly all classical association schemes distinct from the Hamming and Johnson schemes. This is achieved by constructing feasible solutions to both the primal and dual linear programs whose objective values coincide. As a corollary, we obtain upper bounds on $t$-intersecting sets in classical association schemes, providing new proofs of several known results and, in particular, improving earlier bounds on $t$-intersecting sets of generators in polar spaces. These results can be viewed as analogs of the classical Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem in extremal set theory. Our proofs draw on techniques from algebraic combinatorics and the duality theory of linear programming.</description>

      <title>On the Tur\'{a}n number of odd-ballooning of $3$-chromatic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $F$, the Tur\'{a}n number ${\rm ex}(n,F)$ is the maximum number of edges in any $n$-vertex $F$-free graph. The odd-ballooning of $F$, denoted by $F^{o}$, is a graph obtained by replacing each edge of $F$ with an odd cycle, where all new vertices of the odd cycles are distinct. The Tur\'{a}n number of the odd-ballooning of $F$ has been established for several important cases. For a star, it was determined by Erd\H{o}s, F\"{u}redi, Gould, and Gunderson (1995), Hou, Qiu, and Liu (2018), and Yuan (2018); for trees under certain conditions, by Zhu and Chen (2023); and for complete bipartite graphs $K_{s,t}$ ($t\geq s \geq 2$) where each substituted odd cycle has length at least five, by Peng and Xia (2024). In this paper, we apply Simonovits' celebrated method of progressive induction to determine the Tur\'{a}n number for the odd-ballooning of a class of $3$-chromatic graphs. Specifically, let $F$ be a graph formed by connecting a single vertex to all vertices of another graph whose components are either non-trivial trees or even cycles. We determine ${\rm ex}(n,F^{o})$ when each substituted odd cycle in $F^{o}$ has length at least five. As corollaries, we obtain the Tur\'{a}n number for the odd-ballooning of several well-known graph classes, including odd wheels, fan graphs, book graphs, and friendship graphs, where each substituted odd cycle in the ballooning has length at least five.</description>

      <title>Non-bipartite graphs without theta subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a color-critical graph $H$ with $\chi(H)=r+1\geq 3$. Simonovits' chromatic critical edge theorem and Nikiforov's spectral chromatic critical edge theorem imply that $T_{n,r}$ is the extremal graph with the maximum size and the maximum spectral radius over all $H$-free graphs of order $n$, respectively. Since $T_{n,r}$ is $r$-partite, it is interesting to study the Tur\'{a}n number and the spectral Tur\'{a}n number of a color-critical graph $H$ in non-$r$-partite graphs. Denote by ${\rm EX}_{r+1}(n,H)$ (resp. ${\rm SPEX}_{r+1}(n,H)$) the family of $n$-vertex $H$-free non-$r$-partite graphs with the maximum size (resp. spectral radius). Brouwer showed that any graph in $\mathrm{EX}_{r+1}(n,K_{r+1})$ is of size $e(T_{n,r})-\lfloor\frac{n}{r}\rfloor+1$ for $n\geq 2r+1$. Lin, Ning and Wu [Combin. Probab. Comput. 30 (2) (2021) 258--270], and Li and Peng [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 37 (2023) 2462--2485] characterized the unique graph in $\mathrm{SPEX}_{r+1}(n,K_{r+1})$ for $r\geq 2$. Particularly, the unique graph is of size $e(T_{n,r})-\lfloor\frac{n}{r}\rfloor+1$. Thus $\mathrm{SPEX}_{r+1}(n,K_{r+1})\subseteq \mathrm{EX}_{r+1}(n,K_{r+1})$. It is natural to conjecture that ${\rm SPEX}_{r+1}(n,H)\subseteq {\rm EX}_{r+1}(n,H)$ for arbitrary color-critical graph $H$ with $\chi(H)=r+1\geq 3$. Fix $q,r\geq 2$ with even $q$, a theta graph $\theta(1,q,r)$ is obtained from internally disjoint paths of lengths $1,q,r$, respectively by sharing a common pair of endpoints. In this paper, we prove that $\mathrm{SPEX}_{3}(n,\theta(1,q,r))\subseteq \mathrm{EX}_{3}(n,\theta(1,q,r))$ for sufficiently large $n$. Furthermore, we determine all the graphs in $\mathrm{SPEX}_{3}(n,\theta(1,q,r))$ and $\mathrm{EX}_{3}(n,\theta(1,q,r))$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Necklaces, permutations, and periodic critical orbits for quadratic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G_n$ denote the $n^{\rm th}$ Gleason polynomial, whose roots correspond to parameters $c$ such that the critical point $0$ is periodic of exact period $n$ under iteration of $z^2 + c$, and let $\bar{G}_n$ denote the reduction of $G_n$ modulo $2$. Buff, Floyd, Koch, and Parry made the surprising observation that the number of real roots of $G_n$ is equal to the number of irreducible factors of $\bar{G}_n$ for all $n$. We provide a bijective proof for this result by first providing explicit bijections between (a) the set of real roots of $G_n$ and the set $\bar{N}(n)$ of equivalence classes of primitive binary necklaces of length $n$ under the inversion map swapping $0$ and $1$; and (b) the set of irreducible factors of $G_n$ modulo 2 and the set $\tilde{N}^+(n)$ of binary necklaces which are either primitive of length $n$ with an even number of $1$'s or primitive of length $n/2$ with an odd number of $1$'s. We then provide an explicit bijection, closely related to Milnor and Thurston's kneading theory, between $\bar{N}(n)$ and $\tilde{N}^+(n)$. In addition, we provide explicit bijections between $\bar{N}(n)$, the set ${\rm CUP}(n)$ of cyclic unimodal permutations of $\{ 1,\ldots,n \}$, and the set $N^-(n)$ of primitive binary necklaces of length $n$ with an odd number of $1$'s.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a 3-GDD of type $1^n k^1 \ell^1$, where $n= k \cdot \ell$, with minimum distance 3 exists for every $k$ and $\ell$ such that $n = k \ell$, $k = 1$ or $3~(mod ~ 6)$, and $\ell = 1$ or $3~(mod ~ 6)$. These designs are of the shortest possible length (smallest number of elements) for given $k$ and $\ell$. Other constructions for such triple systems are also presented.</description>

      <title>Notes on the topology of independence structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following Welsh, a pre-independence space (pi-space) is a set $M$ together with a non-empty collection $I(M)$ of subsets of $M$, called independent sets, which is closed under taking subsets, and finite independent sets satisfy the exchange property from matroid theory.
  We show that $I(M)$, viewed as a poset, is contractible if it is infinite-dimensional, and Cohen-Macaulay otherwise. Moreover, the proper part of the associated poset of flats is also contractible in the infinite-dimensional case, and Cohen-Macaulay otherwise.
  These results generalize those for independence complexes and geometric lattices of (finite) matroids.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Graphs and Frameworks: A Matroid Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $d$-dimensional (bar-and-joint) framework $(G,p)$ consists of a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a realisation $p:V\to \mathbb{R}^d$. It is rigid if every continuous motion of the vertices which preserves the lengths of the edges is induced by an isometry of $\mathbb{R}^d$. The study of rigid frameworks has increased rapidly since the 1970s stimulated by numerous applications in areas such as civil and mechanical engineering, CAD, molecular conformation, sensor network localisation and low rank matrix completion. We will describe some of the main results in combinatorial rigidity theory and their applications to other areas of combinatorics, putting an emphasis on links to matroid theory.</description>

      <title>Unitary causal decompositions: a combinatorial characterisation via lattice theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a unitary transformation has a decomposition into a quantum circuit with no directed path from input $a$ to output $b$, then $a$ does not influence $b$ through the overall unitary. Conversely, it is known that if $a$ does not influence $b$, one may always find a circuit decomposition lacking a path between these systems, thus making the no-influence condition directly apparent in the connectivity of the circuit. Causal decompositions are circuit decompositions in which, more generally, multiple such no-influence conditions are made apparent simultaneously. They bridge two fundamental concepts in quantum causality: causal structure, as expressed by influences through unitary transformations (and related to signalling through quantum channels); and compositional structure, expressed in terms of the shape of quantum circuits or networks. The general existence of causal decompositions remains unknown.
  This work focusses on unitary causal decompositions, i.e. decompositions in terms of unitary circuits in the traditional quantum circuit formalism that do not require the generalisation to `extended' or `routed' quantum circuits prompted by earlier research on this topic. We identify a combinatorial condition that characterises precisely those sets of causal no-influence constraints $G$ for which any unitary transformation satisfying $G$ has a unitary causal decomposition compositionally representing those constraints. Our methods are based on finite-dimensional operator algebra as well as the concept lattice construction, which was recently shown to provide a canonical shape $L_G$ for causal decompositions. The combinatorial condition we identify can be formulated in terms of $G$ as the absence of a forbidden substructure $C_3$ and in terms of $L_G$ as the existence of no more than one path between each input and output.</description>

      <title>Queen Domination by SAT Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The queen domination problem asks for the minimum number of queens needed to attack all squares on an $n\times n$ chessboard. Once this optimal number is known, determining the number of distinct solutions up to isomorphism has also attracted considerable attention. Previous work has introduced specialized and highly optimized search procedures to address open instances of the problem. While efficient in terms of runtime, these approaches have not provided proofs that can be independently verified by third-party checkers. In contrast, this paper aims to combine efficiency with verifiability. We reduce the problem to a propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) using a straightforward encoding, and solve the resulting formulas with modern SAT solvers capable of generating proof certificates. By improving the SAT encoding with a novel literal ordering strategy, and leveraging established techniques such as static symmetry breaking and the Cube-and-Conquer paradigm, this paper achieves both performance and trustworthiness. Our approach discovers and corrects a discrepancy in previous results for $n=16$ and resolves the previously open case $n=19$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a sufficient condition for zero-freeness of partition functions applicable to lattice gases with possibly complex-valued multi-body interactions. This includes the case of hard-core interactions and, in particular, generalises recent results by Galvin et al.\ (2024) and Bencs-Buys (2025) on zero-free polydiscs of hypergraph independence polynomials. We provide two proofs: the first generalises the inductive approach of Bencs and Buys; the second employs the Kirkwood-Salsburg hierarchy. Notably, the central argument of the second proof uses of a certain partition scheme for coverings and, as a by-product, we obtain a direct improvement of Gallavotti and Miracle-Sol\'e's (1968) bounds for the Kirkwood-Salsburg operator.</description>

Abstract: We present a contour integral formalism for computing the K-theoretic equivariant Pandharipande--Thomas (PT) 4-vertex. Within the Jeffrey--Kirwan (JK) residue framework, we show that the PT 4-vertex can be obtained from the same integrand as the Donaldson--Thomas (DT) 4-vertex by choosing a different reference vector. We illustrate the formalism through examples involving curves and surfaces on the 4-fold. Furthermore, we investigate the DT/PT correspondence for the 4-fold setting together with its higher rank and supergroup-like generalizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical result due to Agranovsky and Narayanan (\cite{AN04}) says that if the support of the Fourier transform of $f: {\mathbb R}^n \to {\mathbb C}$ is carried by a smooth measure on a $d$-dimensional manifold $M$, and $f \in L^p({\mathbb R}^d)$ for $p \leq \frac{2n}{d}$, then $f$ is identically equal to $0$. In this paper, we investigate an analogous problem for functions $f: {\mathbb Z}_N^d \to {\mathbb C}$. Bourgain's celebrated result on $\Lambda_p$ sets (\cite{Bou89}), random constructions (\cite{Bab89}), and connections with the theory of exact signal recovery (\cite{DS89}, \cite{MS73}, \cite{IKLM24}, \cite{IM24}) play an important role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find nine new sets of rank four Nahm sums associated with nine different numeric matrices which are likely to be modular. They are discovered by applying the lift-dual operation to some modular rank three Nahm sums in the works of Zagier and the authors. We prove the modularity of four sets of these Nahm sums by establishing Rogers--Ramanujan type identities which express them as modular infinite products. We use various $q$-series techniques including the constant term method and Bailey pairs to prove these identities. Meanwhile, we present some conjectural identities expressing several Nahm sums as modular infinite products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the request of Laszlo Babai, founder and an editor of the free online journal Theory of Computing (ToC), theoryofcomputing.org, in August, 2025, I am posting on the arXiv, essentially unedited and not updated, a combination of two closely related sets of unpublished notes from 2003. ToC is keen on publishing links to all bibliography items, and a paper soon to be published there makes progress on a conjecture in my 2003 notes. The sections "The problem", "Evidence in favor of the conjecture", "Facts about the spectral structure of the matrix $K$", and "Stronger conjectures" previously formed a document entitled "An interesting spectral gap problem, from Jim Fill". The sections "Introduction: Self-organizing lists" and "The move-ahead-$1$ (MA1) rule" formed a document entitled "Background on the gap problem". The two sets of notes have inspired some research, including (as one example, with no attempt here at a literature survey) a 2022 paper by Bhakta, Miracle, Randall, and Streib cited in this arXiv document.</description>

      <title>Taming Irrationality: An Invariance Principle for the Random Billiard Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random billiard walk is a stochastic process $(L_t)_{t\geq 0}$ in which a laser moves through the Coxeter arrangement of an affine Weyl group in $\mathbb{R}^d$, reflecting at each hyperplane with probability $p\in (0, 1)$ and transmitting unchanged otherwise. Defant, Jiradilok, and Mossel introduced this process from the perspective of algebraic combinatorics and established that, for initial directions aligned with the coroot lattice, $L_t/\sqrt{t}$ converges to a centered spherical Gaussian. We bring analytic tools from ergodic theory and probability to the problem and extend this central limit theorem to all initial directions. More strongly, we prove the rescaled trajectories $t\mapsto n^{-1/2}L_{tn}$ converge to isotropic Brownian motion. Away from directions with rational dependencies, the limiting covariance varies continuously in $p$ and the initial direction.</description>

      <title>Bounded ranges of cardinal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{x}$ be a (non-empty) sequence of positive real numbers. Its achievement set $\mathcal{\mathbf{x}}$ is the set of all the possible sums of the elements of $\mathbf{x}$. The cardinal function of $\mathbf{x}$ is the function $f:\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x}) \to \mathbb{N}\cup\{\omega,\mathfrak{c}\}$ that for every $x\in\mathbb{A}(\mathbf{x})$ the value $f(x)$ is equal to the number of ways $x$ is represented as a sum of elements of $\mathbf{x}$.
  In this paper we consider possible ranges of cardinal functions of sequences $\mathbf{x}$. We present some general constructions and several criteria that a set has to satisfy in order to be a range of a cardinal function.
  We put special attention to the case of sets with maximal element equal to $6$. In this case, in particular, we obtained a full characterisation of sets that are ranges of cardinal functions of interval-filling sequences.</description>

      <title>Influence Prediction in Collaboration Networks: An Empirical Study on arXiv</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an empirical study of the Social Sphere Model for influence prediction, previously introduced by the authors, combining link prediction with top-k centrality-based selection. We apply the model to the temporal arXiv General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology collaboration network, evaluating its performance under varying edge sampling rates and prediction horizons to reflect different levels of initial data completeness and network evolution. Accuracy is assessed using mean squared error in both link prediction and influence maximization tasks. The results show that the model effectively identifies latent influencers, i.e., nodes that are not initially central but later influential, and performs best with denser initial graphs. Among the similarity measures tested, the newly introduced RA-2 metric consistently yields the lowest prediction errors. These findings support the practical applicability of the model to predict real-world influence in evolving networks.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of constrained reconfiguration and motion planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13032v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinating the motion of multiple agents in constrained environments is a fundamental challenge in robotics, motion planning, and scheduling. A motivating example involves $n$ robotic arms, each represented as a line segment. The objective is to rotate each arm to its vertical orientation, one at a time (clockwise or counterclockwise), without collisions nor rotating any arm more than once. This scenario is an example of the more general $k$-Compatible Ordering problem, where $n$ agents, each capable of $k$ state-changing actions, must transition to specific target states under constraints encoded as a set $\mathcal{G}$ of $k$ pairs of directed graphs.
  We show that $k$-Compatible Ordering is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete, even when $\mathcal{G}$ is planar, degenerate, or acyclic. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for cases such as when $k = 1$ or $\mathcal{G}$ has bounded treewidth. We also introduce generalized variants supporting multiple state-changing actions per agent, broadening the applicability of our framework. These results extend to a wide range of scheduling, reconfiguration, and motion planning applications in constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Sheffer Polynomials and the s-ordering of Exponential Boson Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The s-ordered form of any product of single-mode boson creation and annihilation operators, containing only a single annihilator, is computed explicitly. The s-ordering concept originated in quantum optics, and subsumes normal, symmetric (Weyl), and anti-normal ordering for any two operators satisfying a canonical commutation relation. Because the s-ordering map can be viewed as producing a function of a complex variable, its inverse is a quantization map that takes such "classical" functions to quantum operators. The explicit s-ordered expressions are derived with the aid of a parametric family of Sheffer polynomial sequences (or equivalently an exponential Riordan array of polynomial coefficients), called the Hsu-Shiue family. To yield orderings interpolating between normal and anti-normal, this family is extended in an intricate way.</description>

Abstract: The orbital chromatic polynomial introduced by Cameron and Kayibi counts the number of proper $\lambda$-colorings of a graph modulo a group of symmetries. In this paper, we establish expansions for the orbital chromatic polynomial of the $n$-cycle for the group of rotations and its full automorphism group. As a side result, we obtain a new proof of Fermat's Little Theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.10423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining two classical notions in extremal combinatorics, the study of Ramsey-Tur\'an theory seeks to determine, for integers $m\le n$ and $p \leq q$, the number $\mathsf{RT}_p(n,K_q,m)$, which is the maximum size of an $n$-vertex $K_q$-free graph in which every set of at least $m$ vertices contains a $K_p$.
  Two major open problems in this area from the 80s ask: (1) whether the asymptotic extremal structure for the general case exhibits certain periodic behaviour, resembling that of the special case when $p=2$; (2) constructing analogues of Bollob\'as-Erd\H{o}s graphs with densities other than $1/2$.
  We refute the first conjecture by witnessing asymptotic extremal structures that are drastically different from the $p=2$ case, and address the second problem by constructing Bollob\'as-Erd\H{o}s-type graphs using high dimensional complex spheres with all rational densities. Some matching upper bounds are also provided.</description>

      <title>On the total Italian domination number in digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a finite simple digraph $D$ with vertex set $V(D)$. An Italian dominating function (IDF) on $D$ is a function $f:V(D)\rightarrow\{0,1,2\}$ satisfying every vertex $u$ with $f(u)=0$ has an in-neighbor $v$ with $f(v)=2$ or two in-neighbors $w$ and $z$ with $f(w)=f(z)=1$. A total Italian dominating function (TIDF) on $D$ is an IDF $f$ such that the subdigraph $D[\{ u\, |\, f(u)\ge 1\}]$ contains no isolated vertices. The weight $\omega(f)$ of a TIDF $f$ on $D$ is $\sum_{u\in V(D)}f(u)$. The total Italian domination number of $D$ is $\gamma_{tI}(D)=\min\{ \omega(f)\, |\, \mbox{$f$ is a TIDF on $D$}\}$.
  In this paper, we present bounds on $\gamma_{tI}(D)$, and investigate the relationship between several different domination parameters. In particular, we give the total Italian domination number of the Cartesian products $P_2\Box P_n$ and $P_3\Box P_n$, where $P_n$ represents a dipath with $n$ vertices.</description>

Abstract: The problem of the malicious ma\^{i}tre d' is introduced and solved by Peter Winkler in his book Mathematical Puzzles: A Connoisseur's Collection [1]. This problem is about a ma\^{i}tre d' seating diners around a table, trying to maximize the number of diners who don't get napkins. Along with this problem, Winkler introduces a variation called the adaptive ma\^{i}tre d' and presents a strategy. This problem was later investigated and a better strategy was discovered by Acton et al. [2]. We describe an even better strategy which we call ``long trap setting" and prove that it is optimal. We also derive a formula for the expected number of napkinless diners under our optimal strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are many similarities between the theories of matroids and $q$-matroids. However, when dealing with the direct sum of $q$-matroids many differences arise. Most notably, it has recently been shown that the direct sum of representable $q$-matroids is not necessarily representable. In this work, we focus on the direct sum of uniform $q$-matroids. Using algebraic and geometric tools, together with the notion of cyclic flats of $q$-matroids, we show that this is always representable, by providing a representation over a sufficiently large field.</description>

      <title>Spectral extrema of graphs with fixed size: forbidden a fan graph, friendship graph or theta graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the Brualdi-Hoffman-Tur\'an-type problem inquiries about the maximum spectral radius \( \lambda(G) \) of an \( F \)-free graph \( G \) with \( m \) edges. Let \( \theta_{1,p,q} \) denote the theta graph, which is constructed by connecting two vertices with 3 internally disjoint paths of lengths 1, \( p \), and \( q \) respectively. Let \( F_k \) be the fan graph, that is, the join of a \( K_1 \) and a path \( P_{k - 1} \). Let \( F_{k,3} \) be the friendship graph, obtained by having \( k \) triangles share a common vertex. In this paper, we utilize the \( k \)-core method and spectral techniques to address some spectral extrema of graphs with a fixed number of edges. Firstly, we demonstrate that for \( m \geqslant \frac{9}{4}k^6 + 6k^5 + 46k^4 + 56k^3 + 196k^2 \) and \( k \geqslant 3 \), if \( G \) is \( F_{2k + 2} \)-free, then \( \lambda(G) \leqslant \frac{k - 1 + \sqrt{4m - k^2 + 1}}{2} \). Equality holds if and only if \( G \cong K_k \vee (\frac{m}{k}-\frac{k - 1}{2})K_1 \). This validates a conjecture by Yu, Li, and Peng [Discrete Math. 348 (2025) 114391] and refines a recent result by Li, Zhai, and Shu [European J. Combin. 120 (2024) 103966]. Secondly, we show that for \( m \geqslant \frac{9}{4}k^6 + 6k^5 + 46k^4 + 56k^3 + 196k^2 \) with \( k \geqslant 3 \), if \( G \) is \( F_{k,3} \)-free and has \( m \) edges, then \( \lambda(G) \leqslant \frac{k - 1 + \sqrt{4m - k^2 + 1}}{2} \). Equality holds precisely when \( G \cong K_k \vee (\frac{m}{k}-\frac{k - 1}{2})K_1 \). This confirms a conjecture put forward by Li, Lu, and Peng [Discrete Math. 346(2023)113680]. Finally, we identify the \( \theta_{1,p,q} \)-free graph with \( m \) edges that possesses the largest spectral radius, where \( q \geqslant p \geqslant 3 \) and \( p + q \geqslant 2k + 1 \). A further research problem is also proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $k$-star is a complete bipartite graph $K_{1,k}$. A partial $k$-star design of order $n$ is a pair $(V,\mathcal{A})$ where $V$ is a set of $n$ vertices and $\mathcal{A}$ is a set of edge-disjoint $k$-stars whose vertex sets are subsets of $V$. If each edge of the complete graph with vertex set $V$ is in some star in $\mathcal{A}$, then $(V,\mathcal{A})$ is a (complete) $k$-star design. We say that $(V,\mathcal{A})$ is completable if there is a $k$-star design $(V,\mathcal{B})$ such that $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$. In this paper we determine, for all $k$ and $n$, the minimum number of stars in an uncompletable partial $k$-star design of order $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1970s, structural Ramsey theory emerged as a new branch of combinatorics. This development came with the isolation of the concepts of the $\mathbf{A}$-Ramsey property and Ramsey class. Following the influential Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\"odl theorem, several Ramsey classes have been identified. In the 1980s, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, inspired by a seminar of Lachlan, discovered a crucial connection between Ramsey classes and Fra\"iss\'e classes, and, in his 1989 paper, connected the classification programme of homogeneous structures to structural Ramsey theory. In 2005, Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'c revitalized the field by connecting Ramsey classes to topological dynamics. This breakthrough motivated Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il to propose a program for classifying Ramsey classes. We review the progress made on this program in the past two decades, list open problems, and discuss recent extensions to new areas, namely the extension property for partial automorphisms (EPPA), and big Ramsey structures.</description>

      <title>Solving tiling enumeration problems by tensor network contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17698v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for computing the contraction of two-dimensional tensor networks on a square lattice; and we combine it with solving congruence equations to compute the exact enumeration (including weighted enumeration) of Wang tilings. Based on this, the paper demonstrates how to transform other tiling enumeration problems (such as those of polyominoes) into Wang tiling enumeration problems, thereby solving them using this algorithm.
  Our algorithm extends the sequence length records for dozens of sequences defined by polyomino tiling enumeration on chessboards on the OEIS website, covering numerous of different polyomino sets, including I-polyominoes, tetrominoes, pentominoes, etc. This demonstrates the high efficiency and strong universality of the algorithm for solving exact tiling enumeration problems.
  In addition, the theory and techniques used in the algorithm establish a bridge between tensor network contractions and tiling enumeration, where the former provides a theoretical foundation for solving problems in the latter, while the latter offers an intuitive combinatorial interpretation of the former.</description>

      <title>On polynomially high-chromatic pure pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a forest. We study polynomially high-chromatic pure pairs in graphs with no $T$ as an induced subgraph ($T$-free graphs in other words), with applications to the polynomial Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture. In addition to reproving several known results in the literature, we deduce:
  $\bullet$ If $T=P_5$ is the five-vertex path, then every $T$-free graph $G$ with clique number $w\ge2$ contains a complete pair $(A,B)$ of induced subgraphs with $\chi(A)\ge w^{-d}\chi(G)$ and $\chi(B)\ge 2^{-d}\chi(G)$, for some universal $d\ge1$. The proof uses the recent Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal result for $P_5$-free graphs. Via the classical Gy\'arf\'as path argument, such a ``polynomial versus linear high-$\chi$ complete pairs'' result can be viewed as further supporting evidence for the polynomial Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture for $P_5$. In particular, it implies
  \[\chi(G)\le w^{O(\log w/\log\log w)}\]
  which asymptotically improves the bound $\chi(G)\le w^{\log w}$ of Scott, Seymour, and Spirkl.
  $\bullet$ If $T$ and a broom satisfy the polynomial Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture, then so does their disjoint union. Unifying earlier results of Chudnovsky, Scott, Seymour, and Spirkl, and of Scott, Seymour, and Spirkl, this gives new instances of $T$ for which the conjecture holds.</description>

      <title>Prefix-bounded matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By unifying various earlier extensions of alternating sign matrices (ASMs), we introduce the notion of prefix-bounded matrices (PBMs). It is shown that the convex hull of these matrices forms the intersection of two special generalized polymatroids. This implies $\unicode{x2013}$ in a more general form $\unicode{x2013}$ that the linear inequality system given by Behrend and Knight (2007) and by Striker (2007, 2009) for describing the polytope of alternating sign matrices is totally dual integral (TDI), confirming a recent conjecture of Edmonds (2024, 2025). By relying on the polymatroidal approach, we derive a characterization for the existence of prefix-bounded matrices meeting lower and upper bounds on their entries. Furthermore, we point out that the constraint matrix of the linear system describing the convex hull of PBMs, in particular ASMs, is a network matrix. This implies that (a) standard network-flow techniques can be used to manage algorithmically optimization and structural results on PBMs obtained via g-polymatroids, (b) the linear system is actually box-TDI, and (c) the convex hull of PBMs admits a sharpened form of the integer Carath\'eodory property, in particular, the integer decomposition property. This latter feature makes it possible to confirm an extended form of an elegant conjecture of Brualdi and Dahl (2023) on the decomposability of a so-called $k$-regular alternating sign matrix as the sum of $k$ pattern-disjoint ASMs.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of certain matroids by maximizing valuative invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Luis Ferroni and Alex Fink recently introduced a polytope of all unlabeled matroids of rank $r$ on $n$ elements, and they showed that the vertices of this polytope come from matroids that can be characterized by maximizing a sequence of valuative invariants. We prove that a number of the matroids that they conjectured to yield vertices indeed do (these include cycle matroids of complete graphs, projective geometries, and Dowling geometries), and we give additional examples (including truncations of cycle matroids of complete graphs, Bose-Burton geometries, and binary and free spikes with tips). We prove a special case of a conjecture of Ferroni and Fink by showing that direct sums of uniform matroids yield vertices of their polytope, and we prove a similar result for direct sums whose components are in certain restricted classes of extremal matroids.</description>

Abstract: The *somewhere-to-below shuffles* are the elements \[ t_{\ell} := \operatorname{cyc}_{\ell}+\operatorname{cyc}_{\ell,\ell+1}+\operatorname{cyc}_{\ell,\ell+1,\ell+2}+\cdots+\operatorname{cyc}_{\ell,\ell+1,\ldots,n} \] (for $\ell \in \{1,2,\dots,n\}$) in the group algebra $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$ of the $n$-th symmetric group $S_n$. Their linear combinations are called the *one-sided cycle shuffles*. We determine the eigenvalues of the action of any one-sided cycle shuffle on any Specht module $\mathcal{S}^{\lambda}$ of $S_n$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an equivariant version of the characteristic quasi-polynomials as the permutation characters on the complement of mod $q$ hyperplane arrangements. We prove that the permutation character is a quasi-polynomial in $q$, and show that it can be expressed by the sum of the induced characters of an equivariant version of the Ehrhart quasi-polynomials. Furthermore, we consider the case of the Coxeter arrangements, and compute in detail for type $A_\ell$.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly realize an internal action of the symplectic cactus group, recently defined by Halacheva for any complex, reductive, finite-dimensional Lie algebra, on crystals of Kashiwara-Nakashima tableaux. Our methods include a symplectic version of jeu de taquin due to Sheats and Lecouvey, symplectic reversal, and virtualization due to Baker. As an application, we define and study a symplectic version of the Berenstein-Kirillov group and show that it is a quotient of the symplectic cactus group. In addition two relations for symplectic Berenstein-Kirillov group are given that do not follow from the defining relations of the symplectic cactus group.</description>

We then prove that the marked Ex-functor can be used to compute the localization of a marked quasicategory satisfying our condition and that the appropriate (co)completeness properties of the quasicategory carry over to its localization.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles II: the dynamics of an aperiodic computer chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a new family $(\mathcal{T}_n)_{n\geq1}$ of aperiodic sets of Wang tiles and we describe the dynamical properties of the set $\Omega_n$ of valid configurations $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. The tiles can be defined as the different instances of a square-shaped computer chip whose inputs and outputs are 3-dimensional integer vectors. The family include the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles and gathers the hallmarks of other small aperiodic sets of Wang tiles. Notably, the tiles satisfy additive versions of equations verified by the Kari--Culik aperiodic sets of 14 and 13 Wang tiles. Also configurations in $\Omega_n$ are the codings of a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action on a 2-dimensional torus like the Jeandel--Rao aperiodic set of 11 Wang tiles. The family broadens the relation between quadratic integers and aperiodic tilings beyond the omnipresent golden ratio as the dynamics of $\Omega_n$ involves the positive root $\beta$ of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$, also known as the $n$-th metallic mean. We show the existence of an almost one-to-one factor map $\Omega_n\to\mathbb{T}^2$ which commutes with the shift action on $\Omega_n$ with horizontal and vertical translations by $\beta$ on $\mathbb{T}^2$. The factor map can be explicitly defined by the average of the top labels from the same row of tiles as in Kari and Culik examples. The proofs are based on the minimality of $\Omega_n$ (proved in a previous article) and a polygonal partition of $\mathbb{T}^2$ which we show is a Markov partition for the toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action. The partition and the sets of Wang tiles are symmetric which makes them, like Penrose tilings, worthy of investigation.</description>

Abstract: Heckman-Polychronakos operators form a prominent family of commuting differential-difference operators defined in terms of the Dunkl operators $\mathcal D_i$ as $\mathcal P_m= \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i \mathcal D_i)^m$. They have been known since 1990s in connection with trigonometric Calogero-Moser-Sutherland Hamiltonian and Jack symmetric polynomials. We explicitly compute the eigenvalues of these operators for symmetric and skew-symmetric eigenfunctions, as well as partial sums of eigenvalues for general polynomial eigenfunctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16305v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the following variant of the Gale-Berlekamp switching game. Let $P$ be a set of n noncollinear points in the plane, each of them having weight $+1$ or $-1$. At each step, we pick a line $\ell$ passing through at least two points of $P$, and switch the sign of every point $p \in P\cap\ell$. The objective is to maximize the total weight of the elements of $P$. We show that one can always achieve that this quantity is at least $n - o(n)$, as $n\rightarrow\infty$, and at least $n/3$, for every $n$. Moreover, these can be attained by a polynomial time algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite set $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$, the $h$-fold sumset is $hA :=\{x_1+\dots+x_h:x_i\in A\}$. We interpret the beginning of the sequence of sumset sizes $(|hA|)_{h=1}^\infty$ in terms of the successive $L^1$-minima of a lattice (specifically, the points in $\mathbb{Z}^{|A|}$ whose coordinates sum to 0 and which are perpendicular to $\langle a_1,\dots,a_{|A|}\rangle$). In particular, if $h_1,h_2$ are the first and second minima, and $1\le h&lt;h_1$, then $|hA|=\binom{h+|A|-1}{|A|-1}$, while if $h_1\le h &lt;h_2$, then $|hA|=\binom{h+|A|-1}{|A|-1}-\binom{h-h_1+|A|-1}{|A|-1}$. This explains the appearance of triangular numbers in the sequence of sumset sizes, an observation related to a recent experiment of Nathanson.</description>

      <title>Universal diameter bounds for random graphs with given degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, let $\mathrm{diam}(G)$ be the greatest distance between any two vertices of $G$ which lie in the same connected component, and let $\mathrm{diam}^+(G)$ be the greatest distance between any two vertices of $G$; so $\mathrm{diam}^+(G)=\infty$ if $G$ is not connected.
  Fix a sequence $(d_1,\ldots,d_n)$ of positive integers, and let $\mathbf{G}$ be a uniformly random connected simple graph with $V(\mathbf{G})=[n]:=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that $\mathrm{deg}_{\mathbf{G}}(v)=d_v$ for all $v \in [n]$. We show that, unless a $1-o(1)$ proportion of vertices have degree $2$, then $\mathbb{E}[\mathrm{diam}(\mathbf{G})]=O(\sqrt{n})$. It is not hard to see that this bound is best possible for general degree sequences (and in particular in the case of trees, in which $\sum_{v=1}^n d_v = 2(n-1)$). We also prove that this bound holds without the connectivity constraint. As a key input to the proofs, we show that graphs with minimum degree $3$ are with high probability connected and have logarithmic diameter: if $\min(d_1,\ldots,d_n) \ge 3$ then $\mathrm{diam}^+(\mathbf{G})=O_{\mathbb{P}}(\log n)$; this bound is also best possible.</description>

      <title>Delta-matroids and toric degenerations in OG(n,2n+1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an explicit, embedded degeneration of the general torus orbit closure in the maximal orthogonal Grassmannian OG(n,2n+1) into a union of Richardson varieties. In particular, we deduce a formula for the cohomology class of the torus orbit closure, as a sum of products of Schubert classes. The moment map images of the degenerate pieces are the base polytopes of their underlying delta-matroids, and give a polyhedral decomposition of the unit hypercube, which had previously been studied by Chen-Sanchez-Veliz-Ying.</description>

      <title>NP-Hardness and ETH-Based Inapproximability of Communication Complexity via Relaxed Interlacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that computing the deterministic communication complexity D(f) of a Boolean function is NP-hard in the standard protocol-tree model, answering, independently and concurrently with Hirahara-Llango-Loff (arXiv:2507.10426), a question first posed by Yao (1979). Our reduction builds and expands on a suite of structural "interlacing" lemmas introduced by Mackenzie and Saffidine (arXiv:2411.19003); these lemmas can be reused as black boxes in future lower-bound constructions.
  The instances produced by our reduction admit optimal protocols for self-similar constructions with strong structural properties, giving a flexible framework for the design of reductions showing NP-hardness of deciding the communication complexity of a Boolean matrix. This complements the work by Hirahara, Ilango, and Loff, which establishes NP-hardness in the same model via a different route; our analysis additionally yields reusable structural guarantees and underpins further consequences concerning inapproximability.
  Because the gadgets in our construction are self-similar, they can be recursively embedded. We sketch how this yields, under the Exponential-Time Hypothesis, an additive inapproximability gap that grows without bound. Furthermore we outline a route toward NP-hardness of approximating D(f) within a fixed constant additive error. Full details of the ETH-based inapproximability results will appear in a future version.
  Beyond settling the complexity of deterministic communication complexity itself, the modular framework we develop opens the door to a wider class of reductions and, we believe, will prove useful in tackling other long-standing questions in communication complexity.</description>

      <title>Extensive embeddings into Fra\"iss\'e structures and stationary weak independence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a Fra\"iss\'e structure (a countably infinite ultrahomogeneous structure). We call an embedding $f : A \to M$ extensive if each automorphism of its image extends to an automorphism of $M$, where the extension map respects composition, and we say that $M$ has extensible $\omega$-age if each substructure admits an extensive embedding into $M$.
  We investigate the relationship between the following two properties: the presence of a stationary weak independence relation (SWIR) on $M$, and extensibility of the $\omega$-age of $M$. We show that linearly ordered Fra\"iss\'e structures with a SWIR have extensible $\omega$-age, but also we give examples of Fra\"iss\'e structures where only one of the two properties holds. Finally, we consider whether a wide range of examples of Fra\"iss\'e structures have extensible $\omega$-age or a finite SWIR expansion, including all countably infinite ultrahomogeneous oriented graphs (with one exception).</description>

      <title>Thomason-Type Model Structures on Simplicial Complexes and Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the Matsushita model structure on loop graphs, which is right-transferred from the Kan-Quillen model structure on simplicial sets, factors through two other right-transferred model structures on simplicial complexes and reflexive graphs. We show that each Quillen adjunction between these right-transferred model categories is a Quillen equivalence. These model structures are analogous to the Thomason model structure on small categories, and we prove that they are all cofibrantly generated and proper. Furthermore we show that all cofibrant simplicial complexes are flag complexes, and all forests are cofibrant.</description>

      <title>The partition function and elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each $n\geq 1$, we express the partition function $p(n)$ as a CM trace on $X_0(6)$ of the discriminant $\Delta_n:=1-24n$ invariants of a weight 0 weak Maass function $P$ that records
  where CM elliptic curves sit on $X(1)$, together with their canonical first-order "CM tangent'', the diagonal local slope of the CM isogeny relation on $X(1)\times X(1)$. In this viewpoint, we obtain a formula for $p(n)\!\!\pmod{\ell},$ when $\ell$ is inert in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta_n}),$ as a Brandt-module pairing $\langle u_{\Delta_n},v_P\rangle$ that is assembled from oriented optimal embeddings of Eichler orders. For $\ell \in \{5, 7, 11\}$ and $j\geq 1$, we obtain a new proof of the Ramanujan congruences $$
  p(5^j n +\beta_5(j))\equiv 0\pmod{5^j}, $$ $$
  p(7^j n +\beta_7(j))\equiv 0\pmod{7^{ [ j/2]+1}}, $$ $$ p(11^jn+\beta_{11}(j))\equiv 0\pmod{11^j}, $$
  where $\beta_m(j)$ is the unique residue $0\le \beta&lt;m^j$ with $24\,\beta_m(j)\equiv 1\pmod{m^j}$. The key point is a "bonus valuation" that stems from the fact that the supersingular locus of $X_0(6)_{\mathbb{F}_{\ell}}$ lies over $\{0, 1728\}$ for $\ell \in \{5, 7, 11\}.$ This special property, combined with the uniform growth of the $\lambda$-adic valuations of the number of oriented optimal embeddings, explains these congruences. More generally, we give a portable genus 0 template showing that the Watson--Atkin $U_\ell$-contraction works uniformly for suitable traces of singular moduli for genus 0 modular curves with $\ell\nmid N.$</description>

      <title>Congruences modulo powers of $7$ for $k$-elongated plane partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The enumeration $d_k(n)$ of $k$-elongated plane partition diamonds has emerged as a generalization of the classical integer partition function $p(n)$. Congruences for $d_k(n)$ modulo certain powers of primes have been proven via elementary means and modular forms by many authors. Recently, Banerjee and Smoot established an infinite family of congruences for $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of 5. In this paper we have discovered an infinite congruence family for $d_3(n)$ and $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of 7.</description>
