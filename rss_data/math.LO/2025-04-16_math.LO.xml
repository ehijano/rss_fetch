      <title>The Internal Logic and Finite Colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe how finite colimits can be described using the internal lanuage, also known as the Mitchell-Benabou language, of a topos, provided the topos admits countably infinite colimits. This description is based on the set theoretic definitions of colimits and coequalisers, however the translation is not direct due to the differences between set theory and the internal language, these differences are described as internal versus external. Solutions to the hurdles which thus arise are given.</description>

      <title>Translating between NIP integral domains and topological fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that definable ring topologies on NIP fields are closely connected to NIP integral domains. More precisely, we show that up to elementary equivalence, any NIP topological field arises from an NIP integral domain. As an application, we prove several results about definable ring topologies on NIP fields, including the following. Let $K$ be an NIP field or expansion of a field. Let $\tau$ be a definable ring topology on $K$. Then $\tau$ is a field topology, and $\tau$ is locally bounded. If $K$ has characteristic $p$ or finite dp-rank, then $\tau$ is "generalized t-henselian" in the sense of Dittman, Walsberg, and Ye, meaning that the implicit function theorem holds for polynomials. If $K$ has finite dp-rank, then $\tau$ must be a topology of "finite breadth" (a $W_n$-topology). Using these techniques, we give some reformulations of the conjecture that NIP local rings are henselian.</description>

      <title>On the Weierstrass Preparation Theorem over General Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rings over which an analogue of the Weierstrass preparation theorem holds for power series. We show that a commutative ring $R$ admits a factorization of every power series in $R[[x]]$ as the product of a polynomial and a unit if and only if $R$ is isomorphic to a finite product of complete local principal ideal rings. We also characterize Noetherian rings $R$ for which this factorization holds under the weaker condition that the coefficients of the series generate the unit ideal: this occurs precisely when $R$ is isomorphic to a finite product of complete local Noetherian integral domains.
  Beyond this, we investigate the failure of Weierstrass-type preparation in finitely generated rings and prove a general transcendence result for zeros of $p$-adic power series, producing a large class of power series over number rings that cannot be written as a polynomial times a unit. Finally, we show that for a finitely generated infinite commutative ring $R$, the decision problem of determining whether an integer power series (with computable coefficients) factors as a polynomial times a unit in $R[[x]]$ is undecidable.</description>

      <title>A computable version of Hall's Harem Theorem and Geometric von Neumann Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.06304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a version of Hall's Harem Theorem where the matching realizes a function with some special properties of its cycles. Using this approach we also prove a new computable version of Hall's Harem theorem. We apply it to non-amenable computable coarse spaces.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic correspondence and analytic rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.14147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the algorithm MASSA which takes classical modal formulas in input, and, when successful, effectively generates: (a) (analytic) geometric rules of the labelled calculus G3K, and (b) cut-free derivations (of a certain `canonical' shape) of each given input formula in the geometric labelled calculus obtained by adding the rule in output to G3K. We show that MASSA successfully terminates whenever its input formula is a (definite) analytic inductive formula, in which case, the geometric axiom corresponding to the output rule is, modulo logical equivalence, the first-order correspondent of the input formula. In proving the correctness of MASSA, we also show that the algorithm for the elimination of second-order quantifiers SCAN is complete with respect to the class of inductive analytic formulas. Finally, we show how our algorithm can be extended to the class of inductive formulas and to modal logic with quantifiers.</description>

      <title>Towards a generic absoluteness theorem for Chang models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma^\infty$ be the set of all universally Baire sets of reals. Inspired by recent work of the second author and Nam Trang, we introduce a new technique for establishing generic absoluteness results for models containing $\Gamma^\infty$.
  Our main technical tool is an iteration that realizes $\Gamma^\infty$ as the sets of reals in a derived model of some iterate of $V$. We show, from a supercompact cardinal $\kappa$ and a proper class of Woodin cardinals, that whenever $g \subseteq Col(\omega, 2^{2^\kappa})$ is $V$-generic and $h$ is $V[g]$-generic for some poset $\mathbb{P}\in V[g]$, there is an elementary embedding $j: V\rightarrow M$ such that $j(\kappa)=\omega_1^{V[g*h]}$ and $L(\Gamma^\infty, \mathbb{R})$ as computed in $V[g*h]$ is a derived model of $M$ at $j(\kappa)$.
  As a corollary we obtain that $\mathsf{Sealing}$ holds in $V[g]$, which was previously demonstrated by Woodin using the stationary tower forcing. Also, using a theorem of Woodin, we conclude that the derived model of $V$ at $\kappa$ satisfies $\mathsf{AD}_{\mathbb{R}}+``\Theta$ is a regular cardinal".
  Inspired by core model induction, we introduce the definable powerset $\mathcal{A}^\infty$ of $\Gamma^\infty$ and use our derived model representation mentioned above to show that the theory of $L(\mathcal{A}^\infty)$ cannot be changed by forcing. Working in a different direction, we also show that the theory of $L(\Gamma^\infty, \mathbb{R})[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathcal{C}$ is the club filter on $\wp_{\omega_1}(\Gamma^\infty)$, cannot be changed by forcing. Proving the two aforementioned results is the first step towards showing that the theory of $L(Ord^\omega, \Gamma^\infty, \mathbb{R})([\mu_\alpha: \alpha\in Ord])$, where $\mu_\alpha$ is the club filter on $\wp_{\omega_1}(\alpha)$, cannot be changed by forcing.</description>
