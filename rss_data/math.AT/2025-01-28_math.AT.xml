      <title>Rational G-spectra for rank 2 toral groups of mixed type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit and calculable algebraic model for the block of rational G-spectra on full subgroups when G has identity component a 2-torus T, and component group of order 2 acting non-trivially on H_1(T). The example of particular interest is the normalizer of the maximal torus in U(2), which constitutes one of the most complicated blocks in the analysis of SU(3). This builds on the determination of subgroups up to conjugacy in arXiv 2501.06914</description>

      <title>Computing homology of $\mathbb{Z}_k$-complexes from their quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the question of how one can recover the homology of a simplicial complex $X$ equipped with a regular action of a finite group $G$ from the structure of its quotient space $X/G.$ Specifically, we describe a process for enriching the structure of the chain complex $C_\ast(X/G; \mathbb{F})$ using the data of a complex of groups, a framework developed by Bridson and Corsen for encoding the local structure of a group action. We interpret this data through the lens of matrix representations of the acting group, and combine this structure with the standard simplicial boundary matrices for $X/G$ to construct a surrogate chain complex. In the case $G = \mathbb{Z}_k,$ the group ring $\mathbb{F}G$ is commutative and matrices over $\mathbb{F}G$ admit a Smith normal form, allowing us to recover the homology of $G$ from this surrogate complex. This algebraic approach complements the geometric compression algorithm for equivariant simplicial complexes described by Carbone, Nanda, and Naqvi.</description>

      <title>The \v{C}ech homotopy groups of a shrinking wedge of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the \v{C}ech homotopy groups of the $m$-dimensional infinite earring space $\mathbb{E}_m$, i.e. a shrinking wedge of $m$-spheres. In particular, for all $n,m\geq 2$, we prove that $\check{\pi}_n(\mathbb{E}_m)$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of countable powers of homotopy groups of spheres: $\bigoplus_{1\leq j\leq \frac{n-1}{m-1}}\left(\pi_{n}(S^{mj-j+1})\right)^{\mathbb{N}}$. Equipped with this isomorphism and infinite-sum algebra, we also construct new elements of $\pi_n(\mathbb{E}_m)$ with a view toward characterizing the image of the canonical homomorphism $\Psi_{n}:\pi_n(\mathbb{E}_m)\to \check{\pi}_{n}(\mathbb{E}_m)$. We prove that $\Psi_{n}$ is a split epimorphism when $n\leq 2m-1$ and we identify a candidate for the image of $\Psi_n$ when $n&gt;2m-1$.</description>

      <title>Parametrized homotopic distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of parametrized homotopic distance, extending the classical notion of homotopic distance to the fibrewise setting. We establish that it corresponds to the fibrewise sectional category of a specific fibration and derive cohomological lower bounds and connectivity upper bounds under mild conditions. The behavior of parametrized homotopic distance under compositions and products of fibrewise maps is analyzed, along with a proof of a triangle inequality. For fibrewise H-spaces admitting a fibrewise division map, we show that their parametrized topological complexity equals their fibrewise unpointed Lusternik-Schnirelman category. Furthermore, we estimate the parametrized homotopic distance of fibre-preserving, fibrewise maps between fibrewise fibrations, in terms of the parametrized homotopic distance of the induced fibrewise maps between individual fibrewise fibres, as well as the fibrewise unpointed Lusternik-Schnirelman category of the base space. We also define and study a pointed version of parametrized homotopic distance, providing cohomological bounds and identifying conditions for equivalence with the unpointed version.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend McCarthy's stabilization construction to exact $\infty$-categories. This is achieved by constructing, for any functor from exact $\infty$-categories to a fixed stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{A}$, a coherent chain complex in $\mathcal{A}$ that is an immediate generalization of Mac Lane's cubical $Q$-complex computing the stable homology of abelian groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using methods of stable homotopy theory, the category of symmetric quasi-coherent sheaves associated with non-commutative graded algebras with extra symmetries is introduced and studied in this paper. It is shown to be a closed symmetric monoidal Grothendieck category with invertible generators. It is proven that the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a projective scheme is recovered out of symmetric quasi-coherent sheaves.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any base scheme $S$, real \'etale motivic (unstable) homotopy theory over $S$ coincides with unstable semialgebraic topology over $S$ (that is, sheaves of spaces on the real spectrum of $S$). Moreover we show that for pointed connected motivic spaces over $S$, the real \'etale motivic localization is given by smashing with the telescope of the map $\rho: S^0 \to {\mathbb G}_m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work we introduced the notion of binomial cup-one algebras, which are differential graded algebras endowed with Steenrod $\cup_1$-products and compatible binomial operations. In this paper we show that binomial cup-one algebras capture homotopy 1-type. In particular, given such an $R$-dga, $(A,d_A)$, defined over the ring $R=\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{F}_p$ (for $p$ a prime), with $H^0(A)=R$ and with $H^1(A)$ a finitely generated, free $R$-module, we show that $A$ admits a functorially defined 1-minimal model, $\rho\colon (\mathcal{M}(A),d)\to (A,d_A)$, which is unique up to isomorphism. Furthermore, we associate to this model a pronilpotent group, whose continuous cohomology is isomorphic to that of $\mathcal{M}(A)$. These constructions, which refine classical notions from rational homotopy theory, allow us to distinguish spaces with isomorphic torsion-free integral cohomology rings. Moreover, we show that there is an equivalence of categories between isomorphism classes of finitely-generated, torsion-free-nilpotent groups and isomorphism classes of finitely generated 1-minimal models over the integers.</description>

      <title>M\"obius Homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces and develops M\"obius homology, a homology theory for representations of finite posets into abelian categories. Although the connection between poset topology and M\"obius functions is classical, we go further by establishing a direct connection between poset topology and M\"obius inversions. In particular, we show that M\"obius homology categorifies the M\"obius inversion, as its Euler characteristic coincides with the M\"obius inversion applied to the dimension function of the representation. We also present a homological version of Rota's Galois Connection Theorem, relating the M\"obius homologies of two posets connected by a Galois connection.
  Our main application concerns persistent homology over general posets. We prove that, under a suitable definition, the persistence diagram arises as an Euler characteristic over a poset of intervals, and thus M\"obius homology provides a categorification of the persistence diagram. This furnishes a new invariant for persistent homology over arbitrary finite posets. Finally, leveraging our homological variant of Rota's Galois Connection Theorem, we establish several results about the persistence diagram.</description>

      <title>On the homotopy links of stratified cell complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homotopy links have proven to be one of the most powerful tools of stratified homotopy theory. In previous work, we described combinatorial models for the generalized homotopy links of a stratified simplicial set. For many purposes, in particular to investigate the stratified homotopy hypothesis, a more general version of this result pertaining to stratified cell complexes is needed. Here we prove that, given a stratified cell complex $X$, the generalized homotopy links can be computed in terms of certain subcomplexes of a subdivision of $X$. As a consequence, it follows that homotopy links map certain pushout diagrams of stratified cell complexes into homotopy pushout diagrams. This result is crucial to the development of (semi-)model structures for stratified homotopy theory in which geometric examples of stratified spaces, such as Whitney stratified spaces, are bifibrant.</description>

Abstract: This paper is part of a series of three articles with the objective of investigating a stratified version of the homotopy hypothesis in terms of semi-model structures that interact well with classical examples of stratified spaces, such as Whitney stratified spaces. To this end, we prove the existence of several combinatorial simplicial model structures in the combinatorial setting of stratified simplicial sets. One of these we show to be Quillen equivalent to the left Bousfield localization of the Joyal model structure that presents the $(\infty,1)$-category of layered $(\infty,1)$-categories, i.e., such $(\infty,1)$-categories in which every endomorphism is an isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Presenting the topological stratified homotopy hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with three different homotopy theories of stratified spaces: The one defined by Douteau and Henriques, the one defined by Haine, and the one defined by Nand-Lal. One of the central questions concerning these theories has been how precisely they connect with geometric and topological examples of stratified spaces, such as piecewise linear pseudomanifolds, Whitney stratified spaces, or more recently Ayala, Francis and Tanaka's conically smooth stratified spaces. More precisely, so far, it has been an open question whether there exist (semi-)model structures on stratified topological spaces that present these theories, in which such relevant examples of stratified spaces are bifibrant. Here, we prove an affirmative answer to this question. As a consequence, we obtain a model categorical interpretation of a stratified homotopy hypothesis. Specifically, we show that Lurie's stratified singular simplicial set functor induces a Quillen equivalence between the semimodel category of stratified topological spaces presenting Nand-Lal's homotopy theory of stratified spaces and the left Bousfield localization of the Joyal model structure that corresponds to such $\infty$-categories in which every endomorphism is an isomorphism. We then perform a detailed investigation of bifibrant objects in these model structures of stratified spaces, proving a series of detection criteria and illuminating the relationship to Quinn's homotopically stratified spaces.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the loop space cohomology we construct the secondary operations on the cohomology $H^*(X; \mathbb{Z}_p)$ to be a Hopf algebra for a simply connected space $X.$ The loop space cohomology ring $H^*(\Omega X; \mathbb{Z}_p)$ is calculated in terms of generators and relations. This answers to A. Borel's decomposition of a Hopf algebra into a tensor product of the monogenic ones in which the heights of generators are determined by means of the action of the primary and secondary cohomology operations on $H^*(X;\mathbb{Z}_p).$ An application for calculating of the loop space cohomology of the exceptional group $F_4$ is given.</description>

Abstract: A duoidal category is a category equipped with two monoidal structures in which one is (op)lax monoidal with respect to the other. In this paper we introduce duoidal $\infty$-categories which are counterparts of duoidal categories in the setting of $\infty$-categories. There are three kinds of functors between duoidal $\infty$-categories, which are called bilax, double lax, and double oplax monoidal functors. We make three formulations of $\infty$-categories of duoidal $\infty$-categories according to which functors we take. Furthermore, corresponding to the three kinds of functors, we define bimonoids, double monoids, and double comonoids in duoidal $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>Homological stability for generalized Hurwitz spaces and Selmer groups in quadratic twist families over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a version of the Bhargava-Kane-Lenstra-Poonen-Rains heuristics for Selmer groups of quadratic twist families of abelian varieties over global function fields. As a consequence, we derive a result towards the "minimalist conjecture" on Selmer ranks of abelian varieties in such families. More precisely, we show that the probabilities predicted in these two conjectures are correct to within an error term in the size of the constant field, $q$, which goes to $0$ as $q$ grows. Two key inputs are a new homological stability theorem for a generalized version of Hurwitz spaces parameterizing covers of punctured Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus, and an expression of average sizes of Selmer groups in terms of the number of rational points on these Hurwitz spaces over finite fields.</description>
