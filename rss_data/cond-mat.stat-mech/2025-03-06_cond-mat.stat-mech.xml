      <title>Configurational Information Measures, Phase Transitions, and an Upper Bound on Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Configurational entropy (CE) and configurational complexity (CC) are recently popularized information theoretic measures used to study the stability of solitons. This paper examines their behavior for 2D and 3D lattice Ising Models, where the quasi-stability of fluctuating domains is controlled by proximity to the critical temperature. Scaling analysis lends support to an unproven conjecture that these configurational information measures (CIMs) can detect (in)stability in field theories. The primary results herein are the derivation of a model dependent CC-CE relationship, as well as a model independent upper bound on CC. CIM phenomenology in the Ising universality class reveals multiple avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced cycles in the Togashi-Kaneko model with species-dependent degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-state Togashi-Kaneko model demonstrates how, at finite system sizes, autocatalysis can lead to noise-induced bistability between different molecular species. By allowing the export rates to be species-dependent, we find that the nascent stochastic switching between molecular species is coupled to periods of growth or decay in the system size, $N$, leading to a type of noise-induced cycle. Since there is no oscillatory behavior in the underlying deterministic dynamics, this behavior is distinct from other types of noisy cycle. By combining piecewise-deterministic-Markov and linear-noise approximations, we find analytic expressions for the stationary distributions of the different molecular species when stochastic switching is faster than molecular import or export. We envisage that other models in the voter class -- including spin systems, flocking and opinion dynamics -- will also exhibit noise-induced cycles, as well as be amenable to similar techniques.</description>

      <title>On the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking in liquid hydrogen peroxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular chirality is a key concept in chemistry with implications for the origin of life and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Simulations of a chiral molecular model with an energetic bias towards homochiral interactions show spontaneous symmetry breaking wherein the liquid separates into two phases, each enriched in one of the two enantiomers. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations of a geometrically similar model with a semi-empirical force field and no explicit bias towards homochiral interactions, in order to test the possible existence of this phenomenon in hydrogen peroxide, the smallest chiral molecule. For this purpose, we study the fluid phase of this substance between 100 K and 1500 K, and from $10^{-4}$ GPa to 1 GPa. We find a glass transition and we suggest that hydrogen bonds, captured by our force field, play a central role in such behavior. We also test the possibility of observing chiral symmetry breaking by performing both constant temperature and cooling simulations at multiple pressures, and we do not observe the phenomenon. An analysis of the structure of the liquid shows negligible differences between homochiral and heterochiral interactions, supporting the difficulty in observing chiral fluid-phase separation. If hydrogen peroxide manifests spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, it likely takes place significantly below room temperature and is hidden by other phenomena, such as the glass transition or crystallization. More broadly, our results, and recent experimental observations, suggest that greater molecular complexity is needed for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the liquid phase to occur.</description>

      <title>Interaction-correlated random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of random matrices where correlations between matrix elements are induced via interaction-derived Boltzmann factors. Varying these yields access to different ensembles. We find a universal scaling behavior of the finite-size statistics characterized by a heavy-tailed eigenvalue distribution whose extremes are governed by the Fr\'echet extreme value distribution for the case corresponding to a ferromagnetic Ising transition. The introduction of a finite density of nonlocal interactions restores standard random-matrix behavior. Suitably rescaled average extremes, playing a physical role as an order parameter, can thus discriminate aspects of the interaction structure; they also yield further nonuniversal information. In particular, the link between maximum eigenvalues and order parameters offers a potential route to resolving long-standing problems in statistical physics, such as deriving the exact magnetization scaling function in the two-dimensional Ising model at criticality.</description>

      <title>Theory of Cation Solvation in the Helmholtz Layer of Li-ion Battery Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solvation environments of Li$^+$ in conventional non-aqueous battery electrolytes, such as LiPF$_6$ in mixtures of ethylene carbaronate (EC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), are often used to rationalize the transport properties of electrolytes and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. In the SEI, the solvation environments in the compact electrical double layer (EDL) next to the electrode, also known as the Helmholtz layer, determine (partially) what species can react to form the SEI, with bulk solvation environments often being used as a proxy. Here we develop and test a theory of cation solvation in the Helmholtz layer of non-aqueous Li-ion battery electrolytes. First, we validate the theory against bulk and diffuse EDL atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of LiPF$_6$ EC/EMC mixtures as a function of surface charge, where we find the theory can capture the solvation environments well. Next we turn to the Helmholtz layer, where we find that the main effect of the solvation structures next to the electrode is an apparent reduction in the number of binding sites between Li$^+$ and the solvents, again where we find good agreement with our developed theory. Finally, by solving a simplified version of the theory, we find that the probability of Li$^+$ binding to each solvent remains equal to the bulk probability, suggesting that the bulk solvation environments are a reasonable place to start when understanding new battery electrolytes. Our developed formalism can be parameterized from bulk MD simulations and used to predict the solvation environments in the Helmholtz layer, which can be used to determine what could react and form the SEI.</description>

      <title>The cost of resetting discrete-time random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time continuous-space random walk, with a symmetric jump distribution, under stochastic resetting. Associated with the random walker are cost functions for jumps and resets, and we calculate the distribution of the total cost for the random walker up to the first passage to the target. By using the backward master equation approach we demonstrate that the distribution of the total cost up to the first passage to the target can be reduced to a Wiener-Hopf integral equation. The resulting integral equation can be exactly solved (in Laplace space) for arbitrary cost functions for the jump and selected functions for the reset cost. We show that the large cost behaviour is dominated by resetting or the jump distribution according to the choice of the jump distribution. In the important case of a Laplace jump distribution, which corresponds to run-and-tumble particle dynamics, and linear costs for jumps and resetting, the Wiener-Hopf equation simplifies to a differential equation which can easily be solved.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature quantum topological order in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a three-dimensional system that exhibits long-range entanglement at sufficiently small but nonzero temperature--it therefore constitutes a quantum topological order at finite temperature. The model of interest is known as the fermionic toric code, a variant of the usual 3D toric code, which admits emergent fermionic point-like excitations. The fermionic toric code, importantly, possesses an anomalous 2-form symmetry, associated with the space-like Wilson loops of the fermionic excitations. We argue that it is this symmetry that imbues low-temperature thermal states with a novel topological order and long-range entanglement. Based on the current classification of three-dimensional topological orders, we expect that the low-temperature thermal states of the fermionic toric code belong to an equilibrium phase of matter that only exists at nonzero temperatures. We conjecture that further examples of topological orders at nonzero temperatures are given by discrete gauge theories with anomalous 2-form symmetries. Our work therefore opens the door to studying quantum topological order at nonzero temperature in physically realistic dimensions.</description>

      <title>Self-sustained frictional cooling in active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooling processes in nature are typically generated by external contact with a cold reservoir or bath. According to the laws of thermodynamics, the final temperature of a system is determined by the temperature of the environment. Here, we report a spontaneous internal cooling phenomenon for active particles, occurring without external contact. This effect, termed ``self-sustained frictional cooling'', arises from the interplay between activity and dry (Coulomb) friction, and in addition is self-sustained from particles densely caged by their neighbors. If an active particle moves in its cage, dry friction will stop any further motion after a collision with a neighbor particle thus cooling the particle down to an extremely low temperature. We demonstrate and verify this self-sustained cooling through experiments and simulations on active granular robots and identify dense frictional arrested clusters coexisting with hot, dilute regions. Our findings offer potential applications in two-dimensional swarm robotics, where activity and dry friction can serve as externally tunable mechanisms to regulate the swarm's dynamical and structural properties.</description>

      <title>Hidden memory and stochastic fluctuations in science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the statistical laws governing citation dynamics remains a fundamental challenge in network theory and the science of science. Citation networks typically exhibit in-degree distributions well approximated by log-normal distributions, yet they also display power-law behaviour in the high-citation regime, presenting an apparent contradiction that lacks a unified explanation. Here, we identify a previously unrecognised phenomenon: the variance of the logarithm of citation counts per unit time follows a power law with respect to time since publication, scaling as $t^{H}$. This discovery introduces a new challenge while simultaneously offering a crucial clue to resolving this discrepancy. We develop a stochastic model in which latent attention to publications evolves through a memory-driven process incorporating cumulative advantage. This process is characterised by the Hurst parameter $H$, derived from fractional Brownian motion, and volatility. Our framework reconciles this contradiction by demonstrating that anti-persistent fluctuations ($H&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$) give rise to log-normal citation distributions, whereas persistent dynamics ($H&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}$) favour heavy-tailed power laws. Numerical simulations confirm our model's explanatory and predictive power, interpolating between log-normal and power-law distributions while reproducing the $t^{H}$ law. Empirical analysis of arXiv e-prints further supports our theory, revealing an intrinsically anti-persistent nature with an upper bound of approximately $H=0.13$. By linking memory effects and stochastic fluctuations to broader network dynamics, our findings provide a unifying framework for understanding the evolution of collective attention in science and other attention-driven processes.</description>

      <title>Unification of Stochastic and Quantum Thermodynamics in Scalar Field Theory via a Model with Brownian Thermostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic procedure to derive a quantum master equation for thermal relaxation in real scalar field theory, expanding on the method proposed in [Koide and Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A494, 129277 (2024)]. We begin by introducing a generalized model for a classical scalar field interacting with a Brownian thermostat, consistent with stochastic thermodynamics. Applying canonical quantization to this model, we derive the corresponding quantum master equation, that is applicable to any form of the scalar field Hamiltonian. While its evolution is generally non-CPTP (Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving), it can be adjusted to describe a CPTP evolution, such as those found in the GKSL (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation by appropriately tuning the parameters of the model. In this framework, we define heat, work, and entropy in a way that satisfies the first and second laws of quantum thermodynamics. This suggests that the quantum-classical correspondence extends beyond closed systems governed by unitary time evolution to open systems as well. We further investigate the relation between the second law in quantum thermodynamics and relative entropy, providing insights into the study of quantum fluctuations through information-theoretical techniques in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magic in Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum computing, non-stabilizerness -- the magic -- refers to the computational advantage of certain quantum states over classical computers and is an essential ingredient for universal quantum computation. Employing the second order stabilizer R\'enyi entropy to quantify magic, we study the production of magic states in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) via 2-to-2 scattering processes involving electrons and muons. Considering all 60 stabilizer initial states, which have zero magic, the angular dependence of magic produced in the final states is governed by only a few patterns, both in the non-relativistic and the ultra-relativistic limits. Some processes, such as the low-energy $e^-\mu^-\to e^-\mu^-$ and Bhabha scattering $e^-e^+\to e^-e^+$, do not generate magic at all. In most cases the largest magic generated is significantly less than the maximal possible value of $\log (16/7) \approx 0.827$. The only instance where QED is able to generate maximal magic is the low-energy $\mu^-\mu^+\to e^-e^+$, in the limit $m_e/m_\mu \to 0$, which is well approximated in nature. Our results suggest QED, although capable of producing maximally entangled states easily, may not be an efficient mechanism for generating quantum advantages.</description>

      <title>Universal law for the dispersal of motile microorganisms in porous media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dispersal is essential to the plethora of motile microorganisms living in porous environments, yet how it relates to movement patterns and pore space structure remains largely unknown. Here we investigate numerically the long-time dispersal of a run-and-tumble microorganism that remains trapped at solid surfaces and escapes from them by tumbling. We find that dispersal and mean run time are connected by a universal relation, that applies for a variety of porous microstructures and swimming strategies. We explain how this generic dependence originates in the invariance of the mean free path with respect to the movement pattern, and we discuss the optimal strategy that maximizes dispersal. Finally, we extend our approach to microorganisms moving along the surface. Our results provide a general framework to quantify dispersal that works across the vast diversity of movement patterns and porous media.</description>

      <title>Polydispersity-driven dynamical differences between two- and three-dimensional supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have suggested a conundrum in the relaxation dynamics of polydisperse supercooled liquids. It has been shown that in two dimensions, the relative relaxation times of particles of different sizes become more similar as the material is cooled, whereas the opposite happens in three dimensions: they decouple. Here we resolve this conundrum. First, we show that the coupling observed in two dimensions is an artifact of cage correction introduced to account for Mermin-Wagner fluctuations. Instead, the relative relaxation time of small and large particles in two dimensions remains constant or slightly decouples with temperature, as opposed to the substantial decoupling observed in three dimensions. Investigating these dimensional differences further, we find through mobile cluster analysis that small particles initiate relaxation in both dimensions. As the clusters grow larger, they remain dominated by small particles in three dimensions whereas in two cluster growth becomes particle-size agnostic. We explain these findings with a minimal model by studying the distributions of single-particle barrier heights in the system, showing there is a clear difference in the environments of small and large particles, depending on the dimensionality. These findings highlight the critical role of dimensionality in glass formation, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying the glass transition in polydisperse supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>Anti Kibble-Zurek behavior in the quantum XY spin-1/2 chain driven by correlated noisy magnetic field and anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the non-adiabatic dynamics across a quantum phase transition, the Kibble-Zurek paradigm describes that the average number of topological defects is suppressed as a universal power law with the quench time scale. A conflicting observation, which termed anti-Kibble-Zurek dynamics has been reported in several studies, specifically in the driven systems with an uncorrelated stochastic (white) noise. Here, we study the defect generation in the driven transverse field/anisotropy quantum $XY$ model in the presence of a correlated (colored) Gaussian noise. We propose a generic conjecture that properly capture the noise-induced excitation features, which shows good agreement with the numerical simulations. We show that, the dynamical features of defect density are modified by varying the noise correlation time. Our numerical simulations confirm that, for fast noises, the dynamics of the defect density is the same as that of the uncorrelated (white) noise, as is expected. However, the larger ratio of noise correlation time to the annealing time results in larger defects density formation and reforms the universal dynamical features. Our finding reveals that, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the annealing time for fast noises, while in the presence of the slow noises, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the square of the annealing time. The numerical simulations confirm that, the optimal annealing time, at which the defects density is minimum, scales linearly in logarithmic scale with the total noise power having different exponents for the fast and slow noises.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of a Rouse polymer in a fluctuating correlated medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the static and dynamical properties of a harmonically confined Rouse polymer coupled to a fluctuating correlated medium, which affect each other reciprocally during their stochastic evolution. The medium is modeled by a scalar Gaussian field $\phi(\mathbf{x},t)$, which can feature modes with slow relaxation and long-range spatial correlations. We show that these modes affect the long-time behavior of the center-of-mass position of the polymer, which, after a displacement, turns out to relax algebraically towards its equilibrium position. In contrast, we show that the coupling to the medium speeds up the relaxation of higher Rouse modes. We further characterize the typical size of the polymer as a function of its polymerization degree and of the correlation length of the medium, in particular when the system is driven out of equilibrium via the application of a constant external driving force. Finally, we study the response of a linear polymer to a tensile force acting on its terminal monomers.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation and scaling from noisy quenches across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.</description>

      <title>Estimating predictability of depinning dynamics by machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the future behaviour of complex systems exhibiting critical-like dynamics is often considered to be an intrinsically hard task. Here, we study the predictability of the depinning dynamics of elastic interfaces in random media driven by a slowly increasing external force, a paradigmatic complex system exhibiting critical avalanche dynamics linked to a continuous non-equilibrium depinning phase transition. To this end, we train a variety of machine learning models to infer the mapping from features of the initial relaxed line shape and the random pinning landscape to predict the sample-dependent staircase-like force-displacement curve that emerges from the depinning process. Even if for a given realization of the quenched random medium the dynamics are in principle deterministic, we find that there is an exponential decay of the predictability with the displacement of the line as it nears the depinning transition from below. Our analysis on how the related displacement scale depends on the system size and the dimensionality of the input descriptor reveals that the onset of the depinning phase transition gives rise to fundamental limits to predictability.</description>

      <title>Influence of Media Disorder on DNA Melting: A Monte Carlo Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the melting of a lattice DNA in the presence of atmospheric disorder, which mimics the crowded environment inside the cell nucleus, using Monte Carlo simulations. The disorder is modeled by randomly retaining lattice sites with probability $p$ while diluting the rest, rendering them unavailable to the DNA. By varying the disorder over a wide range from $p=1$ (zero disorder) up to the percolation critical point $p_c=0.3116$, we show the melting temperature $(T_m)$ to increase nearly linearly with disorder up to $p\approx 0.6$, while strong non-linearity enters for $p\lesssim 0.6$. Associated changes in the bubble statistics have been investigated, showing a substantial change in the bubble size exponents at corresponding melting points for $p\leq 0.5$. Based on these findings two distinct disorder regimes showing weak and strong effects on melting are identified. For simulations, we use the pruned and enriched Rosenbluth method in conjunction with a depth-first implementation of the Leath algorithm to generate the underlying disorder.</description>

      <title>Emptiness Instanton in Quantum Polytropic Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emptiness formation problem is addressed for a one-dimensional quantum polytropic gas characterized by an arbitrary polytropic index $\gamma$, which defines the equation of state $P \sim \rho^\gamma$, where $P$ is the pressure and $\rho$ is the density. The problem involves determining the probability of the spontaneous formation of an empty interval in the ground state of the gas. In the limit of a macroscopically large interval, this probability is dominated by an instanton configuration. By solving the hydrodynamic equations in imaginary time, we derive the analytic form of the emptiness instanton. This solution is expressed as an integral representation analogous to those used for correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory. Prominent features of the spatiotemporal profile of the instanton are obtained directly from this representation.</description>

      <title>Precision reconstruction of rational CFT from exact fixed point tensor network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18005v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The novel concept of entanglement renormalization and its corresponding tensor network renormalization technique have been highly successful in developing a controlled real space renormalization group (RG) scheme. Numerically approximate fixed-point (FP) tensors are widely used to extract the conformal data of the underlying conformal field theory (CFT) describing critical phenomena. In this paper, we present an explicit analytical construction of the FP tensor for 2D rational CFT. We define it as a correlation function between the "boundary-changing operators" (BCO) on triangles. Our construction fully captures all the real-space RG conditions. We also provide concrete examples, such as Ising, Yang-Lee and Tri-critical Ising models to compute the scaling dimensions explicitly based on the corresponding FP tensor. The BCO descendants turn out to be an optimal basis such that truncation in bond dimensions naturally produces comparable accuracies with the leading existing FP algorithms. Interestingly, our construction of FP tensors is closely related to a strange correlator, where the holographic picture naturally emerges. Our results also open a new door towards understanding CFT in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Metastability and time scales for parabolic equations with drift 2: the general time scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the elliptic operator given by \[ \mathscr{L}_\epsilon f=b\cdot\nabla f+\epsilon\Delta f \] for some smooth vector field $b:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, and the initial-valued problem on $\mathbb{R}^d$ \[ \left\{\begin{aligned}&amp;\partial_t u_\epsilon=\mathscr{L}_\epsilon u_\epsilon,\\ &amp;u_\epsilon(0,\,\cdot)=u_0(\cdot), \end{aligned} \right. \] for some bounded continuous function $u_0$. Under the hypothesis that the diffusion on $\mathbb{R}^d$ induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$ has a Gibbs invariant measure of the form $\exp \{-U(x)/\epsilon\}dx$ for some smooth Morse potential function $U$, we provide the complete characterization of the multi-scale behavior of the solution $u_\epsilon$ in the regime $\epsilon\to0$. More precisely, we find the critical time scales $1\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(1)}\ll\cdots\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(q)}$ as $\epsilon\to0$, and the kernels $R_t^{(p)}:M_0\times M_0\to\mathbb{R}_+$, where $M_0$ denotes the set of local minima of $U$, such that \[ \lim_{\epsilon\to0}u_\epsilon(t\theta_\epsilon^{(p)},\,x)=\sum_{m'\in M_0}R_t^{(p)}(m,\,m')u_0(m'), \] for all $t&gt;0$ and $x$ in the domain of attraction of $m$ for the dynamical system $\dot{x}(t)=b(x(t))$. We then complete the characterization of the solution $u_\epsilon$ by computing the exact asymptotic limit of the solution between time scales
  $\theta_\epsilon^{(p)}$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(p+1)}$ for each $p$, where $\theta_\epsilon^{(0)}=1$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(q+1)}=\infty$. Our proof relies on the full tree-structure characterization of the metastable behavior in different time-scales of the diffusion induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$. This result can be regarded as the precise refinement of Freidlin-Wentzell theory which was not known for more than a half century.</description>

      <title>Controlling nonergodicity in quantum many-body systems by reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods largely relied on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Driving with Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.</description>
