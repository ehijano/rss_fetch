      <title>Mamba-X: An End-to-End Vision Mamba Accelerator for Edge Computing Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have proven effective in language modeling but are limited by high computational and memory demands that grow quadratically with input sequence length. State space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative by reducing attention complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$ while also lowering overall memory consumption. Vision Mamba adapts the SSM approach for computer vision tasks, achieving lower latency and memory consumption than traditional transformer models. However, deploying Vision Mamba on edge devices is challenging due to its sequential scan operations, which hinder GPU efficiency. We propose Mamba-X, an end-to-end Vision Mamba accelerator that includes a systolic scan array to maximize parallelism and minimize memory traffic, along with a hybrid, hardware-friendly quantization technique to reduce memory usage and improve hardware efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Towards Memory Specialization: A Case for Long-Term and Short-Term RAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both SRAM and DRAM have stopped scaling: there is no technical roadmap to reduce their cost (per byte/GB). As a result, memory now dominates system cost. This paper argues for a paradigm shift from today's simple memory hierarchy toward specialized memory architectures that exploit application-specific access patterns. Rather than relying solely on traditional off-chip DRAM and on-chip SRAM, we envisage memory systems equipped with additional types of memory whose performance trade-offs benefit workloads through non-hierarchical optimization. We propose two new memory classes deserving explicit OS support: long-term RAM (LtRAM) optimized for read-intensive data with long lifetimes, and short-term RAM (StRAM) designed for transient, frequently-accessed data with short lifetimes. We explore underlying device technologies that could implement these classes, including their evolution and their potential integration into current system designs given emerging workload requirements. We identify critical research challenges to realize what we believe is a necessary evolution toward more efficient and scalable computing systems capable of meeting future demands.</description>

      <title>Morphlux: Programmable chip-to-chip photonic fabrics in multi-accelerator servers for ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We optically interconnect accelerator chips (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) within compute servers using newly viable programmable chip-to-chip photonic fabrics. In contrast, today, commercial multi-accelerator compute servers that are workhorses of ML, use electrical interconnects to network accelerator chips in the server. However, recent trends have shown an interconnect bandwidth wall caused by accelerator FLOPS scaling at a faster rate than the bandwidth of the interconnect between accelerators in the same server. This has led to under-utilization and idling of GPU resources in cloud datacenters. We develop Morphlux, a server-scale programmable photonic fabric, to interconnect accelerators within servers. We show that augmenting state-of-the-art photonic ML-centric datacenters with Morphlux can improve the bandwidth of tenant compute allocations by up to 66% and reduce compute fragmentation by up to 70%. We develop a novel end-to-end hardware prototype of Morphlux to demonstrate these performance benefits, which translate to 1.72x improvement in training throughput of ML models. By rapidly programming the server-scale fabric in our hardware testbed, Morphlux can logically replace a failed accelerator chip in 1.2 seconds.</description>

      <title>GainSight: A Unified Framework for Data Lifetime Profiling and Heterogeneous Memory Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14866v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI workloads drive increasing memory requirements, domain-specific accelerators need higher-density on-chip memory beyond what current SRAM scaling trends can provide. Simultaneously, the vast amounts of short-lived data in these workloads make SRAM overprovisioned in retention capability. To address this mismatch, we propose a wholesale shift from uniform SRAM arrays to heterogeneous on-chip memory, incorporating denser short-term RAM (StRAM) devices whose limited retention times align with transient data lifetimes. To facilitate this shift, we introduce GainSight, the first comprehensive, open-source framework that aligns dynamic, fine-grained workload lifetime profiles with memory device characteristics to enable generation of optimal StRAM memory compositions. GainSight combines retargetable profiling backends with an architecture-agnostic analytical frontend. The various backends capture cycle-accurate data lifetimes, while the frontend correlates workload patterns with StRAM retention properties to generate optimal memory compositions and project performance. GainSight elevates data lifetime to a first-class design consideration for next-generation AI accelerators, enabling systematic exploitation of data transience for improved on-chip memory density and efficiency. Applying GainSight to MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads reveals that 64.3% of first-level GPU cache accesses and 79.01% of systolic array scratchpad accesses exhibit sub-microsecond lifetimes suitable for high-density StRAM, with optimal heterogeneous on-chip memory compositions achieving up to 3x active energy and 4x area reductions compared to uniform SRAM hierarchies. To facilitate adoption and further research, GainSight is open-sourced at https://gainsight.stanford.edu/.</description>

      <title>WIP: Turning Fake Chips into Learning Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work-in-progress paper presents a case study in which counterfeit TL074 operational amplifiers, discovered in a junior level electronics course, became the basis for a hands on learning experience. Counterfeit integrated circuits (IC) are increasingly common, posing a significant threat to the integrity of undergraduate electronics laboratories. Instead of simply replacing the counterfeit components, we turned the issue into a teaching moment. Students engaged in hands-on diagnostics measuring current, analyzing waveforms, and troubleshooting. By working with fake chip components, they gained deeper insight into analog circuits, supply chain security, and practical engineering.</description>
