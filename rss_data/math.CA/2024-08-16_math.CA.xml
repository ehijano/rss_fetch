      <title>On the Hartree-Fock Eigenvalue Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using properties of harmonic functions in multidimensional space, we transform the Hartree-Fock eigenvalue problem into a more tractable eigenvalue problem in which the Laplacian is eliminated. This new formulation may facilitate the development of novel ways of finding approximate solutions of the electronic problem.</description>

      <title>The finite bivariate biorthogonal I -- Konhauser polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a finite set of biorthogonal polynomials in two variables is produced using Konhauser polynomials. Some properties containing operational and integral representation, Laplace transform, fractional calculus operators of this family are studied. Also, computing Fourier transform for the new set, a new family of biorthogonal functions are derived via Parseval's identity. On the other hand, this finite set is modified by adding two new parameters in order to have semigroup property and construct fractional calculus operators. Further, integral equation and integral operator are also derived for the modified version.</description>

      <title>Congruence Classes of Simplex Structures in Finite Field Vector Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem over finite fields. For a graph $G$, two embeddings $p, p': V(G) \to \mathbb{F}_q^d$ of a graph $G$ are congruent if for all edges $(v_i, v_j)$ of $G$ we have that $||p(v_i) - p(v_j)|| = ||p'(v_i) - p'(v_j)||$. What is the infimum of $s$ such that for any subset $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $|E| \gtrsim q^s$, $E$ contains a positive proportion of congruence classes of $G$ in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$? Bennett et al. and McDonald used group action methods to prove results in the case of $k$-simplices. The work of Iosevich, Jardine, and McDonald as well as that of Bright et al. have proved results in the case of trees and trees of simplices, utilizing the inductive nature of these graphs.
  Recently, Aksoy, Iosevich, and McDonald combined these two approaches to obtain nontrivial bounds on the "bowtie" graph, two triangles joined at a vertex. Their proof relies on an application of the Hadamard three-lines theorem to pass to a different graph. We develop novel geometric techniques called branch shifting and simplex unbalancing to reduce our analysis of trees of simplices to a much smaller class of simplex structures. This allows us to establish a framework that handles a wide class of graphs exhibiting a combination of rigid and loose behavior. In $\mathbb{F}_q^2$, this approach gives new nontrivial bounds on chains and trees of simplices. In $\mathbb{F}_q^d$, we improve on the results of Bright et al. in many cases and generalize their work to a wider class of simplex trees. We discuss partial progress on how this framework can be extended to more general simplex structures, such as cycles of simplices and structures of simplices glued together along an edge or a face.</description>

      <title>On Polynomial Carleson operators along quadratic hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a maximally modulated singular oscillatory integral operator along a hypersurface defined by $(y,Q(y))\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, for an arbitrary non-degenerate quadratic form $Q$, admits an a priori bound on $L^p$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, for each $n \geq 2$. This operator takes the form of a polynomial Carleson operator of Radon-type, in which the maximally modulated phases lie in the real span of $\{p_2,\ldots,p_d\}$ for any set of fixed real-valued polynomials $p_j$ such that $p_j$ is homogeneous of degree $j$, and $p_2$ is not a multiple of $Q(y)$. The general method developed in this work applies to quadratic forms of arbitrary signature, while previous work considered only the special positive definite case $Q(y)=|y|^2$.</description>

      <title>Convergence from the discrete to the continuous non-linear Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we study the convergence from the discrete to the continuous non-linear Fourier transform. Relations between spectral problems and questions in complex function theory provide a new approach to the study of scattering problems and the non-linear Fourier transform \cite{Scatter}. In particular, the non-linear Fourier transform can be viewed from the perspective of spectral problems for differential operators. Results in \cite{MP, PZ} can be seen as results for the non-linear Fourier transform. These results are similar to some convergence problems for the discrete non-linear Fourier transform considered in \cite{T} and \cite{TT}.</description>

      <title>On the Laplace-type transform and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make use of the Laplace transform and gamma function to construct a new integral transform having the property of mapping a derivative to the backward difference, whence we derive a method for solving difference equations and, relying on classical orthogonal polynomials, for obtaining combinatorial identities. A table of some basic functions is given in the Appendix.</description>

      <title>On the distance problem over finite p-adic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distance problem in the setting of finite p-adic rings. In odd dimensions, our results are essentially sharp. In even dimensions, we clarify the conjecture and provide examples to support it. Surprisingly, compared to the finite field case, in this setting, we are able to provide a large family of sets such that the distance conjecture holds. By developing new restriction type estimates associated to circles and orbits, with a group theoretic argument, we will prove the $4/3$-parallel result in the two dimensions. This answers a question raised by Alex Iosevich. In a more general scenario, the existence/distribution of geometric/graph configurations will be also considered in this paper. Our results present improvements and extensions of recent results due to Ben Lichtin (2019, 2023). In comparison with Lichtin's method, our approach is much simpler and flexible, which is also one of the novelties in this paper.</description>

      <title>Functional inequalities in the framework of Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quadrilateral inequality established by C. Sch\"otz in the context of Hilbert spaces is extended to the framework of Banach spaces. Our approach is based on the majorization theory and a substitute for the parallelogram law associated with Clarkson's notion of von Neumann-Jordan constant. As a by-product, several functional inequalities that extend classical inequalities from linear algebra and geometry of Banach spaces are also obtained.</description>
