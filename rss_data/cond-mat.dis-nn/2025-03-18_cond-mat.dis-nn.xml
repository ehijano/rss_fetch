      <title>Constructing the low-temperature phase diagram for the $2+p$-quantum spin glass using the nonperturbative renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use a nonperturbative renormalization group approach to construct the dynamical phase space of a quantum spin glass in the large $N$ limit. The disordered Hamiltonian is of ``$2 + p$" type, and we perform a coarse-graining procedure over the Wigner spectrum for the matrix-like disorder. The phase space reconstruction relies on phase transitions derived from the Luttinger-Ward functional, which accounts for interactions that are forbidden by perturbation theory. Various phases are identified, characterized by large correlations between replicas and/or the breaking of time translation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Effects of Disorder on the Energy Landscape and Motional Mechanisms Involved in Lithium Ion Dynamics and Transport in Solid Electrolytes: Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 Argyrodite as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 7Li NMR diffusometry and relaxometry are combined with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to compare the mechanisms for the dynamics and transport of lithium ions in disordered and crystalline electrolytes with argyrodite composition Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5. The dc conductivity of a disordered sample prepared by ball milling amounts to 0.76 mScm-1 at room temperature, which is substantially lower than that of two previously studied crystalline argyrodites differing in the order of the anion sublattice due to various heat treatments. However, the activation energy of the dc conductivity is smaller for ball-milled disordered Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 (E_dc= 0.35 eV) than for both crystalline compounds (E_dc= 0.38 eV). 7Li NMR field-gradient measurements of the self-diffusion coefficient D and its activation energy E_D confirm these findings and, furthermore, reveal different Haven ratios. 7Li NMR field-cycling relaxometry shows that the lithium ion jumps in ball-milled Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 are described by very broad dynamical susceptibilities arising from a temperature-independent Gaussian-like distribution of activation energies g(E_a) with a mean value of E_m= 0.43 eV, while the susceptibilities indicated a high-energy cutoff for the crystalline electrolytes. Based on different relations between the activation energies for the conductivity, diffusivity and jumps, we discuss that the shape and exploration of the energy landscapes of ball-milled and crystalline Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 samples strongly differ. Moreover, significant differences in the preexponential factor of the dc conductivity, the Haven ratio and the single-particle correlation factor point to distinct types of anion lattice disorder of the ball-milled disordered and heat-treated crystalline samples.</description>

      <title>Tunable resonant s-p mixing of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitonic states of tightly-bound electron-hole pairs dominate the optical response in a growing class of two-dimensional (2D) materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) a useful guidance for the excitonic spectrum is the analogy with the states in the 2D hydrogen atom. From our symmetry analysis and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equations we find a much richer picture for excitons and predict their tunable resonant s-p mixing. The resonance is attained when the subband splitting matches the energy difference between the 1s and 2p+ (or 2p-) excitons, resulting in the anticrossing of the spectral lines in the absorption as a function of the subband splitting. By focusing on TMDs modified by magnetic proximity, and gated 3R-stacked bilayer TMD, we corroborate the feasibility of such tunable spin splitting. The resulting tunable and bright s-p excitons provide unexplored opportunities for their manipulation and enable optical detection of Rashba or interlayer coupling in vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <title>qReduMIS: A Quantum-Informed Reduction Algorithm for the Maximum Independent Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a quantum-informed reduction algorithm for the maximum independent set problem that integrates classical kernelization techniques with information extracted from quantum devices. Our larger framework consists of dedicated application, algorithm, and hardware layers, and easily generalizes to the maximum weight independent set problem. In this hybrid quantum-classical framework, which we call qReduMIS, the quantum computer is used as a co-processor to inform classical reduction logic about frozen vertices that are likely (or unlikely) to be in large independent sets, thereby opening up the reduction space after removal of targeted subgraphs. We systematically assess the performance of qReduMIS based on experiments with up to 231 qubits run on Rydberg quantum hardware available through Amazon Braket. Our experiments show that qReduMIS can help address fundamental performance limitations faced by a broad set of (quantum) solvers including Rydberg quantum devices. We outline implementations of qReduMIS with alternative platforms, such as superconducting qubits or trapped ions, and we discuss potential future extensions.</description>

      <title>Revealing Nanostructures in High-Entropy Alloys via Machine-Learning Accelerated Scalable Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale simulations are a powerful tool for understanding material behavior and designing new materials. However, the computational limitations of atomistic-scale simulations stemming from constraints in computational power, algorithmic efficiency, and accuracy, prevent us from modeling large systems, even at ground state,(DFT)-level precision. Here, we introduce an efficient and Scalable Monte Carlo (SMC) method that overcomes the parallelization bottlenecks inherent in conventional MC simulation algorithms, reducing the computational complexity of an MC sweep from cubic to linear. Leveraging the large degree of parallelization inherent in our method, we present a GPU accelerated implementation, SMC_GPU, which enables the simulation of atomistic systems exceeding one billion atoms while maintaining the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT). Using this unprecedented capability, we perform large-scale thermodynamic simulations to investigate the microstructure evolution in the FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW high entropy alloys (HEAs). Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanoscale phenomena, including short-range and long-range order, nanoparticles, and nanophases. The size, composition, and morphology of these nanostructures, which can comprise millions of atoms and thus present significant challenges for traditional methods, are analyzed with high-accuracy atomistic simulations for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Our simulations produce thermodynamic properties and nanostructures that align well with available theoretical and experimental data. More intriguingly, our results reveal that the intricate nanoscale interplay of order and disorder in HEA stems from the combined effects of chemical complexity and temperature. This work underscores the promising potential of large-scale MC simulation for HEAs.let alone at finite temperatures, with density functional theory</description>

      <title>Echo state property and memory capacity of artificial spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing by using artificial spin ice (ASI) has been proposed on the basis of both numerical and experimental analyses. ASI is a many-body system consisting of ferromagnets with various interactions. Recently, fabricating magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) as ferromagnets in an ASI was achieved in the experiment, which enables an electrical detection of magnetic state of each MTJ independently. However, performing a recognition task of time-dependent signal by such an MTJ-based ASI has not been reported yet. In this work, we examine numerical simulation of a recognition task of time-dependent input and evaluate short-term memory and parity-check capacities. These capacities change significantly when the magnitude of the input magnetic field is comparable to a value around which the magnetization alignment is greatly affected by the dipole interaction. It implies that the presence of the dipole interaction results in a loss of echo state property. This point was clarified by evaluating Lyapunov exponent and confirming that the drastic change of the memory capacities appears near the boundary between negative and zero exponents, which corresponds to the edge of echo state property.</description>

      <title>From time crystals to time quasicrystals: Exploring novel phases in transverse field Ising chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time crystals (TCs) and time quasicrystals (TQCs) represent novel phases of matter that arise from the breaking of time translational symmetry in periodically and quasiperiodically driven quantum systems. In this study, we explore the formation of a TQC phase within the disordered quantum Ising chain model under a transverse field (ITF). Notably, TQCs demonstrate robust subharmonic responses at multiple incommensurate frequencies, unlike traditional TCs which respond at a single frequency. Our analysis reveals that the TQC phase exhibits stable magnetization responses even in the presence of interaction perturbations and imperfections in the quasiperiodic driving fields. Employing exact diagonalization techniques, we find that increasing the chain length further stabilizes both TC and TQC phases. These results suggest promising pathways for experimental realization of TQCs in cold atomic systems and quantum simulators, opening avenues for deeper investigation into these intriguing dynamical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Crisis in time-dependent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many dynamical systems operate in a fluctuating environment. However, even in low-dimensional setups, transitions and bifurcations have not yet been fully understood. In this Letter we focus on crises, a sudden flooding of the phase space due to the crossing of the boundary of the basin of attraction. We find that crises occur also in non-autonomous systems although the underlying mechanism is more complex. We show that in the vicinity of the transition, the escape probability scales as $\exp[-\alpha (\ln \delta)^2]$, where $\delta$ is the distance from the critical point, while $\alpha$ is a model-dependent parameter. This prediction is tested and verified in a few different systems, including the Kuramoto model with inertia, where the crisis controls the loss of stability of a chimera state.</description>

Abstract: Analytical relations for the glass transition temperature, $T_g$, and the crystal melting temperature, $T_m$, are developed on the basis of nonaffine lattice dynamics. The proposed relations explain: (i) the seemingly universal factor of $\approx 2/3$ difference between glass transition temperature and melting temperature of the corresponding crystal, and (ii) the recent empirical discovery that both $T_g$ and $T_m$ are proportional to the liquid fragility $m$ divided by the thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha$ of the solid.</description>

      <title>Assessment of spectral phases of non-Hermitian quantum systems through complex and singular values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic behavior or lack thereof in non-Hermitian systems is often diagnosed via spectral analysis of associated complex eigenvalues. Very recently, singular values of the associated non-Hermitian systems have been proposed as an effective measure to study dissipative quantum chaos. Motivated by the rich properties of non-Hermitian power-law banded random matrices and its promise as a platform to study localized and delocalized phases in non-Hermitian systems, we make an in-depth study to assess different spectral phases of these matrices through the lens of both complex eigenvalues and singular values. Remarkably, the results from complex spectra and singular value analysis are seemingly different, thereby necessitating caution while identifying different phases. We also exemplify our findings by studying a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with a complex on-site disorder. Our work indicates that systems, where disorder is present both in the Hermitian and non-Hermitian segments of a Hamiltonian, are sensitive to the specific diagnostic tool that needs to be employed to study quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Identifying the impact of local connectivity patterns on dynamics in excitatory-inhibitory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons form a canonical circuit in the brain. Seminal theoretical results on dynamics of such networks are based on the assumption that synaptic strengths depend on the type of neurons they connect, but are otherwise statistically independent. Recent synaptic physiology datasets however highlight the prominence of specific connectivity patterns that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections. While decades of influential research have demonstrated the strong role of the basic EI cell type structure, to which extent additional connectivity features influence dynamics remains to be fully determined. Here we examine the effects of pairwise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in EI networks using an analytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank structures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation of the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix and predicts the impact on responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions with cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of connectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes than other pairwise motifs. An overrepresentation of chain motifs induces a strong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical excitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs, we show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses where an increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity due to the recurrent feedback. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of experiments in which responses to optogenetic perturbations are measured and used to infer the dynamical regime of cortical circuits.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a quantum many-body state, while simultaneously engineering long-range entanglement for its remaining constituents. Though this two-fold character of measurements in open quantum systems has been appreciated for entangled state preparation, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for regarding symmetry as an organizing principle. Here we discuss the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric and magnetic vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class $D$ at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, with target space $SO(2N)/U(N)$, established as a Born-measurement version of the Cho-Fisher model. An explicit breaking of the self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or non-interacting coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both of which are related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits and are described by non-unitary conformal field theories of non-interacting fermions, as is the self-dual point. Using numerical approaches combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</description>

      <title>Probing Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic intra-cell coupling disorder in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</description>
