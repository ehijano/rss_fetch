      <title>Dependence of convective precipitation extremes on near-surface relative humidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitation extremes produced by convection have been found to intensify with near-surface temperatures at a Clausius-Clapeyron rate of $6$ to $7\%$ K$^{-1}$ in simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE). However, these idealized simulations are typically performed over an ocean surface with a high near-surface relative humidity (RH) that stays roughly constant with warming. Over land, near-surface RH is lower than over ocean and is projected to decrease by global climate models. Here, we investigate the dependence of precipitation extremes on near-surface RH in convection-resolving simulations of RCE. We reduce near-surface RH by increasing surface evaporative resistance while holding free-tropospheric temperatures fixed by increasing surface temperature. This ``top-down'' approach produces an RCE state with a deeper, drier boundary layer, which weakens convective precipitation extremes in three distinct ways. First, the lifted condensation level is higher, leading to a small thermodynamic weakening of precipitation extremes. Second, the higher lifted condensation level also reduces positive buoyancy in the lower troposphere, leading to a dynamic weakening of precipitation extremes. Third, precipitation re-evaporates more readily when falling through a deeper, drier boundary layer, leading to a substantial decrease in precipitation efficiency. These three effects all follow from changes in near-surface relative humidity and are physically distinct from the mechanism that underpins the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling rate. Overall, our results suggest that changes in relative humidity must be taken into account when seeking to understand and predict changes in convective precipitation extremes over land.</description>

      <title>Rapid Climate Model Downscaling to Assess Risk of Extreme Rainfall in Bangladesh in a Warming Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As climate change drives an increase in global extremes, it is critical for Bangladesh, a nation highly vulnerable to these impacts, to assess future risks for effective adaptation and mitigation planning. Downscaling coarse-resolution climate models to finer scales is essential for accurately evaluating the risk of extremes. In this study, we apply our downscaling method, which integrates data, physics, and machine learning, to quantify the risks of extreme precipitation in Bangladesh. The proposed approach successfully captures the observed spatial patterns and risks of extreme rainfall in the current climate while generating risk and uncertainty estimates by efficiently downscaling multiple models under future climate scenarios. Our findings project that the risk of extreme rainfall rises across the country, with the most significant increases in the northeastern hilly and southeastern coastal areas. Projections show that the daily maximum rainfall for a 100-year return period could increase by approximately 50 mm/day by mid-century and around 100 mm/day by the end of the century. However, substantial uncertainties remain due to variations across multiple climate models and scenarios.</description>

      <title>TSformer: A Non-autoregressive Spatial-temporal Transformers for 30-day Ocean Eddy-Resolving Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean forecasting is critical for various applications and is essential for understanding air-sea interactions, which contribute to mitigating the impacts of extreme events. State-of-the-art ocean numerical forecasting systems can offer lead times of up to 10 days with a spatial resolution of 10 kilometers, although they are computationally expensive. While data-driven forecasting models have demonstrated considerable potential and speed, they often primarily focus on spatial variations while neglecting temporal dynamics. This paper presents TSformer, a novel non-autoregressive spatiotemporal transformer designed for medium-range ocean eddy-resolving forecasting, enabling forecasts of up to 30 days in advance. We introduce an innovative hierarchical U-Net encoder-decoder architecture based on 3D Swin Transformer blocks, which extends the scope of local attention computation from spatial to spatiotemporal contexts to reduce accumulation errors. TSformer is trained on 28 years of homogeneous, high-dimensional 3D ocean reanalysis datasets, supplemented by three 2D remote sensing datasets for surface forcing. Based on the near-real-time operational forecast results from 2023, comparative performance assessments against in situ profiles and satellite observation data indicate that, TSformer exhibits forecast performance comparable to leading numerical ocean forecasting models while being orders of magnitude faster. Unlike autoregressive models, TSformer maintains 3D consistency in physical motion, ensuring long-term coherence and stability in extended forecasts. Furthermore, the TSformer model, which incorporates surface auxiliary observational data, effectively simulates the vertical cooling and mixing effects induced by Super Typhoon Saola.</description>

      <title>Structured pathways in the turbulence organizing recent oil spill events in the Eastern Mediterranean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chaotic nature of ocean motion is a major challenge that hinders the discovery of spatio-temporal current routes that govern the transport of material. Certain material, such as oil spills, pose significant environmental threats and these are enhanced by the fact that they evolve in a chaotic sea, in a way which still nowadays is far from being systematically anticipated. Recently such an oil spill event has affected the Mediterranean coast of several Middle Eastern countries. No accidents were reported for these spills previous to their arrival at the coast, and therefore there was no hint of their origin. Modelling such an event, in which uncertainties are increased due to the lack of information on where and when the spills was produced, stretches available technologies to their limits, and requires the use of novel ideas that help to understand the essential features of oil and tar transport by ocean currents. In this regard Lagrangian Coherent Structures enable us to find order within ocean chaos and provide powerful insights into chaotic events and their relationships over different locations and times like the one addressed. Using the observed locations of the oil impacting the coast at specific times, we seek to determine its original location and the time it was released in the open ocean. We have determined both using a combination of earlier satellite observations and computational modelling of the time evolution. The observed agreement between modeled cases and satellite observations highlights the power of these ideas.</description>

      <title>Mixing and Geometry in the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical motions across the ocean are central to processes, like CO$_2$ fixation, heat removal or pollutant transport, which are essential to the Earth's climate. This work explores 3D conveyor routes {associated with} the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Our findings show the geometry of mixing structures in the upper and deep ocean layers by means of Lagrangian Coherent Structures. This tool identifies among others, zones linked to vertical transport and characterizes vertical transport time scales. We focus the study in two regions. The first one is the Flemish Cap region, a zone of interaction between the major AMOC components, where our analysis identifies a domain of deep waters that ascend very rapidly to the ocean surface. The second one is the Irminger Sea, where our analysis confirms the existence of a downwelling zone, and reveals a previously unreported upwelling connection between very deep waters and the ocean surface.</description>

      <title>Examining Entropic Unbalanced Optimal Transport and Sinkhorn Divergences for Spatial Forecast Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An optimal transport (OT) problem seeks to find the cheapest mapping between two distributions with equal total density, given the cost of transporting density from one place to another. Unbalanced OT allows for different total density in each distribution. This is the typical setting for precipitation forecast and observation data, when considering the densities as accumulated rainfall, or intensity. In this work, entropic unbalanced OT and its associated Sinkhorn divergence are examined as a spatial forecast verification method for precipitation data. It offers many attractive features, such as morphing one field into another, defining a distance between fields and providing feature based optimal assignment. It is found that the Sinkhorn divergence is robust against the common double penalty problem (a form of phase error), aligns with expert assessments of model performance, and allows for a variety of novel pictorial illustrations of error. It provides informative summary scores, and has few limitations to its application. Combined, these findings place unbalanced entropy regularised optimal transport and the Sinkhorn divergence as an informative method which follows geometric intuition.</description>

      <title>Paraformer: Parameterization of Sub-grid Scale Processes Using Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the major sources of uncertainty in the current generation of Global Climate Models (GCMs) is the representation of sub-grid scale physical processes. Over the years, a series of deep-learning-based parameterization schemes have been developed and tested on both idealized and real-geography GCMs. However, datasets on which previous deep-learning models were trained either contain limited variables or have low spatial-temporal coverage, which can not fully simulate the parameterization process. Additionally, these schemes rely on classical architectures while the latest attention mechanism used in Transformer models remains unexplored in this field. In this paper, we propose Paraformer, a "memory-aware" Transformer-based model on ClimSim, the largest dataset ever created for climate parameterization. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model successfully captures the complex non-linear dependencies in the sub-grid scale variables and outperforms classical deep-learning architectures. This work highlights the applicability of the attenuation mechanism in this field and provides valuable insights for developing future deep-learning-based climate parameterization schemes.</description>

      <title>Building transport models from baroclinic wave experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study baroclinic waves both from the experimental and the theoretical perspective. We obtain data from a rotating annulus experiment capable of producing a series of baroclinic eddies similar to those found in the mid-latitude atmosphere. We analyze the experimental outputs using two methods. First, we apply a technique that involves filtering data using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis, which is applied to both velocity and surface temperature fields. The second method relies on the construction of a simple kinematic model based on key parameters derived from the experimental data. To analyze eddy-driven fluid transport, we apply the method of Lagrangian descriptors to the underlying velocity field, revealing the attracting material curves that act as transport barriers in the system. These structures effectively capture the essential characteristics of the baroclinic flow and the associated transport phenomena. Our results show that these barriers are in good agreement with the transport patterns observed in the rotating annulus experiment. In particular, we observe that the structures obtained from the kinematic model, or the one derived in terms of filtered velocities, perform well in this regard.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report room temperature heterodyne detection of a quantum cascade laser beaten with a local oscillator on a unipolar quantum photodetector in two different atmospheric windows, at 4.8 $\mu$m and 9 $\mu$m. A noise equivalent power of few pW is measured by employing an active stabilization technique in which the local oscillator and the signal are locked in phase. The measured heterodyne noise equivalent power is six orders of magnitude lower than that obtained with direct detection.</description>

      <title>The QBO, the annual cycle, and their interactions: Isolating periodic modes with Koopman analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is the dominant mode of variability in the equatorial stratosphere. It is characterized by alternating descending easterly and westerly jets over a period of approximately 28 months. It has long been known that the QBO interactions with the annual cycle, e.g., through variation in tropical upwelling, leading to variations in the descent rate of the jets and, resultingly, the QBO period. Understanding these interactions, however, has been hindered by the fact that conventional measures of the QBO convolve these interactions. Koopman formalism, derived from dynamical systems, allows one to decompose spatio-temporal datasets (or nonlinear systems) into spatial modes that evolve coherently with distinct frequencies. We use a data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator on zonal-mean zonal-wind to find modes that correspond to the annual cycle, the QBO, and the nonlinear interactions between the two. From these modes, we establish a data-driven index for a "pure" QBO that is independent of the annual cycle and investigate how the annual cycle modulates the QBO. We begin with what is already known, quantifying the Holton-Tan effect, a nonlinear interaction between the QBO and the annual cycle of the polar stratospheric vortex. We then use the pure QBO to do something new, quantifying how the annual cycle changes the descent rate of the QBO, revealing annual variations with amplitudes comparable to the $30 \, \mathrm{m} \, \mathrm{day}^{-1}$ mean descent rate. We compare these results to the annual variation in tropical upwelling and interpret then with a simple model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ocean turbulence parameterization has principally been based on processed-based approaches, seeking to embed physical principles so that coarser resolution calculations can capture the net influence of smaller scale unresolved processes. More recently there has been an increasing focus on the application of data-driven approaches to this problem. Here we consider the application of online learning to data-driven eddy parameterization, constructing an end-to-end differentiable dynamical solver forced by a neural network, and training the neural network based on the dynamics of the combined hybrid system. This approach is applied to the classic barotropic Stommel-Munk gyre problem -- a highly idealized configuration which nevertheless includes multiple flow regimes, boundary dynamics, and a separating jet, and therefore presents a challenging test case for the online learning approach. It is found that a neural network which is suitably trained can lead to a coarse resolution neural network parameterized model which is stable, and has both a reasonable mean state and intrinsic variability. This suggests that online learning is a powerful tool for studying the problem of ocean turbulence parameterization.</description>

      <title>Turbulent spectrum of 2D internal gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the turbulent energy spectrum of weakly interacting 2D internal gravity waves using the full, non-hydrostatic dispersion relation. This spectrum is an exact solution of a regularized kinetic equation, from which the zero-frequency shear modes have been excised by a careful limiting process. This is a new method in wave kinetic theory. The turbulent spectrum agrees with the 2D oceanic Garrett--Munk spectrum for frequencies large compared to the Coriolis frequency and vertical scales small compared to the depth of the ocean. We show that this turbulent spectrum is the unique power law solution to the steady kinetic equation with a non-zero radial flux. Our solution provides an interesting insight into a turbulent energy cascade in an anisotropic system -- like isotropic turbulence it is self-similar in scale, but its angular part is peaked along the curve of vanishing frequency and is self-similar in frequency.</description>
