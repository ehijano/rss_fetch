      <title>Infection dynamics for fluctuating infection or removal rates regarding the number of infected and susceptible individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general, the rates of infection and removal (whether through recovery or death) are nonlinear functions of the number of infected and susceptible individuals. One of the simplest models for the spread of infectious diseases is the SIR model, which categorizes individuals as susceptible, infectious, recovered or deceased. In this model, the infection rate, governing the transition from susceptible to infected individuals, is given by a linear function of both susceptible and infected populations. Similarly, the removal rate, representing the transition from infected to removed individuals, is a linear function of the number of infected individuals. However, existing research often overlooks the impact of nonlinear infection and removal rates in infection dynamics. This work presents an analytic expression for the number of infected individuals considering nonlinear infection and removal rates. In particular, we examine how the number of infected individuals varies as cases emerge and obtain the expression accounting for the number of infected individuals at each moment. This work paves the way for new quantitative approaches to understanding infection dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stationary and Non-Stationary Transition Probabilities in Decision Making: Modeling COVID-19 Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the complexities of stationary and non-stationary transition probabilities within the framework of a Markov Decision Process (MDP), specifically applied to COVID-19. The research highlights the critical role these probabilities play in accurately modeling disease dynamics and informing evidence-based decisions by policymakers and public health authorities. By incorporating both stationary transition probabilities (which assume constant rates of state changes) and non-stationary transition probabilities (which adapt to evolving conditions), the findings are pivotal for offering practical insights into optimizing resource allocation and intervention strategies to mitigate the pandemic's impacts. The structured analysis within this paper includes a detailed model description, derivation of balanced systems, and formulation of transition probabilities, all contextualized within a COVID-19 scenario. These contributions are invaluable for enhancing the efficacy of pandemic response strategies, ultimately improving public health outcomes and economic efficiency.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Impact of Misinformation Dynamics on Antimicrobial Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (RAM) poses a significant threat to global public health, making important medicines less useful. While the medical and biological reasons behind RAM are well studied, we still don't know enough about how false health information affects people's actions, which can speed up RAM. This study presents a new mathematical model to investigate the complex interplay between the spread of misinformation and the dynamics of RAM. We adapt a multi-strain fake news model, including distinct population compartments representing individuals susceptible to, believing in, or skeptical of various ideas related to antibiotic use. The model considers multiple "strains" of misinformation, such as the wrong belief that antibiotics are effective for viral infections or not trusting medical advice regarding prudent antibiotic prescription. Time delays are integrated to reflect the latency in information processing, behavioral change, and the manifestation of resistance. Through stability analysis and numerical simulations, this research aims to identify critical factors and parameters that influence the propagation of harmful beliefs and their consequent impact on behaviors contributing to RAM. The findings could help develop public health campaigns to reduce the negative impact of misinformation on fighting antimicrobial resistance.</description>

      <title>Perfect taxon sampling and fixing taxon traceability: Introducing a class of phylogenetically decisive collections of taxon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3472</link>
      <description>arXiv:1206.3472v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetically decisive collections of taxon sets have the property that if trees are chosen for each of their elements, as long as these trees are compatible, the resulting supertree is unique. This means that as long as the trees describing the phylogenetic relationships of the (input) species sets are compatible, they can only be combined into a common supertree in precisely one way. This setting is sometimes also referred to as \enquote{perfect taxon sampling}. While for rooted trees, the decision if a given set of input taxon sets is phylogenetically decisive can be made in polynomial time, the decision problem to determine whether a collection of taxon sets is phylogenetically decisive concerning \emph{unrooted} trees is unfortunately coNP-complete and therefore in practice hard to solve for large instances. This shows that recognizing such sets is often difficult. In this paper, we explain phylogenetic decisiveness and introduce a class of input taxon sets, namely so-called \emph{fixing taxon traceable} sets, which are guaranteed to be phylogenetically decisive and which can be recognized in polynomial time. Using both combinatorial approaches as well as simulations, we compare properties of fixing taxon traceability and phylogenetic decisiveness, e.g., by deriving lower and upper bounds for the number of quadruple sets (i.e., sets of 4-tuples) needed in the input set for each of these properties. In particular, we correct an erroneous lower bound concerning phylogenetic decisiveness from the literature.
  We have implemented the algorithm to determine if a given collection of taxon sets is fixing taxon traceable in \textsf{R} and made our software package \verb+FixingTaxonTraceR+ publicly available.</description>

      <title>Bang-Bang Optimal Control of Vaccination in Metapopulation Epidemics with Linear Cost Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates optimal vaccination strategies in a metapopulation epidemic model. We consider a linear cost to better capture operational considerations, such as the total number of vaccines or hospitalizations, in contrast to the standard quadratic cost assumption on the control. The model incorporates state and mixed control-state constraints, and we derive necessary optimality conditions based on Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. We use Pontryagin's result to rule out the possibility of the occurrence of singular arcs and to provide a full characterization of the optimal control.</description>
