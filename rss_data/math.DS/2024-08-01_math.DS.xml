      <title>Hopf and Bautin bifurcations in a 3D model for pest leafhopper with stage structure and generalist predatory mite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper of Yuan and Zhu (J. Differential Equations 321(2022) 99-129), the nature of dynamics of a generalist predator and prey with stage structure is modeled as a three-dimensional coupled nonlinear differential system. A detailed analysis of the bifurcation shows that the model exhibits a high complexity in its dynamics, which arises from the use of predatory mites as agent for controlling stage structures of tea green leafhopper pest. Unfortunately, there is a mistake in Proposition 2.2, item (3), also the hypothesis in Proposition 3.3 is incorrect. In this paper, we revisit the model and straighten those mentioned errors as in item (3), changed the existing hypothesis by a suitable one and give a corrected proof of Proposition 3.3 in its new form. Also, we show that the model does undergo both Hopf bifurcation and Bautin bifurcation, and numerical examples are given to support the analytic results.</description>

      <title>Non degenerate Birkhoff functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known after the works of Mahler, Kleinbock, Margulis, Sprind\v{z}uk and others that very well approximated numbers on a manifold form a zero measure set, assuming non-degeneracy conditions. These non-degeneracy conditions are, in many applications, difficult to check. We propose here a setting in which these are automatic. Rather than functions, we consider correspondences which have a better behaviour.</description>

      <title>Global stability in the Ricker model with delay and stocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Ricker model with delay and constant or periodic stocking. We found that the high stocking density tends to neutralize the delay effect on stability. Conditions are established on the parameters to ensure the global stability of the equilibrium solution in the case of constant stocking, as well as the global stability of the $2$-periodic solution in the case of $2$-periodic stocking. Our approach extensively relies on the utilization of the embedding technique. Whether constant stocking or periodic stocking, the model has the potential to undergo a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation in both cases. However, the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation in the $2$-periodic case results in the emergence of two invariant curves that collectively function as a single attractor. Finally, we pose open questions in the form of conjectures about global stability for certain choices of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Post$-$operative glioblastoma cancer cell distribution in the peritumoural oedema</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain tumour, exhibits low survival rates due to its rapid growth, infiltrates surrounding brain tissue, and is highly resistant to treatment. One major challenge is oedema infiltration, a fluid build$-$up that provides a path for cancer cells to invade other areas. MRI resolution is insufficient to detect these infiltrating cells, leading to relapses despite chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In this work, we propose a new multiscale mathematical modelling method, to explore the oedema infiltration and predict tumour relapses. To address tumour relapses, we investigated several possible scenarios for the distribution of remaining GBM cells within the oedema after surgery. Furthermore, in this computational modelling investigation on tumour relapse scenarios were investigated assuming the presence of clinically relevant chemo$-$radio therapy numerical results suggest that a higher concentration of GBM cells near the surgical cavity edge led to limited spread and slower progression of tumour relapse. Finally, we explore mathematical and computational avenues for reconstructing relevant shapes for the initial distributions of GBM cells within the oedema from available MRI scans. The results obtained show good overlap between our simulation and the patient serial MRI scans taken 881 days into the treatment. While still under analytical investigation, this work paves the way for robust reconstruction of tumour relapses from available clinical data.</description>

      <title>Enumerating Finite Braid Group Orbits on $SL_2(\C)$-Character Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze finite orbits of the natural braid group action on the character variety of the $n$ times punctured sphere. Building on recent results relating middle convolution and finite complex reflection groups, our work implements Katz's middle convolution to explicitly classify finite orbits in the $SL_2(\C)$-character variety of the punctured sphere. We provide theoretical results on the existence of finite orbits arising from the imprimitive finite complex reflection groups and formulas for constructing such examples when they exist. In the primitive finite complex reflection groups, we perform an exhaustive search and provide computational results. Our contributions also include Magma computer code for middle convolution and for computing the orbit under this action when it is known to be finite.</description>

      <title>Higher order quantum reservoir computing for non-intrusive reduced-order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting dynamical systems is of importance to numerous real-world applications. When possible, dynamical systems forecasts are constructed based on first-principles-based models such as through the use of differential equations. When these equations are unknown, non-intrusive techniques must be utilized to build predictive models from data alone. Machine learning (ML) methods have recently been used for such tasks. Moreover, ML methods provide the added advantage of significant reductions in time-to-solution for predictions in contrast with first-principle based models. However, many state-of-the-art ML-based methods for forecasting rely on neural networks, which may be expensive to train and necessitate requirements for large amounts of memory. In this work, we propose a quantum mechanics inspired ML modeling strategy for learning nonlinear dynamical systems that provides data-driven forecasts for complex dynamical systems with reduced training time and memory costs. This approach, denoted the quantum reservoir computing technique (QRC), is a hybrid quantum-classical framework employing an ensemble of interconnected small quantum systems via classical linear feedback connections. By mapping the dynamical state to a suitable quantum representation amenable to unitary operations, QRC is able to predict complex nonlinear dynamical systems in a stable and accurate manner. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework through benchmark forecasts of the NOAA Optimal Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature dataset and compare the performance of QRC to other ML methods.</description>

      <title>Packing measure and dimension of the limit sets of IFSs of generalized complex continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04460v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of conformal iterated function systems (for short, CIFSs) of generalized complex continued fractions. Note that in our previous paper we showed that the proper-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the limit set is zero and the packing measure of the limit set with respect to the Hausdorff dimension is positive. In this paper, we show that the packing dimension and the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of each CIFS in the family are equal, and the proper-dimensional packing measure of the limit set is finite.</description>

      <title>Universal exponential pointwise convergence for weighted multiple ergodic averages over $ \mathbb{T}^\infty $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By employing an accelerated weighting method, we establish arbitrary polynomial and exponential pointwise convergence for multiple ergodic averages under general conditions in both discrete and continuous settings, involving quasi-periodic and almost periodic cases, which breaks the well known slow convergence rate observed in classical ergodic theory. We also present joint Diophantine rotations as explicit applications. Especially, in the sense that excluding nearly rational rotations with zero measure, we demonstrate that the pointwise exponential convergence is universal via analytic observables, even when multiplicatively averaging over the infinite-dimensional torus $ \mathbb{T}^\infty $, utilizing a novel truncated approach. Moreover, by constructing counterexamples concerning with multiple ergodicity, we highlight the irremovability of the joint nonresonance and establish the optimality of our weighting method in preserving rapid convergence. We also provide numerical simulations with analysis to further illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Tracking Control for $(x,u)$-Flat Systems by Quasi-Static Feedback of Classical States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.12995v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that for flat systems the tracking control problem can be solved by utilizing a linearizing quasi-static feedback of generalized states. If measurements (or estimates) of a so-called generalized Brunovsk\'y state are available, a linear, decoupled and asymptotically stable tracking error dynamics can be achieved. However, from a practical point of view, it is often desirable to achieve the same tracking error dynamics by feedback of a classical state instead of a generalized one. This is due to the fact that the components of a classical state typically correspond to measurable physical quantities, whereas a generalized Brunovsk\'y state often contains higher order time derivatives of the (fictitious) flat output which are not directly accessible by measurements. In this paper, a systematic solution for the tracking control problem based on quasi-static feedback and measurements of classical states only is derived for the subclass of $(x,u)$-flat systems.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary game selection creates cooperative environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of collective cooperation in competitive environments is a well-known phenomenon in biology, economics, and social systems. While most evolutionary game models focus on the evolution of strategies for a fixed game, how strategic decisions coevolve with the environment has so far mostly been overlooked. Here, we consider a game selection model where not only the strategies but also the game can change over time following evolutionary principles. Our results show that coevolutionary dynamics of games and strategies can induce novel collective phenomena, fostering the emergence of cooperative environments. When the model is taken on structured populations the architecture of the interaction network can significantly amplify pro-social behavior, with a critical role played by network heterogeneity and the presence of clustered groups of similar players, distinctive features observed in real-world populations. By unveiling the link between the evolution of strategies and games for different structured populations, our model sheds new light on the origin of social dilemmas ubiquitously observed in real-world social systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider discrete ensembles of linear, scalar control systems with single-inputs. Assuming that all the individual systems are unstable, we investigate whether there exist linear feedback control laws that can asymptotically stabilize the ensemble system. We provide necessary/sufficient conditions for feasibility of pole placement in the left half plane and for feedback stabilizability of the ensemble systems.</description>

      <title>Explain the Black Box for the Sake of Science: Revisiting the Scientific Method in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scientific method is the cornerstone of human progress across all branches of the natural and applied sciences, from understanding the human body to explaining how the universe works. The scientific method is based on identifying systematic rules or principles that describe the phenomenon of interest in a reproducible way that can be validated through experimental evidence. In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), there are discussions on how AI systems may discover new knowledge. We argue that human complex reasoning for scientific discovery remains of vital importance, at least before the advent of artificial general intelligence. Yet, AI can be leveraged for scientific discovery via explainable AI. More specifically, knowing what data AI systems deemed important to make decisions can be a point of contact with domain experts and scientists, that can lead to divergent or convergent views on a given scientific problem. Divergent views may spark further scientific investigations leading to new scientific knowledge.</description>
