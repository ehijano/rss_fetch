      <title>Identifying the Growth Phase of Magnetic Reconnection using Pressure-Strain Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection often initiates abruptly and then rapidly progresses to a nonlinear quasi-steady state. While satellites frequently detect reconnection events, ascertaining whether the system has achieved steady-state or is still evolving in time remains challenging. Here, we propose that the relatively rapid opening of reconnection separatrices within the electron diffusion region (EDR) serves as an indicator of the growth phase of reconnection. The opening of the separatrices is produced by electron flows diverging away from the neutral line downstream of the X-line and flowing around a dipolarization front. This flow pattern leads to characteristic spatial structures in pressure-strain interaction that could be a useful indicator for the growth phase of a reconnection event. We employ two-dimensional particle-in-cell numerical simulations of anti-parallel magnetic reconnection to validate this prediction. We find that the signature discussed here, alongside traditional reconnection indicators, can serve as a marker of the growth phase. This signature is potentially accessible using multi-spacecraft single-point measurements, such as with NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) satellites in Earth's magnetotail. Applications to other settings where reconnection occurs are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Sputter Yields of the Lunar Surface: Experimental Validation and Numerical Modelling of Solar Wind Sputtering of Apollo 16 Soils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sputtering by solar wind ions is a key process driving the ejection of high-energy particles into the exospheres of airless bodies like asteroids, Mercury and the Moon. In view of upcoming missions which will deliver new in-situ data on these exospheres like the Artemis program at the Moon and BepiColombo at Mercury, a deeper understanding of sputtering effects is crucial. In this work, we combine sensitive quartz crystal microbalance measurements and numerical simulations to quantify sputter yields of Apollo soil 68501 under solar wind relevant conditions. We find that none of the commonly used simulation codes can reliably predict laboratory sputter yields without experimental benchmarks. All of the employed packages significantly overestimate the sputter yields of flat samples by at least a factor of 2 for the case of hydrogen. When accounting for surface roughness and regolith-like porosity, sputter yields are decreased even further to 7.3E-3 atoms\ion and 7.6E-2 atoms\ion for H and He at solar wind energies of 1 keV\amu, respectively. The reduced yields of porous regolith structures are largely independent of the ion incidence angle, making them applicable across a wide range of lunar latitudes. This study highlights the need for experimental validation of sputtering models to ensure accurate predictions for space weathering and lunar exosphere composition.</description>

      <title>The effects of resistivity on oscillatory reconnection and consequences for solar flare Quasi Periodic Pulsations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are often observed in flare emissions. While these may reveal much about the time-dependent reconnection involved in flare energy release, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this paper, we use 2D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the magnetic reconnection in two merging flux ropes, focusing on the effects of the resistivity on the time variation of the reconnection. We consider both uniform resistivity and current-dependent anomalous resistivity profiles. Our findings reveal that resistivity plays a critical role in controlling the reconnection dynamics, including reconnection rate oscillations and the rate of decay of the reconnection rate. Resistivity also influences the oscillations in emitted gyrosynchrotron radiation. However, in contrast to this strong influence of resistivity on reconnection rates, we observed a different behaviour for the emitted waves, whose frequencies are almost independent of resistivity variations.</description>
