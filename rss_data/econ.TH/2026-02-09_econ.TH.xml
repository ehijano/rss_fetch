      <title>Future-blindness and the product topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study future-blind preferences, which are preferences that heavily discount the future, within the space of infinite consumption streams. We give two definitions: $N$-blindness, where agents ignore periods beyond a fixed date $N$, and eventual blindness, where all but finitely many dates are neglected. Using a topological approach, we show that the finest topology ensuring eventual blindness coincides with the product topology. This provides a behavioral foundation for continuity in the product topology, which was considered for studying equilibrium existence in infinite-dimensional spaces. Finally, we characterize the dual spaces under these topologies.</description>

      <title>The Impossibility of Strategyproof Rank Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In rank aggregation, the goal is to combine multiple input rankings into a single output ranking. In this paper, we analyze rank aggregation methods, so-called social welfare functions (SWFs), with respect to strategyproofness, which requires that no agent can misreport his ranking to obtain an output ranking that is closer to his true ranking in terms of the Kemeny distance. As our main result, we show that no anonymous SWF satisfies unanimity and strategyproofness when there are at least four alternatives. This result is proven by SAT solving, a computer-aided theorem proving technique, and verified by Isabelle, a highly trustworthy interactive proof assistant. Further, we prove by hand that strategyproofness is incompatible with majority consistency, a variant of Condorcet-consistency for SWFs. Lastly, we show that all SWFs in two natural classes have a large incentive ratio and are thus highly manipulable.</description>

      <title>Topological Semantics for Common Inductive Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lewis' account of common knowledge in Convention describes the generation of higher-order expectations between agents as hinging upon agents' inductive standards and a shared witness. This paper attempts to draw from insights in learning theory to provide a formal account of common inductive knowledge and how it can be generated by a witness. Our language has a rather rich syntax in order to capture equally rich notions central to Lewis' account of common knowledge; for instance, we speak of an agent 'having some reason to believe' a proposition and one proposition 'indicating' to an agent that another proposition holds. A similar line of work was pursued by Cubitt &amp; Sugden 2003; however, their account was left wanting for a corresponding semantics. Our syntax affords a novel topological semantics which, following Kelly 1996's approach in The Logic of Reliable Inquiry, takes as primitives agents' information bases. In particular, we endow each agent with a 'switching tolerance' meant to represent their personal inductive standards for learning. Curiously, when all agents are truly inductive learners (not choosing to believe only those propositions which are deductively verified), we show that the set of worlds where a proposition $P$ is common inductive knowledge is invariant of agents' switching tolerances. Contrarily, the question of whether a specific witness $W$ generates common inductive knowledge of $P$ is sensitive to changing agents' switching tolerances. After establishing soundness of our proof system with respect to this semantics, we conclude by applying our logic to solve an 'inductive' variant of the coordinated attack problem.</description>

      <title>Consistent Beliefs without Common Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a strand of the literature, it is assumed that the common prior has full support; that is, every type of every player is assigned positive probability. Morris (1991,1994) established an epistemological-behavioral duality characterisation of the common prior with full support, showing that a finite type space admits such a prior if and only if it contains no acceptable bet. This result forms the basis of the present paper.
  The paper makes three contributions: (1) The characterisation of Morris (1991,Morris1994) is extended to infinite type spaces. (2) The extension is robust: it does not depend on whether the infinite model applies countably additive or purely additive probabilities as beliefs. (3) The analysis implies that the notion of a real common prior-understood as a single probability distribution or a set of probability distributions-is not necessarily meaningful.</description>

      <title>Regulating a Monopolist without Subsidy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study monopoly regulation under asymmetric information about costs when subsidies are infeasible. A monopolist with privately known marginal cost serves a single product market and sets a price. The regulator maximizes a weighted welfare function using unit taxes as sole policy instrument. We identify a sufficient and necessary condition for when laissez-faire is optimal. When intervention is desired, we provide simple sufficient conditions under which the optimal policy is a progressive price cap: prices below a benchmark face no tax, while higher prices are taxed at increasing and potentially prohibitive rates. This policy combines delegation at low prices with taxation at high prices, balancing access, affordability, and profitability. Our results clarify when taxes act as complements to subsidies and when they serve only as imperfect substitutes, illuminating how feasible policy instruments shape optimal regulatory design.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scheduling of Electricity and Water in Renewable-Colocated Desalination Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework for the optimal scheduling of flexible water desalination plants (WDPs) as hybrid generator-load resources. WDPs integrate thermal generation, membrane-based controllable loads, and renewable energy sources, offering unique operational flexibility for power system operations. They can simultaneously participate in two markets: selling desalinated water to a water utility, and bidirectionally transacting electricity with the grid based on their net electricity demand. We formulate the scheduling decision problem of a profit-maximizing WDP, capturing operational, technological, and market-based coupling between water and electricity flows. The threshold-based structure we derive provides computationally tractable coordination suitable for large-scale deployment, offering operational insights into how thermal generation and membrane-based loads complementarily provide continuous bidirectional flexibility. The thresholds are analytically characterized in closed form as explicit functions of technology and tariff parameters. We examine how small changes in the exogenous tariff and technology parameters affect the WDP's profit. Extensive simulations illustrate the optimal WDP's operation, profit, and water-electricity exchange, demonstrating significant improvements relative to benchmark algorithms.</description>
