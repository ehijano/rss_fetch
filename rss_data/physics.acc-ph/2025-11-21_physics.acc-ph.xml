      <title>Characteristics of electromagnetic radiation and the interference protection on a small-sized direct-acting electron accelerator with a plasma opening switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experimental study of the parameters of electromagnetic and X-ray radiation was carried out on a small-sized direct-acting electron accelerator with inductive storage and a plasma opening switch. Frequency spectra have been determined, and the diagnostics of the power of the microwave component of the spectrum has been tested. An analytical comparison of radiation signals and power signals has been carried out. A method for determining the directivity pattern using a broadband power sensor has been proposed. An anechoic chamber and a reflective screen were used to suppress interference.</description>

      <title>Orbit-Controlled Generation of Two-color Attosecond Mode-locked Free-electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generation of attosecond X-ray pulses has garnered significant attention within the X-ray free-electron laser (FEL) community due to their potential for ultrafast time-resolved studies. Such pulses enable the investigation of electron dynamics with unprecedented temporal resolution, opening new avenues in fields such as quantum control and ultrafast spectroscopy. In an FEL, the mode-locking technique synthesizes a comb of longitudinal modes by applying spatiotemporal shifts between the co-propagating radiation and the electron bunch. Here, we propose a novel scheme for generating two-color attosecond mode-locked FEL pulses via orbit control in two-stage mode-locked undulators. Specifically, a chicane with a wiggler inserted in the middle generates periodic temporal-transverse modulation in the electron beam. In this configuration, the low-energy and high-energy components of the beam lase in separate undulator sections, with each producing attosecond mode-locked FEL pulses. Three-dimensional simulations with realistic parameters confirm that trains of 250-attosecond soft X-ray pulses at the gigawatt level can be independently generated in each undulator section. Furthermore, time delay between the two pulse trains can be adjusted over a range of several hundred femtoseconds.</description>
