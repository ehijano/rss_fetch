      <title>Search for binary companions around millisecond pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is believed that the radio pulsars rotating at spin periods of about 30 millisecond or even lower got such high spins through the transfer of angular momentum by accreting matter from their binary companions (or past companions) in the past. Around 35% of MSPs are known to be isolated, some of the which might actually be in binaries - either not timed very well to obtain the signature of the orbit or in extremely wide binaries that can be revealed only through very accurate timing, as in the case of PSR J1024-0719. This has motivated an exercise to identify probable candidates of companions of MSPs in the Galactic field. This exercise has even the potential of discovering optical emission from MSPs themselves. Discovery of any possible binary companion will be followed by motivated pulsar timing campaigns to confirm the binary nature and to constrain orbital parameters.</description>

      <title>Insight-HXMT Spectral and Timing Studies of a Giant Outburst in RX J0440.9+4431</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Be/X-ray binary pulsar RX J0440.9+4431 underwent a giant outburst in late 2022 and lasted three months. The Insight-HXMT has observed this source at several instances of the entire outburst in 2022-2023. We used these bright outburst observations of the pulsar to study its X-ray spectral and timing variability. The pulse profiles obtained at similar luminosity during the progress and declining phases of the outburst show a similar shape behavior.With the increase in source luminosity, the complex pulse profile with multiple peaks at low luminosity becomes a single peaked pulse profile at the high luminosity at the outburst peak. The phase-averaged spectra of the pulsar in 1-120 keV are explained with an absorbed cutoff power-law continuum model. During the outburst phases, we have found the evidence of a cyclotron resonance scattering feature in the spectra varying in energies ($\sim$ 33.6- 41.6 keV) having broad linewidth &gt; 5 keV . In declining phases of the outburst, we have also found the hints of first cyclotron harmonic varying in 65-75 keV . The application of thermal and bulk Comptonization model to the phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectra reveals a high surface magnetic field ($B \sim 10^{13}$ G) for the pulsar.</description>

      <title>Transient MeV radiation from a relativistic tidal disruption candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On July 2, 2025, the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray space telescope detected three short-duration MeV transients with overlapping sky locations. These events, named as GRB 250702D, B, and E (collectively referred to as DBE), triggered the detector with delays of approximately 1-2 hours between each burst. Follow-up observations of this unusually long MeV transient (lasting &gt;3 hours) by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array over a period of 10 days revealed a steep temporal decline in soft X-rays ($\propto t^{-1.9 \pm 0.1}$). These characteristics are consistent with the scenario in which DBE arises from a relativistic jet launched after the tidal disruption of a star by a compact object. In the relativistic Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) scenario, DBE is the first one with detected MeV $\gamma$-ray emission. We show that the time-resolved MeV spectra during the outbursts are best described by a single power-law, $dN_{\gamma}/dE \propto E^{-1.5}$, extending from 10 keV to 40 MeV. The upper limits at higher energies ($&gt;$ 100 MeV) indicate that the spectrum breaks at $10-100$ MeV. From standard MeV $\gamma$-ray transparency arguments, we derive a lower limit on the jet bulk Lorentz factor. These constraints place DBE in the same category as four previously reported relativistic TDEs in terms of outburst luminosity and energetics. We discuss the origin of the MeV emission in several scenarios, including synchrotron and inverse Compton cooling of electrons accelerated in the jet.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Flux Emergence in Binary Neutron Star Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using high-resolution AthenaK simulations of a twisted toroidal flux tube, we study the flux emergence of magnetic structures in the shear layer of a hot massive neutron star typical of a binary neutron star remnant. High-resolution simulations demonstrate that magnetic buoyant instabilities allow for emergence only for extremely large magnetic fields significantly exceeding $10^{17}~\mathrm{G}$, and more typical fields around $10^{16}~\mathrm{G}$ are instead dominated by hydrodynamic effects. Because merger remnants tend to be stable against hydrodynamic convection, our work places strong limitations on the mechanisms by which massive binary neutron star remnants can produce the magnetically-driven outflows needed to power jets.</description>

      <title>Broadband Modelling of GRB 230812B Afterglow: Implications for VHE $\gamma$-ray Detection with IACTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction of the energy from the $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) jets, after powering the keV-MeV emission, forms an ultra-relativistic shock propagating into the circumburst medium. The particles in the medium accelerate through the shock and produce afterglow emission. Recently, a few GRB afterglows have been observed in TeV $\gamma$-rays by Cherenkov Telescopes. This provides access to broadband spectra of GRB afterglows containing rich information about the microphysics of relativistic shocks and the profile of the circumburst medium. Since the transition from synchrotron to inverse Compton regime in afterglow spectra occurs between hard X-rays and the very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-rays, detection in one of these bands is required to identify the two spectral components. The early afterglow data in the hard X-rays, along with the GeV emission, could accurately constrain the spectral shape and help in capturing the spectral turnover to distinguish the two components. We present the multiwavelength spectral and temporal study, focused on the keV-VHE domain, of GRB 230812B, one of the brightest GRBs detected by Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM), along with the detection of a 72 GeV photon in Large Area Telescope (LAT) during the early afterglow phase. Through a detailed modelling of the emission within the afterglow external forward shock in a wind-like scenario, we predict optical to high-energy observations up to ~1 day. We emphasize the importance of following up poorly localised GRBs by demonstrating that even without prompt sub-degree localisation, such as in GRB 230812B, it is possible to recover the emission using imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, thanks to their relatively wider field of view. Moreover, we show that the low energy threshold of Large-Sized Telescope is essential in discovering the VHE component at much higher redshifts, typical of long GRBs.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Cool Cores: An Inverse-Compton Origin for Cool Core Cluster Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray bright cool-core (CC) clusters contain luminous radio sources accelerating cosmic ray (CR) leptons at prodigious rates. Near the acceleration region, high-energy leptons produce synchrotron (mini)halos and sometimes observable gamma rays, but these leptons have short lifetimes and so cannot propagate far from sources without some rejuvenation. However, low-energy (~0.1-1 GeV) CRs should survive for &gt;Gyr, potentially reaching ~100 kpc before losing energy via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons to keV X-ray energies, with remarkably thermal X-ray spectra. In groups/clusters, this will appear similar to relatively 'cool' gas in cluster cores (i.e. CCs). In lower-mass (e.g. Milky Way/M31) halos, analogous CR IC emission will appear as hot (super-virial) gas at outer CGM radii, explaining recent diffuse X-ray observations. We show that for plausible (radio/gamma-ray observed) lepton injection rates, the CR-IC emission could contribute significantly to the X-ray surface brightness (SB) in CCs, implying that CC gas densities may have been overestimated and alleviating the cooling flow problem. A significant IC contribution to diffuse X-ray emission in CC clusters also explains the tight correlation between the X-ray 'cooling luminosity' and AGN/cavity/jet power, because the apparent CC emission is itself driven by the radio source. Comparing observed Sunyaev Zeldovich to X-ray inferred pressures at $\ll 100$ kpc in CCs represents a clean test of this scenario, and existing data appears to favor significant CR-IC. A significant IC contribution also implies that X-ray inferred gas-phase metallicities have been underestimated in CCs, potentially explaining the discrepancy between X-ray (sub-Solar) and optical/UV (super-Solar) observed metallicities in the central ~10 kpc of nearby CCs. We also discuss the model's connection to observations of multiphase gas in clusters.</description>

      <title>The infrared jet of M87 observed with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first JWST+NIRCam images of the giant elliptical active galaxy M87 and its jet at 0.90, 1.50, 2.77 and 3.56 $\mu$m. We analysed the large-scale jet structure, identifying prominent components, and determined the near-infrared spectral index. The data were calibrated using the standard JWST pipeline. We subtracted a constant background level and a smooth model of the galaxy surface brightness to isolate the jet. The total image fluxes measured in the NIRCam filters follow the infrared bump pattern seen near 1.6 $\mu$m in the spectral energy distribution of M87, caused by the surrounding stellar population in the galaxy. The residual jet images broadly agree with the radio to optical synchrotron power law $S_\lambda\propto\lambda^\alpha$ with $\alpha=$0.7-1.0. We identified the most upstream knot L at a distance of (320$\pm$50) mas from the core. The component HST-1, at (950$\pm$50) mas from the core, is transversely resolved, and both the individual images and the spectral index map clearly indicate its double-component substructure with two elements of similar size and flux density, with centroids separated by (150$\pm$20) mas and with a significantly larger spectral index $\alpha$ observed in the downstream component ($\alpha_{\rm do}=0.3$) than in the upstream one ($\alpha_{\rm up}= -0.15$). We also observe the counter-jet component located about 24 arcsec away from the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Astrophysical Neutrino Flux Using Contained and Uncontained Cascade Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has reported a deviation from the single power law in the extragalactic diffuse neutrino flux. A neural network-based event selection of contained and uncontained cascade events from IceCube, in which uncontained events have interaction vertices at the edge or outside of the detector instrumentation volume, has a factor \textasciitilde3 gain in effective area over the cascade events used in the novel combined tracks and cascades selection which reported the deviation. Systematic improvements and rigorously updated modeling of the atmospheric neutrino background is incorporated into this high statistics contained and uncontained cascade event selection to clarify features of the astrophysical neutrino spectrum across energies from 1 TeV up to 100 PeV.</description>

      <title>SVOM GRB 250314A at z $\simeq$ 7.3: an exploding star in the era of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most long Gamma-ray bursts originate from a rare type of massive stellar explosion. Their afterglows, while rapidly fading, can be initially extremely luminous at optical/near-infrared wavelengths, making them detectable at large cosmological distances. Here we report the detection and observations of GRB 250314A by the SVOM satellite and the subsequent follow-up campaign with the near-infrared afterglow discovery and the spectroscopic measurements of its redshift z $\simeq$ 7.3 . This burst happened when the Universe was only $\sim$ 5% of its current age. We discuss the signature of these rare events within the context of the SVOM operating model, and the ways to optimize their identification with adapted ground follow-up observation strategies.</description>

      <title>JWST reveals a supernova following a gamma-ray burst at z $\simeq$ 7.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of energetic long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought to arise from the collapse of massive stars, making them powerful tracers of star formation across cosmic time. Evidence for this origin comes from the presence of supernovae in the aftermath of the GRB event, whose properties in turn link back to those of the collapsing star. In principle, with GRBs we can study the properties of individual stars in the distant universe. Here, we present JWST/NIRCAM observations that detect both the host galaxy and likely supernova in the SVOM GRB 250314A with a spectroscopically measured redshift of z $\simeq$ 7.3, deep in the era of reionisation. The data are well described by a combination of faint blue host, similar to many z $\sim$ 7 galaxies, with a supernova of similar luminosity to the proto-type GRB supernova, SN 1998bw. Although larger galaxy contributions cannot be robustly excluded, given the evidence from the blue afterglow colours of low dust extinction, supernovae much brighter than SN 1998bw can be. These observations suggest that, despite disparate physical conditions, the star that created GRB 250314A was similar to GRB progenitors in the local universe.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of SN 2023ixf I: Completing the Early Multi-Wavelength Picture with Plateau-phase Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze panchromatic (0.35-14 $\mu$m) spectroscopy of the Type II supernova 2023ixf, including near- and mid-infrared spectra obtained 33.6 days after explosion during the plateau-phase, with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This is the first in a series of papers examining the evolution of SN 2023ixf with JWST spanning the initial 1000 days after explosion, monitoring the formation and growth of molecules and dust in ejecta and surrounding environment. The JWST infrared spectra are overwhelmingly dominated by H lines, whose profiles reveal ejecta structures unseen in optical spectra. We characterize the nature of these structures, concluding that they likely result from a combination of ejecta geometry, viewing angle, and opacity effects. We find no evidence for the formation of dust precursor molecules such as carbon-monoxide (CO), nor do we observe an infrared excess attributable to dust. These observations imply that any future signatures of molecules or dust in SN 2023ixf will arise either from freshly synthesized material within the ejecta or circumstellar material at radii not yet heated by the supernova at this epoch.</description>

      <title>A New Framework to Detect Multi-Messenger Signals from Bright Sporadic Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temporal dependence of the astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background (SGWB) in the hecto-hertz band brings a unique avenue to identify multi-messenger signals to these sources by using coincident detection in both GW and multi-band EM signals. We developed a new analysis pipeline, \textit{Multi-messenger Cross-Correlation} (MC$^2$) that can search for EM counterparts to the SGWB signal originating from both modeled and unmodeled sources by harnessing the nearly full-sky gamma-ray sky map. We provide an observation strategy that can be followed by current and future missions to discover EM counterparts to the weak GW signal hidden in the SGWB. We demonstrate the ability of this technique to drastically reduce the false alarm rates when involving EM multi-band analysis. This formalism aims towards advancing the multi-messenger observation frontier and improving our understanding of the population of bright SGWB sources present in the high-redshift universe and can also be applied to other messengers such as neutrinos in the future.</description>

      <title>Arcsecond-Scale X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy of SS 433 with Chandra HETG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spatial and spectral analysis of arcsecond-scale X-ray emission in SS433 using zeroth-order data from Chandra High-Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) observations. The analysis is based on 24 observations acquired between 1999 and 2024, comprising a total exposure of $\sim$850 ks and covering a wide range of orbital and precessional phases. Among these, the $\sim$140 ks observation from 2014 was analyzed in detail for this study. This data provides the best statistics and was taken when the jets were nearly perpendicular to the line of sight and the accretion disk was eclipsed. By applying an energy-dependent subpixel event repositioning algorithm and the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution, we enhanced the spatial resolution and revealed eastern and western knot-like structures at a distance of $\sim$1.7 arcsec ($\sim 10^{17}$ cm) from the core. These features are consistent with the kinematic precession model, and the positions of the knots suggest that they were ejected approximately 200 days prior to the observation. A comparison with VLA radio data obtained at a similar precessional phase shows that the X-ray emission extends east-west on a scale comparable to that of the radio emission. While the core is bright in both X-rays and radio, the brightness contrast between the knots and the core is smaller in X-rays than in radio. Spatially resolved spectroscopy indicates that prominent Fe lines in the core X-ray spectrum are well explained by thermal plasma emission. In contrast, Fe lines are not evident in the outer regions after accounting for potential core contamination, suggesting a dominant contribution from non-thermal processes. These findings imply that the arcsecond-scale X-ray structures may vary observationally with viewing conditions or precessional phase, but likely reflect a relatively stable jet-driving mechanism operating within the SS 433 system.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray transport in inhomogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory of cosmic-ray transport in multi-phase diffusive media is developed, with the specific application to cases in which the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient has large spatial fluctuations that may be inherently multi-scale. We demonstrate that the resulting transport of cosmic rays is diffusive in the long-time limit, with an average diffusion coefficient equal to the harmonic mean of the spatially varying diffusion coefficient. Thus, cosmic-ray transport is dominated by areas of low diffusion even if these areas occupy a relatively small, but not infinitesimal, fraction of the volume. On intermediate time scales, the cosmic rays experience transient effective sub-diffusion, as a result of low-diffusion regions interrupting long flights through high-diffusion regions. In the simplified case of a two-phase medium, we show that the extent and extremity of the sub-diffusivity of cosmic-ray transport is controlled by the spectral exponent of the distribution of patch sizes of each of the phases. We finally show that, despite strongly influencing the confinement times, the multi-phase medium is only capable of altering the energy dependence of cosmic-ray transport when there is a moderate (but not excessive) level of perpendicular diffusion across magnetic-field lines.</description>

      <title>Constraining the origin of the highest-energy cosmic-ray events detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory: a three-dimensional approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unveiling the sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays remains one of the main challenges of high-energy astrophysics. Measurements of anisotropies in their arrival directions are key to identifying their sources, yet magnetic deflections obscure direct associations. In this work, we reconstruct the sky regions of possible origin of the highest-energy cosmic-ray events detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory by tracing their trajectories through Galactic magnetic fields using up-to-date models, while fully accounting for energy and directional uncertainties. A mixed composition at injection is assumed to model the detected charge distributions of such events. Different classes of astrophysical sources are investigated and tested for a correlation with the inferred regions of origin of the events. By incorporating constraints on the maximum propagation distances, we also allow for a three-dimensional localization of the possible source regions. Our findings provide new constraints on the sources of the highest-energy cosmic particles and offer fresh insights into the role of Galactic magnetic fields in shaping the observed ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray sky.</description>

      <title>Large-scale anisotropies of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays are crucial to pinpoint their sources, which are yet to be discovered. A dipolar anisotropy in right ascension above 8~EeV has been detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory with a significance of $6.8 \sigma$. The direction of the dipole suggests an extragalactic origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays above those energies. In this contribution, we provide an overview of the studies on large-scale anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory with energy thresholds from $\sim 0.03$~EeV up to $32$~EeV and we present and discuss the recent results achieved with the latest available dataset, which includes 19 years of operations -- resulting in a total exposure of 123,000~km$^2$~sr~yr and nearly 50,000 events above 8~EeV.</description>

      <title>Triggering Electron Capture Supernovae: Dark Matter Effects in Degenerate White-Dwarf-like Cores of Super-Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) have emerged as a compelling formation channel for low-mass neutron stars, bolstered by decades of theoretical work and increasingly supported by observational evidence, including the recent identification of SN~2018zd. Motivated by this, we investigate the influence of fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) on the equilibrium structure of progenitor cores and the formation of their neutron star remnants. Using a general relativistic two-fluid formalism, we model the coupled evolution of ordinary matter (OM) and ADM, treated as separately conserved fluids interacting solely through gravity. Our analysis focuses on neon-rich white dwarfs (Ne WDs), which are typical progenitor cores for ECSNe. We assume conservation of both baryon number ($N_B$) and dark matter particle number ($N_D$) during collapse, allowing for a consistent mapping between progenitor and remnant configurations. We find that ADM significantly enhances the central density of the WD progenitor. This lowers the threshold gravitational mass $M^*$ required to initiate electron capture, enabling ECSNe from lower-mass progenitors. The resulting remnants are stable, dark matter-admixed neutron stars with gravitational masses potentially well below current observational bounds. Moreover, we find that the conversion energy during the WD-to-NS conversion is also significantly reduced for higher ADM particle masses and fractions, suggesting that unusually low-energy ECSNe may serve as potential indicators of ADM involvement in stellar collapse.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Inelastic Proton-Proton Cross-Section at $\sqrt{s} \geq 40$ TeV Using the Hybrid Data of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring proton-proton interaction cross-sections at center-of-mass energies above 40 TeV remains a significant challenge in particle physics. The Pierre Auger Observatory provides a unique opportunity to study the interactions at the highest energies through the distribution of the depth of maximum shower development ($X_\mathrm{max}$) observed by its Fluorescence Detector. In previous studies, the determination of the interaction cross-section at ultrahigh energies has relied on the assumption that the tail of the $X_\mathrm{max}$ distribution is proton-dominated, which restricts the analysis to a limited energy range below the ankle and introduces related systematic uncertainties. In this contribution, we adopt a novel method for the simultaneous estimation of the proton-proton interaction cross-section and the primary cosmic-ray mass composition using data from the Pierre Auger Observatory, avoiding assumptions about one quantity to infer the other and thus improving the accuracy and robustness of our analysis. In addition, a systematic shift in the $X_\mathrm{max}$ scale is fitted to account for both experimental uncertainties and theoretical constraints on the modeling of particle interactions. The obtained results are consistent with previous analyses and provide additional constraints on hadronic interaction models. The measured proton-proton inelastic cross-section at ultra-high energies agrees well with extrapolations of accelerator data. The inferred cosmic-ray composition and the $X_\mathrm{max}$-scale shift are also compatible with previous estimates.</description>

      <title>NANOGrav 15-year Data Set: Search for Gravitational Scattering of Pulsars by Free-Floating Objects in Interstellar Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-floating objects (FFOs) in interstellar space$-$rogue planets, brown dwarfs, and large asteroids that are not gravitationally bound to any star$-$are expected to be ubiquitous throughout the Milky Way. Recent microlensing surveys have discovered several free-floating planets that are not bound to any known stellar systems. Additionally, three interstellar objects, namely 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS, have been detected passing through our solar system on hyperbolic trajectories. In this work, we search for FFOs on hyperbolic orbits that pass near millisecond pulsars (MSPs), where their gravitational influence can induce detectable perturbations in pulse arrival times. Using the NANOGrav 15-year narrowband dataset, which contains high-precision timing data for 68 MSPs, we conduct a search for such hyperbolic scattering events between FFOs and pulsars. Although no statistically significant events were detected, this non-detection enables us to place upper limits on the number density of FFOs as a function of their mass within our local region of the Galaxy. For example, the upper limit on the number density for Jupiter-mass FFOs ($\sim 10^{-2.5} - 10^{-3.5}~M_{\odot}$) obtained from different pulsars ranges from $5.25\times10^{6}~\text{pc}^{-3}$ to $5.37\times10^{9}~\text{pc}^{-3}$, while the upper limit calculated by combining results from all the pulsars is $6.03\times10^{5}~\text{pc}^{-3}$. These results represent the first constraints on FFO population derived from pulsar timing data.</description>

      <title>The most distant $\gamma$-ray flare to date: a multiwavelength campaign on the $z = 4.715$ blazar GB6 B1428+4217</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In November 2023, the Fermi Large Area Telescope detected a $\gamma$-ray flare from the high-redshift blazar GB6 B1428+4217 ($z=4.715$). We initiated a multi-wavelength follow-up campaign involving Swift, NuSTAR, the Sierra Nevada and Perkins Observatories, and the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. This source, also known as 5BZQ J1430+4204, has shown an anomalous soft X-ray spectrum in previous observations, including possible ionized absorption features or signatures of bulk Comptonization of thermal electrons, which are also detected during the flaring episode. Simultaneous optical data revealed a polarization fraction of ${\sim}8$\% in the R band, confirming that synchrotron emission dominated over thermal emission from the accretion disk. The hard X-ray flux was enhanced during the flare. Modeling of the broadband spectral energy distribution suggests that the high-energy component is dominated by Compton scattering by external seed photons from the accretion disk. The origin of the flare is consistent with the injection of a hard-spectrum electron population in the emission region. With a $\gamma$-ray luminosity among the top 5% of flaring events, GB6 B1428+4217 exemplifies a prototypical MeV blazar. Its Compton-dominated SED and extreme luminosity are in line with expectations from the blazar sequence. High-redshift flares like this are critical for understanding jet physics in the early Universe and may improve detection prospects with future missions such as COSI.</description>

      <title>White dwarf structure in $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity: beyond the Chandrasekhar mass limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relativistic structure of white dwarfs (WDs) within the framework of modified gravity theory $f(R, T, L_m) = R + \alpha T L_m$, which introduces a non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature. Using a realistic equation of state (EoS) that includes contributions from a relativistic degenerate electron gas and ionic lattice effects, we solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations for two standard choices of the matter Lagrangian density: $L_m = p$ and $L_m = -\rho$. We show that the extra $\alpha TL_m$ term significantly alters the mass-radius relation of WDs, especially at high central densities $( \rho_c \gtrsim 10^8 - 10^9\,\rm g/cm^3)$, allowing for stable super-Chandrasekhar configurations. In particular, depending on the sign and magnitude of the parameter $\alpha$, the maximum mass can increase or decrease, and in some regimes, the usual critical point indicating the transition from stability to instability disappears. Our findings suggest that $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity provides a viable framework to explain the existence of massive WDs beyond the classical Chandrasekhar limit.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of SN 2024ggi I: Interpretation and Model Comparison of the Type II Supernova 2024ggi at 55 days Past Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present panchromatic 0.4-21 microns observations of the nearby (~7.2 Mpc) Type II supernova 2024ggi, obtained during the plateau phase at ~55 d past explosion. Our dataset includes JWST spectra spanning 1.7-14 microns, MIR imaging at 7.7 and 21 microns, and near-simultaneous ground-based optical and NIR spectra covering 0.32-1.8 microns. The NIR and MIR spectral features of SN 2024ggi are dominated by HI emission. We present line IDs and a toy PHOENIX/1D model that reproduces the observations well, especially the continuum redward of 0.9 microns We compare SN 2024ggi to SN 2022acko and SN 2023ixf, two other Type II supernovae that were also observed by JWST, and highlight key similarities and differences in their spectral features. No evidence for a MIR excess or dust is found at these epochs, with the model matching the observed flux out to 21 microns. We discuss the model's shortcomings, focusing on the density profile, which suppresses line blanketing and produces features in the optical that are too narrow. Our results show the power of panchromatic studies in both exploring the nature of the SN ejecta and constraining detailed models of SNe.</description>

      <title>Radial oscillations of neutron stars in Starobinsky gravity and its Gauss-Bonnet extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starobinsky gravity, as one of the simplest and best-behaved higher-curvature gravity theories, has been extensively studied in the context of neutron stars over the past few decades. In this work, we investigate the adiabatic radial oscillation stability of neutron stars within the framework of Starobinsky gravity. We find that gravitational modifications can significantly impact stellar stability. Specifically, the higher-derivative nature of the theory causes the exterior spacetime to dynamically respond to fluid oscillations, in contrast to general relativity where Birkhoff's theorem ensures a static exterior. For stellar models with low central densities, the fundamental frequency becomes nearly independent of the central density when the coupling constant is large. For stellar models with high central densities, the transition from stability to instability still approximately occurs near the maximum-mass configuration, similar to the case in general relativity. Our main analysis is conducted in the Jordan frame of the scalar-tensor gravity equivalent to Starobinsky gravity, and we explicitly verify consistency with results obtained in the Einstein frame. We further extend our study to a class of Gauss-Bonnet extensions of Starobinsky gravity.</description>

      <title>Refined Constraints on the Hubble Constant from Localized FRBs with Assessment of Systematic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion measure-redshift relation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provides a valuable cosmological probe for constraining the Hubble constant, offering an independent measurement that could help resolve the ongoing Hubble tension. In this paper, we begin with a sample of 117 localized FRBs and use 95 of them to constrain $H_0$ to $71.28^{+1.90}_{-2.08}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ within the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The resulting statistical uncertainty is below 2.8\%, improving previous FRB-based measurements and highlighting the promise of larger future samples. Beyond statistical improvements, we note that different parameter choices have been adopted in previous studies and some results show discrepancies in $H_0$. To address this issue, we perform a systematic assessment of modeling uncertainties that can affect the inferred value of $H_0$, including Galactic electron density models, the contribution of the Galactic halo, outliers such as FRB~20190520B located in extreme environments, and the other parameter selections. We also discuss possible approaches to mitigate these sources of uncertainty, emphasizing both the challenges and prospects of using FRBs as reliable cosmological tools.</description>

      <title>Modeling direct and pre-equilibrium processes of neutron-induced reactions with noniterative finite amplitude method and distorted-wave Born approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a calculation method for describing the direct and pre-equilibrium processes in neutron-induced reactions based on the framework of noniterative finite amplitude method (FAM) and distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA). The noniterative FAM is used to derive equations of quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) for neutron-induced inelastic scatterings to both the discrete and continuum states in a consistent manner. The Skyrme force is employed as an interaction between the projectile neutron with nucleons inside the target nucleus. We apply this method to the neutron-induced reaction on 208Pb. We demonstrate that the calculated differential inelastic scattering cross sections to low-lying states reproduce available experimental data without any phenomenological parameters that are often introduced in conventional DWBA calculations. The calculated double differential cross section to the continuum state also agrees with the experimental data in the energy region relevant to the direct and pre-equilibrium processes. These results are used to investigate the spin distribution of the populated states in the residual nucleus.</description>

      <title>SN 2023vbg: A Type IIn Supernova Resembling SN 2009ip, with a Long-Duration Precursor and Early-Time Bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNe) resembling SN 2009ip (09ip-like SNe) originate from the interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) and the ejecta. This subclass not only shares similar observational properties around the maximum, but is commonly characterized by a long-duration precursor before its maximum. Investigating the observed properties of the precursor provides constraints on the mass-loss history of the progenitor. We present observational data of SN 2023vbg, a 09ip-like type IIn SN that displayed unique observational properties compared to other 09ip-like SNe. SN 2023vbg showed a long-duration precursor at approximately Mg = -14 mag lasting for about 100 days, followed by a bright bump at Mg = -17 mag at 12-25 days before the maximum. The luminosity of the precursor is similar to those of other 09ip-like SNe, but the bright bump has not been observed in other cases. After reaching the peak luminosity, the light curve exhibited a relatively smooth decline. While the H-alpha profile displays two velocity components (approximately 500 and 3000 km/s), a broad component observed in other 09ip-like SNe was not seen, though it may emerge later. We suggest that these properties are explained by the difference in the CSM structure as compared to other 09ip-like SNe; SN 2023vbg had an inner denser CSM component, as well as generally smooth CSM density distribution on a more extended scale, than in the others. Such diversity of CSM likely reflects the diversity of pre-SN outbursts, which in turn may mirror the range of evolutionary pathways in the final stages of the progenitors.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flavor instabilities in a binary neutron star merger remnant: Roles of a long-lived hypermassive neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the post-merger evolution of binary neutron star merger (BNSM) requires accurate modeling of neutrino transport and microphysics including neutrino flavor conversions. Many previous studies have suggested that fast flavor instability (FFI) and collisional flavor instability (CFI) pervade inner regions of BNSM remnant, and they could impact on fluid dynamics and r-process nucleosynthesis. In this work, we re-examine prospects of occurrences of FFI and CFI using Boltzmann neutrino transport, assuming a frozen fluid background obtained from a numerical relativity simulation of BNSM. We pay special attention to a case involving a long-lived ($&gt;1\,$ s) hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Apart from confirming the claim that these flavor instabilities can occur in BNSM remnants, some new insights are revealed. We identify multiple mechanisms responsible for generating electron neutrino lepton number (ELN) angular crossings, corresponding to a key indicator of FFI onset, which differ notably from those in black hole (BH) accretion disk systems. We argue that the appearance of positive chemical potential of electron-type neutrinos plays important roles on generating ELN angular crossings. For CFI, their growth rates are generally lower than FFI, but they can persistently occur in most of the accretion disk up to $\sim 1\,$ s. We also find that neglecting contributions of heavy-leptonic neutrinos results in overestimating growth rate and area of unstable regions of CFI. Our result suggests that FFI (CFI) tends to occur transiently (persistently) and locally (widespread in the disk), and FFI is more sensitive to the central compact object (HMNS or BH) than CFI, though more self-consistent simulations with incorporating effects of flavor conversions are needed to confirm these claims.</description>

      <title>Comparative Testing of Subgrid Models for Fast Neutrino Flavor Conversions in Core-collapse Supernova Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate key methodologies of Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook subgrid modeling for neutrino fast flavor conversions (FFC) in core-collapse supernova based on spherically symmetric Boltzmann radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We first examine time integration methods (explicit, implicit, or semi-implicit) and time step control for the subgrid term, and then compare various approaches in the literature approximating FFCs in two aspects: (1) angular dependent survival probability of neutrinos versus simple equipartition condition with a certain baryon mass density threshold, and (2) 4-species treatment versus 3-species assumption ($\nu_x=\bar\nu_x$). We find that the equipartition condition is reasonable for out-going neutrinos, but large deviations emerge in the incoming neutrinos, that has an influence on matter profiles. We also find that the 3-species model, in which flavor conversions evolve towards erasing electron neutrino lepton number (ELN) crossings, behave differently from the 4-species models where heavy leptonic neutrino number (XLN) are appropriately treated in FFC subgrid modeling. In 4-species models, we commonly observe noticeable differences between $\nu_x$ and $\bar\nu_x$, highlighting the limitation in 3-species treatments to study impacts of flavor conversion on neutrino signals. Our result also suggests that FFC models yield lower neutrino heating rate and smaller shock radii compared to cases with no FFC, in agreement with earlier studies employing quantum kinetic neutrino transport. This work provides valuable information towards robust implementation of FFC subgrid model into classical transport, and serves as a pilot study for future multi-dimensional simulations.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star-White Dwarf Merger as One Possible Optional Source of Kilonova-like Emission: Implications for GRB 211211A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-duration GRB 211211A, which lacked an associated supernova at such a low redshift $z=0.076$, but was associated with a possible kilonova emission, has attracted great attention. The neutron star-white dwarf (NS-WD) merger is proposed as a possible progenitor of GRB 211211A, and it could naturally explain the long duration of the prompt emission. However, the NS-WD merger is not an ideal site for producing heavy elements via r-process nucleosynthesis. In this Letter, we investigate the heavy elements produced in NS-WD mergers based on numerical simulations of nucleosynthesis via SkyNet, and then calculate the resulting kilonova-like emission to compare with the solidly observed case of possible kilonova emission associated with GRB 211211A. By adopting three models (i.e., Model-A, Model-B, and Model-C) from \cite{2023ApJ...956...71K} at different temperatures ($T=4$ GK, 5 GK, and 6 GK), which are treated as free parameters, we find that the mass number of the heaviest element produced in our simulations is less than 90 ($A&lt; 90$). Moreover, by comparing the calculated kilonova-like emission with the afterglow-subtracted observations of the possible kilonova associated with GRB 211211A, it is found that the merger of NS and WD cannot be ruled out as the origin of GRB 211211A to produce the possible kilonova emission if the remnant of the WD-NS merger is a supramassive or stable magnetar. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain the early possible kilonova emission following GRB 211211A by invoking the merger of a WD and an NS.</description>

      <title>A novel energy reconstruction method for the MAGIC stereoscopic observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new gamma ray energy reconstruction method based on Random Forest to be commonly used for the data analysis of the MAGIC Telescopes, a system of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes.
  The energy resolution with the new energy reconstruction improves compared to the one obtained with the LUTs method. For standard observations i.e. dark conditions with pointing zenith (Zd) less than 35 deg for a point-like source, the energy resolution goes from $\sim 20\%$ at 100 GeV to $\sim 10\%$ at a few TeV.
  In addition, the new method suppresses the outlier population in the energy error distribution, which is thus better described by a Gaussian distribution. The new energy reconstruction method enhances the reliability especially for the sources with steep spectra, in higher energies and/or in observations at higher Zd pointings.
  We validate the new method in different ways and demonstrate some cases of its remarkable benefit in spectral analysis with simulated observation data.</description>

      <title>Population Synthesis Study on the Binary Origin of Type Ibn Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type Ibn supernovae (SNe) are a class of SN explosions whose progenitors are surrounded by dense helium-rich circumstellar matter (CSM). Some models have been proposed for how to form the dense CSM, with promising scenarios involving either binaries with a low-mass ($\lesssim 3~M_\odot$) helium (He) star, or mergers following common envelope phases between a He star and a compact object. Using rapid binary population synthesis calculations, we estimate the event rate of these channels and compare it with the observed SN Ibn rate. We find that exploding low-mass He stars in close binaries (of separations $\lesssim$ a few 100 $R_\odot$) can be sufficiently produced to account for the observed event rate of SN Ibn, while the merger scenario can likely account for only a fraction of these SNe. We discuss the types of companions expected in the low-mass He star scenario, finding massive main sequence stars ($10$--$20\ M_\odot$) to be typical, with a potentially non-negligible fraction ($&lt;10\%$) of binaries with white dwarf (WD) companions that have long delay times of up to $100$ Myrs.</description>
