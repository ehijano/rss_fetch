      <title>Superconducting LaPtH$_{ 6 }$ with triatomic hydrogen units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To veryfy "hot supreconductivity" recently proposed in lanthanum hydride-based compounds, we explored thermodynamically stable and superconducting phases in the lanthanum (La)-platinum (Pt)-hydrogen (H) ternary system at 20 GPa using an evolutionary construction scheme of a formation-enthalpy convex hull, universal neural network potential calculations, and density functional theory calculations. Although we found no evidence of the hot superconductivity in this ternary system, we predicted a unique compound, LaPtH$_{ 6 }$, which has equilateral triangular H$_{ 3 }$ units nearly forming a two-dimensional kagome lattice between La and Pt layers and shows the superconductivity at 18.67 K. This structure is dynamically stable from ambient pressure to at least 200 GPa and the superconducting critical temperature increases from 13.51 to 40.63 K.</description>

      <title>Large thermoelectric spin-valve effect with a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed magnetically controllable thermoelectric effects in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) structures. A tunable cryogenic thermoelectric generator needs not only a high conversion factor between electricity and heat, but also a large change in the thermoelectric output when switching the magnetic state of the device. Here, we experimentally measure and numerically model thermoelectric effects in fully epitaxial F/S/F junctions based on commercially available, easily grown materials, as well as their dependence on the magnetic configuration of the F electrodes. We observe sizeable Seebeck coefficients for the parallel alignment of the ferromagnetic electrodes, reaching values of about $100$~$\mu$V/K. Importantly, we find a decrease of the thermoelectric signal of more than an order of magnitude when switching from a parallel to an antiparallel configuration, constituting a large thermoelectric spin-valve effect. Theoretical modeling based on a self-consistent non-equilibrium Keldysh-Usadel Green function theory, combined with micromagnetic simulations, qualitatively reproduce the experimental findings. These findings pave the way for the development of efficient and versatile cryogenic thermoelectric heat engines.</description>

      <title>Vortex dynamics in the region of charge imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of vortex flows in the nonequilibrium region arising in the vicinity of phase-slip lines at the S-N boundary are investigated experimentally. It is shown that vortices continue to move when charge imbalance appears in a film that is in a dynamic mixed state. The vortex dynamics in this case is determined by the interaction of the vortices with only the superconducting component of the current. This statement is supported by a study of the dynamic mixed state in the nonequilibrium region near the S-N boundary.</description>

      <title>Operation of a high-frequency, phase-slip qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum-based Josephson junctions are currently the main sources of nonlinearity for control and manipulation of superconducting qubits. A phase-slip junction, the dual of a Josephson junction, provides an alternative source of nonlinearity that promises new types of protected qubits and the possibility of high-temperature and high-frequency operation through the use of superconductors with larger energy gaps. Phase-slip junctions have been challenging, however, to incorporate into superconducting qubits because of difficulty controlling junction parameters. Here we demonstrate the operation of a superconducting qubit based on a phase slip junction made using titanium nitride. We operate the qubit at zero flux where the qubit frequency (~17 GHz) is mainly determined by the inductance of the qubit. We perform readout and coherent control of the superconducting qubit, and measure qubit lifetimes &gt;60 $\mu$s. Finally, we demonstrate operation of the qubit at temperatures exceeding 300 mK. Our results add the phase-slip junction as a tool for superconducting quantum information processing and opens avenues for new classes of superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Pairing phase diagram for electron-doped cuprates in the square-lattice $t-U-V$ Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by significant discrepancies between experimental observations of electron-doped cuprates and numerical results of the Hubbard model, we investigate the role of nearest-neighbor (NN) electron interactions $V$ by studying the $t-U-V$ model on square lattices. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.153, by using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) method, we find that NN electron attraction $V$ can notably drive an exotic $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing, while the NN electron repulsion $V$ will suppress the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave ($d$-wave) pairing and triggers the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing. Especially in the intermediate coupling regime, as NN repulsion increases, the intensity of $d_{xy}$-wave pairing also increases, further suppressing the presence of $d$-wave pairing, which may help explain the notable suppression of $d$-wave pairing in electron-doped cuprate superconductors. Besides the pairing phase, we also find that the NN electron attraction $V$ has no significant effect on spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW), but repulsion $V$ significantly enhanced CDW and suppressed SDW. Our study suggests the $t-U-V$ Hubbard model can serve as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates. Notably, for $V/U \sim 1/4 - 1/3$, the results align more closely with the experimentally observed behavior of electron-doped systems, potentially explaining the shrinkage of $d$-wave superconductivity region and the decrease of superconducting temperature.</description>

      <title>Emergence of topological superconductivity in the presence of chiral magnetism in 2D CrInTe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for designing a two-dimensional (2D) topological superconductor (TSC) using a magnet-superconductor hybrid system. This setup involves a monolayer of CrInTe$_3$, which hosts noncoplanar magnetic textures, in proximity to a 2D $s$-wave superconducting layer. Serving as an alternative to $p$-wave superconductors, this configuration induces a topological superconducting phase and is a promising platform for realizing the 2D Kitaev model, which supports Majorana zero-energy modes through emergent $p$-wave symmetry superconducting pairing. Notably, the magnetic moments break time-reversal symmetry while the superconducting state preserves particle-hole symmetry, placing our system in the Altland-Zirnbauer class $D$ and ensuring robust Majorana excitations. We first perform density functional theory-based simulations to study a monolayer of CrInTe$_3$, from which essential magnetic characteristic parameters, such as Heisenberg exchange interaction and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), are calculated using the state-of-the-art Liechtenstein-Katsnelson-Antropov-Gubanov (LKAG) approach. With a substantial DMI coupling exhibited in CrInTe$_3$, large-scale Monte Carlo simulations reveal the stabilization of a noncoplanar spiral magnetic state as ground state. In this magnetic phase, we observe a transition from corner modes in the zero-energy local density of states (LDOS) to edge modes as the chemical potential ($\mu$) varies. Furthermore, under a finite magnetic field, the system enters a mixed magnetic state, characterized by isolated skyrmions and spiral domain walls, which lead to unique low-energy localization of electronic wave functions, rendering the system an insulator. Finally, we discuss potential experimental realizations of TSC in this magnet-superconductor interfacial system, using real-space probes such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity in hourglass Dirac chain metals (Ti, Hf)IrGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing topological superconductivity in stoichiometric materials is a key challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we report the discovery of ternary germanide superconductors, $M$IrGe ($M$ = Ti, Hf), as prime candidates for topological superconductivity, predicted to exhibit nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected hourglass Dirac chains. Using comprehensive thermodynamic and muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements, we establish these materials as conventional bulk type-II superconductors with transition temperatures of 2.24(5) K for TiIrGe and 5.64(4) K for HfIrGe, featuring a full gap and preserved time-reversal symmetry. First-principles calculations reveal striking topological features in $M$IrGe, including hourglass-shaped bulk dispersions and a Dirac chain- a ring of fourfold-degenerate Dirac points protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry. Each Dirac point corresponds to the neck of the hourglass dispersion, while the Dirac chain gives rise to drumhead-like surface states near the Fermi level. Additionally, nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology leads to isolated Dirac surface states with helical spin textures that disperse across the Fermi level, forming an ideal platform for proximity-induced topological superconductivity. The coexistence of conventional bulk superconductivity, symmetry-protected hourglass topology, and helical spin-textured surface states establishes $M$IrGe as a rare and robust platform to realize topological superconductivity, opening new avenues for next-generation quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Majorana quasiparticles in atomic spin chains on superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the past decade, Majorana quasiparticles have become one of the hot topics in condensed matter research. Besides the fundamental interest in the realization of particles being their own antiparticles, going back to basic concepts of elementary particle physics, Majorana quasiparticles in condensed matter systems offer exciting potential applications in topological quantum computation due to their non-Abelian quantum exchange statistics. Motivated by theoretical predictions about possible realizations of Majorana quasiparticles as zero-energy modes at boundaries of topological superconductors, experimental efforts have focussed in particular on quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor and magnet-superconductor hybrid systems. However, an unambiguous proof of the existence of Majorana quasiparticles is still challenging and requires considerable improvements in materials science, atomic-scale characterization and control of interface quality, as well as complementary approaches of detecting various facets of Majorana quasiparticles. Bottom-up atom-by-atom fabrication of disorder-free atomic spin chains on atomically clean superconducting substrates has recently allowed deep insight into the emergence of topological sub-gap Shiba bands and associated Majorana states from the level of individual atoms up to extended chains, thereby offering the possibility for critical tests of Majorana physics in disorder-free model-type 1D hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Revealing Higher-Order Topological Bulk-boundary Correspondence in Bismuth Crystal with Spin-helical Hinge State Loop and Proximity Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological materials are typically characterized by gapless boundary states originated from nontrivial bulk band topology, known as topological bulk-boundary correspondence. Recently, this fundamental concept has been generalized in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs). E.g., a second-order three-dimensional (3D) TI hosts one-dimensional (1D) topological hinge states winding around the crystal. However, a complete verification of higher-order topology is still lacking as it requires probing all the crystal boundaries. Here we studied a promising candidate of second-order TI, bismuth (Bi), in the form of mesoscopic crystals grown on superconducting V3Si. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we directly observed dispersive 1D states on various hinges of the crystal. Upon introducing magnetic scatterers, new scattering channels emerged selectively on certain hinges, revealing their spin-helical nature. Combining first-principle calculation and global symmetry analysis, we find these hinge states are topological and formed a closed loop encircling the crystal. This provides direct evidence on the higher-order topology in Bi. Moreover, proximity superconductivity is observed in the topological hinge states, enabling HOTI as a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Flat-Band Enhanced Antiferromagnetic Fluctuations and Superconductivity in Pressurized CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin dynamics and electronic orders of the kagome system at different filling levels stand as an intriguing subject in condensed matter physics. By first-principles calculations and random phase approximation analyses, we investigate the spin fluctuations and superconducting instabilities in kagome phase of CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ under high pressure. At the filling level slightly below the kagome flat bands, our calculations reveal strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, together with a leading $s_{\pm}$-wave and a competing ($d_{xy}$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$)-wave superconducting order. Unlike the general intuition that the flat bands are closely related to the ferromagnetic correlations, here we propose a sublattice-momentum-coupling-driven mechanism for the antiferromagnetic fluctuations enhanced from the unoccupied flat bands. The mechanism is generally applicable to kagome systems where the Fermi level intersects near the flat bands, offering a new perspective for future studies of geometrically frustrated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a numerical approach to modeling magnetoelectric effects generated by spin-orbit coupling in inhomogeneous diffusive 2D superconductors. It is based on direct minimization of the free energy of diffusion modes, including their coupling to the spin-orbit field strength, described by a recently discovered $\sigma$-model action. We explain how to retain exact conservation laws in the discretized model, and detail the numerical procedure. We apply the approach to the spin-galvanic and the inverse spin-galvanic effects in finite-size 2D superconductors, and describe short-range oscillations of circulating currents and spin densities originating from the spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Vortices and Antivortices Generation in Phase-Separated Superconductor Sn-Pb Solder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantized vortices in type-II superconductors provide insights into the mechanisms of superconductivity. However, the generation of antivortices, characterized by magnetization antiparallel to the external magnetic field, remains less understood. In this study, we investigate Sn-Pb solder, a superconductor with phase-separated Sn and Pb phases, and report the observation of both vortices and antivortices. Scanning SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) microscopy revealed the presence of both vortices and antivortices, while magneto-optical imaging demonstrated flux avalanches. Our results demonstrate that Sn in Sn-Pb solder behaves as a type-II superconductor when magnetic fluxes are trapped, despite bulk Sn being a type-I superconductor with a transition temperature (TcSn) of 3.7 K. Our findings suggest that the size effect and proximity effect with Pb contribute synergistically to induce type-II superconductivity in Sn Notably, vortices were observed at temperatures as high as 5 K, exceeding the bulk TcSn. Furthermore, the interplay between the type-I superconducting Pb phase and the type-II superconducting Sn phase results in the generation of antivortices, providing a mechanism to accommodate excess magnetic flux. This study shed light on new research on composites combining type-I and type-II superconductors.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial strain tuning of electronic and spin excitations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_{c,\text{onset}} &gt; 40$ K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) thin films under in-plane biaxial compressive strain underscores the pivotal role of epitaxial strain in tuning exotic electronic states and provides a unique platform for investigating the superconducting mechanisms in nickelate superconductors. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to probe the strain-dependent electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with biaxial strain ranging from $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$ to $1.91\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO thin film grown on LaAlO$_3$ (with $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and enhanced spin excitation bandwidth. In contrast, the 0.4 eV and 1.6 eV $dd$ excitations associated with the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ orbital, along with the spin excitations, are significantly suppressed in the film grown on SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon\approx1.91\%$). The $c$-axis compression and the reduced out-of-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle, induced by in-plane tensile strain in LNO/SrTiO$_3$ broaden the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ bandwidth and decrease the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization, thereby suppressing the $dd$ excitations. The evolution of spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, which can be attributed to the strain-tuned Ni-O-Ni bond angle. Since superconductivity is observed only in films with in-plane compressive strain ($\epsilon\sim-2\%$), the strain-dependent spin correlations align with the emergence of superconductivity, providing indirect evidence for spin-fluctuation-mediated unconventional superconductivity in LNO.</description>
