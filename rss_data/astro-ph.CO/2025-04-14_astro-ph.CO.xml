      <title>Perturbation Theory in the Minimally Extended Varying Speed of Light (meVSL) Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological perturbation theory provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the evolution of density fluctuations and gravitational potentials in the Universe. It plays a crucial role in understanding large-scale structure formation and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. In this study, we apply perturbation theory to the minimally extended varying speed of light (meVSL) model to investigate the effects of a varying speed of light on the matter density contrast and the Newtonian gravitational potential. Unlike conventional models with a constant speed of light, the meVSL model introduces modifications to the cosmological evolution equations, leading to potential deviations in structure formation and gravitational interactions. By deriving and analyzing the perturbed equations within this framework, we explore how a varying speed of light affects the growth of density perturbations and the evolution of gravitational potentials. Compared to the standard constant speed of the light model, we find deviations of approximately $2$\% in the subhorizon modes of both quantities. Although detecting these effects observationally remains a significant challenge, our results provide new theoretical insights into the meVSL model and its potential observational signatures, such as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and gravitational lensing of the CMB.</description>

      <title>Dark matter decay signals in cosmic filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic filaments form the backbone of the cosmic web, yet their properties and evolution remain uncertain. Using the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the dark matter density profiles in filaments and their implications for dark matter decay signals. We show that GeV-scale dark matter particles decaying into electron-positron pairs can produce detectable radio synchrotron emission. By leveraging stacked filament radio data, we place stringent constraints on the dark matter decay lifetime, improving existing limits by up to two orders of magnitude for strong filamentary magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>The Herschel-SPIRE Dark Field -- II. A P(D) fluctuation analysis of the deepest Herschel image of the submillimetre universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Herschel-SPIRE Dark Field is the deepest field produced by the SPIRE instrument pushing down below the galaxy confusion limit in each of the 250, 350, 500 $\mu$m bands. Standard source extraction techniques inevitably fail because of this, and we must turn to statistical methods. Here, we present a P(D) - probability of deflection - analysis of a 12$'$ diameter region of uniform coverage at the centre of the Herschel-SPIRE Dark Field. Comparing the distribution of pixel fluxes from our observations to the distributions predicted by current literature models, we find that none of the most recent models can accurately recreate our observations. Using a P(D) analysis, we produce a fitted differential source count spline with a bump in the source counts at faint flux densities, followed by a turnover at fainter fluxes, required to fit the observations. This indicates a possible missing component from the current literature models that could be interpreted perhaps as a new population of galaxies, or a missing aspect of galaxy evolution. Taking our best-fitting results, we also calculate the contribution to the cosmic infrared background (CIB) in each of the bands, which all agree with the Planck CIB measurements in this field.</description>

      <title>Multi-probe cosmology forecasts from HOD-based forward modeling of galaxy and void statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large under-dense regions in the cosmological matter density field, known as cosmic voids, are powerful probes of cosmology but their potential is currently under-exploited. Observationally, voids are identified within the large scale distribution of galaxies and are therefore sensitive to certain features of the galaxy-halo connection. This sensitivity makes the combination of void and galaxy summary statistics particularly powerful probes of both cosmology and the galaxy-halo connection through self-calibration of the void-galaxy relation. In particular the combination of void and galaxy summary statistics breaks degeneracies in the galaxy-halo connection and cosmology relative to the case of galaxy clustering alone. To demonstrate this we forecast cosmological constraints attainable from the combination of the void size function $n_v$, projected void-galaxy cross-correlation function $w_{p,vg}$ and projected galaxy auto-correlation function $w_{p,gg}$ measured in Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 5 data. We use a grid of cosmological N-body simulations to model this datavector as a function of $\sigma_8$, $\Omega_m$ and a flexible halo occupation distribution (HOD) model that includes central and satellite galaxy assembly bias. For our fiducial scenario combining $n_v$, $w_{p,vg}$ and $w_{p,gg}$ we forecast $1.5\%$ and $0.8\%$ constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ from DESI-Y5 data. We also forecast constraints from the combination of the void size function and stacked weak lensing signal of voids.</description>

      <title>Weak lensing analysis of A115, A2219 and A2261: Detection of galaxy groups and filaments around clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a weak lensing and multi-wavelength analysis of three galaxy clusters: A115, A2219, and A2261. Weak lensing is performed using shape measurements made in short 60s exposure images obtained using WIYN-ODI. Forced measurement is used to measure low Signal to Noise (SNR) sources in individual exposures. We find the weak lensing significance map recovers the galaxy clusters and most galaxy groups in the wide 40$'$ $\times$ 40$'$ field. Significant parts of the filamentary structures over this field, as indicated by the galaxy number density map, were also successfully recovered in lensing significance maps. We find the amount of structure recovery depends on both the depth and average seeing of the images. In particular, we detect a $&gt;$ 9 Mpc long structure that contains the cluster A2219. We compare our weak lensing maps with Chandra, XMM, and LOFAR observations and find that A115 and A2219 show clear signs of ongoing mergers. In particular, we find a significant separation of hot ICM and the weak lensing contours in A115. On the other hand, while A2261 appears relaxed, based on radio and X-ray analysis, we find that it is likely interacting with a structure 700 kpc SW of the main cluster. We also successfully recovered mass structures in two regions around A2261 indicated by diffuse X-ray emission in XMM images.</description>

      <title>The Luminosity Function and Clustering of H$\alpha$ Emitting Galaxies at $z\approx4-6$ from a Complete NIRCam Grism Redshift Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the luminosity function (LF) and clustering properties of 888 H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) at $3.75 &lt; z &lt; 6$ in the GOODS-N field. The sample, built from JWST CONGRESS and FRESCO NIRCam grism surveys using a novel redshift assignment algorithm, spans $\sim$62 arcmin$^2$ and reaches $L_{\rm H\alpha} \sim 10^{41.2} {\rm erg s^{-1}}$. We identify two prominent filamentary protoclusters at $z \approx 4.41$ and $z \approx 5.19$, hosting 98 and 144 HAEs, respectively. The observed H$\alpha$ LFs show similar shallow faint-end slopes for both protocluster and field galaxies at $z=3.75-5$, and for the protocluster at $z=5-6$ ($\alpha\approx 1.2$ to $-1.3$). In contrast, the field LF at $z=5-6$ is much steeper ($\alpha=-1.87_{-0.23}^{+0.30}$), suggesting that protocluster galaxies at $z &gt; 5$ are more evolved, resembling those at $z=3.75-5$. The observed star formation rate density from H$\alpha$, integrated down to 0.45 ${\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}}$, is $0.050^{+0.002}_{-0.003}$ and $0.046^{+0.006}_{-0.004} M_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z=3.75-5$ and $z=5-6$, with protoclusters contributing $\sim$25% and 55%, respectively. This implies that a large fraction of star formation at $z &gt; 4$ occurs in protoclusters. We conduct the first star-formation-rate-limited 3D clustering analysis at $z &gt; 4$. We find the filamentary protocluster geometry flattens the power-law shape of the HAE auto-correlation functions, with slopes much shallower than typically assumed. The auto-correlation function of field HAEs have correlation lengths of $r_0 = 4.61^{+1.00}_{-0.68} h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ at $z \approx 4-5$ and $r_0 = 6.23^{+1.68}_{-1.13} h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ at $z=5-6$. Comparing the observed correlation functions with the UniverseMachine simulation, we infer the dark matter (sub-)halo masses of HAEs to be $\log (M_h/M_\odot)=11.0-11.2$ at $z\approx 4-6$, with a scatter of 0.4 dex.</description>

      <title>Counting Little Red Dots at $z&lt;4$ with Ground-based Surveys and Spectroscopic Follow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Little red dots (LRDs) are a population of red, compact objects discovered by JWST at $z&gt;4$. At $4&lt;z&lt;8$, they are roughly 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars. However, their number density is uncertain at $z&lt;4$ due to the small sky coverage and limited blue wavelength coverage of JWST. We present our ground-based search for LRDs at $2\lesssim z\lesssim4$, combining ultra-deep Hyper Suprime-Cam photometry and various (near-)infrared surveys within a total area of $\sim3.1\,\mathrm{deg^{2}}$. We find that for LRDs with $M_{5500}&lt;-22.5$, their number density declines from $\sim10^{-4.5}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $z&gt;4$ to $\sim10^{-5.3}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $2.7&lt;z&lt;3.7$ and $\sim10^{-5.7}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $1.7&lt;z&lt;2.7$. We also present the Magellan/FIRE spectrum of our first followed-up candidate, DEEP23-z2LRD1 at $z_\mathrm{spec}=2.26$, as a proof of concept for our sample selection. Similar to high-redshift LRDs, the spectrum of DEEP23-z2LRD1 exhibits broad H$\alpha$ emission with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx2400\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and with nearly symmetric narrow H$\alpha$ absorption. Additionally, DEEP23-z2LRD1 has extremely narrow [OIII] lines with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx140\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, suggesting the presence of an accreting black hole in a low-mass host galaxy. Limited by the angular resolution of ground-based surveys, we emphasize that spectroscopic follow-ups are required to characterize the contamination fraction of this sample and pin down LRD number density at $z&lt;4$.</description>

      <title>From kinetic gasses to an exponentially expanding universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational field of a kinetic gas beyond its usual derivation from the second moment of the one-particle distribution function (1PDF), that serves as energy-momentum tensor in the Einstein equations. This standard procedure raises the question why the other moments of the 1PDF (which are needed to fully characterize the kinematical properties of the gas) do not contribute to the gravitational field and what could be their relevance in addressing the dark energy problem? Using the canonical coupling of the entire 1PDF to Finsler spacetime geometry via the Finsler gravity equation, we show that these higher moments contribute non-trivially. A Finslerian geometric description of our universe allows us to determine not only the scale factor but also of the causal structure dynamically. We find that already a Finslerian vacuum solution naturally permits an exponential expanding universe, without the need for a cosmological constant or any additional quantities. This solution possesses a causal structure which is a mild deformation of the causal structure of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry; close to the rest frame defined by cosmological time (i.e., for slowly moving objects), the causal structures of the two geometries are nearly indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>Numerical evolution of Maxwell's equations for wavefronts propagating through a spherical gravitational potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scheme for numerically solving Maxwell's equations in a weakly perturbed spacetime without introducing the usual geometric optics approximation. Using this scheme, we study light propagation through a spherical perturbation of a stationary metric in the linear limit. Going beyond geometric approximation allows us to explore the wave optics effects that occur when the wavefront propagates through the gravitational potential. We find that the wavefront breaks on the gravitational potential due to the Shapiro time delay, i.e. due to the slowing down of light when propagating in an inhomogeneous spacetime. This again leads to constructive interference, resulting in a persistent frequency dependent amplification of parts of the wave amplitude. When the wave length is shorter than a certain threshold set by the induced gravitational mass, the waves are reflected on the curvature gradient.</description>

      <title>Asteroid-mass soliton as the dark matter-baryon coincidence solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations have largely ruled out macroscopic dark matter across a wide range of masses, leaving an experimentally interesting window in the asteroid-mass region. Yet, theoretical motivation for this mass window is still insufficient. We initiate a new pattern of nontopological solitons, where a charge asymmetry is inherited from baryogenesis and later trapped by a first-order phase transition. This pattern makes the solitons coincident dark matter that provides new explanations for the coincidence problem between baryon and dark matter energy densities. Coincident soliton dark matter miraculously resides in the asteroid-mass window if strong gravitational waves reach the detection region, providing a strong motivation for macroscopic dark matter within this window. For the first time, we provide a realistic neutrino-ball scenario that solves the baryon asymmetry, dark matter, and neutrino mass problems. New particles are below the electroweak scale, and observable signals are correlated, including lensing effects, gravitational waves, and soliton evaporation/collision.</description>

      <title>First confirmation of anisotropic halo bias from statistically anisotropic matter distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We confirm for the first time the existence of distinctive halo bias associated with the quadrupolar type of statistical anisotropy (SA) of the linear matter density field using cosmological $N$-body simulations. We find that the coefficient of the SA-induced bias for cluster-sized halos takes negative values and exhibits a decreasing trend with increasing halo mass. This results in the quadrupole halo power spectra in a statistically anisotropic universe being less amplified compared to the monopole spectra. The anisotropic feature in halo bias that we found presents a promising new tool for testing the hypothesis of a statistically anisotropic universe, with significant implications for the precise verification of anisotropic inflation scenarios and vector dark matter and dark energy models.</description>

      <title>DESI constraints on $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent results on the baryon acoustic oscillations measurements from the DESI collaboration have shown tantalizing hints for a time-evolving dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$, with a statistically significant deviation from the cosmological constant and cold dark matter $\Lambda$CDM model. One of the simplest and theoretically well-motivated plausible candidates to explain the observed behavior of $w(z)$, is scalar-field quintessence. Here, we consider a class of models known as $\alpha$-attractor, which describe in a single framework both inflation and the late-time acceleration of the Universe. Using the recent DESI data, in conjunction with other cosmological observations, we place stringent constraints on $\alpha$-attractor models and compare them to the $\Lambda$CDM model. We find the $\alpha$ parameter of the theory, which is physically motivated from supergravity and supersymmetry theories to have the values $3\alpha \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$, is constrained to be $\alpha\simeq 1.89_{-0.35}^{+0.40}$. In addition, we find that the rest of the cosmological parameters of the model agree with the corresponding values of $\Lambda$CDM, while a Bayesian analysis finds strong support in favor of the $\alpha$-attractor model. We also highlight an interesting connection between the $\alpha$-attractor models and the stochastic gravitational wave background, where a contribution to the latter could derive from an enhancement of inflationary gravitational waves at high frequencies due to an early kination phase, thus providing an interesting alternative way to constrain the theory.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts as probes of the late-time universe: a new insight on the Hubble tension</title>

Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transient events, a subset of which have been localized to their host galaxies. Their high dispersion measures offer valuable insights into the ionized plasma along their line of sight, enabling them to serve as probes of cosmological parameters. One of the major challenges in contemporary cosmology is the Hubble tension -- an unresolved discrepancy between two independent methods of determining the Universe's expansion rate, yielding differing values for the Hubble constant. In this study, we analyze a sample of 64 extragalactic, localized FRBs observed by various telescopes, employing Bayesian analysis with distinct likelihood functions. Our findings suggest that FRBs serve as tracers of the Hubble constant in the late-time Universe. Notably, our results exhibit smaller error bars compared to previous studies, and the derived Hubble constant with 1$\sigma$ error bars no longer overlap with those obtained from early-Universe measurements. These results underscore the continuing tension between early- and late-time measurements of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Ten-parameter simulation suite for cosmological emulation beyond $\Lambda$CDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Goku, a suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations, and the corresponding 10-dimensional emulator, GokuEmu, for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. The simulations span the base parameters of $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology and its extensions, including dynamical dark energy ($w_0$, $w_a$), the sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu$), the effective number of neutrinos ($N_\text{eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_\text{s}$), enabling tests of new physics with data from upcoming surveys like the Roman Space Telescope, Euclid, and LSST. Designed within the MF-Box framework, which integrates multi-scale and multi-fidelity simulations, the suite includes high-fidelity simulations evolving $3000^3$ particles in $1\,(\text{Gpc}/h)^3$ volumes and low-fidelity simulations with $750^3$ particles across varying box sizes. This approach achieves percent-level accuracy in high-likelihood regions and 5% accuracy across broader parameter ranges, while reducing computational costs by 94% compared to single-fidelity methods. The simulations adopt an accurate treatment of massive neutrinos, enhancing predictions of the matter power spectrum on nonlinear scales. Key innovations include an adaptive sampling strategy and the use of beam search to optimize generalization accuracy. The emulator is valid for redshifts $z \leq 3$ and scales $0.01 \lesssim k / (h \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}) \lesssim 10$. Beyond the matter power spectrum, the simulations also support analyses of other statistical measures, such as the halo mass function. The emulator and its training data are publicly available at https://github.com/astro-YYH/GokuEmu, providing a valuable resource for cosmological parameter inference and model testing.</description>

      <title>Robustness of dark energy phenomenology across different parameterizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI, in combination with other cosmological data, has generated significant interest in understanding the nature of dark energy and its underlying microphysics. However, interpreting these results critically depends on how dark energy is parameterized. This paper examines the robustness of conclusions about the viability of particular kinds of dynamical dark energy models to the choice of parameterization, focusing on four popular two-parameter models: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), and exponential (EXP) parameterizations. We find that conclusions regarding the viability of minimally and non-minimally coupled quintessence models are independent of the parameterization adopted. We demonstrate this both by mapping these dark energy models into the $(w_0, w_a)$ parameter space defined by these various parameterizations and by showing that all of these parameterizations can equivalently account for the phenomenology predicted by these dark energy models to a high degree of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Has DESI detected exponential quintessence?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The new Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 results have strengthened the possibility that dark energy is dynamical, i.e., it has evolved over the history of the Universe. One simple, but theoretically well motivated and widely studied, physical model of dynamical dark energy is minimally coupled, single-field quintessence $\phi$ with an exponential potential $V(\phi)=V_0\,e^{-\lambda\phi}$. We perform a full Bayesian statistical analysis of the model using the DESI DR2 data, in combination with other cosmological observations, to constrain the model's parameters and to compare its goodness of fit to that of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We find that the quintessence model provides a significantly better fit to the data, both when the spatial curvature of the Universe is fixed to zero and when it is allowed to vary. The significance of the preference varies between $\sim3.3\sigma$ and $\sim3.8\sigma$, depending on whether the curvature density parameter $\Omega_K$ is fixed or varied. We obtain the values $0.698^{+0.173}_{-0.202}$ and $0.722^{+0.182}_{-0.208}$ at the $68.3\%$ (i.e., $1\sigma$) confidence level for the parameter $\lambda$ in the absence and presence of $\Omega_K$, respectively, which imply $\sim3.5\sigma$ preference for a nonzero $\lambda$. We also obtain $\Omega_K=0.003\pm 0.001$, which implies $\sim3\sigma$ preference for a positive $\Omega_K$, i.e., a negative curvature. Finally, we discuss the differences between quintessence and phenomenological parametrizations of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, in particular the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, as well as a few caveats to our results.</description>

      <title>Galaxy and halo properties around cosmic filaments from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 and the ELUCID simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) along with haloes from the dark matter only constrained ELUCID (Exploring the Local Universe with the reConstructed Initial Density field) simulation, we examine the properties of galaxies and haloes with respect to their distance to cosmic filaments, determined by the medial-axis thinning technique of the COsmic Web Skeleton (COWS) method. Our findings suggest that galaxies or subhaloes grow in mass as they approach these filaments. Galaxies exhibit a redder colour and diminished specific star formation rates as they approach these filaments. Additionally, older subhaloes tend to be more common near the central regions of these filaments. Elliptical galaxies are more frequently found than spiral galaxies in the central regions of the filaments. Lower-mass galaxies typically display reduced sizes in proximity to filaments, whereas higher-mass galaxies tend to exhibit increased sizes when close to filaments. Moreover, the concentration and spin of the haloes grow as they approach the filaments. These findings support the notion that the large-scale structure of the universe, characterized by cosmic web structures, plays a vital role in shaping galaxy and halo properties.</description>

      <title>On the Schwinger effect during axion inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair-creation of charged particles in a strong gauge-field background - the renowned Schwinger effect - can strongly alter the efficiency of gauge-field production during axion inflation. It is therefore crucial to have a clear understanding and proper description of this phenomenon to obtain reliable predictions for the physical observables in this model. In the present work, we revisit the problem of Schwinger pair production during axion inflation in the presence of both electric and magnetic fields and improve on the state of the art in two ways: (i) taking into account that the electric- and magnetic-field three-vectors are in general not collinear, we derive the vector decomposition of the Schwinger-induced current in terms of these fields and determine the corresponding effective electric and magnetic conductivities; (ii) by identifying the physical momentum scale associated with the pair-creation process, we incorporate Schwinger damping of the gauge field in a scale-dependent fashion in the relevant equations of motion. Implementing this new description in the framework of the gradient-expansion formalism, we obtain numerical results in a benchmark scenario of axion inflation and perform a comprehensive comparison with earlier results in the literature. In some cases, the resulting energy densities of the produced gauge fields differ from the old results by more than one order of magnitude, which reflects the importance of taking the new effects into account.</description>

      <title>Magnetically assisted vorticity production in decaying acoustic turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study vorticity production in isothermal, subsonic, acoustic (nonvortical), and decaying turbulence due to the presence of magnetic fields. Using three-dimensional numerical simulations, we find that the resulting kinetic energy cascade follows the ordinary Kolmogorov phenomenology involving a constant spectral energy flux. The nondimensional prefactor for acoustic turbulence is larger than the standard Kolmogorov constant due to the inefficient dissipation of kinetic energy. We also find that the Lorentz force can drive vortical motions even when the initial field is uniform, by converting a fraction of the acoustic energy into vortical energy. This conversion is shown to be quadratic in the magnetic field strength and linear in the acoustic flow speed. By contrast, the direct production of vortical motions by a non-force-free magnetic field is linear in the field strength. Our results suggest that magnetic fields play a crucial role in vorticity production in cosmological flows, particularly in scenarios where significant acoustic turbulence is prevalent. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the early Universe, where magnetic fields may convert acoustic turbulence generated during cosmological phase transitions into vortical turbulence.</description>

      <title>Measuring anisotropies in the PTA band with cross-correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical gravitational wave background in the nanohertz (nHz) band is expected to be primarily composed of the superposition of signals from binaries of supermassive black holes. The spatial discreteness of these sources introduces shot noise, which, in certain regimes, would overwhelm efforts to measure the anisotropy of the gravitational wave background. Moreover, the fact the time-residual map has a finite angular resolution and the presence of pulsar noise, affects our ability to construct the angular power spectrum of the anisotropy from a time-residual map (finite resolution noise). In this work, we explicitly demonstrate, starting from first principles, that cross-correlating a gravitational wave background map with a sufficiently dense galaxy survey can mitigate this issue. This approach could potentially reveal underlying properties of the gravitational wave background that would otherwise remain obscured. We quantify both the shot noise and the finite resolution noise level and show that cross-correlating the gravitational wave background with a galaxy catalog improves by more than one order of magnitude the prospects for a first detection of the background anisotropy by a gravitational wave observatory operating in the nHz frequency range. In particular, we find that with a futuristic scenario with an effective number of frequencies equal to $N_f=10$, the detection of the spectral amplitude can be achieved combining the first $20$ multipoles, with a threshold to resolve single events SKA-like. Increasing observation time, pulsar number or reducing the pulsar white noise considerably improves the detection significance.</description>

      <title>Near-field imaging of local interference in radio interferometric data: Impact on the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio-frequency interference (RFI) is a major systematic limitation in radio astronomy, particularly for science cases requiring high sensitivity, such as 21 cm cosmology. Traditionally, RFI is dealt with by identifying its signature in the dynamic spectra of visibility data and flagging strongly affected regions. However, for RFI sources that do not occupy narrow regions in the time-frequency space, such as persistent local RFI, modeling these sources could be essential to mitigating their impact. This paper introduces two methods for detecting and characterizing local RFI sources from radio interferometric visibilities: matched filtering and maximum a posteriori (MAP) imaging. These algorithms use the spherical wave equation to construct three-dimensional near-field image cubes of RFI intensity from the visibilities. The matched filter algorithm can generate normalized maps by cross-correlating the expected contributions from RFI sources with the observed visibilities, while the MAP method performs a regularized inversion of the visibility equation in the near field. We developed a full polarization simulation framework for RFI and demonstrated the methods on simulated observations of local RFI sources. The stability, speed, and errors introduced by these algorithms were investigated, and, as a demonstration, the algorithms were applied to a subset of NenuFAR observations to perform spatial, spectral, and temporal characterization of two local RFI sources. We used simulations to assess the impact of local RFI on images, the uv plane, and cylindrical power spectra, and to quantify the level of bias introduced by the algorithms in order to understand their implications for the estimated 21 cm power spectrum with radio interferometers. The near-field imaging and simulation codes are publicly available in the Python library nfis.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Reconstruction of Large-Scale Structure from Combined Photometric and Spectroscopic Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy surveys are crucial for studying large-scale structure (LSS) and cosmology, yet they face limitations--imaging surveys provide extensive sky coverage but suffer from photo-$z$ uncertainties, while spectroscopic surveys yield precise redshifts but are sample-limited. To take advantage of both photo-$z$ and spec-$z$ data while eliminating photo-$z$ errors, we propose a deep learning framework based on a dual UNet architecture that integrates these two datasets at the field level to reconstruct the 3D photo-$z$ density field. We train the network on mock samples representative of stage-IV spectroscopic surveys, utilizing CosmicGrowth simulations with a $z=0.59$ snapshot containing $2048^3$ particles in a $(1200~h^{-1}\rm Mpc)^3$ volume. Several metrics, including correlation coefficient, MAE, MSE, PSNR, and SSIM, validate the model's accuracy. Moreover, the reconstructed power spectrum closely matches the ground truth at small scales ($k \gtrsim 0.06~h/\rm Mpc$) within the $1\sigma$ confidence level, while the UNet model significantly improves the estimation of photo-$z$ power spectrum multipoles. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning to enhance LSS reconstruction by using both spectroscopic and photometric data.</description>
