      <title>Spontaneous rolling on a 90 degree incline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On perfectly vertical surfaces, rolling is conventionally deemed impossible without external torque. While various species like geckos and spiders exhibit vertical locomotion, they cannot achieve rolling; instead, they fall. In this study, we demonstrate the spontaneous rolling of an elastic polyacrylamide sphere on an elastic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate held vertically at a 90 degree incline, given specific elasticity values for the materials. Our experiments uncover a slow rolling motion induced by a dynamically changing contact diameter and a unique contact asymmetry. The advancing edge behaves like a closing crack, while the receding edge acts as an opening crack. Utilizing adhesion hysteresis theories and crack propagation models, we explain how this contact asymmetry generates the necessary torque and friction to maintain rolling, preventing either pinning or falling. The findings challenge the traditional understanding of vertical surface interactions and open new avenues for exploring soft-on-soft contact systems. This novel phenomenon has potential implications for designing advanced materials and understanding biological locomotion on vertical surfaces.</description>

      <title>Adaptive dynamics of Ising spins in one dimension leveraging Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A one-dimensional flocking model using active Ising spins is studied, where the system evolves through the reinforcement learning approach \textit{via} defining state, action, and cost function for each spin. The orientation of spin with respect to its neighbouring spins defines its state. The state of spin is updated by altering its spin orientation in accordance with the $\varepsilon$-greedy algorithm (action) and selecting a finite step from a uniform distribution to update position. The $\varepsilon$ parameter is analogous to the thermal noise in the system. The cost function addresses cohesion among the spins. By exploring the system in the plane of the self-propulsion speed and $\varepsilon$ parameter, four distinct phases are found: disorder, flocking, flipping, and oscillatory. In the flipping phase, a condensed flock reverses its direction of motion stochastically. The mean reversal time $\langle T \rangle $ exponentially decays with $\varepsilon$. A new phase, an oscillatory phase, is also found, which is a chaotic phase with a positive Lyapunov exponent.
  The findings obtained from the reinforcement learning approach for the active Ising model system exhibit similarities with the outcomes of other conventional techniques, even without defining any explicit interaction among the spins.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and exceptional points in nonreciprocal active polar mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological and synthetic active matter systems consist of different particle types that interact via nonreciprocal couplings. A striking consequence of such interactions is the spontaneous emergence of time-dependent states that break parity-time symmetry. On the field-theoretical level, the transition to these states is marked by so-called exceptional points. However, their precise impact on observable particle dynamics remains poorly understood. In this study, we address this gap by providing a scale-bridging view of a minimal active mixture with nonreciprocal polar interactions. We find that nonreciprocity induces chiral motion on the particle level, yet no full, homogeneous synchronization. Instead, we observe various behaviors, ranging from fully synchronized clusters to chimera-like states. The nonreciprocity-induced spontaneous chirality increases with the degree of nonreciprocity and peaks at coupling strengths associated with exceptional points.</description>

      <title>Simulating phase inversion processes by coupled map lattice: Towards the theoretical design of food texture and quality in dairy processing from fresh cream to butter via whipped cream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical model and simulation for the formation dynamics of diverse texture patterns that emerge spontaneously or self-organize during phase inversion processes of fresh cream by mechanical whipping. The results suggest that the model should be applied for theoretically designing the texture and quality of whipped cream and butter products. The modeling complexity in phase inversion processes from fresh cream via whipped cream to butter was overcome by using a well-established complex systems approach, coupled map lattice (CML). The proposed CML consists of a minimal set of procedures (i.e., parameterized nonlinear maps), whipping, coalescence, and flocculation, acting on the appropriately coarse-grained field variables, surface energy, cohesive energy, and velocity (flow) of the emulsion defined on a two-dimensional square lattice. In the CML simulations, two well-known and different phase inversion processes are reproduced at high and low whipping temperatures. The overrun and viscosity changes simulated in these processes are at least qualitatively consistent with those observed in experiments. We characterize these processes exhibiting different texture patterns as the viscosity dominance at high whipping temperature and as the overrun dominance at low whipping temperature on the viscosity-overrun plane, which is one of the state diagrams.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Mechanical Metamaterials Using a Point-Cloud-Based Deep Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials have garnered attention for their engineered mechanical properties, enabling control over specific behaviors. Advances in additive manufacturing have expanded design freedom for complex metamaterials. However, the design process remains challenging due to vast design space and numerous parameters. While artificial intelligence (AI) aids design, current approaches are often restricted to predefined, parameterized structures. This study introduces a parameter-free design strategy for 3D mechanical metamaterials using point-cloud-based deep generative networks. A library of widely known metamaterial structures was constructed to train the machine learning model. The trained latent space forms clusters of unit cell topologies with similar properties, enabling efficient exploration and smooth interpolation. Additionally, mechanical properties can be predicted more faster than with conventional methods. This approach created metamaterials with targeted properties, unrestricted by parameterized constraints. Computational and experimental validations confirmed alignment with desired properties within acceptable error margins. We believe this work significantly enhances design flexibility in AI-driven metamaterials, expanding their potential applications across various fields.</description>

      <title>Predictive orientational phase behavior in convex polyhedral entropic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard convex polyhedra, idealized models for anisotropic colloids and nanoparticles, are known to form variety of orientational phases despite the regular arrangement of particles in the crystalline assemblies. Based on the orientational behavior of the constituents particles, such phases could be categorized into freely rotating plastic crystals (PC), discrete plastic crystals (DPC) and orientationally ordered crystals (OC). In this article, we report an extensive Monte Carlo computer simulation study of sixty hard convex polyhedral shape indicating a direct predictive relationship between the nature of orientational phases in the crystalline assemblies and single-particle shape attributes. The influence of three attributes namely; (i) Isoperimetric Quotient (IQ) i.e., the extent of asphericity; (ii) isotropy of the moment of inertia tensor in the principal frame and (iii) number of symmetry operations in the point group of the particle and self-assembled crystal structure, were observed to control the orientational phase behavior of the entire solid region in many-body system. The translational order in the crystal appeared to play significant role only in the DPC phase, where as, other two phases were completely governed by the combination of two attributes. In this study, the role of shape attributes were characterized by sequential appearance of one or two of the aforementioned rotational phases across the phase diagram in a pressure dependent manner which could be regarded as an important stepping stone towards fully predictive self-assembly behavior of hard particle systems.</description>

      <title>The 2024 Motile Active Matter Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activity and autonomous motion are fundamental aspects of many living and engineering systems. Here, the scale of biological agents covers a wide range, from nanomotors, cytoskeleton, and cells, to insects, fish, birds, and people. Inspired by biological active systems, various types of autonomous synthetic nano- and micromachines have been designed, which provide the basis for multifunctional, highly responsive, intelligent active materials. A major challenge for understanding and designing active matter is their inherent non-equilibrium nature due to persistent energy consumption, which invalidates equilibrium concepts such as free energy, detailed balance, and time-reversal symmetry. Furthermore, interactions in ensembles of active agents are often non-additive and non-reciprocal. An important aspect of biological agents is their ability to sense the environment, process this information, and adjust their motion accordingly. It is an important goal for the engineering of micro-robotic systems to achieve similar functionality. With many fundamental properties of motile active matter now reasonably well understood and under control, the ground is prepared for the study of physical aspects and mechanisms of motion in complex environments, of the behavior of systems with new physical features like chirality, of the development of novel micromachines and microbots, of the emergent collective behavior and swarming of intelligent self-propelled particles, and of particular features of microbial systems. The vast complexity of phenomena and mechanisms involved in the self-organization and dynamics of motile active matter poses major challenges, which can only be addressed by a truly interdisciplinary effort involving scientists from biology, chemistry, ecology, engineering, mathematics, and physics.</description>

      <title>A potassium ion channel simulated with a universal neural network potential</title>

Abstract: Potassium ion channels are critical components of biology. They conduct potassium ions across the cell membrane with remarkable speed and selectivity. Understanding how they do this is crucially important for applications in neuroscience, medicine, and materials science. However, many fundamental questions about the mechanism they use remain unresolved, partly because it is extremely difficult to computationally model due to the scale and complexity of the necessary simulations. Here, the selectivity filter (SF) of the KcsA potassium ion channel is simulated using Orb-D3, a recently released universal neural network potential. A previously unreported hydrogen bond between water in the SF and the T75 hydroxyl side group at the entrance to the SF is observed. This hydrogen bond appears to stabilize water in the SF, enabling a soft knock-on transport mechanism where water is co-transported through the SF with a reasonable conductivity (80 $\pm$ 20 pS). Carbonyl backbone flipping is also observed at new sites in the SF. This work demonstrates the potential of universal neural network potentials to provide insights into previously intractable questions about complex systems far outside their training data distribution.</description>

      <title>Inertial Dynamics of Run-and-Tumble Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a single inertial run-and-tumble particle on a straight line. The motion of this particle is characterized by two intrinsic time-scales, namely, an inertial and an active time-scale. We show that interplay of these two time-scales leads to the emergence of four distinct regimes, characterized by different dynamical behaviour of mean-squared displacement and survival probability. We analytically compute the position distributions in these regimes when the two time-scales are well separated. We show that in the large-time limit, the distribution has a large deviation form and compute the corresponding large deviation function analytically. We also find the persistence exponents in the different regimes theoretically. All our results are supported with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Kirchhoff's analogy for a planar ferromagnetic rod</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kirchhoff's kinetic analogy relates the equilibrium solutions of an elastic rod or strip to the motion of a spinning top. In this analogy, time is replaced by the arc length parameter in the phase portrait to determine the equilibrium configurations of the rod. Predicted equilibrium solutions from the phase portrait for specific boundary value problems, as well as certain localized solutions, have been experimentally observed. In this study, we employ the kinetic analogy to investigate the equilibrium solutions of planar soft ferromagnetic rods subjected to transverse and longitudinal external magnetic fields. Our analysis reveals a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation in the phase portrait of a ferromagnetic rod subjected to transverse external magnetic field as the axial load is decreased continuously from a large compressive load. Similarly, a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation is observed in the case of longitudinal external magnetic field. We predict equilibrium configurations for a free-standing soft ferromagnetic elastic rod and the same subjected to canonical boundary conditions. Furthermore, we observe novel localized equilibrium solutions arising from homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, which are absent in the phase portraits of purely elastic rods.</description>

      <title>Geometric theory of (extended) time-reversal symmetries in stochastic processes -- Part II: field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the time-reversal properties of a generic Markovian stochastic field dynamics with Gaussian noise. We introduce a convenient functional geometric formalism that allows us to straightforwardly generalize known results from finite dimensional systems to the case of continuous fields. We give, at field level, full reversibility conditions for three notions of time-reversal defined in the first article of this two-part series, namely T-, MT-, and EMT-reversibility. When the noise correlator is invertible, these reversibility conditions do not make reference to any generically unknown function like the stationary probability, and can thus be verified systematically. Focusing on the simplest of these notions, where only the time variable is flipped upon time reversal, we show that time-reversal symmetry breaking is quantified by a single geometric object: the vorticity two-form, which is a two-form over the functional space $\mathbb{F}$ to which the field belongs. Reversibility then amounts to the cancellation of this vorticity two-form. This condition applies at distributional level and can thus be difficult to use in practice. For fields that are defined on a spatial domain of dimension $d=1$, we overcome this problem by building a basis of the space of two-forms $\Omega^2(\mathbb{F})$. Reversibility is then equivalent to the vanishing of the vorticity's coordinates in this basis, a criterion that is readily applicable to concrete examples. Furthermore, we show that this basis provides a natural direct-sum decomposition of $\Omega^2(\mathbb{F})$, each subspace of which is associated with a distinctive kind of phenomenology. This decomposition enables a classification of celebrated out-of-equilibrium phenomena, ranging from non-reciprocal (chaser/chased) interactions to the flocking of active agents, dynamical reaction-diffusion patterns, (...)</description>

Abstract: Using the rigid dipole model, we study the translational and rotational motions of single-domain fer-romagnetic nanoparticles in a dilute suspension induced by the harmonically oscillating gradient magnetic field in the presence of a time-independent uniform magnetic field. Our approach is based on a set of the first-order differential equations that describe the time dependencies of the particle coordinate and mag-netization angle. We find the asymptotic solutions of this set of equations at small and large times and, by applying the matched asymptotic expansions for discrete times, derive analytical expressions for the aver-age particle coordinate and velocity.</description>

      <title>Diffusionless relaxation of half-skyrmion liquid, hexatic, and crystalline states in a chiral molecular crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particles in a crowded environment exhibit slow anomalous diffusion, and their efficient manipulation is important in controlling transport phenomena in complex materials. Skyrmions and half-skyrmions, spatially localized quasiparticles observed in magnetic systems and liquid crystals, also exhibit diffusive motion. They exhibit normal diffusion in dilute conditions. However, the cooperative dynamics and diffusion of skyrmions and half-skyrmions in their condensed liquid, hexatic, and crystalline phases are elusive. Here we show in the half-skyrmion condensed phases that the fusion and fission of half-skyrmions, not their diffusion, are responsible for the primary structural relaxation. The fusion and fission occur due to the non-conserved nature of the quasiparticle number density. The diffusion, which contributes to the secondary structural relaxation, is suppressed by cages formed by surrounding half-skyrmions, whereas enhanced by Mermin-Wagner fluctuation characteristic to two-dimensional systems, leading to subdiffusive motion. Large displacement of half-skyrmions is locally excited by fusion-fission and bond-breaking between adjacent half-skyrmions via heterogeneous elastic fields. Furthermore, the motion of half-skyrmions couples with transverse and longitudinal sound wave excitation differently, where the transverse sound wave is more attenuated than the longitudinal one due to the coupling between transverse sound wave and half-skyrmion deformation. We also discuss the {relationship} between half-skyrmion diffusion in our system and skyrmion diffusion in magnetic systems. Our result provides a qualitative difference in dynamical properties between half-skyrmion gaseous and condensed phases, suggesting the efficient manipulation of high-density half-skyrmions and skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Generalizing multiple memories from a single drive: The hysteron latch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Far-from-equilibrium systems can form memories of previous deformations or driving. In systems from sheared glassy materials to buckling beams to crumpled sheets, this behavior is dominated by return-point memory, in which revisiting a past extremum of driving restores the system to a previous state. Cyclic driving with both positive and negative strains forms multiple nested memories -- as in a single-dial combination lock -- while asymmetric driving (only positive strain) cannot. We study this case in a general model of hysteresis that considers discrete elements called hysterons. We show how two hysterons with a frustrated interaction can violate return-point memory, realizing multiple memories of asymmetric driving. This reveals a general principle for designing systems that store sequences of cyclic driving, whether symmetric or asymmetric. In disordered systems, asymmetric driving is a sensitive tool for the direct measurement of frustration.</description>

      <title>Understanding orientational disorder in crystalline assemblies of hard convex polyhedra</title>

Abstract: Spontaneous self-assembly of hard convex polyhedra are known to form orientationally disordered crystalline phases, where particle orientations do not follow the same pattern as the positional arrangement of the crystal. A distinct type of orientational phase with discrete rotational mobility has been reported in hard particle systems. In this paper, we present a new analysis method for characterizing orientational phase of a crystal, which is based on algorithmic detection of unique orientations. Using this method we collected complete statistics of discrete orientations along the Monte Carlo simulation trajectories and observed that particles were equally partitioned among them, with specific values of pairwise orientational differences. These features remained constant across the pressure range and did not depend on rotational mobility. The discrete mobility was characteristic of a distinct equilibrium thermodynamic phase, qualitatively different from the freely rotating plastic phase with continuous orientations. The high pressure behavior with frozen particle orientations was part of that the same description and not a non-equilibrium arrested state. We introduced a precise notion of orientational order and demonstrated that the system was maximally disordered at the level of unit cell, even though individual particles could only take few discrete orientations. We report the existence of this phase in five polyhedral shapes and in systematically curated shape families constructed around two of them. The symmetry mismatch between the particle and the crystallographic point groups was found to be a predictive indicator for the occurrence of this phase.</description>

      <title>Inverse Measurements in Active Nematics</title>

Abstract: We present a framework to take new measurements in nematic systems that contain active elements such as molecular motors. Spatio-temporal fields of stress, traction, velocity, pressure, and forces are estimated jointly from microscopy images alone. Our inverse-problem approach ensures that these fields comply with physical laws and are accurate at system boundaries. Our novel measurements in active biological materials provide new insight for the design of boundary-aware nematic systems. The shear stress at the wall unveils a correlation with the nucleation of topological defects. The pressure gradients and the velocity characterize how boundary effects drive system-wide dynamics. And the forces link the underlying fluid with the nematic tensor to reveal the time scales of the system. More broadly, our work establishes a generalizable approach to quantitatively study experimental systems that are inaccessible to measuring probes.</description>

      <title>Salt Effects on Ionic Conductivity Mechanisms in Ethylene Carbonate Electrolytes: Interplay of Viscosity and Ion-ion Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intricate role of shear viscosity and ion-pair relaxations on ionic conductivity mechanisms and the underlying changes induced by salt concentration ($c$) in organic liquid electrolytes remain poorly understood despite their widespread technological importance. Using molecular dynamics simulations employing nonpolarizable force fields for $c$ ranging between 10$^{-3}$ to 10$^1$ M, we show that the low and high $c$ regimes of the EC-LiTFSI electrolytes are distinctly characterized by $\eta\sim\tau_c^{1/2}$ and $\eta\sim\tau_c^{1}$, where $\eta$ and $\tau_c$ are shear viscosity and cation-anion relaxation timescales, respectively. Our extensive simulations and analyses suggest a universal relationship between the ionic conductivity and $c$ as $\sigma(c)\sim c^{\alpha}e^{-c/c_{0}} (\alpha&gt;0)$. The proposed relationship convincingly explains the ionic conductivity over a wide range of $c$, where the term $c^\alpha$ accounts for the uncorrelated motion of ions and $e^{-c/c_0}$ captures the salt-induced changes in shear viscosity. Our simulations suggest vehicular mechanism to be dominant at low $c$ regime which transitions into a structural diffusion mechanism at high $c$ regime, where structural relaxation is the dominant form of ion transport mechanism. Our findings shed light on some of the fundamental aspects of the ion conductivity mechanisms in liquid electrolytes, offering insights into optimizing the ion transport in EC-LiTFSI electrolytes.</description>

      <title>How to define temperature in active systems?</title>

Abstract: We are used to measure temperature with a thermometer and we know from everyday life that different types of thermometers measure the same temperature. This experience can be based on equilibrium thermodynamics, which explains the equivalence of different possibilities to define temperature. In contrast, for systems out of equilibrium such as active matter, measurements performed with different thermometers can generally lead to different temperature values. In the present work, we systematically compare different possibilities to define temperature for active systems. Based on simulations and theory for inertial active Brownian particles, we find that different temperatures generally lead to different temperature values, as expected. Remarkably, however, we find that different temperatures not only lead to the same values near equilibrium (low P\'eclet number or high particle mass), but even far from equilibrium, several different temperatures approximately coincide. In particular, we find that the kinetic temperature, the configurational temperature, and temperatures based on higher moments of the velocity distribution constitute a class of temperatures that all assume very similar values over a wide parameter range. Notably, the effective temperature and temperatures exploiting the virial theorem, the Stokes-Einstein relation, or a harmonic confinement form a second class of temperatures whose values approximately coincide with each other but which strongly differ from those of the first class. Finally, we identify advantages and disadvantages of the different possibilities to define temperature and discuss their relevance for measuring the temperature of active systems.</description>

      <title>Synchronized motion of gold nanoparticles in an optothermal trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers have revolutionized particle manipulation at the micro- and nanoscale, playing a critical role in fields such as plasmonics, biophysics, and nanotechnology. While traditional optical trapping methods primarily rely on optical forces to manipulate and organize particles, recent studies suggest that optothermal traps in surfactant solutions can induce unconventional effects such as enhanced trapping stiffness and increased diffusion. Thus, there is a need for further exploration of this system to gain a deeper understanding of the forces involved. This work investigates the behaviour of gold nanoparticles confined in an optothermal trap around a heated anchor particle in a surfactant (CTAC) solution. We observe unexpected radial confinement and synchronized rotational diffusion of particles at micrometre-scale separations from the anchor particle. These dynamics differ from known optical binding and thermophoretic effects, suggesting unexplored forces facilitated by the surfactant environment. This study expands the understanding of optothermal trapping driven by anchor plasmonic particles and introduces new possibilities for nanoparticle assembly, offering insights with potential applications in nanoscale fabrication and materials science.</description>
