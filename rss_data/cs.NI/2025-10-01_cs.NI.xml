      <title>Oh-Trust: Overbooking and Hybrid Trading-empowered Resource Scheduling with Smart Reputation Update over Dynamic Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incentive-driven computing resource sharing is crucial for meeting the ever-growing demands of emerging mobile applications. Although conventional spot trading offers a solution, it frequently leads to excessive overhead due to the need for real-time trading related interactions. Likewise, traditional futures trading, which depends on historical data, is susceptible to risks from network dynamics. This paper explores a dynamic and uncertain edge network comprising a computing platform, e.g., an edge server, that offers computing services as resource seller, and various types of mobile users with diverse resource demands as buyers, including fixed buyers (FBs) and uncertain occasional buyers (OBs) with fluctuating needs. To facilitate efficient and timely computing services, we propose an overbooking- and hybrid trading-empowered resource scheduling mechanism with reputation update, termed Oh-Trust. Particularly, our Oh-Trust incentivizes FBs to enter futures trading by signing long-term contracts with the seller, while simultaneously attracting OBs to spot trading, enhancing resource utilization and profitability for both parties. Crucially, to adapt to market fluctuations, a smart reputation updating mechanism is integrated, allowing for the timely renewal of long-term contracts to optimize trading performance. Extensive simulations using real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Oh-Trust across multiple evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Multi-link EDCA Optimization for Delay-Bounded QoS in Wi-Fi 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO) as a While MLO offers significant parallelism and capacity, realizing its full potential in guaranteeing strict delay bounds and optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) for diverse, heterogeneous traffic streams in complex multi-link scenarios remain a significant challenge. This is largely due to the limitations of static Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) parameters and the complexity inherent in cross-link traffic management. To address this, this paper investigates the correlation between overall MLO QoS indicators and the configuration of EDCA parameters and Acess Catagory (AC) traffic allocation among links. Based on this analysis, we formulate a constrained optimization problem aiming to minimize the sum of overall packet loss rates for all access categories while satisfying their respective overall delay violation probability constraints. A Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based MLO EDCA QoS optimization algorithm is designed to efficiently search the complex configuration space of AC assignments and EDCA parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach's efficacy in generating adaptive MLO configuration strategies that align with diverse service requirements. The proposed solution significantly improves delay distribution characteristics, and enhance QoS robustness and resource utilization efficiency in high-load MLO environments.</description>

      <title>User-Centric Communication Service Provision for Edge-Assisted Mobile Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future 6G networks are envisioned to facilitate edge-assisted mobile augmented reality (MAR) via strengthening the collaboration between MAR devices and edge servers. In order to provide immersive user experiences, MAR devices must timely upload camera frames to an edge server for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)-based device pose tracking. In this paper, to cope with user-specific and non-stationary uplink data traffic, we develop a digital twin (DT)-based approach for user-centric communication service provision for MAR. Specifically, to establish DTs for individual MAR devices, we first construct a data model customized for MAR that captures the intricate impact of the SLAM-based frame uploading mechanism on the user-specific data traffic pattern. We then define two DT operation functions that cooperatively enable adaptive switching between different data-driven models for capturing non-stationary data traffic. Leveraging the user-oriented data management introduced by DTs, we propose an algorithm for network resource management that ensures the timeliness of frame uploading and the robustness against inherent inaccuracies in data traffic modeling for individual MAR devices. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate that the user-centric communication service provision achieves a 14.2% increase in meeting the camera frame uploading delay requirement in comparison with the slicing-based communication service provision widely used for 5G.</description>

      <title>OpenID Connect for Agents (OIDC-A) 1.0: A Standard Extension for LLM-Based Agent Identity and Authorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenID Connect for Agents (OIDC-A) 1.0 is an extension to OpenID Connect Core 1.0 that provides a comprehensive framework for representing, authenticating, and authorizing LLM-based agents within the OAuth 2.0 ecosystem. As autonomous AI agents become increasingly prevalent in digital systems, there is a critical need for standardized protocols to establish agent identity, verify agent attestation, represent delegation chains, and enable fine-grained authorization based on agent attributes. This specification defines standard claims, endpoints, and protocols that address these requirements while maintaining compatibility with existing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect infrastructure. The proposed framework introduces mechanisms for agent identity representation, delegation chain validation, attestation verification, and capability-based authorization, providing a foundation for secure and trustworthy agent-to-service interactions in modern distributed systems.</description>

      <title>User-Centric Comparison of 5G NTN and DVB-S2/RCS2 Using OpenAirInterface and OpenSAND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of satellite networks into next-generation mobile communication systems has gained considerable momentum with the advent of 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (5G-NTN). Since established technologies like DVB-S2/RCS2 are already widely used for satellite broadband, a detailed comparison with emerging 5G NTN solutions is necessary to understand their relative merits and guide deployment decisions. This paper presents a user-centric, end-to-end evaluation of these technologies under realistic traffic conditions, showing how differences in architecture and protocols impact application-layer performance. Utilizing the 6G Sandbox platform, we employ OpenAirInterface to emulate 5G NTN and OpenSAND for DVB-S2/RCS2, replicating transparent payload GEO satellite scenarios under uniform downlink conditions. A range of real-world applications, such as web browsing, file downloads, and video streaming, are tested across both systems and systematically analyzed. While the emulation lacks real-time capability, it reveals key strengths and limitations of each approach, helping identify suitable deployment scenarios for 5G NTN and DVB-S2/RCS2.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Defined Networking for 6G: A Reinforcement Learning Example for Resource Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G networks are expected to revolutionize connectivity, offering significant improvements in speed, capacity, and smart automation. However, existing network designs will struggle to handle the demands of 6G, which include much faster speeds, a huge increase in connected devices, lower energy consumption, extremely quick response times, and better mobile broadband. To solve this problem, incorporating the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has been proposed. This idea led to the concept of Knowledge-Defined Networking (KDN). KDN promises many improvements, such as resource management, routing, scheduling, clustering, and mobility prediction. The main goal of this study is to optimize resource management using Reinforcement Learning.</description>

      <title>Flexible-Sector 6DMA Base Station: Modeling and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) has emerged as a promising new technology for future wireless networks, which can adaptively adjust the three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations of antennas/antenna arrays for performance enhancement. This paper proposes a novel cost-effective 6DMA-based base station (BS) architecture, termed the \textit{flexible-sector} BS, which allows the deployed antennas to flexibly rotate and move along a circular track, thus enabling common sector rotation and flexible antenna allocation across sectors to adapt to the spatial user distribution efficiently. In particular, we focus on the uplink transmission in a single-cell system, where the flexible-sector BS receives independent messages from multiple users. We introduce an angular-domain user distribution model, which captures the users' spatial clustering or hot-spot distribution effectively. Assuming the zero-forcing (ZF) based receiver applied at the BS to decode multiuser signals, we derive the average sum rate achievable for the users as a function of the common rotation of sectors and the antenna allocation over them. Moreover, we develop a two-step algorithm to jointly optimize the common sector rotation and antenna allocation to maximize the average sum rate of all users. It is shown that the optimal antenna number in each sector linearly increases with the number of users in it. It is also revealed that under the most favorable user distribution, the achievable sum rate gain increases in the order of $\log_{2}(B)$ in the regime of asymptotically large number of antennas, where $B$ denotes the number of sectors. Numerically results also show that as $B$ increases, the proposed flexible-sector BS achieves higher sum rate, and it outperforms other benchmark schemes, such as the traditional fixed-sector BS as well as the BS with sector rotation or antenna allocation optimization only.</description>

      <title>Toward an Unbiased Collective Memory for Efficient LLM-Based Agentic 6G Cross-Domain Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for proactive cross-domain resource orchestration in 6G RAN-Edge networks, featuring large language model (LLM)-augmented agents. The system comprises specialized RAN (energy efficiency) and Edge (latency assurance) agents that engage in iterative negotiation, supported by advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. Agents dynamically interact with a digital twin (DT) to test their proposals and leverage a long-term collective memory where their joint successful and failed agreements along with the related network contexts are distilled into strategies to either follow or avoid and subsequently stored. Given that agents are subject to a plethora of cognitive distortions when retrieving those past experiences -- such as primacy, recency, confirmation and availability biases -- we propose in this work a novel unbiased memory design (A reusable mockup version of the unbiased memory source code is available for non-commercial use at https://github.com/HatimChergui/unbiased-collective-memory). featuring (i) semantic retrieval of past strategies via Jaccard similarity; (ii) learning from failures through amplified weighting of SLA violations and mandatory inclusion of failed negotiation cases to mitigate confirmation bias; (iii) diversity enforcement to minimize availability bias and (iv) recency and primacy weighting with slow decay to counteract temporal biases. Evaluation results showcase the impact of existing biases and how the unbiased memory allows to tackle them by learning from both successful and failed strategies, either present or old, resulting in $\times 4.5$ and $\times 3.5$ reductions of unresolved negotiations compared to non-memory and vanilla memory baselines, respectively, while totally mitigating SLA violations as well as improving latency and energy saving distributions.</description>

      <title>Target Wake Time Scheduling for Time-sensitive and Energy-efficient Wi-Fi Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is fundamental for the reliable, low-latency networks that will enable the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Wi-Fi has historically been considered unfit for TSN, as channel contention and collisions prevent deterministic transmission delays. However, this issue can be overcome by using Target Wake Time (TWT), which enables the access point to instruct Wi-Fi stations to wake up and transmit in non-overlapping TWT Service Periods (SPs), and sleep in the remaining time. In this paper, we first formulate the TWT Acceptance and Scheduling Problem (TASP), with the objective to schedule TWT SPs that maximize traffic throughput and energy efficiency while respecting Age of Information (AoI) constraints. Then, due to TASP being NP-hard, we propose the TASP Efficient Resolver (TASPER), a heuristic strategy to find near-optimal solutions efficiently. Using a TWT simulator based on ns-3, we compare TASPER to several baselines, including HSA, a state-of-the-art solution originally designed for WirelessHART networks. We demonstrate that TASPER obtains up to 24.97% lower mean transmission rejection cost and saves up to 14.86% more energy compared to the leading baseline, ShortestFirst, in a challenging, large-scale scenario. Additionally, when compared to HSA, TASPER also reduces the energy consumption by 34% and reduces the mean rejection cost by 26%. Furthermore, we validate TASPER on our IIoT testbed, which comprises 10 commercial TWT-compatible stations, observing that our solution admits more transmissions than the best baseline strategy, without violating any AoI deadline.</description>

      <title>Introducing Large Language Models in the Design Flow of Time Sensitive Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for real-time, safety-critical systems has significantly increased both the adoption and complexity of Time Sensitive Networking (TSN). Configuring an optimized TSN network is highly challenging, requiring careful planning, design, verification, validation, and deployment. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex tasks, positioning them as promising candidates for automating end-to-end TSN deployment, referred to as TSN orchestration. This paper outlines the steps involved in TSN orchestration and the associated challenges. To assess the capabilities of existing LLM models, we conduct an initial proof-of-concept case study focused on TSN configuration across multiple models. Building on these insights, we propose an LLM-assisted orchestration framework. Unlike prior research on LLMs in computer networks, which has concentrated on general configuration and management, TSN-specific orchestration has not yet been investigated. We present the building blocks for automating TSN using LLMs, describe the proposed pipeline, and analyze opportunities and limitations for real-world deployment. Finally, we highlight key challenges and research directions, including the development of TSN-focused datasets, standardized benchmark suites, and the integration of external tools such as Network Calculus (NC) engines and simulators. This work provides the first roadmap toward assessing the feasibility of LLM-assisted TSN orchestration.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) is challenging for traditional methods under varying user loads and channel conditions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that jointly optimises transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling via a multi-objective reward balancing throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness. Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) against three heuristic algorithms in multiple network scenarios. Our results show that DRL frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in optimising resource allocation in dynamic networks. These findings highlight key trade-offs in DRL design for future HetNets.</description>

      <title>Capacity-Net-Based RIS Precoding Design without Channel Estimation for mmWave MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Capacity-Net, a novel unsupervised learning approach aimed at maximizing the achievable rate in reflecting intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. To combat severe channel fading of the mmWave spectrum, we optimize the phase-shifting factors of the reflective elements in the RIS to enhance the achievable rate. However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily on complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often challenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components. To circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with implicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals. Specifically, it usually requires perfect CSI to evaluate the achievable rate as a performance metric of the current optimization result of the unsupervised learning method. Instead of channel estimation, the Capacity-Net is proposed to establish a mapping among the received pilot signals, optimized RIS phase shifts, and the resultant achievable rates. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Capacity-Net-based unsupervised learning approach over learning methods based on traditional channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Precoding for Multi-RIS-Aided Multiuser Downlink Systems with Practical Phase Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study considers multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-aided multiuser downlink systems with the goal of jointly optimizing the transmitter precoding and RIS phase shift matrix to maximize spectrum efficiency. Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical coupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for the RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address this challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated under both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel settings. Simulation results demonstrate that, despite its complexity, the proposed DDPG approach significantly outperforms optimization-based algorithms and double deep Q-learning, particularly in scenarios with random user distributions.</description>

      <title>PAST: Pilot and Adaptive Orchestration for Timely and Resilient Service Delivery in Edge-Assisted UAV Networks under Spatio-Temporal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incentive-driven resource trading is essential for UAV applications with intensive, time-sensitive computing demands. Traditional spot trading suffers from negotiation delays and high energy costs, while conventional futures trading struggles to adapt to the dynamic, uncertain UAV-edge environment. To address these challenges, we propose PAST (pilot-and-adaptive stable trading), a novel framework for edge-assisted UAV networks with spatio-temporal dynamism. PAST integrates two complementary mechanisms: PilotAO (pilot trading agreements with overbooking), a risk-aware, overbooking-enabled early-stage decision-making module that establishes long-term, mutually beneficial agreements and boosts resource utilization; and AdaptAO (adaptive trading agreements with overbooking rate update), an intelligent adaptation module that dynamically updates agreements and overbooking rates based on UAV mobility, supply-demand variations, and agreement performance. Together, these mechanisms enable both stability and flexibility, guaranteeing individual rationality, strong stability, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that PAST consistently outperforms benchmark methods in decision-making overhead, task completion latency, resource utilization, and social welfare. By combining predictive planning with real-time adjustments, PAST offers a valuable reference on robust and adaptive practice for improving low-altitude mission performance.</description>

      <title>Think Less, Label Better: Multi-Stage Domain-Grounded Synthetic Data Generation for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models in Telecommunications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale, high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However, generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting, where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever, base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.</description>

      <title>CardioForest: An Explainable Ensemble Learning Model for Automatic Wide QRS Complex Tachycardia Diagnosis from ECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to develop and evaluate an ensemble machine learning-based framework for the automatic detection of Wide QRS Complex Tachycardia (WCT) from ECG signals, emphasizing diagnostic accuracy and interpretability using Explainable AI. The proposed system integrates ensemble learning techniques, i.e., an optimized Random Forest known as CardioForest, and models like XGBoost and LightGBM. The models were trained and tested on ECG data from the publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset. The testing was carried out with the assistance of accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of 94.95%, a balanced accuracy of 88.31%, and high precision and recall metrics. SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model. Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through explainability makes it a valuable tool to help cardiologists make timely and well-informed diagnoses, especially for high-stakes and emergency scenarios.</description>

      <title>On Computing Top-$k$ Simple Shortest Paths from a Single Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of computing the top-$k$ simple shortest paths in weighted digraphs. While the single-pair variant -- finding the top-$k$ simple shortest paths between two specified vertices -- has been extensively studied over the past decades, with Yen's algorithm and its heuristic improvements emerging as the most effective solving strategies, relatively little attention has been devoted to the more general single-source version, where the goal is determining top-$k$ simple shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices. Motivated by the numerous practical applications of ranked shortest paths, in this paper we provide new insights and algorithmic contributions to this problem. In particular, we first present a theoretical characterization of the structural properties of its solutions. Then, we introduce the first polynomial-time algorithm specifically designed to handle it. On the one hand, we prove our new algorithm is on par, in terms of time complexity, with the best (and only) polynomial-time approach known in the literature to solve the problem, that is applying the fastest single-pair algorithm independently to each vertex pair formed by the source and the remaining vertices. On the other hand, through an extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic graphs, we demonstrate that our algorithm consistently and significantly outperforms the latter baseline in terms of running time, achieving speed-ups of up to several orders of magnitude. These results establish our new algorithm as the solution to be preferred for computing $k$ simple shortest paths from a single source in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Indoor/Outdoor Spectrum Sharing Enabled by GNSS-based Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The desirability of the mid-band frequency range (1 - 10 GHz) for federal and commercial applications, combined with the growing applications for commercial indoor use-cases, such as factory automation, opens up a new approach to spectrum sharing: the same frequency bands used outdoors by federal incumbents can be reused by commercial indoor users. A recent example of such sharing, between commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where unlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor incumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no reliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or outdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor access points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and reducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate indoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling automatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To this end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for I/O classification. GNSS signals, designed inherently for outdoor reception and highly susceptible to indoor attenuation and blocking, provide a robust and distinguishing feature for environmental sensing. We develop various methodologies, including threshold-based techniques and machine learning approaches and evaluate them using an expanded dataset gathered from diverse geographical locations. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-based methods alone can achieve greater accuracy than approaches relying solely on wireless (Wi-Fi) data, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Furthermore, the integration of GNSS data with Wi-Fi information leads to improved classification accuracy, showcasing the significant benefits of multi-modal data fusion.</description>

      <title>A Modular and Scalable Simulator for Connected-UAVs Communication in 5G Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00868v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellular-connected UAV systems have enabled a wide range of low-altitude aerial services. However, these systems still face many challenges, such as frequent handovers and the inefficiency of traditional transport protocols. To better study these issues, we develop a modular and scalable simulation platform specifically designed for UAVs communication leveraging the research ecology in wireless communication of MATLAB. The platform supports flexible 5G NR node deployment, customizable UAVs mobility models, and multi-network-interface extensions. It also supports multiple transport protocols including TCP, UDP, QUIC, etc., allowing to investigate how different transport protocols affect UAVs communication performance. In addition, the platform includes a handover management module, enabling the evaluation of both traditional and learning-based handover strategies. Our platform can serve as a testbed for the development and evaluation of advanced transmission strategies in cellular-connected UAV systems.</description>

      <title>Information-Geometric Barycenters for Bayesian Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used and impactful distributed optimization framework that achieves consensus through averaging locally trained models. While effective, this approach may not align well with Bayesian inference, where the model space has the structure of a distribution space. Taking an information-geometric perspective, we reinterpret FL aggregation as the problem of finding the barycenter of local posteriors using a prespecified divergence metric, minimizing the average discrepancy across clients. This perspective provides a unifying framework that generalizes many existing methods and offers crisp insights into their theoretical underpinnings. We then propose BA-BFL, an algorithm that retains the convergence properties of Federated Averaging in non-convex settings. In non-independent and identically distributed scenarios, we conduct extensive comparisons with statistical aggregation techniques, showing that BA-BFL achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering a geometric interpretation of the aggregation phase. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning, exploring the impact of Bayesian layers on uncertainty quantification and model calibration.</description>

      <title>DNN-Based Precoding in RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems With Practical Phase Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.</description>

      <title>To Stream or Not to Stream: Towards A Quantitative Model for Remote HPC Processing Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern scientific instruments generate data at rates that increasingly exceed local compute capabilities and, when paired with the staging and I/O overheads of file-based transfers, also render file-based use of remote HPC resources impractical for time-sensitive analysis and experimental steering. Real-time streaming frameworks promise to reduce latency and improve system efficiency, but lack a principled way to assess their feasibility. In this work, we introduce a quantitative framework and an accompanying Streaming Speed Score to evaluate whether remote high-performance computing (HPC) resources can provide timely data processing compared to local alternatives. Our model incorporates key parameters including data generation rate, transfer efficiency, remote processing power, and file input/output overhead to compute total processing completion time and identify operational regimes where streaming is beneficial. We motivate our methodology with use cases from facilities such as APS, FRIB, LCLS-II, and the LHC, and validate our approach through an illustrative case study based on LCLS-II data. Our measurements show that streaming can achieve up to 97% lower end-to-end completion time than file-based methods under high data rates, while worst-case congestion can increase transfer times by over an order of magnitude, underscoring the importance of tail latency in streaming feasibility decisions.</description>
