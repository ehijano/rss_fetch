      <title>An RF-Domain Leakage Cancellation Scheme for FMCW Radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel solution to address the leakage from the transmitter (TX) to the receiver (RX) in frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars. The proposed scheme replicates the leakage using an in-phase and quadrature mixer (IQ-mixer) and performs leakage cancellation in the radio-frequency (RF) domain. This approach utilizes a Wilkinson power combiner after the RX antenna to subtract the replicated leakage signal from the received signal, ensuring that only the true target signal reaches the low-noise amplifier (LNA). This scheme enhances the dynamic range and the receiver's ability to discern proximate targets from previously indistinguishable low beat-frequency clutter. In addition, the proposed technique incorporates a second IQ-mixer based complex modulator in the transmitter to tune the leakage beat frequency. This allows for accurate estimation of the leakage amplitude and phase without additional hardware. Simulation results show more than 20 dB of leakage cancellation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Replay Memory Architectures in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Congestion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Episodic control, inspired by the role of episodic memory in the human brain, has been shown to improve the sample inefficiency of model-free reinforcement learning by reusing high-return past experiences. However, the memory growth of episodic control is undesirable in large-scale multi-agent problems such as vehicle traffic management. This paper proposes a novel replay memory architecture called Dual-Memory Integrated Learning, to augment to multi-agent reinforcement learning methods for congestion control via adaptive light signal scheduling. Our dual-memory architecture mimics two core capabilities of human decision-making. First, it relies on diverse types of memory--semantic and episodic, short-term and long-term--in order to remember high-return states that occur often in the network and filter out states that don't. Second, it employs equivalence classes to group together similar state-action pairs and that can be controlled using the same action (i.e., light signal sequence). Theoretical analyses establish memory growth bounds, and simulation experiments on several intersection networks showcase improved congestion performance (e.g., vehicle throughput) from our method.</description>

      <title>Online Reduced-Order Data-Enabled Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) has garnered significant attention for its ability to achieve safe, data-driven optimal control without relying on explicit system models. Traditional DeePC methods use pre-collected input/output (I/O) data to construct Hankel matrices for online predictive control. However, in systems with evolving dynamics or insufficient pre-collected data, incorporating real-time data into the DeePC framework becomes crucial to enhance control performance. This paper proposes an online DeePC framework for time-varying systems (i.e., systems with evolving dynamics), enabling the algorithm to update the Hankel matrix online by adding real-time informative signals. By exploiting the minimum non-zero singular value of the Hankel matrix, the developed online DeePC selectively integrates informative data and effectively captures evolving system dynamics. Additionally, a numerical singular value decomposition technique is introduced to reduce the computational complexity for updating a reduced-order Hankel matrix. Simulation results on two cases, a linear time-varying system and the vehicle anti-rollover control, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed online reduced-order DeePC framework.</description>

      <title>Koopman Analytical Modeling of Position and Attitude Dynamics: a Case Study for Quadrotor Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a novel, analytical, Koopman Operator based formulation for position and attitude dynamics which can be used to derive control strategies for underactuated systems. Compared to data driven Koopman based techniques, the analytical approach presented in this work is model based and allows for an exact linear representation of the original nonlinear position and attitude dynamics. In fact, the resulting infinite dimensional model, defined in the lifted state space, is linear in the autonomous component and state dependent in the control. A boundary study is carried on to define the range of validity of the finite truncation of the Koopman based model followed by a controllability and stabilizability analysis to show the feasibility of employing the derived model for control system design. Compared to existing literature formulation, the presented model results in a better approximation of the original dyanmics using a more compact truncation of the lifted state space. Moreover, the model is derived using the Koopman approach on the entirety of the dynamics and does not require the need of angular velocity dynamic compensation. A case study involving an underactuated quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is provided to show that, for practical use, a truncated subset of the infinite dimensional model, embeds most of the original nonlinear dynamics and can be used to design linear control strategies in the lifted space which results in nonlinear controllers in the original state space. The main advantages of the presented approach reside in the effective use of linear control strategies for nonlinear plats and the solution of the underactuation problem employing a single control loop.</description>

      <title>Addressing Trust Issues for Vehicle to Grid in Distributed Power Grids Using Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While blockchain offers inherent security, trust issues among stakeholders in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications remain unresolved due to a lack of regulatory frameworks and standardization. Additionally, a tailored decentralized privacy-preserved coordination scheme for blockchain in V2G networks is needed to ensure user privacy and efficient energy transactions. This paper proposes a V2G trading and coordination scheme tailored to the decentralized nature of blockchain as well as the interests of stakeholders utilizing smart charging points (SCPs) and Stackelberg game model. Case studies using real-world data from Southern University of Science and Technology demonstrate the efficacy of proposed scheme in reducing EV charging costs and the potential for supporting auxiliary grid services.</description>

      <title>Flatness-based motion planning for a non-uniform moving cantilever Euler-Bernoulli beam with a tip-mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a non-uniform Euler-Bernoulli beam with a tip-mass at one end and a cantilever joint at the other end. The cantilever joint is not fixed and can itself be moved along an axis perpendicular to the beam. The position of the cantilever joint is the control input to the beam. The dynamics of the beam is governed by a coupled PDE-ODE model with boundary input. On a natural state-space, there exists a unique state trajectory for this beam model for every initial state and each smooth control input which is compatible with the initial state. In this paper, we study the motion planning problem of transferring the beam from an initial state to a final state over a prescribed time interval. We address this problem by extending the generating functions approach to flatness-based control, originally proposed in the literature for motion planning of parabolic PDEs, to the beam model. We prove that such a transfer is possible if the initial and final states belong to a certain set, which also contains steady-states of the beam. We illustrate our theoretical results using simulations and experiments.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Uncertainties in Electricity Markets via Machine Learning and Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of decision-making process in electricity markets is crucial for understanding and resolving issues related to market manipulation and reduced social welfare. Traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method can model decision-making of generation companies (GENCOs), but faces challenges due to uncertainties in policy functions, reward functions, and inter-agent interactions. Quantum computing offers a promising solution to resolve these uncertainties, and this paper introduces the Quantum Multi-Agent Deep Q-Network (Q-MADQN) method, which integrates variational quantum circuits into the traditional MARL framework. The main contributions of the paper are: identifying the correspondence between market uncertainties and quantum properties, proposing the Q-MADQN algorithm for simulating electricity market bidding, and demonstrating that Q-MADQN allows for a more thorough exploration and simulates more potential bidding strategies of profit-oriented GENCOs, compared to conventional methods, without compromising computational efficiency. The proposed method is illustrated on IEEE 30-bus test network, confirming that it offers a more accurate model for simulating complex market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Domestic Flexible Demand: Observations from experiments in cold climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we report on our experience with domestic flexible electric energy demand based on a regular commercial (HVAC)-based heating system in a house. Our focus is on investigating the predictability of the energy demand of the heating system and of the thermal response when varying the heating system settings. Being able to form such predictions is crucial for most flexible demand algorithms. We will compare several methods for predicting the thermal and energy response, which either gave good results or which are currently promoted in the literature for controlling buildings. We will report that the stochasticity of a house response is -- in our experience -- the main difficulty in providing domestic flexible demand from heating. The experiments were carried out on a regular house in Norway, equipped with four air-to-air Mitsubishi heat pumps and a high-efficiency balanced ventilation system. The house was equipped with multiple IoT-based climate sensors, real-time power measurement, and the possibility to drive the HVAC system via the IoT. The house is operating on the spot market (Nord Pool NO3) and is exposed to a peak energy demand penalty. Over a period of three years, we have collected data on the house (temperatures, humidity, air quality), real-time power and hourly energy consumption, while applying various flexible demand algorithms responding to the local energy costs. This has produced large variations in the settings of the heating system and energy demand, resulting in rich data for investigating the house response. This chapter aims at providing important insights on providing flexible demand from houses in cold climates.</description>

      <title>Economic Model Predictive Control as a Solution to Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) offer a fairly generic and powerful framework to discuss the notion of optimal policies for dynamic systems, in particular when the dynamics are stochastic. However, computing the optimal policy of an MDP can be very difficult due to the curse of dimensionality present in solving the underlying Bellman equations. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a very popular technique for building control policies for complex dynamic systems. Historically, MPC has focused on constraint satisfaction and steering dynamic systems towards a user-defined reference. More recently, Economic MPC was proposed as a computationally tractable way of building optimal policies for dynamic systems. When stochsaticity is present, economic MPC is close to the MDP framework. In that context, Economic MPC can be construed as attractable heuristic to provide approximate solutions to MDPs. However, there is arguably a knowledge gap in the literature regarding these approximate solutions and the conditions for an MPC scheme to achieve closed-loop optimality. This chapter aims to clarify this approximation pedagogically, to provide the conditions for MPC to deliver optimal policies, and to explore some of their consequences.</description>

      <title>Consideration of Vehicle Characteristics on the Motion Planner Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicle control is generally divided in two main areas; trajectory planning and tracking. Currently, the trajectory planning is mostly done by particle or kinematic model-based optimization controllers. The output of these planners, since they do not consider CG height and its effects, is not unique for different vehicle types, especially for high CG vehicles. As a result, the tracking controller may have to work hard to avoid vehicle handling and comfort constraints while trying to realize these sub-optimal trajectories. This paper tries to address this problem by considering a planner with simplified double track model with estimation of lateral and roll based load transfer using steady state equations and a simplified tire model to reduce solver workload. The developed planner is compared with the widely used particle and kinematic model planners in collision avoidance scenarios in both high and low acceleration conditions and with different vehicle heights.</description>

      <title>Negotiating Control: Neurosymbolic Variable Autonomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variable autonomy equips a system, such as a robot, with mixed initiatives such that it can adjust its independence level based on the task's complexity and the surrounding environment. Variable autonomy solves two main problems in robotic planning: the first is the problem of humans being unable to keep focus in monitoring and intervening during robotic tasks without appropriate human factor indicators, and the second is achieving mission success in unforeseen and uncertain environments in the face of static reward structures. An open problem in variable autonomy is developing robust methods to dynamically balance autonomy and human intervention in real-time, ensuring optimal performance and safety in unpredictable and evolving environments. We posit that addressing unpredictable and evolving environments through an addition of rule-based symbolic logic has the potential to make autonomy adjustments more contextually reliable and adding feedback to reinforcement learning through data from mixed-initiative control further increases efficacy and safety of autonomous behaviour.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a general switching dynamical system model, and a custom majorization-minimization-based algorithm EM++ for identifying its parameters. For certain families of distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, this algorithm reduces to the well-known expectation-maximization method. We prove global convergence of the algorithm under suitable assumptions, thus addressing an important open issue in the switching system identification literature. The effectiveness of both the proposed model and algorithm is validated through extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Optimal Feedback Laws via Kernel Mean Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven approach for optimal control of nonlinear control-affine systems represented by a stochastic diffusion. The focus is on the scenario where both the nonlinear dynamics and stage cost functions are unknown, while only control penalty function and constraints are provided. Leveraging the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, we introduce novel kernel mean embeddings (KMEs) to identify the Markov transition operators associated with controlled diffusion processes. The KME learning approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions. Thus, unlike traditional dynamic programming methods, our approach exploits the ``kernel trick'' to break the curse of dimensionality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through numerical examples, highlighting its ability to solve a large class of nonlinear optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Correlating Stroke Risk with Non-Invasive Tracing of Brain Blood Dynamic via a Portable Speckle Contrast Optical Spectroscopy Laser Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stroke poses a significant global health threat, with millions affected annually, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Current stroke risk assessment for the general population relies on markers such as demographics, blood tests, and comorbidities. A minimally invasive, clinically scalable, and cost-effective way to directly measure cerebral blood flow presents an opportunity. This opportunity has potential to positively impact effective stroke risk assessment prevention and intervention. Physiological changes in the cerebral vascular system, particularly in response to carbon dioxide level changes and oxygen deprivation, such as during breath-holding, can offer insights into stroke risk assessment. However, existing methods for measuring cerebral perfusion reserve, such as blood flow and blood volume changes, are limited by either invasiveness or impracticality. Here, we propose a transcranial approach using speckle contrast optical spectroscopy (SCOS) to non-invasively monitor regional changes in brain blood flow and volume during breath-holding. Our study, conducted on 50 individuals classified into two groups (low-risk and higher-risk for stroke), shows significant differences in blood dynamic changes during breath-holding between the two groups, providing physiological insights for stroke risk assessment using a non-invasive quantification paradigm. Given its cost-effectiveness, scalability, portability, and simplicity, this laser-centric tool has significant potential in enhancing the pre-screening of stroke and mitigating strokes in the general population through early diagnosis and intervention.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Interactions Between Human Controllers and Remote Devices in Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supporting real-time interactions between human controllers and remote devices remains a challenging goal in the Metaverse due to the stringent requirements on computing workload, communication throughput, and round-trip latency. In this paper, we establish a novel framework for real-time interactions through the virtual models in the Metaverse. Specifically, we jointly predict the motion of the human controller for 1) proactive rendering in the Metaverse and 2) generating control commands to the real-world remote device in advance. The virtual model is decoupled into two components for rendering and control, respectively. To dynamically adjust the prediction horizons for rendering and control, we develop a two-step human-in-the-loop continuous reinforcement learning approach and use an expert policy to improve the training efficiency. An experimental prototype is built to verify our algorithm with different communication latencies. Compared with the baseline policy without prediction, our proposed method can reduce 1) the Motion-To-Photon (MTP) latency between human motion and rendering feedback and 2) the root mean squared error (RMSE) between human motion and real-world remote devices significantly.</description>

      <title>Inverse Particle and Ensemble Kalman Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cognitive systems, recent emphasis has been placed on studying cognitive processes of the subject whose behavior was the primary focus of the system's cognitive response. This approach, known as inverse cognition, arises in counter-adversarial applications and has motivated the development of inverse Bayesian filters. In this context, a cognitive adversary, such as a radar, uses a forward Bayesian filter to track its target of interest. An inverse filter is then employed to infer adversary's estimate of target's or defender's state. Previous studies have addressed this inverse filtering problem by introducing methods like inverse Kalman filter (I-KF), inverse extended KF (I-EKF), and inverse unscented KF (I-UKF). However, these inverse filters assume additive Gaussian noises and/or rely on local approximations of non-linear dynamics at the state estimates, limiting their practical application. Contrarily, this paper adopts a global filtering approach and develops an inverse particle filter (I-PF). The particle filter framework employs Monte Carlo (MC) methods to approximate arbitrary posterior distributions. Moreover, under mild system-level conditions, the proposed I-PF demonstrates convergence to the optimal inverse filter. Additionally, we explore MC techniques to approximate Gaussian posteriors and introduce inverse Gaussian PF (I-GPF) and inverse ensemble KF (I-EnKF). Our I-GPF and I-EnKF can efficiently handle non-Gaussian noises with suitable modifications. Additionally, we propose the differentiable I-PF, differentiable I-EnKF, and reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based EnKF (RKHS-EnKF) methods to address scenarios where system information is unknown to defender. Using recursive Cram\'er-Rao lower bound and non-credibility index (NCI), our numerical experiments for different applications demonstrate the estimation performance and time complexity of the proposed filters.</description>

      <title>Efficient Discovery of Actual Causality using Abstraction-Refinement</title>

Abstract: Causality is an influence by which one event contributes to the production of another event, where the cause is partly responsible for the effect, and the effect is partly dependent on the cause. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective method to formally reason about the causal effect of events in engineered systems, with application on finding the root-cause of safety violations in embedded and cyber-physical systems. We are motivated by the notion of actual causality by Halpern and Pearl, which focuses on the causal effect of particular events, rather than type-level causality, which attempts to make general statements about scientific and natural phenomena. Our first contribution is formulating discovery of actual causality in computing systems modeled by a transition systems as an SMT solving problem. Since datasets for causality analysis tend to be large, in order to tackle the scalability problem of automated formal reasoning, our second contribution is a novel technique based on abstraction-refinement that allows identifying actual causes within smaller abstract causal models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach (by several orders of magnitude) using three case studies to find the actual cause of violations of safety in (1) a neural network controller for an mountain car, (2) a controller for a lunar lander obtained by reinforcement learning, and (3) an MPC controller for an F-16 autopilot simulator.</description>

      <title>Safety Analysis Methods for Complex Systems in Aviation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Each new concept of operation and equipment generation in aviation becomes more automated, integrated and interconnected. In the case of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), this evolution allows drastically decreasing aircraft weight and operational cost, but these benefits are also realized in highly automated manned aircraft and ground Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems. The downside of these advances is overwhelmingly more complex software and hardware, making it harder to identify potential failure paths. Although there are mandatory certification processes based on broadly accepted standards, such as ARP4754 and its family, ESARR 4 and others, these standards do not allow proof or disproof of safety of disruptive technology changes, such as GBAS Precision Approaches, Autonomous UAS, aircraft self-separation and others. In order to leverage the introduction of such concepts, it is necessary to develop solid knowledge on the foundations of safety in complex systems and use this knowledge to elaborate sound demonstrations of either safety or unsafety of new system designs. These demonstrations at early design stages will help reducing costs both on development of new technology as well as reducing the risk of such technology causing accidents when in use.
  This paper presents some safety analysis methods which are not in the industry standards but which we identify as having benefits for analyzing safety of advanced technological concepts in aviation.</description>

      <title>Learning Provably Stable Local Volt/Var Controllers for Efficient Network Operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a data-driven framework to synthesize local Volt/Var control strategies for distributed energy resources (DERs) in power distribution networks (DNs). Aiming to improve DN operational efficiency, as quantified by a generic optimal reactive power flow (ORPF) problem, we propose a two-stage approach. The first stage involves learning the manifold of optimal operating points determined by an ORPF instance. To synthesize local Volt/Var controllers, the learning task is partitioned into learning local surrogates (one per DER) of the optimal manifold with voltage input and reactive power output. Since these surrogates characterize efficient DN operating points, in the second stage, we develop local control schemes that steer the DN to these operating points. We identify the conditions on the surrogates and control parameters to ensure that the locally acting controllers collectively converge, in a global asymptotic sense, to a DN operating point agreeing with the local surrogates. We use neural networks to model the surrogates and enforce the identified conditions in the training phase. AC power flow simulations on the IEEE 37-bus network empirically bolster the theoretical stability guarantees obtained under linearized power flow assumptions. The tests further highlight the optimality improvement compared to prevalent benchmark methods.</description>

Abstract: Complex system simulation has been playing an irreplaceable role in understanding, predicting, and controlling diverse complex systems. In the past few decades, the multi-scale simulation technique has drawn increasing attention for its remarkable ability to overcome the challenges of complex system simulation with unknown mechanisms and expensive computational costs. In this survey, we will systematically review the literature on multi-scale simulation of complex systems from the perspective of knowledge and data. Firstly, we will present background knowledge about simulating complex system simulation and the scales in complex systems. Then, we divide the main objectives of multi-scale modeling and simulation into five categories by considering scenarios with clear scale and scenarios with unclear scale, respectively. After summarizing the general methods for multi-scale simulation based on the clues of knowledge and data, we introduce the adopted methods to achieve different objectives. Finally, we introduce the applications of multi-scale simulation in typical matter systems and social systems.</description>

      <title>Non-intrusive Enforcement of Decentralized Stability Protocol for IBRs in AC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents decentralized, passivity-based stability protocol for inverter-based resources (IBRs) in AC microgrids and a non-intrusive approach that enforces the protocol. By "non-intrusive" we mean that the approach does not require reprogramming IBRs' controllers to enforce the stability protocol. Implementing the approach only requires very minimal information of IBR dynamics, and sharing such information with the non-IBR-manufacturer parties does not cause any concerns on intellectual property privacy. Enforcing the protocol allows for plug-and-play operation of IBRs, while maintaining microgrid stability. The proposed method is tested by simulating two networked microgrids with tie lines and two IBRs modeled in the electromagnetic transient (EMT) time scale. Simulations show that oscillations with increasing amplitudes can occur, when two stable AC microgrids are networked. Simulations also suggest that the proposed approach can mitigate such a system-level symptom by changing less than 2 percent of energy produced by IBRs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces lateral pendulum as an innovative balancer design for bicycle stabilization. This pendulum, operating in the bicycle's vertical plane, enables the bicycle to remain stationary. The paper develops a dynamic model for a bicycle equipped with this lateral pendulum, using Lagrange's method, where the equations are validated with ADAMS software. The stabilization is demonstrated with traditional vertical and novel lateral pendulums, managed through a genetic-pole placement control algorithm. This approach showcases the superiority of the lateral pendulum over traditional methods, including vertical pendulums and steering the handlebar. Additionally, a Digital Linear Quadratic Regulator controller is implemented for practical application, further enhancing system stability.</description>

      <title>Received Power Maximization Using Nonuniform Discrete Phase Shifts for RISs With a Limited Phase Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To maximize the received power at a user equipment, the problem of optimizing a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with a limited phase range R &lt; 2{\pi} and nonuniform discrete phase shifts with adjustable gains is addressed. Necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve this maximization are given. These conditions are employed in two algorithms to achieve the global optimum in linear time for R {\ge} {\pi} and R &lt; {\pi}, where R is the limited RIS phase range. With a total number of N(2K + 1) complex vector additions, it is shown for R {\ge} {\pi} and R &lt; {\pi} that the global optimality is achieved in NK or fewer and N(K + 1) or fewer steps, respectively, where N is the number of RIS elements and K is the number of discrete phase shifts which may be placed nonuniformly over the limited phase range R. In addition, we define two quantization algorithms that we call nonuniform polar quantization (NPQ) algorithm and extended nonuniform polar quantization (ENPQ) algorithm, where the latter is a novel quantization algorithm for RISs with a significant phase range restriction, i.e., R &lt; {\pi}. With NPQ, we provide a closed-form solution for the approximation ratio with which an arbitrary set of nonuniform discrete phase shifts can approximate the continuous solution. We also show that with a phase range limitation, equal separation among the nonuniform discrete phase shifts maximizes the normalized performance. Furthermore, we show that the gain of using K {\ge} 3 with R &lt; {\pi}/2 and K {\ge} 4 with R &lt; {\pi} is only marginal. Finally, we prove that when R &lt; 2{\pi}/3, ON/OFF selection for the RIS elements brings significant performance compared to the case when the RIS elements are strictly ON.</description>

      <title>Delta-V-Optimal Centralized Guidance Strategy For Under-actuated N-Satellite Formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the computation of Delta-V-optimal, safe, relative orbit reconfigurations for satellite formations in a centralized fashion. The formations under consideration comprise an uncontrolled chief spacecraft flying with an arbitrary number, N, of deputy satellites, where each deputy is equipped with a single electric thruster. Indeed, this represents a technological solution that is becoming widely employed by the producers of small-satellite platforms. While adopting a single electric thruster does reduce the required power, weight, and size of the orbit control system, it comes at the cost of rendering the satellite under-actuated. In this setting, the satellite can provide a desired thrust vector only after an attitude maneuver is carried out to redirect the thruster nozzle opposite to the desired thrust direction. In order to further extend the applicability range of such under-actuated platforms, guidance strategies are developed to support different reconfiguration scenarios for N-satellite formations. This paper starts from a classical non-convex quadratically constrained trajectory optimization formulation, which passes through multiple simplifications and approximations to arrive to two novel convex formulations, namely a second-order cone programming formulation, and a linear programming one. Out of five guidance formulations proposed in this article, the most promising three were compared through an extensive benchmark analysis that is applied to fifteen of the most widely-used solvers. This benchmark experiment provides information about the key distinctions between the different problem formulations, and under which conditions each one of them can be recommended.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00296v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For nonlinear (control) systems, extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a popular method to obtain data-driven surrogate models. Its theoretical foundation is the Koopman framework, in which one propagates observable functions of the state to obtain a linear representation in an infinite-dimensional space. In this work, we prove practical asymptotic stability of a (controlled) equilibrium for EDMD-based model predictive control, in which the optimization step is conducted using the data-based surrogate model. To this end, we derive novel bounds on the estimation error that are proportional to the norm of state and control. This enables us to show that, if the underlying system is cost controllable, this stabilizablility property is preserved. We conduct numerical simulations illustrating the proven practical asymptotic stability.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Supervised Approach for Power System Event Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event identification is increasingly recognized as crucial for enhancing the reliability, security, and stability of the electric power system. With the growing deployment of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and advancements in data science, there are promising opportunities to explore data-driven event identification via machine learning classification techniques. However, obtaining accurately-labeled eventful PMU data samples remains challenging due to its labor-intensive nature and uncertainty about the event type (class) in real-time. Thus, it is natural to use semi-supervised learning techniques, which make use of both labeled and unlabeled samples. %We propose a novel semi-supervised framework to assess the effectiveness of incorporating unlabeled eventful samples to enhance existing event identification methodologies. We evaluate three categories of classical semi-supervised approaches: (i) self-training, (ii) transductive support vector machines (TSVM), and (iii) graph-based label spreading (LS) method. Our approach characterizes events using physically interpretable features extracted from modal analysis of synthetic eventful PMU data. In particular, we focus on the identification of four event classes whose identification is crucial for grid operations. We have developed and publicly shared a comprehensive Event Identification package which consists of three aspects: data generation, feature extraction, and event identification with limited labels using semi-supervised methodologies. Using this package, we generate and evaluate eventful PMU data for the South Carolina synthetic network. Our evaluation consistently demonstrates that graph-based LS outperforms the other two semi-supervised methods that we consider, and can noticeably improve event identification performance relative to the setting with only a small number of labeled samples.</description>

      <title>Active Admission Control in a P2P Distributed Environment for Capacity Efficient Livestreaming in Mobile Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, the Active Control in an Intelligent and Distributed Environment (ACIDE) media distribution model solution and algorithms are proposed for livestreaming in capacity efficient mobile wireless networks. The elements of the ACIDE model are a base station and a cluster formed by a number of peers able to establish peer to peer communications. The cluster peers are selected from a group of users interested in livestreaming the same media. The ACIDE model solution minimizes the bandwidth allocated to a cluster of n peers such that an uninterrupted media play for all peers is guaranteed. The livestream media is sent to the peers in packages and every media package is divided into n blocks. The blocks are distributed to the n peers of a cluster in two phases, such that the base station bandwidth is utilized during first phase only. The allocated bandwidth, the amount of bandwidth the base station has to allocate to a cluster, is minimized and its lower bound is equal to the bandwidth required for multicasting. In this study, the ACIDE model is used to address the problem of how to find the maximum number of peers n, chosen from a group of N users, that can be admitted to a cluster knowing the given allocated bandwidth, the amount of bandwidth that a base station allocates to a cluster in advance, prior to admitting users. When users become peers of an ACIDE cluster, the network capacity, the total number of users who are able to access live media, increases meaning that network resources are used more efficiently. The problem of finding the maximum number of peers n is addressed as an optimization problem, with the objective of having the entire given allocated bandwidth used by the peers admitted to the cluster. This problem is NP-complete and a non-optimal solution is proposed for peers selection such that all admitted peers play media continuously.</description>

      <title>Automated Security Response through Online Learning with Adaptive Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study automated security response for an IT infrastructure and formulate the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed, non-stationary game. We relax the standard assumption that the game model is correctly specified and consider that each player has a probabilistic conjecture about the model, which may be misspecified in the sense that the true model has probability 0. This formulation allows us to capture uncertainty about the infrastructure and the intents of the players. To learn effective game strategies online, we design a novel method where a player iteratively adapts its conjecture using Bayesian learning and updates its strategy through rollout. We prove that the conjectures converge to best fits, and we provide a bound on the performance improvement that rollout enables with a conjectured model. To characterize the steady state of the game, we propose a variant of the Berk-Nash equilibrium. We present our method through an advanced persistent threat use case. Testbed evaluations show that our method produces effective security strategies that adapt to a changing environment. We also find that our method enables faster convergence than current reinforcement learning techniques.</description>
