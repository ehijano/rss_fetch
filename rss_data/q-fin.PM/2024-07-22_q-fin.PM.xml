      <title>Large-scale Time-Varying Portfolio Optimisation using Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Apart from assessing individual asset performance, investors in financial markets also need to consider how a set of firms performs collectively as a portfolio. Whereas traditional Markowitz-based mean-variance portfolios are widespread, network-based optimisation techniques have built upon these developments. However, most studies do not contain firms at risk of default and remove any firms that drop off indices over a certain time. This is the first study to incorporate risky firms and use all the firms in portfolio optimisation. We propose and empirically test a novel method that leverages Graph Attention networks (GATs), a subclass of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, as deep learning-based models, can exploit network data to uncover nonlinear relationships. Their ability to handle high-dimensional features and accommodate customised layers for specific purposes makes them particularly appealing for large-scale problems such as mid- and small-cap portfolio optimization. This study utilises 30 years of data on mid-cap firms, creating graphs of firms using distance correlation and the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph approach. These graphs are the inputs to a GAT model that we train using custom layers which impose weight and allocation constraints and a loss function derived from the Sharpe ratio, thus directly maximising portfolio risk-adjusted returns. This new model is benchmarked against a network characteristic-based portfolio, a mean variance-based portfolio, and an equal-weighted portfolio. The results show that the portfolio produced by the GAT-based model outperforms all benchmarks and is consistently superior to other strategies over a long period while also being informative of market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Geometric insights into robust portfolio construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.06194v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate and extend the result that an alpha-weight angle from unconstrained quadratic portfolio optimisations has an upper bound dependent on the condition number of the covariance matrix. This is known to imply that better conditioned covariance matrices produce weights from unconstrained mean-variance optimisations that are better aligned with each assets expected return. Here we relate the inequality between the alpha-weight angle and the condition number to extend the result to include portfolio optimisations with gearing constraints to provide an extended family of robust optimisations. We use this to argue that in general the equally weighted portfolio is not preferable to the mean-variance portfolio even with poor forecast ability and a badly conditioned covariance matrix. We confirm the distribution free theoretical arguments with a simple Gaussian simulation.</description>
