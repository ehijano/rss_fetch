      <title>Improved Dark Photon Sensitivity from the Dark SRF Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the refined dark-photon exclusion bound from Dark SRF's pathfinder run. Our new result is driven by improved theoretical modeling of frequency instability in high-quality resonant experiments. Our analysis leads to a constraint that is an order of magnitude stronger than previously reported (corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio that is four orders of magnitude larger). This result represents the world-leading constraint on non-dark-matter dark photons over a wide range of masses below $6\,\rm \mu eV$ and translates to the best laboratory-based limit on the photon mass $m_\gamma&lt;2.9\times 10^{-48}\,\rm g$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search for the resonant production of a heavy scalar $X$ decaying into a Higgs boson and a lighter scalar $S$, through the process $X \rightarrow S (\rightarrow b \bar{b})H ( \rightarrow \gamma\gamma)$, where the two photons are consistent with the Higgs boson decay, is performed. The search is conducted using integrated luminosities of 140 fb$^{-1}$ and 58.6 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at centre-of-mass energies of 13 TeV and 13.6 TeV respectively, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The search is performed over the mass ranges of 170 $\leq$ $m_{X}$ $\leq$ 1000 GeV and 15 $\leq$ $m_{S}$ $\leq$ 500 GeV. No significant excess over the Standard Model background prediction is observed and limits at 95% confidence level are set on the cross-section times branching ratio $\sigma(X \rightarrow S (\rightarrow b \bar{b})H ( \rightarrow \gamma\gamma))$ at 13 TeV, ranging from 9 fb to 0.06 fb.</description>

      <title>Observation of long-range collective flow in OO and NeNe collisions and implications for nuclear structure studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-range collective flow of particles produced in oxygen-oxygen (OO) and neon-neon (NeNe) collisions is measured with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The data samples were collected at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.36 TeV, with integrated luminosities of 7 nb$^{-1}$ and 0.8 nb$^{-1}$ for OO and NeNe collisions, respectively. Two- and four-particle azimuthal correlations are measured over nearly five units of pseudorapidity. Significant elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) flow harmonics are observed in both systems. The ratios of $v_n$ coefficients between NeNe and OO collisions reveal sensitivity to quadrupole correlations in the nuclear wave functions. Hydrodynamic models with $\textit{ab initio}$ nuclear structure inputs qualitatively reproduce the collision-overlap dependence of both the $v_n$ values and the NeNe to OO ratios. These measurements provide new constraints on hydrodynamic models for small collision systems and offer valuable input on the nuclear structure of $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne.</description>

      <title>Imaging shapes of ground-state uranium-238 nuclei in high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shape and orientation of colliding nuclei play a crucial role in determining the initial conditions of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which influence key observables such as anisotropic and radial flow. In these proceedings, we present the measurements of $v_2$, $p_{\rm T}$ fluctuations and $v_2-p_{\rm T}$ correlations in $^{238}$U + $^{238}$U and $^{197}$Au + $^{197}$Au collisions at center of mass energies $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 193 and 200 GeV, respectively. Our results reveal significant differences in these observables between the two systems, particularly in the most central collisions. Comparisons with hydrodynamic model calculations indicate a large deformation in the ground states of $^{238}$U nuclei, consistent with previous low-energy experiments. However, data also imply a small deviation from axial symmetry of $^{238}$U [1]. Our work introduces a novel approach for imaging nuclear shapes, enhances the modeling of QGP initial conditions, and sheds light on nuclear structure evolution across different energy scales. The potential applications of this method for other nuclear species are discussed.</description>

      <title>Development of Deep Neural Network First-Level Hardware Track Trigger for the Belle II Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB accelerator is designed to explore physics beyond the Standard Model with unprecedented luminosity. As the beam intensity increased, the experiment faced significant challenges due to higher beam-induced background, leading to a high trigger rate and placing limitations on further luminosity increases. To address this problem, we developed trigger logic for tracking using deep neural network (DNN) technology on an FPGA for the Belle II hardware trigger system, employing high-level synthesis techniques. By leveraging drift time and hit pattern information from the Central Drift Chamber and incorporating a simplified self-attention architecture, the DNN track trigger significantly improves track reconstruction performance at the hardware level. Compared to the existing neural track trigger, our implementation reduces the total track trigger rate by 37% while improving average efficiency for the signal tracks from 96% to 98% for charged tracks with transverse momentum &gt; 0.3 GeV. This upgrade ensures the long-term viability of the Belle II data acquisition system as luminosity continues to increase.</description>

      <title>The top quark in 2025 -- International year of Quantum Science and Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its discovery at the Tevatron in 1995, the top quark has been extensively studied due to its unique properties. We discuss how the remarkable progress in top-quark physics has opened the possibility of using the top quark as a tool to test quantum mechanics at the energy frontier. After reviewing the motivations for exploring beyond quantum mechanics, we present an example: probing post-quantum correlations at the energy frontier with boosted top quarks.</description>

Abstract: We describe the results of a haloscope axion search performed with an 11.7 T dipole magnet at CERN. The search used a custom-made radio-frequency cavity coated with high-temperature superconducting tape. A set of 27 h of data at a resonant frequency of around 8.84 GHz was analysed. In the range of axion mass 36.5676 $\mu$eV to 36.5699 $\mu$eV, corresponding to a width of 554 kHz, no signal excess hinting at an axion-like particle was found. Correspondingly, in this mass range, a limit on the axion to photon coupling-strength was set in the range between g$_{a\gamma}\gtrsim$ 6.2e-13 GeV$^{-1}$ and g$_{a\gamma}\gtrsim$ 1.59e-13 GeV$^{-1}$ with a 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Search for cascade decays of charged sleptons and sneutrinos in final states with three leptons and missing transverse momentum in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for cascade decays of charged sleptons and sneutrinos using final states characterized by three leptons (electrons or muons) and missing transverse momentum is presented. The analysis is based on a dataset with 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. This paper focuses on a supersymmetric scenario that is motivated by the muon anomalous magnetic moment observation, dark mattter relic density abundance, and electroweak naturalness. A mass spectrum involving light higgsinos and heavier sleptons with a bino at intermediate mass is targeted. No significant deviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed. This search enables to place stringent constraints on this model, excluding at the 95% confidence level charged slepton and sneutrino masses up to 450 GeV when assuming a lightest neutralino mass of 100 GeV and mass-degenerate selectrons, smuons and sneutrinos.</description>

      <title>Constraints on WIMP-like dark matter scattering on electrons with COSINE-100</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of the search for WIMP-like dark matter interaction with electrons in the NaI(Tl) crystals of the COSINE-100 experiment. The two benchmark scenarios of a heavy and a light vector boson as mediator of the interaction were studied. We found no excess events over the expected background in a data-set of 2.82 years, with a total exposure of 172.9 kg-year. The derived 90% confidence level upper limits exclude a WIMP-electron scattering cross section above 6.4 $\times$ 10$^{-33}$ cm$^2$ for a WIMP mass of 0.25 GeV, assuming a light mediator; and above 3.4 $\times$ 10$^{-37}$ cm$^2$ for a 0.4 GeV WIMP, assuming a heavy mediator, and represent the most stringent constraints for a NaI(Tl) target to date. We also briefly discuss a planned analysis using an annual modulation method below the current 0.7 keV threshold of COSINE-100, down to few photoelectrons yield.</description>

      <title>Resolving the W-Boson Mass in the Lepton Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10888v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2022, the CDF Collaboration reported the $W$-boson mass, $M_W=80.4335\pm0.0094~\mathrm{GeV}$, which deviates from the Standard Model (SM) prediction, $M_W^{\rm SM}=80.357\pm0.006~\mathrm{GeV}$, by about $7\sigma$. By contrast, the CMS Collaboration obtained $M_W=80.3602\pm0.0099~\mathrm{GeV}$, very close to the SM global electroweak fit value of $\sim80.357~\mathrm{GeV}$. Motivated by this situation, we reassess the $W$-boson mass within the Lepton-Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model (LS-2HDM). We perform random scans (generated with SARAH 4.13.0 and evaluated with SPheno 4.0.3) and confront the results with up-to-date theoretical and experimental constraints. In the LS-2HDM, if $h_1$ is the SM-like Higgs at $m_{h_1}\simeq125$ GeV with $|\cos(\beta-\alpha)|\lesssim0.06$, $17\lesssim\tan\beta\lesssim39$, $144\lesssim m_{h_2}\lesssim414$ GeV, and $435\lesssim m_{A,H^{\pm}}\lesssim685$ GeV, the model reproduces the 2024 CMS $W$-boson mass within $3\sigma$. Solutions near the 2022 CDF value, $M_W=80.4335\pm0.0094~\mathrm{GeV}$, survive; however, after applying all constraints, including HiggsTools, they approach it at best within $\lesssim2\sigma$. Our findings emphasize that the LS-2HDM favors the CMS results consistently with the current experimental results. On the other hand, while one can accommodate also the CDF results in this model theoretically, up-to-date electroweak precision bounds on the oblique parameters $(S,T,U)$ together with the SM-like Higgs and LFU constraints exclude these solutions and our results for $W-$boson mass can be only as close as about $2\sigma$ to the CDF results.</description>

      <title>CGAN-Based Framework for Meson Mass and Width Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mesons play a crucial role in understanding the strong interactionin the framework of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, the mass and decay width of several ordinary and exotic mesons remain experimentally undetermined. In this work, we propose a novel application of advanced machine learning techniques to deal with this challenge. Due to the limited available meson datasets, traditional data-driven methods are norm To overcome this, we employ a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to generate synthetic meson data based on known physical parameters. This not only augments the dataset but also retain the underlying physics of the original mesons data. With the extended dataset, we train multiple copies of CGAN and apply a bagging technique to predict uncertainties, improving the robustness and reliability of the predictions. As our findings indicate, the CGAN models are capable of well describing meson properties and their structure relations, offering a potent novel instrument for hadron spectroscopy. This calculation opens a promising future for data-driven hadron physics studies.</description>

      <title>Confronting the production mechanisms of nuclei with deuteron and proton-triggered balance functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ultra high-energy collisions, nuclei with very low binding energies are not expected to survive the dense and hot final state environment. The traditional view has therefore been that nuclei form via coalescence after the hot environment has dissipated. However, statistical thermal models, where hadrons are produced from a fireball at thermal equilibrium, can describe the relative abundances of light nuclei in pp and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC equally well. In this paper we investigate if balance functions triggered by protons and deuterons can be used to distinguish between the two production mechanisms. The coalescence model is investigated using PYTHIA, while the statistical thermal model is examined using the Thermal FIST package. We find that for both models the same simple relation between proton and deuteron triggered balance functions is applicable. However, there is a striking difference between the two models when the transverse momentum of trigger particles is varied. This dependence offers a promising observable to discriminate between the two production scenarios that goes beyond nuclei production. Furthermore, we find that deuteron-meson balance functions vanish identically for both models due to baryon number conservation and isospin symmetry.</description>
