      <title>Accessing thermonuclear detonation with the shock front induced by the alpha particle deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detonation behaviors during thermonuclear burning indicate a state of robust hot spot burning and are widely present in astronomical phenomena, such as supernovae. In this work, we propose an analytical model including alpha-particle deposition at the shock front, which significantly lowers the detonation threshold. The new temperature threshold is 13.4 keV for the isochoric ignition and 25.1 keV for the isobaric ignition, both of which are more accessible experimentally. When a shock wave is present, alpha-particle deposition occurs at the high-density shock front instead of the cold fuel, accelerating the burning wave by approximately 20%. To further validate these findings, we conducted a series of 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations using finite isochoric hot spots with different fast electron energy. The results reveal a rise in burn-up fraction caused by the detonation wave with a deposited fast electron energy about 8.5 kJ. This work can provide a reference for the realization of fusion energy via fast ignition schemes, such as the double-cone ignition scheme. This work also shows the possibility of studying the detonation in astrophysics with laser driven fast ignition.</description>

      <title>Capacitive-Tuned SIW Evanescent-Mode Cavity for Resonant Microwave Plasma Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel atmospheric pressure and frequency-tunable microwave plasma jet utilizing evanescent-mode cavity resonator technology. The design uses a substrate-integrated waveguide approach, where two PCB substrates are assembled to form the resonant microwave plasma jet structure. This configuration provides excellent matching performance across the tuning range and can generate power-efficient plasma jets with a minimal input power of just a few watts. The prototype's resonant frequency can be tuned from 2.94 GHz, with no tuning capacitor, to 2.66 GHz when a capacitor placed in parallel with a circular slot etched on the top PCB board varies up to 1.6 pF. A novel circuit model design approach for this prototype is presented, and close agreement between the measured performance of the fabricated prototype and the simulation results validates this model. The frequency tunability achieved is a critical feature for fine-tuning the plasma jet when fabricated by low-cost PCB manufacturing and for applications in which manipulating the plasma chemistry by varying the ignition frequency is essential.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, a novel particle merging scheme is proposed for PIC-DSMC simulations, based on the solution of a Non-negative Least Squares problem. The merging algorithm conserves arbitrary moments of the velocity distribution function, and a collision rate-conserving version of the algorithm is presented as well. Numerical simulations show excellent performance of the merging algorithm in terms of accuracy.</description>

      <title>A mechanism that could stop the acceleration process within a collisionless shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks are complex nonlinear structures that are not yet fully understood. In particular, the interaction between these shocks and the particles they accelerate remains elusive. Based on an instability analysis that relates the shock width to the spectrum of the accelerated particle and the shock density ratio, we find that the acceleration process could come to an end when the fraction of accelerated upstream particles reaches about 30\%. Only unmagnetized shocks are considered.</description>

      <title>Development of self-modulation as a function of plasma length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use numerical simulations to determine whether the saturation length of the self-modulation (SM) instability of a long proton bunch in plasma could be determined by measuring the radius of the bunch halo SM produces. Results show that defocused protons acquire their maximum transverse momentum and exit the wakefields at a distance approximately equal to the saturation length of the wakefields. This suggests that measuring the radius of the halo as a function of plasma length in the AWAKE experiment would yield a very good estimate for the saturation length of SM.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Constrained Deep Learning Treatment of Runaway Electron Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An adjoint formulation leveraging a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is employed to advance the density moment of a runaway electron (RE) distribution forward in time. A distinguishing feature of this approach is that once the adjoint problem is solved, its solution can be used to project the RE density forward in time for an arbitrary initial momentum space distribution of REs. Furthermore, by employing a PINN, a parametric solution to the adjoint problem can be learned. Thus, once trained, this adjoint-deep learning framework is able to efficiently project the RE density forward in time across various plasma conditions while still including a fully kinetic description of RE dynamics. As an example application, the temporal evolution of the density of primary electrons is studied, with particular emphasis on evaluating the decay of a RE population when below threshold. Predictions from the adjoint-deep learning framework are found to be in good agreement with a traditional relativistic electron Fokker-Planck solver, for several distinct initial conditions, and across an array of physics parameters. Once trained the PINN thus provides a means of generating RE density time histories with exceptionally low online execution time.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Surrogate Model of Secondary Electron Formation and Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the adjoint-deep learning framework for runaway electron (RE) evolution developed in Ref. [C. McDevitt et al., A physics-constrained deep learning treatment of runaway electron dynamics, Submitted to Physics of Plasmas (2024)] to account for large-angle collisions. By incorporating large-angle collisions the framework allows the avalanche of REs to be captured, an essential component to RE dynamics. This extension is accomplished by using a Rosenbluth-Putvinski approximation to estimate the distribution of secondary electrons generated by large-angle collisions. By evolving both the primary and multiple generations of secondary electrons, the present formulation is able to capture both the detailed temporal evolution of a RE population beginning from an arbitrary initial momentum space distribution, along with providing approximations to the saturated growth and decay rates of the RE population. Predictions of the adjoint-deep learning framework are verified against a traditional RE solver, with good agreement present across a broad range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Determination of confinement regime boundaries via separatrix parameters on Alcator C-Mod based on a model for interchange-drift-Alfv\'en turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The separatrix operational space (SepOS) model [Eich \&amp; Manz, \emph{Nuclear Fusion} (2021)] is shown to predict the L-H transition, the L-mode density limit, and the ideal MHD ballooning limit in terms of separatrix parameters for a wide range of Alcator C-Mod plasmas. The model is tested using Thomson scattering measurements across a wide range of operating conditions on C-Mod, spanning $\overline{n}_{e} = 0.3 - 5.5 \times 10^{20}$m$^{-3}$, $B_{t} = 2.5 - 8.0$ T, and $B_{p} = 0.1 - 1.2$ T. An empirical regression for the electron pressure gradient scale length, $\lambda_{p_{e}}$, against a turbulence control parameter, $\alpha_{t}$, and the poloidal fluid gyroradius, $\rho_{s,p}$, for H-modes is constructed and found to require positive exponents for both regression parameters, indicating turbulence widening of near-SOL widths at high $\alpha_{t}$ and an inverse scaling with $B_{p}$, consistent with results on AUG. The SepOS model is also tested in the unfavorable drift direction and found to apply well to all three boundaries, including the L-H transition as long as a correction to the Reynolds energy transfer term, $\alpha_\mathrm{RS} &lt; 1$ is applied. I-modes typically exist in the unfavorable drift direction for values of $\alpha_{t} \lesssim 0.35$. Finally, an experiment studying the transition between the type-I ELMy and EDA H-mode is analyzed using the same framework. It is found that a recently identified boundary at $\alpha_{t} = 0.55$ excludes most EDA H-modes but that the balance of wavenumbers responsible for the L-mode density limit, namely $k_\mathrm{EM} = k_\mathrm{RBM}$, may better describe the transition on C-Mod. The ensemble of boundaries validated and explored is then applied to project regime access and limit avoidance for the SPARC primary reference discharge parameters.</description>

      <title>Laboratory modeling of MHD accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review article summarizes two decades of laboratory research aimed at understanding the dynamics of accretion disks, with particular emphasis on magnetohydrodynamic experiments involving liquid metals and plasmas. First, the Taylor-Couette experiments demonstrated the generation of magnetorotational instability (MRI) in liquid metals, and highlighted how this instability is critically influenced by boundary conditions and the geometry of the applied magnetic field. These experiments also highlight the nonlinear transition to turbulence in accretion disks, and their link with other MHD instabilities in centrifugally-stable flows. A complementary approach, involving laboratory experiments with volumetric fluid driving rather than rotating boundaries, enables a quantitative study of angular momentum transport by Keplerian turbulence. Collectively, these various laboratory studies offer new constraints on the theoretical models designed to explain the dynamics of accretion disks. This is particularly true with regard to the role of Keplerian turbulence in protoplanetary disks, where recent observations from the ALMA telescope have considerably revised previously expected values of the magnitude of the turbulent fluctuations. Finally, the paper discusses outstanding questions and future prospects in laboratory modeling of accretion disks.</description>

      <title>Spontaneously generated flux ropes in 3-D magnetic reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is the key to explosive phenomena in the universe. The flux rope is crucial in three-dimensional magnetic reconnection theory and are commonly considered to be generated by secondary tearing mode instability. Here we show that the parallel electron flow moving toward the reconnection diffusion region can spontaneously form flux ropes. The electron flows form parallel current tubes in the separatrix region where the observational parameters suggest the tearing and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are suppressed. The spontaneously formed flux ropes could indicate the importance of electron dynamics in a three-dimensional reconnection region.</description>

Abstract: Models for the transport of high energy charged particles through strong magnetic turbulence play a key role in space and astrophysical studies, such as describing the propagation of solar energetic particles and high energy cosmic rays. Inspired by the recent advances in high-performance machine learning techniques, we investigate the application of generative diffusion models to synthesizing test particle trajectories obtained from a turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We consider velocity increment, spatial transport and curvature statistics, and find excellent agreement with the baseline trajectories for fixed particle energies. Additionally, we consider two synthetic turbulence models for comparison. Finally, challenges towards an application-ready transport model based on our approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>Effects of Magnetic Focusing on Power and Stability of VE Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theory and modeling of new discovered effects of the oscillating e-beam boundary formed in a magnetic focusing channel on the stability, gain, and power of VE amplifiers are presented. The RF structure and e-beam circuit parameters are computed for different beam envelope radii and oscillation amplitudes and then the self-excitation thresholds are obtained from the Determinant equations. A new solution of the beam envelope equation not limited by the small-amplitude oscillations is derived and used to determine the magnetic focusing conditions providing various beam envelope radii and oscillation amplitudes. It is shown for the example Ka-band serpentine structure that the optimum radius as well as axial position of the oscillating beam envelope allow achieving significantly greater gain and power of RF amplifiers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling plasmas in terms of atoms or ions is theoretically appealing for several reasons. When it is relevant, the notion of atom or ion in a plasma provides us with an interpretation scheme of the plasma's microscopic structure. From the standpoint of quantitative estimation of plasma properties, atomic models of plasma allow extending many theoretical tools of atomic physics to plasmas. This notably includes the statistical approaches to the detailed accounting for excited states, or the collisional-radiative modeling of non-equilibrium plasmas, which is based on the notion of atomic processes.
  This habilitation thesis is mostly focused on the studies to which the author has contributed in the field of atomic modeling of dense, non-ideal plasmas. The studies to which the author contributed in the field of collisional-radiative modeling of non-LTE plasmas are also addressed, and the prospect of bridging with dense-plasma models is sketched.</description>

      <title>Randomization of a Laser Wavefront by the Turbulent Gas-Puff Z-Pinch Plasma Column</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first direct experimental evidence supported by numerical modeling of a turbulent plasma column formed during a gas-puff z-pinch implosion generated by COBRA current. Utilizing an imaging refractometer, we show a significant decrease in spatial autocorrelation of the laser field and the appearance of a laser speckle pattern shortly before stagnation. The intensity distribution of the speckles measured during different shot campaigns while employing long and short COBRA pulses follows the speckle statistics satisfactorily. The imaging refractometer signal is proportional to the integral over electron density gradients; hence, the measured phase randomization of the individual plane waves comprising the laser field implies random density distribution. To validate this, the Beam Propagation Method code simulates the laser beam propagation through different artificial density distributions with various average fluctuation scales and generates synthetic imaging refractometer data. The results reproduce similar trends in the experimental data, such as the increasing vertical width for the decreasing average spatial scale of the fluctuations and decreasing spatial correlation length of the laser field. Therefore, during the gas-puff z-pinch implosion process, it is likely that the plasma flow is almost always turbulent with the average spatial scale of the turbulent density fluctuations decreasing towards stagnation.</description>

      <title>Low-energy Injection and Nonthermal Particle Acceleration in Relativistic Magnetic Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic turbulence has been proposed as a process for producing nonthermal particles in high-energy astrophysics. Particle energization may be contributed by both magnetic reconnection and turbulent fluctuations, but their interplay is poorly understood. It has been suggested that during magnetic reconnection the parallel electric field dominates particle acceleration up to the lower bound of the power-law particle spectrum, but recent studies show that electric fields perpendicular to magnetic field can play an important, if not dominant role. In this study, we carry out 2D fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetically dominated decaying turbulence in a relativistic pair plasma. For a fixed magnetization parameter $\sigma_0=20$, we find that the injection energy ${\varepsilon}_{\rm inj}$ converges with increasing domain size to ${\varepsilon}_{\rm inj}\simeq 10m_ec^2$. In contrast, the power-law index, the cut-off energy, and the power-law extent increase steadily with domain size. We trace a large number of particles and evaluate the contributions of the work done by the parallel ($W_\parallel$) and perpendicular ($W_\perp$) electric fields during both the injection phase and the post-injection phase. We find that during the injection phase, the $W_\perp$ contribution increases with domain size, suggesting that it may eventually dominate injection for a sufficiently large domain. In contrast, both components contribute equally during the post-injection phase, insensitive to the domain size. For high energy (${\varepsilon}\gg{\varepsilon}_{\rm inj}$) particles, $W_\perp$ dominates the subsequent energization. These findings may improve our understanding of nonthermal particles and their emissions in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

Abstract: The solar corona is the prototypical example of a low density environment heated to high temperatures by external sources. The plasma cools radiatively, and because it is optically thin to this radiation, it becomes possible to model the density, velocity, and temperature structure of the system by modifying the MHD equations to include energy source terms that approximate the local heating and cooling rates. The solutions can be highly inhomogeneous and even multiphase because the well known linear instability associated with these source terms, thermal instability, leads to a catastrophic heating and cooling of the plasma in the nonlinear regime. Here we show that there is a separate, much simpler instance of catastrophic heating and cooling accompanying these source terms that can rival thermal instability in dynamical importance. The linear stability criterion is the isochoric one identified by Parker (1953), and we demonstrate that cooling functions derived from collisional ionization equilibrium are highly prone to violating this criterion. If catastrophic cooling instability can act locally in global simulations, then it is an alternative mechanism for forming condensations, and due to its nonequilibrium character, it may be relevant to explaining a host of phenomena associated with the production of cooler gas in hot, low density plasmas.</description>
