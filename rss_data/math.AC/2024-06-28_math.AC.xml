      <title>The generic anisotropy of strongly edge decomposable spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generic anisotropy is an important property in the study of Stanley-Reisner rings of homology spheres, which was introduced by Papadakis and Petrotou. This property can be used to prove the strong Lefschetz property as well as McMullen's $g$-conjecture for homology spheres. It is conjectured that for an arbitrary field $\mathbb{F}$, any $\mathbb{F}$-homology sphere is generically anisotropic over $\mathbb{F}$. In this paper, we prove this conjecture for all strongly edge decomposable spheres.</description>

      <title>On the Hahn-Witt series and their generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the field of Hahn-Witt series $HW(\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p)$ with residue field $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$ (also known as a $p$-adic Malcev-Neumann field \cite{La86, P93}), and its generalizations. Informally, the Hahn-Witt series are possibly infinite linear combinations of rational powers of $p,$ in which the coefficients are Teichm\"uller representatives, and the set of exponents is well-ordered. They form an algebraically closed extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p,$ with a canonical automorphism $\varphi,$ coming from the absolute Frobenius of $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p.$ We prove that the action of $\varphi$ on the $p$-power roots of unity is given by $\varphi(\zeta)=\zeta^{-1},$ answering a question of Kontsevich.
  More generally, we consider the $\pi$-typical Hahn-Witt series $HW_{(K,\pi)}(\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q)$, where $\pi$ is a uniformizer in a local field $K$ with residue field $\mathbb{F}_q.$ Again, this field is an algebraically closed extension of $K,$ and it has a canonical automorphism $\varphi_{\pi},$ coming from the relative Frobenius of $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q$ over $\mathbb{F}_q.$ We prove that the action of $\varphi_{\pi}$ on the maximal abelian extension $K^{ab}$ corresponds via local class field theory to the uniformizer $-\pi\in K^*.$</description>

      <title>Minimal cellular resolutions of powers of matching field ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of monomial ideals, called block diagonal matching field ideals, which arise as monomial Gr\"obner degenerations of determinantal ideals. Our focus is on the minimal free resolutions of these ideals and all of their powers. Initially, we establish their linear quotient property and compute their Betti numbers, illustrating that their minimal free resolution is supported on a regular CW complex. Our proof relies on the results of Herzog and Takayama, demonstrating that ideals with a linear quotient property have a minimal free resolution, and on the construction by Dochtermann and Mohammadi of cellular realizations of these resolutions. We begin by proving the linear quotient property for each power of such an ideal. Subsequently, we show that their corresponding decomposition map is regular, resulting in a minimal cellular resolution. Finally, we demonstrate that distinct decomposition maps lead to different cellular complexes with the same face numbers.</description>
