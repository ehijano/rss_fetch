      <title>Neural Networks as Spin Models: From Glass to Hidden Order Through Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a one-to-one correspondence between a neural network (NN) and a statistical mechanical spin model where neurons are mapped to Ising spins and weights to spin-spin couplings. The process of training an NN produces a family of spin Hamiltonians parameterized by training time. We study the magnetic phases and the melting transition temperature as training progresses. First, we prove analytically that the common initial state before training--an NN with independent random weights--maps to a layered version of the classical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass exhibiting a replica symmetry breaking. The spin-glass-to-paramagnet transition temperature is calculated. Further, we use the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) equations--a theoretical technique to analyze the landscape of energy minima of random systems--to determine the evolution of the magnetic phases on two types of NNs (one with continuous and one with binarized activations) trained on the MNIST dataset. The two NN types give rise to similar results, showing a quick destruction of the spin glass and the appearance of a phase with a hidden order, whose melting transition temperature $T_c$ grows as a power law in training time. We also discuss the properties of the spectrum of the spin system's bond matrix in the context of rich vs. lazy learning. We suggest that this statistical mechanical view of NNs provides a useful unifying perspective on the training process, which can be viewed as selecting and strengthening a symmetry-broken state associated with the training task.</description>

      <title>Extreme events in locally coupled bursting neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a new mechanism through which extreme events with a dragon king-like distribution emerge in a network of locally coupled Hindmarsh-Rose bursting neurons. We establish and substantiate the fact that depending on the choice of initial conditions, the neurons in the network are divided into clusters and whenever these clusters are phase synchronized intermittently, extreme events originate in the collective observable. This mechanism, which we name as intermittent cluster synchronization is proposed as the new precursor for the generation of extreme events in this system. These results are also true for electrical diffusive coupling. The distribution of the local maxima shows long tailed non-Gaussian while the interevent interval follows the Weibull distribution. The goodness of fit are corroborated using probability-probability plot and quantile-quantile plot. These extreme events become rarer and rarer with the increase in the number of different initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Phase reduction explains chimera shape: when multi-body interaction matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05366v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extension of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model for networks, deriving the second-order phase approximation for a paradigmatic model of oscillatory networks - an ensemble of non-identical Stuart-Landau oscillators coupled pairwisely via an arbitrary coupling matrix. We explicitly demonstrate how this matrix translates into the coupling structure in the phase equations. To illustrate the power of our approach and the crucial importance of high-order phase reduction, we tackle a trendy setup of non-locally coupled oscillators exhibiting a chimera state. We reveal that our second-order phase model reproduces the dependence of the chimera shape on the coupling strength that is not captured by the typically used first-order Kuramoto-like model. Our derivation contributes to a better understanding of complex networks' dynamics, establishing a relation between the coupling matrix and multi-body interaction terms in the high-order phase model.</description>
