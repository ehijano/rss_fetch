      <title>On Symmetry-Compatible Superselection Structures for Product States in 2D Quantum Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study superselection sectors in two-dimensional quantum spin systems with an on-site action of a compact abelian group $G$. Naaijkens and Ogata (2022) arXiv:2102.07707 showed that for states quasi-equivalent to a product state, the superselection structure is trivial, reflecting the absence of long-range entanglement. We consider a symmetry-compatible refinement of this setting, in which both the superselection criterion and the notion of equivalence between representations are required to respect the $G$-action. Under this stricter notion of equivalence, the sector structure for a $G$-equivariant product representation becomes nontrivial: the $G$-equivariant superselection sectors are classified by elements of the Pontryagin dual $\widehat{G}$. This shows that even in phases without long-range entanglement, imposing symmetry compatibility can lead to nontrivial sector structure.</description>

      <title>Finite-Rank Optimizers for the mass--supercritical Lieb--Thirring and Hardy--Lieb--Thirring Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of finite-rank operators for an interpolation version of the Lieb--Thirring inequality in the mass--supercritical case, thereby extending a result of Hong, Kwon, and Yoon in 2019 to the full parameter regime. Our method also applies to the Hardy--Lieb--Thirring inequality, where the existence of optimizers faces additional difficulties due to the singularity of the inverse-square potential.</description>

      <title>Instability of Numerical Method for Micromagnetics Simulations with Large Damping Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and implement a third-order accurate numerical scheme for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, which describes magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic materials under large damping parameters. This method offers two key advantages: (1) It solves only constant-coefficient linear systems, enabling fast solvers and thus achieving much higher numerical efficiency than existing second-order methods. (2) It attains third-order temporal accuracy and fourth-order spatial accuracy, and is unconditionally stable for large damping parameters. Numerical examples in 1D and 3D simulations verify both its third-order accuracy and efficiency gains. However, when large damping parameters and pre-projection solutions are involved, both this proposed method and a second-order method of the same style fail to capture reasonable physical structures, despite extensive theoretical analyses. Additionally, comparisons of domain wall dynamics among BDF2, BDF3, and BDF1 show that BDF2 and BDF3 yield failed simulations, while BDF1 performs marginally better.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a conventional tight-binding model for graphene, where distortion of the honeycomb lattice is allowed, but penalized by a quadratic energy. We prove that the optimal 3-periodic lattice configuration has Kekul\'e O-type symmetry, and that for a sufficiently small elasticity parameter, the minimizer is not translation-invariant. Conversely, we prove that for a large elasticity parameter the translation-invariant configuration is the unique minimizer.</description>

      <title>On Geometry of Dissipation in Multiscale Dynamics and Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript introduces novel approaches to three phenomena. First, we extend the algebraic formulation of kinetic theory within the contact framework by making explicit the gauge freedom, thereby obtaining a formulation in which the phase-space volume itself becomes an additional dynamical variable. Second, we develop a new and simpler geometric formulation of the GENERIC framework, unifying Hamiltonian and gradient dynamics in a contact-geometric setting. This is realized within a specifically constructed graph space, which naturally emerges as an intermediate structure in the geometric Hamilton-Jacobi framework. Finally, we formulate a geometric extension of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in the setting of geometric Hamilton-Jacobi theory, allowing for the inclusion of microturbulence - a key feature of complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A Remarkable Application of Zassenhaus Formula to Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Zassenhaus decomposition for the exponential of the sum of two non-commuting operators, simplifies drastically when these operators satisfy a simple condition, called the no-mixed adjoint property. An important application to a Unitary Coupled Cluster method for strongly correlated electron systems is presented. This ansatz requires no Trotterization and is exact on a quantum computer with a finite number of Givens gate equals to the number of free parameters. The formulas obtained in this work also shed light on why and when optimization after Trotterization gives exact solutions in disentangled forms of unitary coupled cluster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how any given system of ordinary differential equations in $n$-dimensional configuration space can be obtained from a peculiar variational problem with one local symmetry. The obtained action functional leads to the Hamiltonian formulation in $(4n+2)$-dimensional phase space. As concrete examples, we discuss the cases of Lagrange-d'Alembert equations with nonlinear nonholonomic constraints, as well as the equations of motion with dissipative (frictional) forces.</description>

      <title>Toward a Physical Interpretation of Phase Field Models with Dynamic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, considerable research has been devoted to partial differential equations (PDEs) with dynamic boundary conditions. However, the physical interpretation of the parameters involved often remains unclear, which in turn limits both theoretical analysis and numerical computation. For instance, the Robin boundary condition used in thermodynamically consistent models with dynamic boundary conditions has been misinterpreted as representing a chemical reaction, or has been generalized in an unjustified manner in numerous works. In this paper, we treat the bulk and surface as a closed system and develop thermodynamically consistent phase field models to clarify the physical meaning of parameters in governing equations and boundary conditions, with particular focus on material and energy exchange between the bulk and surface by connecting it with the nanothermodynamics. Firstly, we commence with the mass and volume conservation law in the close system and elucidate the physical interpretation of the Robin boundary condition, demonstrating that the relevant parameters are connected to the system's characteristic length scale and play a crucial role on the exchanging of material and energy. Furthermore, our analysis justifies the physical necessity for the phase variable in the bulk to differ from that on the surface. Secondly, we construct four more general models capable of describing both irreversible and irreversible-reversible coupling processes using the generalized Onsager principle. Thirdly, we reveal that both conservation and dissipation laws simultaneously determine the mobility operator and free energy, which are two dual variables. Finally, we perform structure-preserving numerical simulations to systematically investigate how reversible processes and characteristic length affect pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Fields of covariances on non-commutative probability spaces in finite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a field of covariances, a contravariant functor from non-commutative probability spaces to Hilbert spaces, as the natural categorical analogue of statistical covariance. In the case of finite-dimensional non-commutative probability spaces, we obtain a complete classification of such fields. Our results unify classical and quantum information geometry: in the tracial case, we recover (a contravariant version of) Cencov's uniqueness of the Fisher-Rao metric, while in the faithful case, we recover (a contravariant version of) the Morozova-Cencov-Petz classification of quantum monotone metrics. Crucially, our classification extends naturally to non-faithful states that are not pure, thus generalizing Petz and Sudar's radial extension.</description>

      <title>On quantum large sieve inequalities and operator recovery from incomplete information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain large sieve type inequalities for the Rayleigh quotient of the restriction of phase space representations of higher rank operators, via an operator analogue of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The resulting bounds are referred to as `quantum large sieve inequalities'. On the shoulders of Donoho and Stark, we demonstrate that these inequalities guarantee the recovery of an operator whose phase-space information is missing or unobservable over a 'measure-sparse' region $\Omega $, by solving an $L^{1}$-minimization program in the complementary region $\Omega^{c}$, when the argument runs over an operator analogue of Feichtinger's algebra of integrable STFTs. This is an operator version of what is commonly known as `Logan's phenomenon'. Moreover, our results can be viewed as a deterministic, continuous variable version, on phase space, of `low-rank' matrix recovery, which itself can be regarded as an operator version of compressive sensing. Our results depend on an abstract large sieve principle for operators with integrable STFT and on a non-commutative analogue of the local reproducing formula in rotationally invariant domains (first stated by Seip for the Fock space of entire functions). As an application, we obtain concentration estimates for Cohen's class distributions and the Husimi function. We motivate the paper by comparing with Nicola and Tilli's Faber-Krahn inequality for the STFT, illustrating that norm bounds on a domain $\Omega $, obtained by large sieve methods, introduce a trade-off between sparsity and concentration properties of $\Omega $: If $\Omega $ is sparse, the large sieve bound may significantly improve known operator norm bounds, while if $\Omega $ is concentrated, it produces worse bounds.</description>

      <title>Conundrum of regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields has sprouted numerous candidates, each exhibiting certain virtues but often accompanied by significant drawbacks. We demonstrate that Komar mass, electric charge and magnetic charge are mutually dependent in regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields, defined by Lagrangian which is a function of both electromagnetic invariants, $F_{ab} F^{ab}$ and $F_{ab}{\star F}^{ab}$, regardless of the specific weak field limit of the theory. Also, we generalize one of the key no-go theorems by showing that static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black holes in a theory respecting the relaxed Maxwellian weak field limit do not admit a bounded Kretschmann scalar. Finally, we address one of the long-standing niche questions, whether regular black hole solutions can exist when both electric and magnetic charges are present, by constructing an exotic family of regular dyonic black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields in theories respecting the Maxwellian weak field limit. Mounting evidence suggests that regularizing black holes through simplistic nonlinear extensions of Maxwell's electromagnetism entails a high cost in the form of unorthodox theoretical assumptions.</description>

      <title>Apparent Universal Behavior in Second Moments of Random Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Just how fast does the brickwork circuit form an approximate 2-design?
  Is there any difference between anticoncentration and being a 2-design?
  Does geometry matter?
  How deep a circuit will I need in practice?
  We tell you everything you always wanted to know about second moments of random quantum circuits, but were too afraid to compute. Our answers generally take the form of numerical results for up to 50 qubits.
  Our first contribution is a strategy to determine explicitly the optimal experiment which distinguishes any given ensemble from the Haar measure. With this formula and some computational tricks, we are able to compute $t = 2$ multiplicative errors exactly out to modest system sizes. As expected, we see that most families of circuits form $\epsilon$-approximate $2$-designs in depth proportional to $\log n$. For the 1D brickwork, we work out the leading-order constants explicitly.
  For graphs, we find some exceptions which are much slower, proving that they require at least $\Omega(n^2)$ gates. This answers a question asked by ref. 1 in the negative. We explain these exceptional architectures in terms of connectedness. Based on this intuition we conjecture universal upper and lower bounds for graph-sampled circuit ensembles.
  For many architectures, the optimal experiment which determines the multiplicative error corresponds exactly to the collision probability (i.e. anticoncentration). However, we find that the star graph anticoncentrates much faster than it forms an $\epsilon$-approximate $2$-design. Finally, we show that one needs only ten to twenty layers to construct an approximate $2$-design for realistic parameter ranges. This is a large constant-factor improvement over previous constructions. The parallel complete-graph architecture is not quite the fastest scrambler, partially resolving a question raised by ref. 2.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic work capacity of quantum information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the resource-theoretic free energy of a quantum channel as the maximal work extractable from the channel as its output equilibrates to a thermal state and its reference system remains locally intact. It is proportional to the relative entropy between the given channel and the absolutely thermal channel. It attains a clear operational meaning as twice the asymptotic rates of athermality distillation and formation under Gibbs preserving superchannels, which map one absolutely thermal channel to another for a given bath, thereby revealing the asymptotic reversibility of the resource theory of athermality for quantum channels. Consequently, we establish that the optimal extractable work in converting one channel to another through the asymptotic athermality distillation and formation tasks equals the difference in their free energies. We call this optimal work the thermodynamic work capacity of channel conversion. Quantum information processing and computing fundamentally concern the manipulation and transformation of quantum channels, which encompass quantum states, their transformations, and measurements. A quantitative characterization of the optimal thermodynamic work gain or expenditure in quantum information processing constitutes a key step toward formulating thermodynamics of quantum processes.</description>

      <title>The injective norm of CSS quantum error-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the injective norm - a.k.a. geometric entanglement - of standard basis states of CSS quantum error-correcting codes. The injective norm of a quantum state is a measure of genuine multipartite entanglement. Computing this measure is generically NP-hard. However, it has been computed exactly in condensed-matter theory - notably in the context of topological phases - for the Kitaev code and its extensions, in works by Or\'us and collaborators. We extend these results to all CSS codes and thereby obtain the injective norm for a nontrivial, infinite family of quantum states. In doing so, we uncover an interesting connection to matroid theory and Edmonds' intersection theorem.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Superconducting Circuit Framework for Emulating Physics in Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical studies and experiments in the last six years have revealed the potential for novel behaviours and functionalities in device physics through the synthetic engineering of negatively-curved spaces. For instance, recent developments in hyperbolic band theory have unveiled the emergence of higher-dimensional eigenstates -- features fundamentally absent in conventional Euclidean systems. At the same time, superconducting quantum circuits have emerged as a leading platform for quantum analogue emulations and digital simulations in scalable architectures. Here, we introduce a scalable superconducting circuit framework for the analogue quantum emulation of tight-binding models on hyperbolic and kagome-like lattices. Using this approach, we experimentally realize three distinct lattices, including, for the first time to our knowledge, a hyperbolic lattice whose unit cell resides on a genus-3 Riemann surface. Our method encodes the hyperbolic metric directly into capacitive couplings between high-quality superconducting resonators, enabling tenable reproduction of spectral and localization properties while overcoming major scalability and spectral resolution limitations of previous designs. These results set the stage for large-scale experimental studies of hyperbolic materials in condensed matter physics and lay the groundwork for realizing hyperbolic quantum processors, with potential implications for both fundamental physics and quantum computing</description>

      <title>Clifford Solver for the Tetrahedron Equation and its Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The different forms of the tetrahedron equation appear when all possible ways to label the scattering process of infinitely long straight lines are considered in three dimensional spacetime. This is expected to lead to three dimensional integrability, analogous to the Yang-Baxter equation. Among the three possibilities, we consider two of them and their variants. We show that Clifford algebras solve both the constant and the spectral parameter dependent versions of all of them. We also present a scheme for canonically solving higher simplex equations using tetrahedron solutions.</description>

      <title>Violation of S-duality in classical $Q$-cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of a chiral supercharge $Q$ in the $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory at tree level. The cohomology classes correspond one-to-one to the $\frac1{16}$ Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) states at one-loop. We argue that monotone classes on the Coulomb branch respect the S-duality between the theories with $\mathrm{SO}(2N+1)$ and $\mathrm{USp}(2N)$ gauge groups, but find an explicit example of a pair of cohomology classes that "violate" the S-duality in the sense that the tree-level $Q$-cohomologies are not isomorphic between the neighborhoods near the two free points. Within this pair, one is a fortuitous class and the other is a monotone chiral ring element. Assuming the non-perturbative validity of S-duality, our results disprove a long-standing conjecture on the one-loop exactness of the $\frac1{16}$-BPS spectrum (including the $\frac1{8}$-BPS chiral ring spectrum) in the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. Mathematically, this shows that, the relative Lie algebra cohomology $H^\bullet(\mathfrak{g}[A],\mathfrak{g})$ is generally not graded-isomorphic to $H^\bullet({}^L\mathfrak{g}[A],{}^L\mathfrak{g})$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ and ${}^L\mathfrak{g}$ are a pair of Langlands dual Lie algebras and $A=\mathbb{C}[z^+,z^-]\otimes\Lambda(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3)$.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of the conductivity in the mirrors model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the mirrors model in $d$ dimensions on an infinite slab and with unit density. This is a deterministic dynamics in a random environment. We argue that the crossing probability of the slab goes like $\kappa/(\kappa+N)$ where $N$ is the width of the slab. We are able to compute $\kappa$ perturbatively by using a multiscale approach. The only small parameter involved in the expansion is the inverse of the size of the system. This approach rests on an inductive process and a closure assumption adapted to the mirrors model. For $d=3$, we propose the recursive relation for the conductivity $\kappa_n$ at scale $n$ : $\kappa_{n+1}=\kappa_n(1+\frac{\kappa_n}{2^{n}}\alpha)$, up to $o(1/2^n)$ terms and with $\alpha\simeq 0.0374$. This sequence has a finite limit.</description>

      <title>Dynamical system analysis of quantum tunneling in an asymmetric double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum tunneling in an asymmetric double-well potential using a dynamical systems-based approach rooted in the Ehrenfest formalism. In this framework, the time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet is governed by a hierarchy of coupled equations linking lower- and higher-order position moments. An approximate closure, required to render the system tractable, yields a reduced dynamical system for the mean and variance, with skewness entering explicitly due to the potential's asymmetry. Stability analysis of this system identifies energy thresholds for detectable tunneling across the barrier and reveals regimes where tunneling, though theoretically allowed, remains practically undetectable. Comparison with full numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation shows that, beyond reproducing key tunneling features, the dynamical systems approach provides an interpretable description of quantum transport through tunneling in an effective asymmetric two-level system.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Geometric Deformations of Function Algebras on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for deforming the algebra of smooth functions on a compact Riemannian manifold based on spectral data rather than group actions or Poisson structures. The deformation is defined through spectral coefficients of the Laplacian and a weight function satisfying a fusion-type cocycle condition, producing a noncommutative product that depends intrinsically on Laplacian spectrum of the manifold. We develop the analytic and algebraic foundations of this construction, establishing associativity, continuity, and the existence of a group structure on admissible weights. We show that the construction is functorial with respect to spectrum-preserving maps of manifolds. This spectral-geometric deformation quantization approach provides a fully intrinsic analytic model of noncommutative geometry based solely on spectral data of the manifold.</description>

      <title>Results on Lorentzian metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a short introduction to ``Lorentzian metric spaces" i.e., spacetimes defined solely in terms of the two-point Lorentzian distance. As noted in previous work, this structure is essentially unique if minimal conditions are imposed, such as the continuity of the Lorentzian distance and the relative compactness of chronological diamonds. The latter condition is natural for interpreting these spaces as low-regularity versions of globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Confirming this interpretation, we prove that every Lorentzian metric space admits a Cauchy time function. The proof is constructive for this general setting and it provides a novel argument that is interesting already for smooth spacetimes.</description>

      <title>A note on relations between convexity and concavity of thermodynamic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with proving the equivalence of convexity or concavity properties of thermodynamic functions, such as energy and entropy, depending on different sets of variables. These variables are the basic thermodynamic state variables, specific state variables or the densities of state variables that are used in continuum mechanics. We prove results for transformations of variables and functions in conjunction with convexity properties. We are concerned with convexity, strict convexity, positive definite Hessian matrices and the analogous forms of concavity. The main results are equivalence relations for these properties between functions. These equivalences are independent of the equations of state since they only use general properties of them. The results can be used for instance to easily prove that the entropy density function for the Euler equations in conservative variables in three space dimensions is strictly concave or even has a negative definite Hessian matrix. Further, we show how various equations of state imply these properties and how these properties are relevant to mathematical analysis.</description>

Abstract: We study the optimal control problem applied to a gas of particles with spin confined in a material with Rashba spin-orbit coupling effect, in the presence of an external magnetic field. The evolution of the particle gas is described in the Wigner formalism. We investigate the classical limit of the optimal control problem, and we prove the convergence of the solution of the quantum problem toward the solution of a simplified optimal control model, based on an ODE description of the particle gas in terms of a single spin vector traveling along a classical trajectory in the phase-space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Relative Entropy implies the Semiclassical Einstein Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the semiclassical Einstein equations emerge directly from quantum information theory. Using modular theory, we establish that the relative entropy between the vacuum state and coherent excitations of a scalar quantum field on a bifurcate Killing horizon is given by the energy flux across the horizon. Under the assumption of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area formula, this energy flux is proportional to a variation in the surface area of the horizon cross section. The semiclassical Einstein equations follow automatically from this identification. Our approach provides a rigorous quantum field theoretic generalization of Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of Einstein's equations, replacing classical thermodynamic entropy with the well-defined quantum relative (Araki-Uhlmann) entropy. This suggests that quantum information plays a fundamental role in what is seen as a zeroth order approximation of a theory of quantum gravity, namely quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>A natural decomposition of the Jacobi equation for some classes of $N$-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider several $N$-body problems. The main result is a very simple and natural criterion for decoupling the Jacobi equation for some classes of them. If $E$ is a Euclidean space, and the potential function $U(x)$ for the $N$-body problem is a $C^2$ function defined in an open subset of $E^N$, then the Jacobi equation along a given motion $x(t)$ writes $\ddot J=HU_x(J)$, where the endomorphism $HU_x$ of $E^N$ represents the second derivative of the potential with respect to the mass inner product.
  Our splitting in particular applies to the case of homographic motions by central configurations. It allows then to deduce the well known Meyer-Schmidt decomposition for the linearization of the Euler-Lagrange flow in the phase space, formulated twenty years ago to study the relative equilibria of the planar $N$-body problem. However, our decomposition principle applies in many other classes of $N$-body problems, for instance to the case of isosceles three body problem, in which Sitnikov proved the existence of oscillatory motions.
  As a first concrete application, for the classical three-body problem we give a simple and short proof of a theorem of Y. Ou, ensuring that if the masses verify $\mu=(m_1+m_2+m_3)^2/(m_1m_2+m_2m_3+m_1m_3)&lt;27/8$ then the elliptic Lagrange solutions are linearly unstable for any value of the excentricity.</description>

      <title>Hard wall repulsion for the discrete Gaussian free field in random environment on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the discrete Gaussian free field (harmonic crystal) on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 3$, with uniformly elliptic and bounded random conductances sampled according to a sufficiently mixing environment measure. We consider the hard wall event that the field is non-negative on the discrete blow-up of a bounded regular domain $V\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$, and establish a quenched large deviation asymptotic for its probability. The asymptotic rate is characterized by the essential supremum of the on-site variances and the homogenized capacity of $V$, which arises from a quenched invariance principle. We then analyze the law of the field conditioned on the hard wall event. We determine the first-order asymptotic profile for its expectation and demonstrate that an entropic push-away of the field from the origin occurs. Furthermore, we characterize the field pathwise behavior under the constraint, showing that, when properly recentered, the field converges weakly to the (quenched) discrete Gaussian free field. A major challenge is the lack of translation invariance in the model. We exploit the superharmonicity of the conditioned expectation of the field to obtain a sharp uniform lower bound for it. We then use this bound to estimate the harmonicity defect of the conditioned expectation. This is a key step that allows us to prove a corresponding sharp upper bound and establish a pathwise entropic repulsion phenomenon.</description>

      <title>A No-Go Theorem for Shaping Quantum Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to independently control higher-order statistical moments of continuous-variable quantum states would allow the direct ``shaping'' of non-Gaussian resources, with wide implications for quantum communication, computation, and metrology. Here we prove that such control is fundamentally impossible under any smooth Hamiltonian dynamics. Within the full infinite-dimensional algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields on phase space, the quadratic (symplectic) subalgebra $\mathfrak{sp}(2N,\mathbb R)$ -- and, in the single-mode case, its $\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ representation -- is the unique hierarchy-preserving structure: only quadratic generators produce differential operators that terminate at second order and thereby decouple first and second moments from higher cumulants. Any smooth non-quadratic Hamiltonian introduces third- and higher-order derivatives in the phase-space generator, enforcing a universal coupling between the Gaussian and non-Gaussian sectors. This \emph{rigidity of the moment hierarchy} generalizes the Gaussian no-go theorems and identifies the analytic boundary between symplectic (Clifford) dynamics and the non-simulable regime beyond the Gottesman--Knill limit.</description>

      <title>Distinct Types of Parent Hamiltonians for Quantum States: Insights from the $W$ State as a Quantum Many-Body Scar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24713v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of parent Hamiltonians that possess a given state as their ground state is a well-studied problem. In this work, we generalize this notion by considering simple quantum states and examining the local Hamiltonians that have these states as exact eigenstates. These states often correspond to Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) of their respective parent Hamiltonians. Motivated by earlier works on Hamiltonians with QMBS, in this work we formalize the differences between three distinct types of parent Hamiltonians, which differ in their decompositions into strictly local terms with the same eigenstates. We illustrate this classification using the $W$ state as the primary example, for which we rigorously derive the complete set of local parent Hamiltonians, which also allows us to establish general results such as the existence of asymptotic QMBS, and distinct dynamical signatures associated with the different parent Hamiltonian types. Finally, we derive more general results on the parent Hamiltonian types that allow us to obtain some immediate results for simple quantum states such as product states, where only a single type exists, and for short-range-entangled states, for which we identify constraints on the admissible types. Altogether, our work opens the door to classifying the rich structures and dynamical properties of parent Hamiltonians that arise from the interplay between locality and QMBS.</description>

Abstract: Given a contact sub-Riemannian manifold one obtains a non-integrable splitting of the tangent bundle into the directions along the contact distribution and the Reeb field. We generalize the construction of the Bismut superconnection to this non-integrable setting and show that although singularities appear within the superconnection, if one extracts the finite part then the resulting operator is hypoelliptic. We find that the hypoellipticity also holds in the setting of two-step subRiemannian manifolds and produce a modification for arbitrary subRiemannian manifolds which always gives a hypoelliptic operator. A discussion of the explicit form of the operator on principal $\bS^1$-bundles is provided. The index theory is worked out on contact manifolds and a matrix twisting of the Clifford relations produces operators with non-trivial Fredholm index. We conclude with a possible relationship between our hypoelliptic operator and a constrained supersymmetric sigma model.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial quantization of 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory II: Quantum invariants of higher ribbons in $D^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a continuation of the first paper (arXiv:2501.06486) of this series, where the framework for the combinatorial quantization of the 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory with an underlying compact structure Lie 2-group $\mathbb{G}$ was laid out. In this paper, we continue our quest and characterize additive module *-functors $\omega:\mathfrak{C}_q(\mathbb{G}^{\Gamma^2})\rightarrow\mathsf{Hilb}$, which serve as a categorification of linear *-functionals (ie. a state) on a $C^*$-algebra. These allow us to construct non-Abelian Wilson surface correlations $\widehat{\mathfrak{C}}_q(\mathbb{G}^{P})$ on the discrete 2d simple polyhedra $P$ partitioning 3-manifolds. By proving its stable equivalence under 3d handlebody moves, these Wilson surface states extend to decorated 3-dimensional marked bordisms in a 4-disc $D^4$. This provides invariants of framed oriented 2-ribbonsin $D^4$ from the data of the given compact Lie 2-group $\mathbb{G}$. We find that these 2-Chern-Simons-type 2-ribbon invariants are given by bigraded $\mathbb{Z}$-modules, similar to the lasagna skein modules of Manolescu-Walker-Wedrich.</description>

      <title>From $n$-Leibniz algebras and linear $n$-racks to the solutions of the (higher analogue of) Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first demonstrate that a finite-dimensional $n$-Leibniz algebra naturally gives rise to an $n$-rack structure on the underlying vector space. Given any $n$-Leibniz algebra, we also construct two Yang-Baxter operators on suitable vector spaces and connect them by a homomorphism. Next, we introduce linear $n$-racks as the coalgebraic version of $n$-racks and show that a cocommutative linear $n$-rack yields a linear rack structure and hence a Yang-Baxter operator. An $n$-Leibniz algebra canonically gives rise to a cocommutative linear $n$-rack and thus produces a Yang-Baxter operator. In the last part, following the well-known close connections among Leibniz algebras, (linear) racks and Yang-Baxter operators, we consider a higher-ary generalization of Yang-Baxter operators (called $n$-Yang-Baxter operators). In particular, we show that $n$-Leibniz algebras and cocommutative linear $n$-racks naturally provide $n$-Yang-Baxter operators. Finally, we consider a set-theoretical variant of $n$-Yang-Baxter operators and propose some problems.</description>

Abstract: The spinor tensor $\epsilon_{AB}$ has a special property that its elements can be formulated into an algebraic expression of the indices. All the totally anti-symmetric tensors in Minkowski space are expressed by $\epsilon_{AB}$. By using the property, we give a simple proof of the total anti-symmetry for the volume spinor tensor.</description>

Abstract: Exploiting the symmetry topological field theory/topological order correspondence (SymTFT/TO), together with the higher-categorical structure of 6D N =(2,0) SCFTs, we prove that the total quantum dimension of the relative gaugeable algebra leading to intrinsic non-invertible symmetries between class S theories is greater with respect to the non-intrinsic case. From a higher-categorical perspective, this supports the idea that multiplicity is allowed to exceed unity in some superselection sectors.</description>

      <title>Complex crystallographic reflection groups and Seiberg-Witten integrable systems: rank 1 case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider generalisations of the elliptic Calogero--Moser systems associated to complex crystallographic groups in accordance to [1]. In our previous work [2], we proposed these systems as candidates for Seiberg--Witten integrable systems of certain SCFTs. Here we examine that proposal for complex crystallographic groups of rank one. Geometrically, this means considering elliptic curves $T^2$ with $\mathbb{Z}_m$-symmetries, $m=2,3,4,6$, and Poisson deformations of the orbifolds $(T^2\times\mathbb{C})/\mathbb{Z}_m$. The $m=2$ case was studied in [2], while $m=3,4,6$ correspond to Seiberg--Witten integrable systems for the rank 1 Minahan--Nemeshansky SCFTs of type $E_{6,7,8}$. This allows us to describe the corresponding elliptic fibrations and the Seiberg--Witten differential in a compact elegant form. This approach also produces quantum spectral curves for these SCFTs, which are given by Fuchsian ODEs with special properties.</description>

      <title>Quantization of K\"ahler Manifolds via Brane Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14574v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their physical proposal for quantization [20], Gukov-Witten suggested that, given a symplectic manifold $M$ with a complexification $X$, the A-model morphism spaces $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$ and $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{B}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$ should recover holomorphic deformation quantization of $X$ and geometric quantization of $M$ respectively, where $\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}}$ is a canonical coisotropic A-brane on $X$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is a Lagrangian A-brane supported on $M$.
  Assuming $M$ is spin and K\"ahler with a prequantum line bundle $L$, Chan-Leung-Li [10] constructed a subsheaf $\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{qu}}^{(k)}$ of smooth functions on $M$ with a non-formal star product and a left $\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{qu}}^{(k)}$-module structure on the sheaf of holomorphic sections of $L^{\otimes k} \otimes \sqrt{K}$.
  In this paper, we give a careful treatment of the relation between (holomorphic) deformation quantizations of $M$ and $X$. As a result, Chan-Leung-Li's work [10] provides a mathematical realization of the action of $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$ on $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{B}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$. By Fedosov's gluing arguments, we also construct a $\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{qu}}^{(k)}$-$\overline{\mathcal{O}}_{\operatorname{qu}}^{(k)}$-bimodule structure on the sheaf of smooth sections of $L^{\otimes 2k}$ to realize the actions of $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$ and $\operatorname{Hom}(\overline{\mathcal{B}}_{\operatorname{cc}}, \overline{\mathcal{B}}_{\operatorname{cc}})$ on $\operatorname{Hom}(\overline{\mathcal{B}}_{\operatorname{cc}}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$, which is related to the analytic geometric Langlands program.</description>

      <title>Sharp commutator estimates of all order for Coulomb and Riesz modulated energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove functional inequalities in any dimension controlling the iterated derivatives along a transport of the Coulomb or super-Coulomb Riesz modulated energy in terms of the modulated energy itself. This modulated energy was introduced by the second author and collaborators in the study of mean-field limits and statistical mechanics of Coulomb/Riesz gases, where control of such derivatives by the energy itself is an essential ingredient. In this paper, we extend and improve such functional inequalities, proving estimates which are now sharp in their additive error term, in their density dependence, valid at arbitrary order of differentiation, and localizable to the support of the transport. Our method relies on the observation that these iterated derivatives are the quadratic form of a commutator. Taking advantage of the Riesz nature of the interaction, we identify these commutators as solutions to a degenerate elliptic equation with a right-hand side exhibiting a recursive structure in terms of lower-order commutators and develop a local regularity theory for the commutators, which may be of independent interest.
  These estimates have applications to obtaining sharp rates of convergence for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and in proving central limit theorems for the fluctuations of Coulomb/Riesz gases. In particular, we show here the expected $N^{\frac{\mathsf{s}}{\mathsf{d}}-1}$-rate in the modulated energy distance for the mean-field convergence of first-order Hamiltonian and gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Non-linear sigma models for non-Hermitian random matrices in symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry of non-Hermitian matrices underpins many physical phenomena. In particular, chaotic open quantum systems exhibit universal bulk spectral correlations classified on the basis of time-reversal symmetry$^{\dagger}$ (TRS$^{\dagger}$), coinciding with those of non-Hermitian random matrices in the same symmetry class. Here, we analytically study the spectral correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices in the presence of TRS$^{\dagger}$ with signs $+1$ and $-1$, corresponding to symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$, respectively. Using the fermionic replica non-linear sigma model approach, we derive $n$-fold integral expressions for the $n$th moment of the one-point and two-point characteristic polynomials. Performing the replica limit $n\to 0$, we qualitatively reproduce the density of states and level-level correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices with TRS$^{\dagger}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Measurements in the Fewster-Verch Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fewster-Verch (FV) framework provides a local and covariant approach for defining measurements in quantum field theory (QFT). Within this framework, a probe QFT represents the measurement device, which, after interacting with the target QFT, undergoes an arbitrary local measurement. Remarkably, the FV framework is free from Sorkin-like causal paradoxes and robust enough to enable quantum state tomography. However, two open issues remain.
  First, it is unclear if the FV framework allows conducting arbitrary local measurements. Second, if the probe field is interpreted as physical and the FV framework as fundamental, then one must demand the probe measurement to be itself implementable within the framework. That would involve a new probe, which should also be subject to an FV measurement, and so on. It is unknown if there exist non-trivial FV measurements for which such an ``FV-Heisenberg cut" can be moved arbitrarily far away. In this work, we advance the first problem by proving that Gaussian-modulated measurements of locally smeared fields fit within the FV framework. We solve the second problem by showing that any such measurement admits a movable FV-Heisenberg cut.
  As a technical byproduct, we establish that state transformations induced by finite-rank perturbations of the classical phase space underlying a linear scalar field preserve the Hadamard property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Gibbs measures for diffusive particles interacting through a two-body mean field energy. By identifying a gradient structure for the conditional law, we derive sharp bounds on the size of chaos, providing a quantitative characterization of particle independence. To handle interaction forces that are unbounded at infinity, we study the concentration of measure phenomenon for Gibbs measures via a defective Talagrand inequality, which may hold independent interest. Our approach provides a unified framework for both the flat semi-convex and displacement convex cases. Additionally, we establish sharp chaos bounds for the quartic Curie-Weiss model in the sub-critical regime, demonstrating the generality of this method.</description>

      <title>The essential regularity of singular connections in Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We accomplish three things: (i) We discover the geometric (true) regularity of affine connections, their essential (highest possible) regularity, a geometric property independent of starting atlas. (ii) We give a checkable necessary and sufficient condition for determining whether or not connections are at their essential regularity, based on the relative regularity of the connection and its Riemann curvature. (iii) We introduce a computable procedure for lifting any $L^p$ affine connection in an atlas ($p&gt;n$), to a new atlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity. To accomplish this, we prove that the RT-equations, originally designed by the authors to locally lift the regularity of singular connections by one derivative, surprisingly, also induce an implicit hidden regularization of the Riemann curvature, together with a global regularization of transition maps between regularizing coordinate charts. From this we deduce a multi-step regularization of the connection, and construct a new atlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity. This paper is a culmination of the theory of the RT-equations which provides a computable iterative procedure for lifting an atlas to a new atlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity, applicable to any $L^p$ affine connection defined in a $W^{2,p}$ starting atlas, $p&gt;n$. This provides a definitive theory for determining whether singularities in an $L^p$ affine connection are essential or removable by coordinate transformation, together with an explicit procedure for lifting removable singularities to their essential regularity, both locally and globally, $p&gt;n$. This includes GR shock wave singularities and cusp singularities (continuous metrics with infinite gradients) in General Relativity. The essential regularity is the point where an intrinsic level regularity enters the subject of Geometry.</description>

      <title>Categories of orthosets and adjointable maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An orthoset is a non-empty set together with a symmetric and irreflexive binary relation $\perp$, called the orthogonality relation. An orthoset with 0 is an orthoset augmented with an additional element 0, called falsity, which is orthogonal to every element. The collection of subspaces of a Hilbert space that are spanned by a single vector provides a motivating example.
  We say that a map $f \colon X \to Y$ between orthosets with 0 possesses the adjoint $g \colon Y \to X$ if, for any $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$, $f(x) \perp y$ if and only if $x \perp g(y)$. We call $f$ in this case adjointable. For instance, any bounded linear map between Hilbert spaces induces a map with this property. We discuss in this paper adjointability from several perspectives and we put a particular focus on maps preserving the orthogonality relation.
  We moreover investigate the category OS of all orthosets with 0 and adjointable maps between them. We especially focus on the full subcategory iOS of irredundant orthosets with 0. iOS can be made into a dagger category, the dagger of a morphism being its unique adjoint. iOS contains dagger subcategories of various sorts and provides in particular a framework for the investigation of projective Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>The Manakov-Zakharov-Ward model as an integrable decoupling limit of the membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel decoupling limit of the membrane is proposed, leading to the $(1+2)$-dimensional classically integrable model originally introduced by Manakov, Zakharov, and Ward. This limit is the large-wrapping regime of a membrane propagating toy background of the form $\mathbb{R}_t \times T^2 \times G$ subject to scaling limit, where $G$ is a Lie group and the geometry is supported by a four-form flux. Such toy backgrounds can arise from consistent eleven-dimensional supergravity solutions, exemplified by the uplift of the pure NSNS AdS$_3 \times$ S$^3 \times$ T$^4$ background. The scaling limit can be interpreted as similtaneous small tension and non- or hyper-relativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transitions and entanglement entropy in a non-Hermitian spin-boson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe some interesting properties of a spin-boson system with non-Hermitian coupling. For this particular model, it is known that the Hilbert space can be described by infinitely-many two-dimensional invariant (closed) subspaces, together with the global ground state. We expose the appearance of exceptional points on such two-dimensional subspaces, together with quantum phase transitions marking the transition from real to complex eigenvalues. We also compute the spin-boson entanglement entropy on each invariant subspace to show that the two phases can be distinguished by their distinct entanglement-entropy profiles.</description>

      <title>A hyperboloidal method for numerical simulations of multidimensional nonlinear wave equations: nonlinear tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the scalar wave equation with power nonlinearity in n+1 dimensions. Unlike most previous numerical studies, we go beyond the radial case and do not assume any symmetries for n=3, and we only impose an SO(n-1) symmetry in higher dimensions. Our method is based on a hyperboloidal foliation of Minkowski spacetime and conformal compactification. We focus on the late-time power-law decay (tails) of the solutions and compute decay exponents for different spherical harmonic modes, for subcritical, critical and supercritical, focusing and defocusing nonlinear wave equations.</description>

      <title>Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics: Axiomatic Formulation and Foundation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for non-equilibrium thermodynamics, termed Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics (NNET), which unifies reversible dynamics described by the Nambu bracket and irreversible processes driven by entropy gradients. The formulation provides a covariant description of systems far from equilibrium, where entropy may transiently decrease as a result of reversible circulations or exchanges with the surroundings, extending the applicability of conventional thermodynamic formalisms.
  As an illustrative example, a triangular chemical reaction system is analyzed. It is shown that, without assuming detailed balance or linearity, two geometric structures that behave as conserved quantities in the reversible limit naturally emerge: one associated with cyclic symmetry in the reaction space, and another that vanishes under symmetric reaction rates. These results demonstrate that NNET provides a unified and covariant formulation for describing both cyclic dynamics and dissipative processes within a single theoretical structure.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Complex Dynamics in Far-from-equilibrium Systems: Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic systems dominated by strong nonlinearity are reformulated within a dynamical framework based on the Nambu bracket formalism. It is demonstrated that general complex nonlinear non-equilibrium systems can be locally reduced to a simple form of Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics (NNET). Furthermore, mathematical and dynamical obstacles encountered in extending this reduction globally are discussed, and a generalized formulation that incorporates nonlinear effects through mixed higher-order tensors is proposed.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Enhanced Colorimetric Sensing: Achieving over 5700-fold Accuracy Improvement via Full-Spectrum Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional colorimetric sensing methods typically rely on signal intensity at a single wavelength, often selected heuristically based on peak visual modulation. This approach overlooks the structured information embedded in full-spectrum transmission profiles, particularly in intensity-based systems where linear models may be highly effective. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that applying a forward feature selection strategy to normalized transmission spectra, combined with linear regression and ten-fold cross-validation, yields significant improvements in predictive accuracy. Using food dye dilutions as a model system, the mean squared error was reduced from over 22,000 with a single wavelength to 3.87 using twelve selected features, corresponding to a more than 5,700-fold enhancement. These results validate that full-spectrum modeling enables precise concentration prediction without requiring changes to the sensing hardware. The approach is broadly applicable to colorimetric assays used in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and industrial analysis, offering a scalable pathway to improve sensitivity and reliability in existing platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct mountain pass critical points of the perimeter functional on sets of fixed volume. For a generic metric, this gives rise to a smooth almost embedded hypersurface with non-zero constant mean curvature. Our work utilizes recent techniques of Mazurwoski--Zhou \cite{mazurowski2024infinitely}, and a new result on the connectedness of Cacciopoli sets: any two smooth Cacciopoli sets can be connected by an $\mathbf{F}$-continuous map.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Heisenberg-type lower bounds on spacelike hypersurfaces in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a coordinate- and foliation-independent Heisenberg-type lower bound for quantum states strictly localized in geodesic balls of radius $r$ on spacelike hypersurfaces of arbitrary spacetimes (with matter and a cosmological constant). The estimate depends only on the induced Riemannian geometry of the slice; it is independent of the lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature, and controls the canonical momentum variance/uncertainty $\sigma_p$ by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Theorem). On weakly mean-convex balls we obtain the universal product inequality $\sigma_p r \ge \hbar/2$. Under the same assumption, a vector-field Barta-type argument improves this universal floor to the scale-invariant bound $\sigma_p r \ge \pi\hbar/2$, which provides a universal, foliation-independent floor. Any further sharpening of the constant requires eigenvalue-comparison results or other curvature-sensitive methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum capacity amplification via privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate superadditivity of quantum capacity through private channels whose Choi-Jamiolkowski operators are private states. This perspective links the security structure of private states to quantum capacity and clarifies the role of the shield system: information encoded in the shield system that would otherwise leak to the environment can be recycled when paired with an assisting channel, thereby boosting capacity. Our main contributions are threefold: Firstly, we develop a general framework that provides a sufficient condition for capacity amplification, which is formulated in terms of the assisting channel's Holevo information. As examples, we give explicit, dimension and parameter dependent amplification thresholds for erasure and depolarizing channels. Secondly, assuming the Spin alignment conjecture, we derive a single-letter expression for the quantum capacity of a family of private channels that are neither degradable, anti-degradable, nor PPT; as an application, we construct channels with vanishing quantum capacity yet unbounded private capacity. Thirdly, we further analyze approximate private channels: we give an alternative proof of superactivation that extends its validity to a broader parameter regime, and, by combining amplification bounds with continuity estimates, we establish a metric separation showing that channels exhibiting capacity amplification have nonzero diamond distance from the set of anti-degradable channels, indicating that existing approximate (anti-)degradability bounds are not tight. We also revisit the computability of the regularized quantum capacity and modestly suggest that this fundamental question still remains open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove that the universal and maximal abelian covers of a finite multi-graph have the same eigenvalues. This result strengthens a recent theorem of Li, Magee, Sabri, and Thomas (2025) and answers one of their questions. Our proof builds upon their new characterization of the point spectrum of maximal abelian covers in terms of matching polynomials. It is based on the theory of the matching polynomial and its Gallai-Edmonds decomposition.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Love number of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidal deformation of compact objects, characterised by their Love numbers, provides insights into the internal structure of neutron stars and black holes. While bosonic tidal Love numbers vanish for black holes in general relativity, it has been recently revealed that fermionic tidal perturbations can induce non-zero Love numbers for Kerr black holes. In this paper, we investigate the response of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole to the fermionic Weyl field. As a result, we find that the corresponding fermionic tidal Love numbers are also non-vanishing for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes except for the extremal ones, which highlights the universal distinct behavior of the fermionic tidal Love numbers compared to the bosonic counterparts.</description>
