      <title>A Graph Theoretic Approach for Exploring the Relationship between EV Adoption and Charging Infrastructure Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing global demand for conventional energy has led to significant challenges, particularly due to rising CO2 emissions and the depletion of natural resources. In the U.S., light-duty vehicles contribute significantly to transportation sector emissions, prompting a global shift toward electrified vehicles (EVs). Among the challenges that thwart the widespread adoption of EVs is the insufficient charging infrastructure (CI). This study focuses on exploring the complex relationship between EV adoption and CI growth. Employing a graph theoretic approach, we propose a graph model to analyze correlations between EV adoption and CI growth across 137 counties in six states. We examine how different time granularities impact these correlations in two distinct scenarios: Early Adoption and Late Adoption. Further, we conduct causality tests to assess the directional relationship between EV adoption and CI growth in both scenarios. Our main findings reveal that analysis using lower levels of time granularity result in more homogeneous clusters, with notable differences between clusters in EV adoption and those in CI growth. Additionally, we identify causal relationships between EV adoption and CI growth in 137 counties, and show that causality is observed more frequently in Early Adoption scenarios than in Late Adoption ones. However, the causal effects in Early Adoption are slower than those in Late Adoption.</description>

      <title>Contrail, or not contrail, that is the question: the "feasibility" of climate-optimal routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The environmental impact of aviation has been the subject of significant research efforts for several decades. While reducing carbon emissions has reached a consensus across different stakeholders, leading to efforts to reduce route inefficiencies in air traffic management systems, other climate effects like contrails have spurred a different kind of discussion in the research community. Some research has rapidly moved into the pre-operational phase, aiming to reduce the climate impact of aviation by optimizing flight trajectories to avoid contrail formation. Notably, recent commercial projects from Google and Breakthrough Energy have been fast-tracking the operational perspective of contrail avoidance. In our past research, we have established a robust and fast methodology for trajectory optimization to minimize contrail formation based on TOP, a trajectory optimizer using the OpenAP aircraft performance model.
  In this paper, we address the practical challenges of implementing contrail-aware routing strategies in the aviation industry. We analyze the trade-offs between fuel consumption and contrail avoidance, the impact of weather forecast uncertainty on contrail mitigation strategies, the effects of contrail mitigation on airspace capacity and network operations, and the implications of contrail reduction strategies on the aviation industry and regulatory frameworks. We use a dataset of flight trajectories over Europe on a day with significant contrail potential to conduct a data-driven analysis of these challenges. Then, we demonstrate the potential difficulties in implementing contrail-optimal routing, especially concerning the uncertainties in weather forecasts, airspace capacity, and the responsibility for optimal routing. Overall, we argue that contrail optimal routing should be approached with caution, and it may not be as straightforward as promoted by some stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Where do local markets fit in the current European Electricity Market structures?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: European electricity markets have been complex since their inception. Policies and technologies advancing renewable integration, consumer empowerment, flexibility, and electrification are reshaping generation and consumption, increasing this complexity. System operators face congestion, voltage management, and redispatch challenges while market actors navigate imbalances and volatility. New market structures, such as energy communities and local flexibility markets, aim to address local energy dynamics and integrate decentralized flexibility. However, their fit within existing market frameworks remains unclear, leading to inconsistent interpretations and regulatory uncertainties. This manuscript presents a graphical classification of local markets, positioning them within electricity procurement (e.g., wholesale) and system operation (e.g., ancillary) services while illustrating their interrelations. Despite their potential, these markets remain in early development, facing regulatory ambiguities, resource limitations, and coordination challenges.</description>

      <title>Parenthood Penalties in Academia: Childcare Responsibilities, Gender Role Beliefs and Institutional Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite progress toward gender parity, women remain underrepresented in academia, particularly in senior research positions. This study investigates the role of parenthood in shaping gender disparities in academic careers, focusing on the complex interplay between gender, childcare responsibilities, gender role beliefs, institutional support, and scientists' career achievements. Using a large-scale survey of 5,670 U.S. and Canadian academics, supplemented with bibliometric data from Web of Science, it reveals that childcare responsibilities significantly mediate gender disparities in both subjective and objective academic achievements, with women assuming a disproportionate share of childcare duties. In particular, women shoulder a greater caregiving load when their partners are employed full-time outside academia. However, egalitarian gender role beliefs have been playing an important role in shifting this structure by transforming women academics' behaviors. As women's egalitarian gender role beliefs strengthen, their childcare responsibilities tend to diminish-an effect not mirrored in men. Institutional parental support policies show mixed effects. While flexible work schedules and childcare support can mitigate the negative association between childcare responsibilities and career outcomes of women academics, policies such as tenure clock extensions and paternity leave may inadvertently intensify it. Addressing these disparities necessitates a comprehensive approach that integrates shifts in individual attitudes, broader sociocultural changes, and policy improvements.</description>

      <title>Operatorial formulation of crimo-taxis phenomena in a street</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the ladder operators typical of quantum mechanics are used to construct an operatorial version of a model dubbed crimo-taxis. In a classical framework, the crimo-taxis model is described by reaction-diffusion partial differential equations describing a population divided into three interacting subgroups (ordinary citizens, drug users/dealers, and law enforcement personnel). By means of a quantum-like approach, these interacting subgroups are modeled using annihilation, creation, and number fermionic operators. Their dynamics is governed by a self-adjoint and time-independent Hamiltonian operator, emboding the interactions among the groups. Furthermore, a recent variant of the standard Heisenberg approach, namely $(\mathcal{H},\rho)$--induced dynamics, is also taken into account with the goal of enriching the dynamics. The results of some numerical simulations in a one--dimensional setting are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Microscopic features of the effect of vehicle overacceleration on traffic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through the development of a microscopic deterministic model in the framework of three-phase traffic theory, microscopic features of vehicle overacceleration, which determines the occurrence of the metastability of free traffic flow at a bottleneck, have been revealed: (i) The greater the impact of vehicle overacceleration on free traffic flow at a bottleneck, the higher the maximum flow rate at which free flow can persist at the bottleneck, i.e., the better traffic breakdown can be avoided. (ii) There can be at least two mechanisms of overacceleration in road lane caused by safety acceleration at the bottleneck. (iii) Through a microscopic analysis of spatiotemporal competition between speed adaptation and vehicle acceleration behaviors, traffic conditions have been found at which safety acceleration in road lane or/and vehicle acceleration due to lane-changing on multi-lane road become overacceleration. (iv) There is spatiotemporal cooperation of different overacceleration mechanisms. (v) The stronger the overacceleration cooperation, the stronger the maintenance of free flow at the bottleneck due to overacceleration. (vi) On two-lane road, both speed adaptation and overacceleration in road lane can effect qualitatively on the overacceleration mechanism caused by lane-changing. These microscopic features of the effect of vehicle overacceleration on traffic flow are related to traffic flow consisting of human-driving or/and automated-driving vehicles.</description>

      <title>Identifying polycentric urban structure using the minimum cycle basis of road network as building blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a graph, the minimum cycle bases are a set of linearly independent cycles that can be used to represent any cycle within that cycle space of graph. These bases are useful in various contexts, including the intricate analysis of electrical networks, structural engineering endeavors, chemical processes and surface reconstruction techniques etc. This study focuses on six cities in China to explore the topological characteristics, the centrality of nodes and robustness of urban road networks based on motif and minimum cycle bases. Some interesting conclusions are obtained: the frequency of motifs containing cycles exceeds that of random networks with equivalent degree sequences; the frequency distribution of minimum cycle's length and surface areas obey the power-law distribution. The cycle contribution rate is introduced to investigate the centrality of nodes within road networks, and has a significant impact on the total number of cycles in the robustness analysis. Finally, we construct two types of cycle-based dual networks for urban road networks by representing cycles as nodes and establishing edges between two cycles sharing a common node and edge respectively. The results show that cycle-based dual networks exhibit small-world and scale-free properties.</description>

      <title>One pathogen does not an epidemic make: A review of interacting contagions, diseases, beliefs, and stories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From pathogens and computer viruses to genes and memes, contagion models have found widespread utility across the natural and social sciences. Despite their success and breadth of adoption, the approach and structure of these models remain surprisingly siloed by field. Given the siloed nature of their development and widespread use, one persistent assumption is that a given contagion can be studied in isolation, independently from what else might be spreading in the population. In reality, countless contagions of biological and social nature interact within hosts (interacting with existing beliefs, or the immune system) and across hosts (interacting in the environment, or affecting transmission mechanisms). Additionally, from a modeling perspective, we know that relaxing these assumptions has profound effects on the physics and translational implications of the models. Here, we review mechanisms for interactions in social and biological contagions, as well as the models and frameworks developed to include these interactions in the study of the contagions. We highlight existing problems related to the inference of interactions and to the scalability of mathematical models and identify promising avenues of future inquiries. In doing so, we highlight the need for interdisciplinary efforts under a unified science of contagions and for removing a common dichotomy between social and biological contagions.</description>

      <title>Community detection in hypergraphs through hyperedge percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex networks, representing the connections between the constituents of large complex systems, are often characterised by a community structure, with communities corresponding to denser sub-graphs in which nodes are closely linked. When modelling systems where interactions extend beyond node pairs to involve arbitrary numbers of nodes, hypergraphs become necessary, creating a need for specialised community detection methods. Here, we adapt the classical $k$-clique percolation method to hypergraphs, building communities from hyperedges containing at least $k$ nodes, defining hyperedge adjacency similarly to clique adjacency in the original algorithm. Although the analogy between the proposed hyperedge percolation method and the classical clique percolation algorithm is evident, we show that communities obtained directly from the hyperedges can differ from those identified by the clique percolation method in the pairwise projection of the hypergraph. We also propose an alternative way for uniting hyperedges into communities, where instead of limiting the cardinality of the considered hyperedges from below, we restrict the size of the largest hyperedges that can be added to a community. This alternative algorithm is better suited to hypergraphs where larger edges realise weaker linkages between the nodes. After comparing the suggested two approaches on simple synthetic hypergraphs constructed to highlight their differences, we test them on hypergraphs generated with a newly proposed geometric process on the hyperbolic plane, as well as on some real-world examples.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multi-level Urban Instant Delivery Management via Infomap-based Hierarchical Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient management of on-demand delivery systems is essential for modern urban logistics, especially in densely populated cities with complex spatial layouts. This study introduces a novel, computer-supported cooperative framework that utilizes Infomap-based hierarchical community detection to analyze spatial multilevel clustering patterns. The experiment was conducted to large scale on-demand delivery datasets from Shenzhen and Beijing, revealing integrated spatial clusters that align with cohesive urban layout. Through hierarchical detection, finer and fragmented clusters are identified, reflecting its diverse urban structure and delivery demands. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical community detection in uncovering spatial dependencies and optimizing resource allocation and delivery strategies. This framework provides practical insights for urban logistics, enabling tailored approaches for business hub placement, route allocation, and adaptive resource management.</description>

      <title>Surfacic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surfacic networks are structures built upon a two-dimensional manifold. Many systems, including transportation networks and various urban networks, fall into this category. The fluctuations of node elevations imply significant deviations from typical plane networks and require specific tools to understand their impact. Here, we present such tools, including lazy paths that minimize elevation differences, graph arduousness which measures the tiring nature of shortest paths, and the excess effort, which characterizes positive elevation variations along shortest paths. We illustrate these measures using toy models of surfacic networks and empirically examine pedestrian networks in selected cities. Specifically, we examine how changes in elevation affect the spatial distribution of betweenness centrality. We also demonstrate that the excess effort follows a non-trivial power law distribution, with an exponent that is not universal, which illustrates that there is a significant probability of encountering steep slopes along shortest paths, regardless of the elevation difference between the starting point and the destination. These findings highlight the significance of elevation fluctuations in shaping network characteristics. Surfacic networks offer a promising framework for comprehensively analyzing and modeling complex systems that are situated on or constrained to a surface environment.</description>

      <title>COARA will not save science from the tyranny of administrative evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) agreement is a cornerstone in the ongoing efforts to reform research evaluation. CoARA advocates for administrative evaluations of research that rely on peer review, supported by responsible metrics, as beneficial for both science and society. Its principles can be critically examined through the lens of Philip Kitcher's concept of well-ordered science in a democratic society. From Kitcher's perspective, CoARA's approach faces two significant challenges: definitions of quality and impact are determined by governments or evaluation institutions rather than emerging from broad public deliberation, and a select group of scientists is empowered to assess research based on these predefined criteria. This creates susceptibility to both the ''tyranny of expertise'' and the ''tyranny of ignorance'' that Kitcher cautions against. Achieving Kitcher's ideal would require limiting administrative evaluations to essential tasks, such as researcher recruitment and project funding, while establishing procedures grounded in principles of fairness.</description>
