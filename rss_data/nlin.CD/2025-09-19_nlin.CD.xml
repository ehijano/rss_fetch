      <title>Dynamic effects of electric field in hybrid coupling thermosensitive neuronal network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic of thermosensitive neuronal networks under the influence of external electric fields is explored, focusing on hybrid coupling models that incorporate both electrical and chemical synapses. Numerical simulations reveal a variety of complex behaviors, including coherent, incoherent, and chimera states, which are influenced by the frequency of the external field and the cell size. Specificaly chemical coupling is shown to enhances the appearance of a typical chimera states called traveling chimera states, while the external electric field modulates synchronization based on its frequency. Low-frequency fields induce localized synchronization, whereas high-frequency fields exert minimal influence. The study also investigates the role of intrinsic electric fields, represented by cell size, and their effect on both individual neuron activity and network dynamics. These findings enhance the understanding of how external fields control collective neuronal behavior and open up new possibilities for the modulation of neural activity.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Geodesic Dynamics with Conservative, Dissipative, and GUP Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive generalized geodesic equations in curved spacetime that include conservative forces, dissipative effects, and quantum-gravity-motivated minimal-length corrections. Conservative interactions are incorporated through external vector potentials, while dissipative dynamics arise from an exponential rescaling of the particle Lagrangian. Quantum-gravity effects are introduced via Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) deformed Poisson brackets in the Hamiltonian framework. We show that free-particle geodesics remain unaffected at leading order, but external potentials induce velocity-dependent corrections, implying possible violations of the equivalence principle. As an application, we analyze modified trajectories in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes dominated by dust, radiation, stiff matter, and dark energy. Our results establish a unified approach to conservative, dissipative, and GUP-corrected geodesics, providing a framework to probe the interplay between external forces, spacetime curvature, and Planck-scale physics.</description>

      <title>Chaotic scattering and heating in cold ion-atom collisions: two sides of the same coin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the classical dynamics of a Paul-trapped ion in a low-density bath of atoms above 1 $\mu\textrm{K}$. We find that lower energy collisions with more massive atoms, especially at energies less than the initial micromotion heating, are more likely to form atom-ion complexes. These complexes evolve in a fractal structure for every scattering observable, showing non-hyperbolic chaotic dynamics. To explore the chaotic dynamics, we use a GPU-accelerated methodology allowing us to run over $3\times 10^{8}$ trajectories of a $^{174}$Yb$^+$ and different atoms. As a result, after analyzing the dynamics as a function of the atom species, collision energy, trap parameters, and ion-atom potential depth, we find a link between heating and the onset of chaos in the first atom-ion interaction that occurs when a low-density atomic bath is merged with a trapped ion.</description>
