      <title>Impact of line-of-sight structure on weak lensing observables of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing observations of galaxy clusters are sensitive to all mass along the line-of-sight, introducing systematic and additional statistical uncertainties due to intervening structures. We quantify their impact on the recovery of mass density profile parameters using 967 clusters from the highest-resolution FLAMINGO simulation. We construct mock weak lensing maps, including both single source plane mocks and Euclid-like mocks with a realistic source redshift distribution. Applying Bayesian inference with Nautilus, we fit spherical and elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White models to recover the cluster mass, concentration, axis ratio, and centre, which we use to measure the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) offset from the potential centre, or `BCG wobble'. We find that the spherical model fits clusters along under-dense sight-lines better than those along over-dense ones. This introduces a positive skew in the relative error distributions for mass and concentration, which increases with source redshift. In Euclid-like mocks, this results in a mean mass bias of $+5.3\pm1.4$% (significant at $3.5\sigma$) when assuming a spherical NFW model. We also detect a mean axis ratio bias of $-2.0\pm0.7$% ($2.9\sigma$), with no significant bias in concentration. We measure a BCG wobble of ~14 kpc in our Euclid-like mocks, with negligible contribution from line-of-sight structure. Furthermore, we predict the scatter in mass estimates from future weak lensing surveys that have mean source redshifts $z_\text s \gtrsim 1.2$ (such as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope), will be dominated by line-of-sight structure and hence assuming a diagonal covariance matrix will lead to overestimating the precision. We conclude that cluster weak lensing pipelines should be calibrated on simulations with lightcone data in order to properly account for the significant impact of line-of-sight structure.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes in Randall-Sundrum: Cosmological signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider primordial black hole physics in Randall-Sundrum Type-II universes, focusing on constraints from cosmological and astrophysical observables. We pay particular attention to scenarios that allow the entirety of dark matter to be in the form of higher-dimensional primordial black holes. This is possible for a range of AdS radii and black hole masses. Observable constraints are generally modified due to the changes in the higher-dimensional gravitational sector, and come from low-energy $e^{\pm}$ emission, microlensing, and possibly from contributions to unresolved radiation backgrounds. We discuss constraints from the cosmic microwave background due to injection of Hawking quanta into the intergalactic medium. Finally, we comment on recent discussions on the compatibility of higher-dimensional black holes and the KM3-230213A event.</description>

      <title>Field-level inference in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes delve into field-level inference, a framework offering a robust way to extract more information and avoid biases compared to traditional methods for cosmological data analysis. The core idea is to analyse uncompressed maps to infer underlying physical fields and cosmological parameters. We introduce Bayesian hierarchical field-level models and discuss sampling techniques for exploring complex, high-dimensional posterior distributions. We review the framework that underpins field-level inference. Finally, we highlight some state-of-the-art applications across various cosmological probes, and the growing role of machine learning in enhancing field-level inference capabilities.</description>

      <title>Using Neural Emulators and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to constrain the Epoch of Reionization's History with the Ly$\alpha$ Forest Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) forest at $z \sim 5$ offers a primary probe to constrain the history of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), retaining thermal and ionization signatures imprinted by the reionization process. In this work, we present a new inference framework based on JAX that combines forward-modeled Ly$\alpha$ forest observables with differentiable neural emulators and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). We construct a dataset of 501 low-resolution simulations generated with user-defined reionization histories and compute a set of 1D Ly$\alpha$ power spectra and model-dependent covariance matrices. We then train two independent neural emulators that achieve sub-percent errors across relevant scales and combine them with HMC to efficiently perform parameter estimation. We validate this framework by applying it to a suite of mock observations, demonstrating that the true parameters are reliably recovered. While this work is limited by the low resolution of the simulations used, our results highlight the potential of this method for inferring the reionization history from high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forest measurements. Future improvements in our reionization models will further enhance its ability to extract constraints from observational datasets.</description>

      <title>Nucleation regions in the Large-Scale Structure II: Morphology and dynamical state of supercluster cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the morphology and dynamical properties of cores within rich superclusters, highlighting their role as transitional structures in the large-scale structure of the Universe. Using projected and radial velocity distributions of member galaxies, we identify cores as dense structures that, despite being gravitationally bound, are not yet dynamically relaxed. However, they exhibit a tendency toward virialisation, evolving in a self-similar manner to massive galaxy clusters but on a larger scale. Morphological analysis reveals that cores are predominantly filamentary, reflecting quasi-linear formation processes consistent with the Zeldovich approximation. Our estimates of the entropy confirm their intermediate dynamical state, with relaxation levels varying across the sample. Mass estimates indicate efficient accretion processes, concentrating matter into gravitationally bound systems. We conclude that cores are important environments where galaxy evolution and hierarchical assembly occur, bridging the gap between supercluster-scale structures and virialised clusters.</description>

      <title>DESI DR1 Ly$\alpha$ 1D power spectrum: Validation of estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is the largest sample to date for small-scale Ly$\alpha$ forest cosmology, accessed through its one-dimensional power spectrum ($P_{\mathrm{1D}}$). The Ly$\alpha$ forest $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ is extracted from quasar spectra that are highly inhomogeneous (both in wavelength and between quasars) in noise properties due to intrinsic properties of the quasar, atmospheric and astrophysical contamination, and also sensitive to low-level details of the spectral extraction pipeline. We employ two estimators in DR1 analysis to measure $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$: the optimal estimator and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) estimator. To ensure robustness of our DR1 measurements, we validate these two power spectrum and covariance matrix estimation methodologies against the challenging aspects of the data. First, using a set of 20 synthetic 1D realizations of DR1, we derive the masking bias corrections needed for the FFT estimator and the continuum fitting bias needed for both estimators. We demonstrate that both estimators, including their covariances, are unbiased with these corrections using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Second, we substantially extend our previous suite of CCD image simulations to include 675,000 quasars, allowing us to accurately quantify the pipeline's performance. This set of simulations reveals biases at the highest $k$ values, corresponding to a resolution error of a few percent. We base the resolution systematics error budget of DR1 $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ on these values, but do not derive corrections from them since the simulation fidelity is insufficient for precise corrections.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Birefringence from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarized light of the cosmic microwave background is sensitive to new physics that violates parity symmetry. For example, the interaction of photons with the fields of elusive dark matter and dark energy could cause a uniform rotation of the plane of linear polarization across the sky, an effect known as cosmic birefringence. We extract the cosmological rotation angle, $\beta$, using Bayesian analysis of parity-violating correlations, $EB$ and $TB$, of polarization data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6. We use prior probabilities for instrumental miscalibration angles derived from the optics model for the ACT telescope and instruments, and marginalize over a residual intensity-to-polarization leakage. We measure $\beta = 0.215^\circ\pm 0.074^\circ$ (68\% confidence level), which excludes $\beta=0$ with a statistical significance of $2.9\sigma$. Although there remain systematics in the ACT data that are not understood and do not allow us to draw strong cosmological conclusions, this result is consistent with previous independent results from the \wmap\ and \planck\ missions. It is suggestive that independent data sets and analyses using different methodologies have yielded the same sign and comparable magnitudes for $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Conditioning halos on the tidal environment for fast and accurate HI power spectra during reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the statistical properties of the neutral hydrogen (HI) density field during reionization is an important step in using upcoming 21 cm observations to constrain models of reionization. Semi-numerical models of reionization are often coupled with the collapse fraction field $f_{\text{coll}}(\mathbf{x})$, which determines the fraction of dark matter within halos. In this work, we improve upon earlier prescriptions that compute $f_{\text{coll}}$ based on the dark matter overdensity $\delta(\mathbf{x})$ alone, to include more information about the environment in the form of eigenvalues of the tidal tensor. We compute the mean of the $f_{\text{coll}}$ conditioned on these eigenvalues from a set of high-resolution, small-volume simulations and use them to sample the $f_{\text{coll}}$ field of a low-resolution, large-volume simulation. We subsequently use a semi-numerical code for reionization to compute the HI density field and its power spectrum, and benchmark our results against a reference high-resolution, large-volume simulation. Across variations in redshift, ionized fraction, grid resolution, and minimum halo mass, our method recovers the large-scale HI power spectrum with errors at the $\lesssim 2\%-5\%$ level for $k \lesssim 0.5~ h~ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, providing a substantial improvement over the $\sim 10\%$ results previously obtained using density-only conditioning. Overall, this makes our method a simple yet efficient tool for forward modeling HI maps during reionization.</description>

      <title>An updated constraint on the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFTofDE) provides a systematic and model-independent framework to study dark energy (DE) and modified gravity (MG) with one additional scalar degree of freedom. It can describe the known models such as Quintessence, k-essence, DGP, $f(R)$, and Horndeski theories. In this work, we update constraints on EFTofDE by utilizing the most up-to-date public data including the BAO (DESI DR2), CMB (Planck 2018 \&amp; ACT DR6), SNIa (DESY5), weak lensing (DESY3) and full-shape galaxy power (BOSS DR12). We find with the $\Lambda$CDM background, general relativity (GR) is favored by the data, while with the $w0wa$CDM background, slight modification to GR is favored, but still consistent with GR within $1.5\sigma$. We also find the significance level for dynamical DE is greatly reduced within EFTofDE compared to within GR, indicating the degeneracy between dynamical DE and MG.</description>

      <title>The effect of matter discreteness on gravitational wave propagation in post-geometrical optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave equation of motion includes direct coupling to the Riemann tensor. The curvature terms are usually neglected, but they can be large at the location of matter particles and impact the angular diameter distance. We apply the recently introduced post-geometrical optics approximation that includes curvature to gravitational wave propagation. Assuming that particles are localised within their Compton wavelength, the curvature due to electrons leads to a large effect on the angular diameter distance, but caustic formation invalidates the post-geometrical optics approximation. We conclude that the interesting regime of validity of the approximation is limited, as it ceases to apply when the curvature effects become large. Other methods are needed to evaluate the effect of curvature spikes, and the localisation of particles due to decoherence also needs further work.</description>

      <title>Recovering the Coupled Treatment of Redshift-Space Distortions and the Lightcone Effect after Diffuse Foreground Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21 cm brightness temperature during the Epoch of Reionisation is widely modelled using semi-numeric simulations, used for their computational speed and flexibility in testing astrophysical and cosmological parameters. However, it is common practice to simulate coeval brightness temperature boxes, and then apply post-processing algorithms that treat the lightcone effect and redshift-space distortions separately, assuming they can be added in sequence. We instead model them together, allowing for partial coeval cell contributions, and ensuring that velocity-induced frequency shifts are computed at the correct cosmic time for every position along the line of sight. We show that considering these effects simultaneously creates a difference in the shape of the power spectrum over all Fourier scales, and remains recoverable after semi-blind foreground removal. We show that our lightcones consist of an average of 8% and maximum of 120% of a coeval cell length. These contributions to a 21cm brightness temperature lightcone voxel are shifted from within a +/- 0.5 MHz range of the emitted frequency. The boost in the power spectrum seen over small scales (k&gt;1.5 Mpc) of our robust 21 cm lightcone method compared to basic methods is recoverable after the addition and removal of diffuse radio foregrounds. The largest differences during the Epoch of Reionisation lie in the k-space, where the noise sensitivity for a 1000-hour SKAO-low observation is greater than the signal. However, in the cosmic dawn, we have shown that the major differences lie outside of this noise-dominated region.</description>

      <title>Thermal SZ effect at the core of CL J1226.9+3332 revealed by NOEMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first detailed maps of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect on a $z = 0.89$ cluster with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). The high sensitivity of these observations enabled the effective identification and removal of the millimetre-wave sources contaminating the tSZ signal, thus isolating the influence of the cluster's hot electron gas on the cosmic microwave background radiation from other emissions. The tSZ observed with success by NOEMA is modelled together with previous single dish (IRAM 30-metre, Green Bank Telescope, and Caltech Sub-millimeter Observatory) observations to obtain the first core to outskirts (from $\sim$ 15 to $\sim$ 1500 kpc) pressure profile reconstruction on such a high redshift galaxy cluster. High angular resolution NOEMA observations have shown that the pressure profile is flat in the core of the cluster. These observations confirm the disturbed nature of CL J1226.9+3332 and map for the first time the distribution of its thermal gas at arcsecond scales, in the environments of the central cluster galaxy. Our results showcase NOEMA's excellent capabilities to complement and enhance the data provided by other millimetre-wave instruments in resolving the core of high-redshift clusters via tSZ emission.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Anomaly Detection for Ia Cosmology: Automating SALT3 Data Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision cosmology with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) requires robust quality control of large, heterogeneous datasets. Current data processing often relies on manual, subjective rejection of photometric data, a practice that is not scalable for forthcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We present a Bayesian framework that automates this step by integrating anomaly detection directly into the light curve fitting process. While the framework is model-agnostic and compatible with any spectral energy distribution (SED) model, here we demonstrate its application with the SALT3 model, implemented fully on GPU using \texttt{JAX-bandflux} for computational efficiency. Our method models the probability of each photometric measurement being anomalous with respect to the model, simultaneously inferring the physical supernova parameters and each data point's posterior probability of being a contaminant. Applying this framework to the Hawaii Supernova Flows dataset, we demonstrate its three principal capabilities: (i) robust mitigation of isolated outliers; (ii) automated identification and rejection of entirely corrupted bandpasses; and (iii) preservation of valid data by flagging only specific anomalous points within otherwise usable filters. We also find that contaminants are systematically brighter and bluer, which if uncorrected could bias subsequent cosmological inference.</description>

      <title>Maximal GW amplitude from bubble collisions in supercooled phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend analytic formulas for the gravitational-wave (GW) spectrum from first-order phase transitions to include cosmic expansion under the thin-wall and envelope approximations. We demonstrate that even for strongly supercooled transitions the GW amplitude is bounded from above. Moreover, the spectral shape, amplitude, and peak frequency remain largely unaffected by the details of the nucleation rate once expressed in terms of the comformal variables.</description>

      <title>Effect of temperature on the structure of porous dust aggregates formed by coagulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The source of high redshift dust has long been debated. One possible source are the ejecta of pair-instability and core collapse supernovae, but it is uncertain how much newly formed dust can survive the supernova reverse shock and be injected into the interstellar medium. We anticipate the structure of the pre-shocked dust to affect how much of it survives. Yet, the structure of dust formed in supernova is not well understood. We present three-dimensional soft-sphere, dust coagulation simulations aimed at studying the impact of temperature and particle size distribution on the structure of growing dust aggregates. Due to the qualitative nature of the concept of structure, there are many ways to define and quantify it, especially for an irregular aggregate. Thus, we test four metrics commonly used in the literature in order to compare the aggregate properties as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the metrics themselves. Our findings show that higher temperatures result in denser, more compact structures for all metrics tested. Additionally, we find that structures that coagulate from a distribution of particle sizes are denser and more compact than structures formed from identical particles under similar conditions. The latter finding, however, is true for three of the metrics except for the average number of contact points, which has proven to be the least reliable of the four considered metrics.</description>

      <title>Dark matter annihilation signals from the Large Magellanic Cloud and its impact on the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dark matter (DM) annihilation signals from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the impact of the LMC on the DM annihilation signals from the Milky Way (MW) halo, using a MW-LMC analogue from the Auriga magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the gamma-ray signals from DM annihilation from the LMC rises above the MW foreground by a factor of greater than 100 for the s-wave velocity-independent annihilation model, as well as for the Sommerfeld, p-wave, and d-wave velocity-dependent models. We derive upper limits on the annihilation cross section of DM particles in the LMC using Fermi-LAT data for all velocity-dependent cross section models. Bounds for d-wave annihilation are more stringent by $\sim 4-6$ orders of magnitude relative to previous bounds from dwarf galaxies, and for p-wave emission our bounds are $\sim 2-3$ orders of magnitude more stringent. We also demonstrate that the impact of the LMC on the DM annihilation signals from the MW halo is greatest for the p-wave and d-wave models towards the outer MW halo, while the impact is minimal for Sommerfeld and s-wave models. The LMC boosts the DM density and velocity distribution in the outer MW halo, both by bringing in high-speed DM particles and by accelerating the DM particles of the MW, affecting the DM annihilation signals from the MW for the p-wave and d-wave models.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Split Conjecture and an Observational Test for Cosmological Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit string theoretic derivations of black hole entropy and argue that their enabling structures do not persist in realistic cosmologies. We formalize this as the Thermodynamic Split Conjecture (TSC) which is the statement that in any UV complete quantum gravity, black hole and cosmological horizon thermodynamics are generically inequivalent. The BKE criterion is then formulated to formalize this approach while we also discuss ways to falsify the conjecture. Finally, we propose an observational scaling test which is centered around comparisons of data native entropy proxies from tomographic maps to the Bekenstein Hawking prediction. The framework both sharpens when and why the area law holds and provides a roadmap towards a UV complete description of cosmological horizon entropy.</description>

      <title>Recovering CMB polarization maps with neural networks: Performance in realistic simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recovering the polarized cosmic microwave background (CMB) is essential for shedding light on the exponential expansion of the very early Universe, known as cosmic inflation. Achieving this goal requires not only improved instrumental sensitivity but also the development of robust and diverse data analysis techniques. In this work, we explore a novel component separation approach based on neural networks to reconstruct the Stokes $Q$ and $U$ polarization maps. To validate the method, we first test the network on realistic \textit{Planck} sky simulations, finding a mean absolute error of $0.1 \pm 0.3~\mu K^{2}$ for the $E$-mode and $-0.1 \pm 0.3~\mu K^{2}$ for the $B$-mode. We then apply the trained network to public \textit{Planck} observations, with results consistent with those obtained using the Commander method. Based on these findings, we conclude that neural network-based methods show potential as component separation techniques in polarization CMB experiments. However, substantial improvements and more comprehensive analyses are necessary before these methods can provide reliable high-precision cosmological estimates.</description>

      <title>The impact of diffuse Galactic emission on direction-independent gain calibration in high-redshift 21 cm observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of diffuse Galactic emission (DGE) on sky-based direction-independent (DI) gain calibration using realistic forward simulations of Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations of the high-redshift 21 cm signal of neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We simulated LOFAR observations between 147 and 159 MHz using a sky model that includes a point source catalog and DGE. The simulated observations were DI-gain calibrated with the point source catalog alone, utilizing the LOFAR-EoR data analysis pipeline. A full power spectrum (PS) analysis was conducted to measure the systematic bias, relative to thermal noise, caused by DI-gain calibration using a point-source-only (PSO) sky model, when applied to simulated data that include both point sources and DGE. The results are compared to a ground truth scenario where both the simulated sky and the calibration model include only point sources. Additionally, the cross-coherence between observation pairs was computed to determine whether DI-gain calibration errors are coherent or incoherent in specific regions of PS space as a function of integration time. We find that DI-gain calibration with a PSO sky model that omits DGE introduces a systematic bias in the PS for $k_{\parallel}$ bins &lt; 0.2 $h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The PS errors in these bins are coherent in time and frequency; therefore, the resulting bias could be mitigated during the foreground removal step using Gaussian Process Regression, as demonstrated in previous studies. In contrast, errors for $k_{\parallel}$ &gt; 0.2 $h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ are largely incoherent and average down as noise. We conclude that, based on our analysis prior to foreground removal, missing DGE in the sky model during DI-gain calibration is unlikely to be a dominant contributor to the excess noise observed in the current LOFAR-EoR upper limits on the 21 cm signal PS.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the epoch of reionisation with Planck PR4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The epoch of reionisation is a key phase in cosmic history, characterised by the ionisation of the intergalactic medium by the first luminous sources. In this work, we constrain the reionisation history of the Universe using data from the cosmic microwave background, more specifically the latest Planck Public Release 4 (PR4) dataset. We investigate a wide range of reionisation models, from simple parametric descriptions to more flexible non-parametric approaches, systematically evaluating their impact on the inferred constraints. Special attention is given to implicit priors introduced by each model and their influence on the derived reionisation optical depth, $\tau$. To achieve this, we employ both Bayesian and frequentist methods to derive robust constraints. We obtain consistent estimates of $\tau$ across models, highlighting the robustness of the constraints on the integrated optical depth derived from the Planck PR4 data. Averaging across models, the posterior means and best-fit values, respectively, yield $\tau = 0.0576 \pm 0.0060$ and $\tau = 0.0581$, highlighting the presence of small volume effects. Based on our analysis, we estimate that an additional uncertainty, associated with the modelling of reionisation, contributes an error of approximately $\sigma_\tau\!\sim\!0.0006$. Beyond the integrated optical depth, our analysis reveals that the inferred ionisation fraction as a function of redshift is highly model-dependent. While current CMB data do not favour significant early ionisation, they are consistent with a modest contribution from ionised gas at very early times ($z&gt;15$). Although indicative upper bounds can be placed on such contributions, these limits remain strongly dependent on the assumed model.</description>

      <title>Spinning masters: on the impact of tidal forces and protohalo size on early spin evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore how the size and surrounding tidal fields of dark matter protohalos at high redshift influence their angular momentum (AM) evolution. While tidal torque theory (TTT) states that AM arises from the misalignment between protohalo shape and tidal fields, it remains unclear what is the characteristic scale of the perturbations that couple with each protohalo, and its correlation with protohalo properties such as size. Moreover, although the assumptions of the TTT are assumed to hold during the linear and quasi-linear regime, cosmological simulations reveal that discrepancies between its predictions and the true AM of halos emerge earlier than expected. To address this, we analyze cosmological simulations to study tidal fields at z=80 using different smoothing lengths, and determine which best predicts AM under TTT. We then investigate discrepancies between predicted and actual AM across redshifts, considering the effect of evolving tidal and inertia tensors. Our results show that the early tidal field couples with the inertia tensor of protohalos on scales about half of their characteristic size and confirm that disagreements between theory and simulation emerge already at relatively early cosmic times (z~10-5), suggesting a systematic effect from protohalo shape interacting with the forming cosmic web.</description>

      <title>On the Analysis Dependence of DESI Dynamical Dark Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue scientific scrutiny of the DESI dynamical dark energy (DE) claim by explicitly demonstrating that the result depends on the analysis pipeline. Concretely, we define a likelihood that converts the $w_0 w_a$CDM model back into the (flat) $\Lambda$CDM model, which we fit to DESI constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model from DR1 Full-Shape (FS) modelling and BAO. We further incorporate CMB constraints. Throughout, we find that $w_0$ and $w_a$ are within $1 \sigma$ of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our work makes it explicit that, in contrast to DR1 and DR2 BAO, there is no dynamical DE signal in FS modelling, even when combined with BAO and CMB. Moreover, one confirms late-time accelerated expansion today $(q_0 &lt; 0)$ at $ \gtrsim 3.4 \sigma$ in FS modelling + BAO. On the contrary, DR1 and DR2 BAO fail to confirm $q_0 &lt; 0$ under similar assumptions. Our analysis highlights the fact that trustable scientific results should be independent of the analysis pipeline.</description>

      <title>Observational Insights on DBI K-essence Models Using Machine Learning and Bayesian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comparative statistical analysis of two Dirac--Born--Infeld (DBI) type k-essence scalar field models (Model I and Model II) for late-time cosmic acceleration, alongside the standard $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM benchmarks. The models are constrained using a joint dataset comprising Pantheon+, Hubble parameter measurements, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), including the latest DESI DR2 release. To ensure efficient and accurate likelihood evaluations, we employ Bayesian inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) in \texttt{NumPyro}, supplemented with a machine learning (ML) emulator. Model selection is performed using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The results demonstrate excellent consistency between the MCMC and ML emulator approaches. Compared to the reference models, $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM, Model I yields the lowest $\chi^2$ and a negative $\Delta$AIC relative to $\Lambda$CDM, indicating a mild statistical preference for its richer late-time dynamics, though the BIC penalizes its additional parameter and prevents a decisive advantage. Conversely, Model II has a lower accuracy compared to both $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM according to AIC and BIC, leading to its disfavor. Notably, Model I also delivers $H_0=73.67\pm0.15$ (without the nuisance parameter $\mu_0$) in agreement with SH0ES, and $H_0=69.65\pm0.83$ (with $\mu_0$) as an intermediate value, thereby reconciling with local measurements while simultaneously providing a compromise between early and late universe determinations. This dual feature offers a promising pathway toward alleviating the Hubble tension. Overall, our analysis highlights the significance of non-canonical scalar field models as viable alternatives to $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM, which often provide improved fits to current observational data.</description>

      <title>Constraining the lensing dispersion from the angular clustering of binary black hole mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries provide direct measurements of luminosity distances and serve as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe. In addition to their role as standard sirens, they offer an opportunity to constrain small-scale density fluctuations through the dispersion in the distance-redshift relation induced by gravitational lensing. We propose a method to constrain this lensing dispersion without requiring the redshift information by analyzing the angular clustering of gravitational wave sources. Our formalism incorporating second-order lensing effects in the luminosity distance shows that the amplitude of the auto-correlation angular clustering decreases with increasing lensing dispersion. While we show that the auto-correlation signal is detected with sufficient signal-to-noise ratios in future gravitational wave experiments, there exists a strong degeneracy between the lensing dispersion and the linear bias of gravitational wave sources. We demonstrate that this degeneracy is partially broken by a joint analysis of the auto-correlation of gravitational wave sources and the cross-correlation with galaxies whose redshifts are known. This approach enhances the use of gravitational waves as a cosmological probe at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $\Delta N_{eff}$ Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $&gt;3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08716v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of simulation-based inference (SBI) methods, simulations need to be fast as well as realistic. $\texttt{UFig v1}$ is a public Python package that simulates astronomical images with exceptional speed, taking approximately the same time as source extraction. This makes it particularly well-suited for SBI methods where computational efficiency is crucial. To render an image, $\texttt{UFig}$ requires a galaxy catalog, and a description of the point spread function (PSF). It can also add background noise, sample stars using the Besan\c{c}on model of the Milky Way, and run $\texttt{SExtractor}$ to extract sources from the rendered image. The extracted sources can be matched to the intrinsic catalog, flagged based on $\texttt{SExtractor}$ output and survey masks, and emulators can be used to bypass the image simulation and extraction steps. A first version of $\texttt{UFig}$ was presented in Berg\'e et al. (2013) and the software has since been used and further developed in a variety of forward modelling applications.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Formed during Magneto-Hydrodynamic Turbulence in The Early Universe as Dominant Part of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10158</link>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. The production of PBHs through well-tested and accepted physical processes is highly worthy of investigation. This work highlights the role of turbulences in the very early universe in sustaining intense and persistent fluctuations in energy or mass density, which could provide a natural mechanism for PBH formation in the primordial universe. We analyze the mass range and abundance of PBHs produced in the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by the electroweak phase transition. Remarkably, we find that the mass range of the produced PBHs falls within the most viable ``asteroid mass'' window from the present-day observations, and within natural parameter regions their abundance can be sufficiently large. These findings suggest that PBHs produced during magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the very early universe may comprise a dominant part of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Production of Dark Photons through Higher Electromagnetic Moments at LDMX: Simulations and Model Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the projected sensitivity of LDMX for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) to the case of dark photons produced through higher order electromagnetic moments. These moments arise from loop diagrams involving portal matter fields, along with the gauge fields of new symmetry groups. Due to the Lorentz structures, in particular the momentum dependence, of these additional interactions, the kinematic distributions expected at missing momentum/energy experiments vary with model in addition to dark photon mass. By considering four additional types of interactions -- magnetic and electric dipole, charge radius, and anapole moment -- we show that LDMX Phase-II is expected to probe the relic target of these additional dark photon models. We compare the analytic with the numerical methods for calculating the dark bremsstrahlung cross section, and compute the kinematic distributions for each model. The potential for model discrimination in the scenario of non-zero signal events at LDMX is discussed. We find that there is a degeneracy between the dark photon mass and model, which can be partially broken by considering both the energy and the transverse momentum of the recoil electron.</description>

      <title>Curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how the higher-order curvature terms $R^3$, $R^{4}$ and $R^{3/2}$ modify the inflationary predictions. Using the scalar-tensor formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, we derive the effective scalar potentials and compute the resulting scalar tilt $n_s$, its running index $\alpha_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We show that those curvature corrections can shift the predictions to align better with the ACT data, thus providing a possible resolution to a minor discrepancy between the standard Starobinsky model and ACT observations. Our findings suggest that the modified Starobinsky models with the higher-order curvature terms offer a viable pathway to reconciling inflationary predictions with precision cosmological measurements. At the same time, measuring or constraining primordial tensor modes can help to discriminate between these corrections.</description>

      <title>A black hole in a near-pristine galaxy 700 million years after the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a large number of massive black holes within the first two billion years after the Big Bang, as well as their peculiar properties, have been largely unexpected based on the extrapolation of the properties of luminous quasars. These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04 (classified as a Little Red Dot), hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow H$\beta$ emission indicates extremely low metallicity, less than $10^{-2}$ solar. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in some cases. Models invoking "primordial black holes" (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole, although this class of models also requires further developments for proper testing.</description>

      <title>The dark matter content of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies: Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Milky Way Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has so far observed three classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs): Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor. Based on the observed line-of-sight velocities and metallicities of their member stars, we apply the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion modeling (JAM) approach to recover their inner dark matter distributions. In particular, both the traditional single-population Jeans model and the multiple population chemodynamical model are adopted. With the chemodynamical model, we divide member stars of each dSph into metal-rich and metal-poor populations. The metal-rich populations are more centrally concentrated and dynamically colder, featuring lower velocity dispersion profiles than the metal-poor populations. We find a diversity of the inner density slopes $\gamma$ of dark matter halos, with the best constraints by single-population or chemodynamical models consistent with each other. The inner density slopes are $0.71^{+0.34}_{-0.35}$, $0.26^{+0.22}_{-0.12}$ and $0.33^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor, respectively. We also present the measured astrophysical J and D factors of the three dSphs. Our results indicate that the study of the dark matter content of dSphs through stellar kinematics is still subject to uncertainties behind both the methodology and the observed data, through comparisons with previous measurements and data sets.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Wavelength Survey of Transient Lensing Opportunities for Primordial Black Hole Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of short astrophysical transients provides a uniquely direct avenue for searching for primordial black holes (PBHs) across a vast range of masses. While past search efforts have focused on particular source classes-such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gamma-ray burst spikes-no systematic, multi-wavelength assessment has compared their relative potential for PBH discovery. We present here a broad assessment of transient lensing search opportunities, spanning more than twenty decades in photon frequency and over twelve orders of magnitude in PBH mass. For each class, we determine the accessible PBH mass window by accounting for wave-optics suppression and time-delay resolution limits, and we estimate potential sensitivities to the PBH abundance using representative event rates, distances, and optical depths. Our survey includes low-frequency radio events (FRBs, pulsar giant pulses, planetary cyclotron bursts), optical/infrared signals, and high-energy phenomena (gamma-ray burst spikes, fast X-ray transients, TeV blazar flares). We synthesize these results in a unified mass-abundance diagram and comprehensive tables summarizing both physical reach and observational requirements. This work serves as a roadmap for optimizing future multi-wavelength lensing searches, guiding the design of instruments and strategies to explore the PBH dark matter hypothesis across its remaining viable parameter space.</description>
