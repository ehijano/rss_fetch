      <title>Electrostatic Origins of the Dirichlet Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dirichlet Principle is an approach to solving the Dirichlet problem by means of a Dirichlet energy integral. It is part of the folklore of mathematics that the genesis of this argument was motivated by physical analogy involving electrostatic fields. The story goes something like this: If an electrostatic potential is prescribed on the boundary of a region, it will extend to a potential in the interior of the region which is harmonic when the electric field is in stable equilibrium, and that electrostatic field has minimum Dirichlet energy. The details of this argument are seldom given and where they are, they are typically scant, redacted, and speculative while often omitting either physics details or mathematics details. The purpose of this article is to give a detailed reconstruction of the electrostatic argument by combining accounts in several contemporary and historical disparate sources. Particular attention is given to explaining the frequently omitted physics and mathematical details and how they fit together to give the physical motivation.</description>

      <title>Samgamagr\=ama M\=adhava: An Updated Biography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an updated biography of Samgamagr\=ama M\=adhava incorporating viewpoints expounded by scholars in the recent past and collecting together in one place more details about his works culled from recent researches into his contributions to mathematics and astronomy. One major updation is with regard to the geographical location in Kerala where M\=adhava flourished. Other updations include observations on M\=adhava's algorithm to compute the numerical values of the sine and cosine functions and on his value of the mathematical constant $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Mathematics -- an imagined tool for rational cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysing several characteristic mathematical models: natural and real numbers, Euclidean geometry, group theory, and set theory, I argue that a mathematical model in its final form is a junction of a set of axioms and an internal partial interpretation of the corresponding language. It follows from the analysis that (i) mathematical objects do not exist in the external world: they are imagined objects, some of which, at least approximately, exist in our internal world of activities or we can realize or represent them there; (ii) mathematical truths are not truths about the external world but specifications (formulations) of mathematical conceptions; (iii) mathematics is first and foremost our imagined tool by which, with certain assumptions about its applicability, we explore nature and synthesize our rational cognition of it.</description>
