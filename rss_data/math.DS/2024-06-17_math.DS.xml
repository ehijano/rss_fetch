      <title>Averaging for random metastable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random metastability occurs when an externally forced or noisy system possesses more than one state of apparent equilibrium. This work investigates a class of random dynamical systems, arising from perturbing a one-dimensional piecewise smooth expanding map of the interval with two invariant subintervals, each supporting a unique ergodic absolutely continuous invariant measure. Upon perturbation, this invariance is destroyed, allowing trajectories to randomly switch between subintervals. We show that the invariant density of the randomly perturbed system may be approximated by an explicit convex combination of the two initially invariant densities, obtained by averaging. Further, we also identify the limit of the second Oseledets space, or coherent structure, as the perturbation shrinks to zero. Our results are applied to random paired tent maps over ergodic, measure-preserving, and invertible driving systems. Finally, we provide generalisations to systems admitting more than two initially invariant sets.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic entropy for harmonic measures on singular holomorphic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{F}=(M,\mathscr{L},E)$ be a Brody-hyperbolic singular holomorphic foliation on a compact complex manifold $M$. Suppose that $\mathscr{F}$ has isolated singularities and that its Poincar\'e metric is complete. This is the case for a very large class of singularities, namely, non-degenerate and saddle-nodes in dimension $2$. Let $\mu$ be an ergodic harmonic measure on $\mathscr{F}$. We show that the upper and lower local hyperbolic entropies of $\mu$ are leafwise constant almost everywhere. Moreover, we show that the entropy of $\mu$ is at least $2$.</description>

      <title>Classification of differentiable structures on the non-Hausdorff line with two origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify differentiable structures on a line $\mathbb{L}$ with two origins being a non-Hausdorff but $T_1$ one-dimensional manifold obtained by ``doubling'' $0$. For $k\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$ let $H$ be the group of homeomorphisms $h$ of $\mathbb{R}$ such that $h(0)=0$ and the restriction of $h$ to $\mathbb{R}\setminus0$ is a $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphism. Let also $D$ be the subgroup of $H$ consisting of $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}$ also fixing $0$. It is shown that there is a natural bijection between $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures on $\mathbb{L}$ (up to a $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphism fixing both origins) and double $D$-coset classes $D \setminus H / D = \{ D h D \mid h \in H\}$.
  Moreover, the set of all $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures on $\mathbb{L}$ (up to a $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphism which may also exchange origins) are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of double $(D,\pm)$-coset classes $D \setminus H^{\pm} / D = \{ D h D \cup D h^{-1} D \mid h \in H\}$.
  In particular, in contrast with the real line, the line with two origins $\mathbb{L}$ admits uncountably many pair-wise non-diffeomorphic $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures for each $k=1,2,\ldots,\infty$.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Programming for Differential Equations: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The differentiable programming paradigm is a cornerstone of modern scientific computing. It refers to numerical methods for computing the gradient of a numerical model's output. Many scientific models are based on differential equations, where differentiable programming plays a crucial role in calculating model sensitivities, inverting model parameters, and training hybrid models that combine differential equations with data-driven approaches. Furthermore, recognizing the strong synergies between inverse methods and machine learning offers the opportunity to establish a coherent framework applicable to both fields. Differentiating functions based on the numerical solution of differential equations is non-trivial. Numerous methods based on a wide variety of paradigms have been proposed in the literature, each with pros and cons specific to the type of problem investigated. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques to compute derivatives of numerical solutions of differential equations. We first discuss the importance of gradients of solutions of differential equations in a variety of scientific domains. Second, we lay out the mathematical foundations of the various approaches and compare them with each other. Third, we cover the computational considerations and explore the solutions available in modern scientific software. Last but not least, we provide best-practices and recommendations for practitioners. We hope that this work accelerates the fusion of scientific models and data, and fosters a modern approach to scientific modelling.</description>

      <title>Forest-skein groups III: simplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An Ore forest-skein category provides three forest-skein groups equipped with a powerful diagrammatic calculus analogous to Richard Thompson's groups F,T,V. We investigate when forest-skein groups have simple derived subgroups and establish two characterisations: a dynamical one and a categorical one. We then construct two classes of examples. The first associates two finitely presented simple groups to every finite binary tree and the second associates two simple groups to every n-ary Higman-Thompson group.</description>

      <title>On the small boundary property, $\mathcal Z$-stability, and Bauer simplexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact metrizable space, and let $\Delta$ be a closed set of Borel probability measures on $X$. We study the small boundary property of the pair $(X, \Delta)$. In particular, it is shown that $(X, \Delta)$ has the small boundary property if it has a restricted version of property Gamma.
  As an application, it is shown that, if $A$ is the crossed product C*-algebra $\mathrm{C}(X)\rtimes\mathbb Z^d$, where $(X, \mathbb Z^d)$ is a free minimal topological dynamical system, or if $A$ is an AH algebra with diagonal maps, then, $A$ is $\mathcal Z$-stable if the set of extreme tracial states is compact, regardless of its dimension.</description>

      <title>Uniform property $\Gamma$ and the small boundary property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, for a free action $\alpha \colon G \curvearrowright X$ of a countably infinite discrete amenable group on a compact metric space, the small boundary property is implied by uniform property $\Gamma$ of the Cartan subalgebra $(C(X) \subseteq C(X) \rtimes_\alpha G)$. The reverse implication has been demonstrated by Kerr and Szab\'o, from which we obtain that these two conditions are equivalent. We moreover show that, if $\alpha$ is also minimal, then almost finiteness of $\alpha$ is implied by tracial $\mathcal{Z}$-stability of the subalgebra $(C(X) \subseteq C(X) \rtimes_\alpha G)$. The reverse implication is due to Kerr, resulting in the equivalence of these two properties as well. As an application, we prove that if $\alpha \colon G \curvearrowright X$ and $\beta \colon H \curvearrowright Y$ are free actions and $\alpha$ has the small boundary property, then the product $\alpha \times \beta \colon G \times H \curvearrowright X \times Y$ has the small boundary property. An analogous permanence property is obtained for almost finiteness in the case of free minimal actions.</description>

      <title>Some contributions to Lagrangian modelling of Power Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian modelling can be used to derive mathematical models for complex power electronic converters. This approach uses scalar quantities (kinetic and potential energy) to derive models, which is simpler than using (vector-based) force balance equations. It employs generalized coordinates, making it easier to deal with complex systems with constraints. This systematic approach results in equations that can be expressed in state-space form, which allows for the simplification of the simulation and design process and the use of many standard software packages for system analysis and simulation. In this work, contributions are made regarding the procedure to be followed for the Lagrangian modelling of power converters and the incorporation of constraints within the Lagrangian framework. Furthermore, for the first time, Lagrangian modelling is extended to non-ideal, high-fidelity descriptions of standard power electronic circuits.</description>

      <title>Balance with Memory in Signed Networks via Mittag-Leffler Matrix Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural balance is an important characteristic of graphs/networks where edges can be positive or negative, with direct impact on the study of real-world complex systems. When a network is not structurally balanced, it is important to know how much balance still exists in it. Although several measures have been proposed to characterize the degree of balance, the use of matrix functions of the signed adjacency matrix emerges as a very promising area of research. Here, we take a step forward to using Mittag-Leffler (ML) matrix functions to quantify the notion of balance of signed networks. We show that the ML balance index can be obtained from first principles on the basis of a nonconservative diffusion dynamic, and that it accounts for the memory of the system about the past, by diminishing the penalization that long cycles typically receive in other matrix functions. Finally, we demonstrate the important information in the ML balance index with both artificial signed networks and real-world networks in various contexts, ranging from biological and ecological to social ones.</description>

      <title>Boundary dynamics in unbounded Fatou components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of a transcendental entire map $ f\colon \mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C} $ on an unbounded invariant Fatou component $ U $, assuming that infinity is accessible from $ U $. It is well-known that $ U $ is simply connected. Hence, by means of a Riemann map $ \varphi\colon\mathbb{D}\to U $ and the associated inner function, the boundary of $ U $ is described topologically in terms of the disjoint union of clusters sets, each of them consisting of one or two connected components in $ \mathbb{C} $.
  Moreover, under more precise assumptions on the distribution of singular values, it is proven that periodic and escaping boundary points are dense in $ \partial U $, being all periodic boundary points accessible from $ U $. Finally, under the same conditions, the set of singularities of $ g $ is shown to have zero Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <title>Elementary fractal geometry. 4. Automata-generated topological spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite automata were used to determine multiple addresses in number systems and to find topological properties of self-affine tiles and finite type fractals. We join these two lines of research by axiomatically defining automata which generate topological spaces. Simple examples show the potential of the concept. Spaces generated by automata are topologically self-similar. Two basic algorithms are outlined. The first one determines automata for all $k$-tuples of equivalent addresses from the automaton for double addresses. The second one constructs finite topological spaces which approximate the generated space. Finally, we discuss the realization of automata-generated spaces as self-similar sets.</description>

      <title>The Problem Of Image Super-Resolution, Denoising And Some Image Restoration Methods In Deep Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we address the challenges of image super-resolution and noise reduction, which are crucial for enhancing the quality of images derived from low-resolution or noisy data. We compared and assessed several approaches for upgrading low-resolution images to higher resolutions and for eliminating unwanted noise, all while maintaining the essential characteristics of the original images and recovering images from poor quality or damaged data using deep learning models. Our analysis and the experimental outcomes on image quality metrics indicate that the EDCNN neural network model, enhanced with pretrained weights, significantly outperforms other methods with a Train PSNR of 31.215, a Valid PSNR of 29.493, and a Test PSNR of 31.6632.</description>
