      <title>Reconfigurable Superdirective and Superabsorptive Aperiodic Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general theory of aperiodic subwavelength arrays for controlling electromagnetic waves. The considered platform is formed by an array of electrically small loaded scatterers above a ground plane. While the array is geometrically periodic, all the loads can be in general different, so that the distributions of currents induced by plane waves are not periodic. To allow analytical solutions, we study arrays of thin wires or strips loaded by bulk loads. We demonstrate a practical way of creating tunable and reconfigurable multifunctional devices, on examples of superdirective beam splitters, focusing lenses establishing subdiffraction focusing, and absorbers going beyond perfect absorption. Contrary to the constraints imposed by the Floquet theorem in periodic counterparts like periodic metasurfaces or metagratings, where a fixed angle of incidence and period dictate the propagating directions of reflected waves, the proposed aperiodic designs allow controlling all propagating modes in any direction, which provides more freedom in manipulating electromagnetic waves. We hope that these results can be useful in multiple applications, such as telecommunications, radar techniques, signal processing, and energy harnessing.</description>

      <title>Flexible Asymmetrically Transparent Conductive Electrode based on Photonic Nanojet Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible transparent electrodes, encompassing the combination of optical transparency and electrical conductivity, empower numerous optoelectronic applications. While the main efforts nowadays concentrate on developing wire meshes and conductive oxides, those technologies are still in a quest to find a balance between price, performance, and versatility. Here we propose a new platform, encompassing the advantages of nanophotonic design and roll-to-roll large-scale lithography fabrication tools, granting an ultimate balance between optical, electrical, and mechanical properties. The design is based on an array of silica microspheres deposited on a patterned thin aluminum film attached to a flexible polymer matrix. Microspheres are designed to squeeze 80% light through nanoscale apertures with the aid of the photonic nanojet effect given the light impinges the structure from the top. The photonic structure blocks the transmission for the backpropagation direction thus granting the device with the high 5-fold level of asymmetry. The patterned layer demonstrates a remarkable 2.8 {\Omega}/sq sheet resistance comparable to that of a continuous metal layer. The high conductivity is shown to be maintained after a repeatable application of strain on the flexible electrode. The technical specifications of the demonstrated transparent electrode establish it as a viable option for integrating into advanced optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, touchscreens, and organic light-emitting diodes to name a few. Its notable capacity to optimize light transmittance while ensuring consistent electrical performance, alongside its mechanical flexibility, makes the demonstrated device an essential component for applications, where such attributes are critically required.</description>

      <title>High-power even- and odd mode emission from linear arrays of resonant-tunneling-diode (RTD) oscillators in the 0.4- to 0.8-THz frequency range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant tunneling diode (RTD) oscillators possess the highest oscillation frequency among all electronic THz emitters. However, the emitted power from RTDs remains limited. Here, we propose linear RTD-oscillator arrays capable of supporting coherent emission from both odd and even coupled modes. Both modes exhibit constructive interference in the far field, enabling high power emission. Experimental demonstrations of coherent emission from 11-RTD-oscillator linear arrays are presented. The odd mode oscillates at approximately 450 GHz, emitting about 0.5 mW, while the even mode oscillates at around 750 GHz, emitting about 1 mW. Moreover, certain RTD-oscillator arrays demonstrate dual-band oscillation under different biases, allowing for controllable switching between two coupled modes. In addition, during bias sweeping in both directions, a notable hysteresis feature is observed in the switching bias for the odd and even modes. Our linear RTD-oscillator array represents a significant step forward in the realization of high-power large RTD-oscillator arrays and enables large-scale applications of RTD devices.</description>

      <title>Waveguide Tailored Radiation Pattern of Nanoparticles for Tunable Multimodal Guided Surface Lattice Resonances in Asymmetric Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface lattice resonances (SLR) in metasurfaces is promising in applications of sub-wavelength devices, with high quality factors (high-Q), large local field enhancement and long-range interaction properties. Tunable peak position and multimodal resonances make SLR further appealing to flexible and multiple light-matter interactions. However, reported multimodal SLRs lack flexible and economic tunability. Moreover, current high-Q SLR requires a homogeneous index of operational environment, which hampered potential applications such as biosensors that are usually operated in aqueous or air environment. Here we report a guided-SLR (gSLR) that is easily accessible in index-discontinuous environment along with multimodal property and active tunability of resonating wavelength, mode number and mode coupling strength. The gSLR is realized via coupling scattered light from metasurfaces units into a slab waveguide, which opens up a light propagating channel in the lattice plane in index-asymmetric environment. Tailoring radiation pattern of each units with guided transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, multimodal resonances of both orthogonal and parallel coupling directions are accomplished. Mode number and mode frequency positions can be easily adjusted by waveguide configuration, while mode strength is tuned by vertical position in the slab. The easy-to-access, actively tunable and multimodal gSLR in inhomogeneous medium will promote the realization of ultrathin and ultracompact nano-optical and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering Rydberg sub-THz frequency comb spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering a Terahertz (THz) frequency comb spectroscopy at atomic level advances the precisely measurement in spectroscopy and sensing. Current progresses on THz frequency comb rely on difference-frequency generation, optical parametric oscillation, and other methods. Generating a THz frequency comb poses challenges in source stability and achieving a narrow bandwidth, which traditional THz devices are difficult to achieve. Furthermore, accurately measuring the generated THz frequency comb necessitates a high-performance THz detector. Rydberg atoms are well-suited for electric field sensing due to their ultra-wide radio frequency transition energy levels, making them especially sensitive to external electric fields in the DC to THz bandwidth. However, there have been no reports about generating THz frequency comb spectroscopy at the atomic level until now. This work presents a THz frequency comb spectroscopy with Rydberg atoms, in which a Floquet comb-like transition is engineered through a time-periodic drive field. Our approach simplifies the setup required for THz frequency comb spectroscopy while extending the working bandwidth for Rydberg atomic sensors. The THz frequency comb spectroscopy at the atomic level reported in this article shows great potential for various applications in astronomy, remote sensing, spectral detection of biological samples, and other related fields.</description>

      <title>Seashell-inspired polarization-sensitive tonotopic metasensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bioinspiration has widely been demonstrated to be a powerful approach for the design of innovative structures and devices. Recently, this concept has been extended to the field of elasticity, dynamics, and metamaterials. In this paper, we propose a seashell-inspired metasensor that can simultaneously perform spatial frequency mapping and act as a polarizer. The structure emerges from a universal parametric design that encompasses diverse spiral geometries with varying circular cross sections and curvature radii, all leading to tonotopic behavior. Adoption of an optimization process leads to a planar geometry that enables us to simultaneously achieve tonotopy for orthogonally polarized modes, leading to the possibility to control polarization as well as the spatial distribution of frequency maxima along the spiral axis. We demonstrate the versatility of the device and discuss the possible applications in the field of acoustics and sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunable nonlinearity facilitates the creation of reconfigurable nonlinear metasurfaces, enabling innovative applications in signal processing, light switching, and sensing. This paper presents a novel approach to electrically modulate SHG from a lithium niobate (LN) metasurface, exploiting the electro-optical (EO) effect. By fabricating a nanohole array metasurface on a thin LN film and applying an electric field, we demonstrate the alteration of the material's refractive index, resulting in resonance shifts and modulation of SHG intensity at specific wavelengths. Our findings provide valuable insights for the development of electrically tunable nonlinear light sources, quantum optics, dynamic nonlinear holography, and nonlinear information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement in metals (HE) is a serious challenge for the use of high strength materials in engineering practice and a major barrier to the use of hydrogen for global decarbonization. Here we describe the factors and variables that determine HE susceptibility and provide an overview of the latest understanding of HE mechanisms. We discuss hydrogen uptake and how it can be managed. We summarize hydrogen trapping and the techniques used for its characterization. We also review literature that argues that hydrogen trapping can be used to decrease HE susceptibility. We discuss the future research that is required to advance the understanding of HE and hydrogen trapping and to develop HE-resistant alloys.</description>

      <title>Terahertz imaging super-resolution for documental heritage diagnostics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz imaging provides valuable insights into the composition and structure of objects or materials, with applications spanning security screening, medical imaging, materials science, and cultural heritage preservation. Despite its widespread utility, traditional terahertz imaging is limited in spatial resolution to approximately 1 mm according to Abbe's formula. In this paper, we propose a novel super-resolution method for terahertz time-domain spectroscopy systems. Our approach involves spatial filtering through scattering in the far-field of high spatial frequency components of the imaged sample. This method leverages evanescent wave filtering using a knife edge, akin to a standard structured illumination scheme. We demonstrate improved spatial resolution in slit diffraction, edge imaging, and reflection imaging of structures fabricated on a paper substrate using commonly encountered materials in works of art and documents. Furthermore, we present super-resolved images of an ancient document on parchment, showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Modeling of antenna-coupled Si MOSFETs in the Terahertz Frequency Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the modeling and experimental characterization of Si CMOS detectors of terahertz radiation based on antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs). The detectors are manufactured using TSMC's 65-nm technology. We apply two models -- the TSMC RF foundry model and our own ADS-HDM -- to simulate the Si CMOS TeraFET performance and compare their predictions with respective experimental data. Both models are implemented in the commercial circuit simulation software Keysight Advanced Design System (ADS). We find that the compact model TSMC RF is capable to predict the detector responsivity and its dependence on frequency and gate voltage with good accuracy up to the highest frequency of 1.2 THz covered in this study. This frequency is well beyond the tool's intended operation range for 5G communications and 110-GHz millimeter wave applications. We demonstrate that our self-developed physics-based ADS-HDM tool, which relies on an extended one-dimensional hydrodynamic transport model and can be adapted readily to other material technologies, has high predictive qualities comparable to those of the foundry model. We use the ADS-HDM to discuss the contribution of diffusive and plasmonic effects to the THz response of Si CMOS TeraFETs, finding that these effects, while becoming more significant with rising frequency, are never dominant. Finally, we estimate that the electrical NEP (perfect power coupling conditions) is on the order of 5 pW/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ at room-temperature.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport in thermoelectric materials of SnSSe and SnS$_2$: a non-equilibrium Monte-Carlo simulation of Boltzmann transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, thermal transport and energy conversation in two thermoelectrically efficient candidates of Janus SnSSe and SnS$_2$ are investigated within the non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulation of phonon Boltzmann equation. The phonon analysis is performed to determine the contributed phonons in heat transport. The results present that the dominant participating phonons are longitudinal acoustic ones while the least belongs to the transverse acoustic (TA) mode. Both materials reached the very high maximum temperature in response to the implied wasted heat. This is attributed to the low presence of the critical TA phonons. Also, the temperature profile achieved during the heating and cooling of the materials is studied. It is obtained that the heat propagation through the SnS$_2$ is, at first, swifter, which results in a temperature gradient through the whole material which is less than that of the SnSSe. As the time passes, the heat transfer that is directly related to the material thermal conductivity, slows down. So, the behavior of the SnS$_2$ and SnSSe, in case of the heat propagation status, becomes similar. More, the behavior of the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT), the efficiency ($\eta$), and the generated voltage have been figured out. It is stated that the higher zT and $\eta$ do not guarantee a larger generated Seebeck voltage. This is true, while the generated Seebeck voltage is related to the temperature difference between the heated and the cold junction. Accordingly, how far the temperature of matter rises in response to the implied wasted heat is related to the obtained voltage. Mainly, it is presented that the maximum temperature that a material achieves, alongside the temperature gradient and material property Seebeck coefficient, are essential in introducing thermoelectrically efficient materials with reasonable thermal to electrical energy conversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electro-optics serves as the crucial bridge between electronics and photonics, unlocking a wide array of applications ranging from communications and computing to sensing and quantum information. Integrated electro-optics approaches in particular enable essential electronic high-speed control for photonics while offering substantial photonic parallelism for electronics. Recent strides in thin-film lithium niobate photonics have ushered revolutionary advancements in electro-optics. This technology not only offers the requisite strong electro-optic coupling but also boasts ultra-low optical loss and high microwave bandwidth. Further, its tight confinement and compatibility with nanofabrication allow for unprecedented reconfigurability and scalability, facilitating the creation of novel and intricate devices and systems that were once deemed nearly impossible in bulk systems. Building upon this platform, the field has witnessed the emergence of various groundbreaking electro-optic devices surpassing the current state of the art, and introducing functionalities that were previously non-existent. This technological leap forward provides a unique framework to explore various realms of physics as well, including photonic non-Hermitian synthetic dimensions, active topological physics, and quantum electro-optics. In this review, we present the fundamental principles of electro-optics, drawing connections between fundamental science and the forefront of technology. We discuss the accomplishments and future prospects of integrated electro-optics, enabled by thin-film lithium niobate platform.</description>
