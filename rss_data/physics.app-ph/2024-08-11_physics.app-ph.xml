      <title>A new class of higher-order topological insulators that localize energy at arbitrary multiple sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\mathbb{Z}$-classified topological phases lead to larger-than-unity topological states. However, these multiple topological states are only localized at the corners in nonlocal systems. Here, first, we rigorously prove that the multiple topological states of nonlocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains can be inherited and realized by local aperiodic chains with only the nearest couplings. Then, we report a new class of higher-order topological insulators constructed with the local aperiodic chains, which can have any integer number of 0D topological states localized at arbitrary positions in the whole domain of the insulators, including within the bulk. The 0D topological states are protected by the local topological marker in each direction, instead of the bulk multipole chiral numbers in the existing work. Our work provides multiple combinations of localized corner-bulk topological states, which enables programmable lasers and sasers by selecting the excitation sites without altering the structure, and thus opens a new avenue to signal enhancement for computing and sensing.</description>

      <title>Photonic biosensing via Su-Schrieffer-Heeger boundary modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a conceptual device for multiplexed biosensor in a photonic crystal chip based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger mechanism. Remarkably, the proposed biosensor can identify three distinct disease markers through a single-shot photon transmission measurement, due to the couplings among the three Su-Schrieffer-Heeger boundary modes in the photonic crystal. Our biosensor design is more robust against defects and disorders inevitable in real-life device applications than previous designs. Such robustness is invaluable for achieving efficient, reliable, and integrated biosensing based on nanophotonic systems. We further demonstrate that various combinations of disease markers can be recognized via the photon transmission spectrum, unveiling a promising route toward high performance advanced biosensing for future biomedical technology.</description>

      <title>Topologically integrated photonic biosensor circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated nanophotonic biosensors offer a promising route toward future biomedical detection applications that may enable inexpensive, portable, and sensitive diagnosis of diseases with a small amount of biological samples for convenient early-stage screening of fatal diseases. However, the current photonic biosensor designs are not suitable for highly integrated and multiplexing device architectures that can achieve the detection of complex combinations of many biomarkers. Here, we propose a topological scheme for the integration of miniature biosensors in photonic crystal chips that can meet the above requirement. Using photonic topological edge states as robust one-dimensional waveguides that connect many photonic biosensors, we propose here the topologically integrated photonic biosensor circuits. We demonstrate that the performance of the topologically integrated photonic biosensors is much more robust against disorders than that of the photonic biosensors connected by the normal photonic waveguides, due to the robust transport of photons along the edge channel. Since disorders arising from the fabrication imperfection and the random distribution of the biomarkers are inevitable in genuine devices, resilience against disorders is a necessity for on-chip integration of biosensors. The topological scheme proposed here thus opens a promising path toward reliable integration of photonic biosensors for next-generation biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Hidden photoexcitations probed by multi-pulse photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved photoluminescence is a validated method for tracking the photoexcited carrier dynamics in luminescent materials. This technique probes the photoluminescence decays upon a periodic excitation by short laser pulses. Herein, we demonstrate that this approach cannot directly detect hidden photoexcitations with much slower dynamics than the photoluminescence decay. We demonstrate a new method based on a multi-pulse excitation scheme that enables an unambiguous detection and an easily interpreted tracking of these hidden species. The multi-pulse excitation consists of a single pulse (Read) followed by a burst of many closely separated pulses (Write) and finally another single pulse (Read). To illustrate the efficacy of the Read-Write-Read excitation scheme, we apply it to metal halide perovskites to directly visualize carrier trapping, extract the concentration of trapped charges and determine the rate constant of trap depopulation. The developed approach allows studying performance-limiting processes in energy devices using a versatile, highly applicable all-optical method.</description>

      <title>Dynamic X-ray coherent diffraction analysis: bridging the timescales between imaging and photon correlation spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of diffraction limited sources and developments in detector technology opens up new possibilities for the study of materials in situ and operando. Coherent X-ray diffraction techniques such as coherent X-ray diffractive imaging (CXDI) and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) are capable for this purpose and provide complimentary information, although due to signal-to-noise requirements, their simultaneous demonstration has been limited. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for the simultaneous use of CXDI and XPCS to study in situ the Brownian motion of colloidal gold nanoparticles of 200 nm diameter suspended in a glycerol-water mixture. We visualise the process of agglomeration, examine the spatiotemporal space accessible with the combination of techniques, and demonstrate CXDI with 22 ms temporal resolution.</description>

      <title>Infrared Beam-shaping on Demand via Tailored Geometric Phase Metasurfaces employing the Plasmonic Phase-Change Material In3SbTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional optical elements are bulky and limited to specific functionalities, contradicting the increasing demand of miniaturization and multi-functionalities. Optical metasurfaces enable tailoring light-matter interaction at will, especially important for the infrared spectral range which lacks commercially available beam-shaping elements. While the fabrication of those metasurfaces usually requires cumbersome techniques, direct laser writing promises a simple and convenient alternative. Here, we exploit the non-volatile laser-induced insulator-to-metal transition of the plasmonic phase-change material In3SbTe2 (IST) for optical programming of large-area metasurfaces for infrared beam-shaping. We tailor the geometric phase of metasurfaces with rotated crystalline IST rod antennas to achieve beam steering, lensing, and beams carrying orbital angular momenta. Finally, we investigate multi-functional and cascaded metasurfaces exploiting enlarged holography, and design a single metasurface creating two different holograms along the optical axis. Our approach facilitates fabrication of large-area metasurfaces within hours, enabling rapid-prototyping of customized infrared meta-optics for sensing, imaging and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Lithography-free patterning of chalcogenide materials for integrated photonic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chalcogenide material-based integrated photonic devices have garnered widespread attention due to their unique wideband transparency. Despite their recognized CMOS compatibility, the fabrication of these devices relies predominantly on lithography techniques. However, chalcogenide thin films are highly susceptible to oxidation, necessitating customized process flows and complex protective measures during lithography. These requirements are hardly compatible with current commercial CMOS manufacturing platforms designed for silicon photonics, significantly limiting the practical applications of chalcogenide photonic devices. In this work, we ingeniously exploit the ease of oxidation of chalcogenide materials, presenting a novel laser-induced localized oxidation technique for spatial patterning on chalcogenide thin films, enabling concise lithography-free fabrication of chalcogenide integrated photonic devices. Using Sb2S3 as an example, we experimentally demonstrate localized multi-level oxidation with a sizable overall refractive index contrast of 0.7 at near-infrared, featuring a high spatial resolution of 0.6 um. Based on this technique, multiple integrated photonic devices are demonstrated, showing versatile functionalities, including color printing at visible and metasurface-based spatial light modulation at near-infrared regions. Leveraging the inherent phase-change property of Sb2S3, an active Fresnel zone plate, enabling switchable beam focusing, is further demonstrated, indicating the feasibility of concise fabrication of active photonic devices. Our work offers a brand-new modulation dimension for chalcogenide materials and provides a significantly simplified approach for realizing chalcogenide-integrated photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Robust field-free switching using large unconventional spin-orbit torque in an all-van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emerging all-van der Waals (vdW) magnetic heterostructure provides a new platform to control the magnetization by the electric field beyond the traditional spintronics devices. One promising strategy is using unconventional spin-orbit torque (SOT) exerted by the out-of-plane polarized spin current to enable deterministic magnetization switching and enhance the switching efficiency. However, in all-vdW heterostructures, large unconventional SOT remains elusive and the robustness of the field-free switching against external magnetic field hasn't been examined, which hinder further applications. Here we demonstrate the field-free switching in an all-vdW heterostructure combining a type-II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 and above-room-temperature ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. The fully field-free switching can be achieved at 2.56 x 10^10 A per m2 at 300K and a large SOT effective field efficiency of the out-of-plane polarized spin current generated by TaIrTe4 is determined to be 0.37. Moreover, we find that the switching polarity cannot be changed until the external in-plane magnetic field reaches 252mT, indicating a robust switching against the magnetic field. The numerical simulation suggests the large unconventional SOT reduces the switching current density and enhances the robustness of the switching. Our work shows that all-vdW heterostructures are promising candidates for future highly efficient and stable SOT-based devices.</description>

      <title>Flame Transfer Function Measurement of a Hydrogen-Blended Sequential Combustor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flame transfer function (FTF) relates acoustic perturbations and the coherent heat release rate response. This frequency-dependent function governs the thermoacoustic stability of a combustor. The FTF measurement is therefore of great interest for predicting the stability of the a practical combustor connected to the engine's compressor and turbine. In this study, the flame transfer function of the sequential flame of an atmospheric constant pressure sequential combustor (CPSC) is experimentally measured. The thermal power of both the first- and second-stage flames is kept constant and their ratio is fixed at 1:1. The effects of hydrogen blending in the first and second stage fuel mixture on the sequential FTF are analyzed. The FTF of the sequential flame is fitted with a distributed time delay (DTD) model with two pulses. The trends of the model parameters obtained are consistent with the chemiluminescence OH* of the sequential flame.</description>
