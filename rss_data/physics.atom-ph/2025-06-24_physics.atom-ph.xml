      <title>Optical excitation and stabilization of ultracold field-linked tetratomic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a coherent optical population transfer of weakly bound field-linked tetratomic molecules (FL tetramers) to deeper bound states using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). We consider static-electric-field shielded polar alkali-metal diatomic molecules and corresponding FL tetramers in their $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+ + \textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$ ground electronic state. We show that the excited metastable $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+ + \textrm{b}^3\Pi$ electronic manifold supports FL tetramers in a broader range of electric fields with collisional shielding extended to zero field. We calculate the Franck-Condon factors between the ground and excited FL tetramers and show that they are highly tunable with the electric field. We also predict photoassociation (PA) of ground-state shielded molecules to the excited FL states in free-bound optical transitions. We propose proof-of-principle experiments to implement STIRAP and PA using FL tetramers, paving the way for the formation of deeply bound ultracold polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>A Liquid-Nitrogen-Cooled Ca+ Ion Optical Clock with a Systematic Uncertainty of 4.6E-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a single-ion optical clock based on the 4S_1/2-3D_5/2 transition of the 40Ca+ ion, operated in a liquid nitrogen cryogenic environment,achieving a total systematic uncertainty of 4.6E-19. We employ a refined temperature evaluation scheme to reduce the frequency uncertainty due to blackbody radiation (BBR), and the 3D sideband cooling has been implemented to minimize the second-order Doppler shift. We have precisely determined the average Zeeman coefficient of the 40Ca+ clock transition to be 14.345(40) Hz/mT^2, thereby significantly reducing the quadratic Zeeman shift uncertainty. Moreover, the cryogenic environment enables the lowest reported heating rate due to ambient electric field noise in trapped-ion optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Attosecond tunneling time measurements through momentum squeezing in strong field ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunneling of a particle through a potential barrier is a fundamental physical process and a major thought-provoking outcome of quantum physics. It is at the basis of multiple scientific and technological advances and strongly influences both the structuring and the dynamics of matter at the microscopic scale. Without a classical counterpart, it defies our intuitive perception and understanding of the motion of a particle. Thus, the temporal characterization of tunneling, typically in terms of the time spent "under the barrier", referred to as tunneling time, raises several debates and questions on its interpretation and measurability. Here we show that an electron wavepacket tunneling out of an atom through the potential barrier induced by a strong electric field, carries in its momentum profile the value of the corresponding tunneling time, in a self-probing manner. In a revisited interpretation of the attoclock setup, we view a circularly polarized light pulse as a temporal prism which maps the barrier configuration, and hence the tunneling dynamics, onto different photoelectron ejection directions. From our simulations, we find that tunneling times in the infrared regime are of the order of hundreds of attoseconds, in agreement with previous theories.</description>

      <title>Two-photon ionization of the K-shell of ions of the isonuclear sequence of a heavy atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape and absolute values of the generalized cross-sections of the two-photon resonant single ionization of the K-shell of ions of the isonuclear sequence of a heavy nickel atom (28Ni - Ni26+ - Ni24+ - Ni18+) have been theoretically predicted. The complete wave functions of ionization states have been obtained in the single-configuration Hartree-Fock approximation. The effects of the occurrence of giant resonances in the subthreshold region of the generalized ionization cross-section and destructive quantum interference of the amplitudes of the probability of radiation transitions have been established. The leading role of the d-symmetry of the final state of ionization in determining the total generalized crosssection in the energy region of absorbed photons in the hard X-ray range has also been established.</description>

      <title>Normal modes and shockwaves in cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods are developed to simulate the dynamics of atoms in a Magneto-Optic Trap (MOT), based on the fluid description of ultracold gases under laser cooling and magnetic trapping forces. With this model, equilibrium hydrostatic profiles and normal modes are calculated, and numerical results are validated against theoretical predictions. As a test case, shock wave formation due to rapid gas expansion and contraction of the ultracold gas is simulated. The latter is caused by a sudden change of the value of its effective collective charge. Limitations of the current methods and future improvements are discussed. This work provides a foundation for studying numerically complex MOT behaviors and their use as analog simulators for astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Spin Polarization Control via Magnetic Field in Dissipative Bosonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering spin polarization in dissipative bosonic systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, especially for applications in quantum metrology and space-based quantum simulations. This work demonstrates precise magnetic moment control in multicomponent Bose gases during evaporative cooling via tailored magnetic fields. By adjusting the magnetic field gradients, null point position, and duration, we selectively tune evaporation rates of magnetic sublevels, achieving targeted spin polarization. Theoretical models, validated by numerical simulations and Stern-Gerlach experiments, reveal how magnetic fields reshape trapping potentials and spin-dependent dissipation. The results establish a dissipative spin-selection mechanism governing polarization evolution in evaporatively cooled Bose gases and provide a framework for engineering spin-polarized quantum states.</description>

      <title>A new beamline for Resonant Excitation of Beams with Electromagnetic fields and Lasers (REBEL) and Stopping and Trapping of Radioactive Isotopes for Precision Experiments (STRIPE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two newly constructed experimental setups - REBEL (Resonant Excitation of Beams with Electromagnetic fields and Lasers) and STRIPE (Stopping and Trapping of Radioactive Isotopes for Precision Experiments) - integrated into a single offline beamline at KU Leuven. REBEL is designed for collinear laser spectroscopy of ion bunches following isobaric separation with a multireflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer, enabling high-sensitivity measurements of mass-selected fast-ion beams. In contrast, STRIPE focuses on the deceleration, trapping, and laser cooling of ions in a segmented linear Paul trap, optimized for long interrogation times and precision spectroscopy. The shared infrastructure features stable high-voltage operation ($&lt;10$ ppm), modular vacuum sections, and a fast-beam switchyard to route ions to either experiment. Initial results include a mass-resolving power of $R \approx 12900$ in REBEL and successful ion trapping and laser cooling of ions with a kinetic energy of 10 keV in STRIPE, with improved performance achieved using a frequency-modulated cooling laser. This dual-system platform enables the development and benchmarking of advanced spectroscopy and trapping techniques and is compatible with future operation at radioactive ion beam facilities.</description>

      <title>Second-order hyperfine structure and its impact on new physics searches using isotope shift spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent precision isotope shift spectroscopy experiments have reported King plot non-linearities that may uncover previously hidden nuclear properties or hint at new force-carrying bosons. Interpreting the data requires many isotope pairs, but sufficient stable spin-zero nuclei are not always available. In this paper we consider the use of isotopes with non-zero nuclear spin for these studies. We confirm that observed King plot non-linearity in strontium is explained by second-order hyperfine shift in the fermionic nucleus, and we discuss the limitations of using Yb isotopes with non-zero spin in King plot studies. By introducing a specific difference of two isotopes with nuclear spin, we allow for a promising addition to future experimental schemes.</description>

      <title>Global Variational Quantum Circuits for Arbitrary Symmetric State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum states that are symmetric under particle exchange play a crucial role in fields such as quantum metrology and quantum error correction. We use a variational circuit composed of global one-axis twisting and global rotations to efficiently prepare arbitrary symmetric states, i.e. any superposition of Dicke states. The circuit does not require local addressability or ancilla qubits and thus can be readily implemented in a variety of experimental platforms including trapped-ion quantum simulators and cavity QED systems. We provide analytic and numerical evidence that any $N$-qubit symmetric state can be prepared in $2N/3$ steps. We demonstrate the utility of our protocol by preparing (i) metrologically useful $N$-qubit Dicke states of up to $N = 300$ qubits in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ gate steps with theoretical infidelities $1-\mathcal{F} &lt; 10^{-3}$, (ii) the $N = 9$ Ruskai codewords in $P = 4$ gate steps with $1-\mathcal{F} &lt; 10^{-4}$, and (iii) the $N = 13$ Gross codewords in $P = 7$ gate steps with $1-\mathcal{F} &lt; 10^{-4}$. Focusing on trapped-ion platforms, for the $N = 9$ Ruskai and $N = 13$ Gross codewords we estimate that the protocol achieves fidelities $\gtrsim 95\%$ in the presence of typical experimental noise levels, thus providing a pathway to the preparation of a wide range of useful highly-entangled quantum states.</description>

      <title>On the non-Markovian quantum control dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study both open-loop control and closed-loop measurement feedback control of non-Markovian quantum dynamics resulting from the interaction between a quantum system and its environment. We use the widely studied cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system as an example, where an atom interacts with the environment composed of a collection of oscillators. In this scenario, the stochastic interactions between the atom and the environment can introduce non-Markovian characteristics into the evolution of quantum states, differing from the conventional Markovian dynamics observed in open quantum systems. As a result, the atom's decay rate to the environment varies with time and can be described by nonlinear equations. The solutions to these nonlinear equations can be analyzed in terms of the stability of a nonlinear control system. Consequently, the evolution of quantum state amplitudes follows linear time-varying equations as a result of the non-Markovian quantum transient process. Additionally, by using measurement feedback through homodyne detection of the cavity output, we can modulate the steady atomic and photonic states in the non-Markovian process. When multiple coupled cavity-QED systems are involved, measurement-based feedback control can influence the dynamics of high-dimensional quantum states, as well as the resulting stable and unstable subspaces.</description>

      <title>Enhanced nuclear Schiff and electric dipole moments in nuclei with an octupole deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deformed nuclei exhibit enhanced moments that violate time-reversal invariance ($T$) and parity ($P$). This paper focuses on the enhanced nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM) and Schiff moment present in nuclei with octupole deformation (pear-shaped nuclei). These moments, which are proportional to the octupole deformation, have a collective nature and are large in the intrinsic frame that rotates with the nucleus. However, in a state with definite angular momentum and parity, $T$ and $P$ conservation forbid their expectation values in the laboratory frame, as nuclear rotation causes them to vanish. In nuclei with octupole deformation, close opposite-parity rotational states with identical spin are mixed by $T$,$P$-violating nuclear forces. This mixing polarises the nuclear axis along the nuclear spin, allowing moments from the intrinsic frame to manifest in the laboratory frame, provided the nuclear spin $I$ is sufficiently large. Using half-life data for $E1$ transitions from the NuDat database, we calculate the intrinsic nuclear EDM $d_{\text{int}}$ for a range of nuclei theorised to exhibit octupole deformation. From these values, we independently estimate the intrinsic nuclear Schiff moment $S_{\text{int}}$ and the octupole deformation parameter $\beta_{3}$. Finally, we compare the magnitude of these collective moments in the laboratory frame with the contributions from valence nucleons, providing an estimate of the nuclear EDM and Schiff moment components unrelated to octupole deformation. The uncertainty of our estimates may exceed a factor of 10.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we employ the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm with a multireference unitary coupled cluster ansatz to report the ground state energy of the BeH2 molecule in a geometry where strong correlation effects are significant. We consider the two most important determinants in the construction of the reference state for our ansatz. We remove redundancies in order to execute a redundancy-free calculation. In view of the currently available noisy quantum hardware, we carry out parameter optimization on a classical computer and measure the energy with optimized parameters on a quantum computer. Furthermore, in order to carry out our intended 12-qubit computation with error mitigation and post-selection on a noisy intermediate scale quantum era trapped ion hardware (the commercially available IonQ Forte-I), we perform a series of resource reduction techniques to a. decrease the number of two-qubit gates by 99.84% (from 12243 to 20 two-qubit gates) relative to the unoptimized circuit, and b. reduce the number of measurements via the idea of supercliques, while losing 2.69% in the obtained ground state energy relative to that computed classically for the same resource-optimized problem setting.</description>

      <title>Multimode Bosonic State Tomography with Single-Shot Joint Parity Measurement of a Trapped Ion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The full characterization of a continuous-variable quantum system is a challenging problem. For the trapped-ion system, a number of methods of reconstructing the quantum states have been developed, including the measurement of the Q quasi-probability function and the density matrix elements in the Fock basis, but these approaches are often slow and difficult to scale to multi-mode states. Here, we demonstrate a novel and powerful scheme for reconstructing a continuous-variable quantum state that uses the direct single-shot measurement of the joint parity of the phonon states of a trapped ion. We drive a spin-dependent bichromatic beam-splitter interaction that coherently exchanges phonons between different harmonic oscillator modes of the ion. This interaction encodes the joint parity information into the relative phase between the two spin states, enabling measurement of the combined phonon-number parity across multiple modes in a single shot. Leveraging this capability, we directly measure multi-mode Wigner quasi-probability distributions to perform quantum state tomography of an entangled coherent state, and show that the generated state is non-positive under partial transpose, confirming its entanglement. We further show that the single-shot joint parity measurement can be used to detect parity-flip errors in real time. By post-selecting the parity measurement outcomes, we experimentally demonstrate the extension of the bosonic state lifetime, effectively implementing an error mitigation technique. Lastly, we identify the various sources of error affecting the fidelity of the spin-dependent beam-splitter operation and study the feasibility of high fidelity operations. The interaction studied in this work can be easily extended to more than two modes, and is highly relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing and quantum metrology.</description>
