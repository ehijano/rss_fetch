      <title>Linear fractional relative risk aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the family of utility functions satisfying linear fractional relative risk aversion (LFRRA) in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric functions. We apply this family, which nests various utility functions used in different strands of literature, to monopolistic competition and obtain a closed-form solution for the profit-maximizing price by generalizing the Lambert W function. We let firm-level data decide whether the RRA in each sector or in the aggregate economy is increasing, decreasing, or constant, which in turn determines whether markups are decreasing, increasing, or constant with respect to marginal costs.</description>

      <title>Robo-Advisors Beyond Automation: Principles and Roadmap for AI-Driven Financial Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming financial planning by expanding access, lowering costs, and enabling dynamic, data-driven advice. Yet without clear safeguards, digital platforms risk reproducing longstanding market inefficiencies such as information asymmetry, misaligned incentives, and systemic fragility. This paper develops a framework for responsible AI in financial planning, anchored in five principles: fiduciary duty, adaptive personalization, technical robustness, ethical and fairness constraints, and auditability. We illustrate these risks and opportunities through case studies, and extend the framework into a five-level roadmap of AI financial intermediaries. By linking technological design to economic theory, we show how AI can either amplify vulnerabilities or create more resilient, trustworthy forms of financial intermediation.</description>

      <title>Price Formation in a Highly-Renewable, Sector-Coupled Energy System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As variable renewable energy increases and more demand is electrified, we expect price formation in wholesale electricity markets to transition from being dominated by fossil fuel generators to being dominated by the opportunity costs of storage and demand management. In order to analyse this transition, we introduce a new method to investigate price formation based on a mapping from the dual variables of the energy system optimisation problem to the bids and asks of electricity suppliers and consumers. This allows us to build the full supply and demand curves in each hour. We use this method to analyse price formation in a sector-coupled, climate-neutral energy system model for Germany, PyPSA-DE, with high temporal resolution and myopic foresight in 5-year steps from 2020 until full decarbonisation in 2045. We find a clear transition from distinct price levels, corresponding to fossil fuels, to a smoother price curve set by variable renewable energy sources, batteries and electrolysis. Despite higher price volatility, the fully decarbonised system clears with non-zero prices in 75% of all hours. Our results suggest that flexibility and cross-sectoral demand bidding play a vital role in stabilising electricity prices in a climate-neutral future. These findings are highly relevant for guiding investment decisions and informing policy, particularly in support of dynamic pricing, the expansion of energy storage across multiple timescales, and the coordinated development of renewable and flexibility technologies.</description>

      <title>The anatomy of Green AI technologies: structure, evolution, and impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a key enabler of innovation against climate change. In this study, we investigate the intersection of AI and climate adaptation and mitigation technologies through patent analyses of a novel dataset of approximately 63 000 Green AI patents. We analyze patenting trends, corporate ownership of the technology, the geographical distributions of patents, their impact on follow-on inventions and their market value. We use topic modeling (BERTopic) to identify 16 major technological domains, track their evolution over time, and identify their relative impact. We uncover a clear shift from legacy domains such as combustion engines technology to emerging areas like data processing, microgrids, and agricultural water management. We find evidence of growing concentration in corporate patenting against a rapidly increasing number of patenting firms. Looking at the technological and economic impact of patents, while some Green AI domains combine technological impact and market value, others reflect weaker private incentives for innovation, despite their relevance for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. This is where policy intervention might be required to foster the generation and use of new Green AI applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Economic Feasibility of Labor Replacement Through Robotics and Automation in Qatar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the economic feasibility of replacing human labor with robotics and automation in Qatar's manufacturing and service sectors. By analyzing labor costs, productivity gains, and implementation expenses, the study assesses the potential financial impact and return on investment of robotic integration. Results indicate the sectors where automation is economically viable and identify challenges related to workforce adaptation, policy, and infrastructure. These insights provide guidance for policymakers and industry stakeholders considering automation strategies in Qatar.</description>

      <title>The temporary impact of permanent hiring incentives: Evidence from Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the short and medium-term effectiveness of hiring incentives aimed at promoting the permanent conversion of temporary contracts through social contribution exemptions. Using rich administrative data from Tuscany, providing detailed employment histories, we use difference in differences and regression discontinuity designs to exploit a unique change in eligibility criteria in 2018. We find that the incentives immediately increased the probability of conversion, with no evidence of substitution against non-eligible cohorts. However, these positive effects were short-lived and appear to reflect anticipated conversions, as we find null longer-term effects on permanent hirings.</description>

      <title>The Precautionary Principle and the Innovation Principle: Incompatible Guides for AI Innovation Governance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In policy debates concerning the governance and regulation of Artificial Intelligence (AI), both the Precautionary Principle (PP) and the Innovation Principle (IP) are advocated by their respective interest groups. Do these principles offer wholly incompatible and contradictory guidance? Does one necessarily negate the other? I argue here that provided attention is restricted to weak-form PP and IP, the answer to both of these questions is "No." The essence of these weak formulations is the requirement to fully account for type-I error costs arising from erroneously preventing the innovation's diffusion through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory red-lighting) as well as the type-II error costs arising from erroneously allowing the innovation to diffuse through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory green-lighting). Within the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model developed here, weak-PP red-light (weak-IP green-light) determinations are optimal for sufficiently small (large) ratios of expected type-I to type-II error costs. For intermediate expected cost ratios, an amber-light 'wait-and-monitor' policy is optimal. Regulatory sandbox instruments allow AI testing and experimentation to take place within a structured environment of limited duration and societal scale, whereby the expected cost ratio falls within the 'wait-and-monitor' range. Through sandboxing regulators and innovating firms learn more about the expected cost ratio, and what respective adaptations -- of regulation, of technical solution, of business model, or combination thereof, if any -- are needed to keep the ratio out of the weak-PP red-light zone. Nevertheless AI foundation models are ill-suited for regulatory sandboxing as their general-purpose nature precludes credible identification of misclassification costs.</description>

      <title>Web3 x AI Agents: Landscape, Integrations, and Foundational Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence of Web3 technologies and AI agents represents a rapidly evolving frontier poised to reshape decentralized ecosystems. This paper presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics, governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3 governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing (RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust, intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent interactions.</description>
