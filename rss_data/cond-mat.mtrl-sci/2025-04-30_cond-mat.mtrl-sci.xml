      <title>Low Resistance P-type Contacts to Monolayer WSe$_2$ through Chlorinated Solvent Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) is a promising p-type semiconductor limited by high contact resistance ($R_\textrm{C}$) and the lack of a reliable doping strategy. Here, we demonstrate that exposing WSe$_2$ to chloroform provides simple and stable p-type doping. In monolayer WSe$_2$ transistors with Pd contacts, chloroform increases the maximum hole current by over 100$\times$ (&gt;200 $\mu$A/$\mu$m), reduces $R_\textrm{C}$ to ~2.5 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m, and retains an on/off ratio of $10^{10}$ at room temperature. These improvements persist for over 8 months, survive annealing above 150 {\deg}C, and remain effective down to 10 K, enabling a cryogenic $R_\textrm{C}$ of ~1 k$\Omega\cdot\mu$m. Density functional theory indicates that chloroform strongly physisorbs to WSe$_2$, inducing hole doping with minimal impact on the electronic states between the valence band and conduction band edges. Auger electron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy reveal that chloroform intercalates at the WSe$_2$ interface with the gate oxide, contributing to doping stability and mitigating interfacial dielectric disorder. This robust, scalable approach enables high-yield WSe$_2$ transistors with good p-type performance.</description>

      <title>Electrical Side-Gate Control of Anisotropic Magnetoresistance and Magnetic Anisotropy in a Composite Multiferroic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite multiferroics consisting of a ferroelectric material interfaced with a ferromagnetic material can function above room temperature and exhibit improved magnetoelectric (ME) coupling compared to single-phase multiferroic materials, making them desirable for applications in energy efficient electronic devices. In this study, we demonstrate electrical side-gate control of magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in single-crystalline ferromagnetic Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ thin films grown on ferroelectric PMN-PT (001) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ is selected due to its large magnetoelastic coupling and low magnetic damping. We find that the magnetoresistance curves of patterned Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ films are controlled by voltages applied to electrostatic side gates. Angle-dependent magnetoresistance scans reveal that the origin of this effect is strain-mediated variation of the magnetic anisotropy due to piezoelectric effects in the PMN-PT. This electrical control of magnetic properties could serve as a building block for future magnetoelectronic and magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Determining the Nature of Magnetism in Altermagnetic Candidate RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The terminology "altermagnetism" has recently been adopted to describe collinear magnetic order with no net magnetization and non-relativisitic, momentum-dependent spin-splitting. The archetypal material used to theoretically explore altermagnetism is RuO$_2$, but there has been significant debate as to whether RuO$_2$ possesses magnetic, let alone altermagnetic, order. To address questions surrounding the nature of magnetism in RuO$_2$, we combine symmetry-sensitive torque magnetometry and magnetization measurements in single crystals. The data are inconsistent with collinear magnetic order possessing a N\'eel vector along the $c-$axis. Torque magnetometry further demonstrates an isotropic magnetic susceptibility within the $ab-$plane, indicative of neither a N\'eel vector within the $ab-$plane nor a field-induced N\'eel vector reorientation. Magnetic quantum oscillations from both techniques reveal a nearly spherical Fermi surface pocket at the Brillouin zone center, in agreement with paramagnetic electronic structure calculations. Taken together, these data indicate no detectable long-range magnetic order and, by extension, suggest no altermagnetism in high-quality RuO$_2$ single crystals.</description>

      <title>Database and deep-learning scalability of anharmonic phonon properties by automated brute-force first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the anharmonic phonon properties of crystal compounds -- such as phonon lifetimes and thermal conductivities -- is essential for investigating and optimizing their thermal transport behaviors. These properties also impact optical, electronic, and magnetic characteristics through interactions between phonons and other quasiparticles and fields. In this study, we develop an automated first-principles workflow to calculate anharmonic phonon properties and build a comprehensive database encompassing more than 6,000 inorganic compounds. Utilizing this dataset, we train a graph neural network model to predict thermal conductivity values and spectra from structural parameters, demonstrating a scaling law in which prediction accuracy improves with increasing training data size. High-throughput screening with the model enables the identification of materials exhibiting extreme thermal conductivities -- both high and low. The resulting database offers valuable insights into the anharmonic behavior of phonons, thereby accelerating the design and development of advanced functional materials.</description>

      <title>Rate Analysis of Dislocations Overcoming Elastic Barriers: Effects of Entropy and Langevin Friction via Kramers Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal activation of dislocations is critical for predicting the mechanical response of materials under common experimental conditions. According to transition state theory (TST), the rate for the system to overcome free energy barriers depends on an attempt frequency, activation free energy, and temperature. We computed the rate for edge and screw dislocation dipoles to overcome their interaction fields at various temperatures, Langevin friction coefficients, and shear stresses using Molecular Dynamics (MD), Schoeck entropy formalism and compared with Kramers rate theory. Rates computed dynamically show dependence on Langevin friction, increasing with weaker friction and showing more correlated events. Statically, using Schoeck formalism and computing the minimum energy path (MEP), we found significant entropic effects at high temperature and a transition from Arrhenius to non-Arrhenius behavior near the critical resolved shear stress values for both edge and screw characters.</description>

      <title>NEP89: Universal neuroevolution potential for inorganic and organic materials across 89 elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) offer near-first-principles accuracy for atomistic simulations, but many models are material-specific or computationally intensive, limiting their broader use. Here, we introduce NEP89, a foundation model based on the neuroevolution potential (NEP) architecture, delivering empirical-potential-like speed and high accuracy across 89 chemical elements. A compact yet comprehensive training dataset covering inorganic and organic materials across 89 elements was curated through descriptor-space subsampling and an iterative active-learning-like process applied to multiple datasets. We rigorously evaluated NEP89's predictive performance against representative foundation models, demonstrating its reliability and competitive accuracy across diverse benchmark studies. NEP89 is 3-4 orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than comparable models, enabling previously impractical large-scale atomistic simulations for both inorganic and organic systems. It also supports fine-tuning on small datasets, allowing rapid adaptation to user-specific applications. This work marks a significant advancement in MLPs, enabling high-performance atomistic simulations across diverse research fields and communities.</description>

      <title>Towards Space Group Determination from EBSD Patterns: The Role of Deep Learning and High-throughput Dynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of novel materials hinges on the understanding of structure-property relationships. However, our capability to synthesize a large number of materials has outpaced the ability and speed needed to characterize them. While the overall chemical constituents can be readily known during synthesis, the structural evolution and characterization of newly synthesized samples remains a bottleneck for the ultimate goal of high throughput nanomaterials discovery. Thus, scalable methods for crystal symmetry determination that can analyze a large volume of material samples within a short time-frame are especially needed. Kikuchi diffraction in the SEM is a promising technique for this due to its sensitivity to dynamical scattering, which may provide information beyond just the seven crystal systems and fourteen Bravais lattices. After diffraction patterns are collected from material samples, deep learning methods may be able to classify the space group symmetries using the patterns as input, which paired with the elemental composition, would help enable the determination of the crystal structure. To investigate the feasibility of this solution, neural networks were trained to predict the space group type of background corrected EBSD patterns. Our networks were first trained and tested on an artificial dataset of EBSD patterns of 5,148 different cubic phases, created through physics-based dynamical simulations. Next, Maximum Classifier Discrepancy, an unsupervised deep learning-based domain adaptation method, was utilized to train neural networks to make predictions for experimental EBSD patterns. We introduce a relabeling scheme, which enables our models to achieve accuracy scores higher than 90% on simulated and experimental data, suggesting that neural networks are capable of making predictions of crystal symmetry from an EBSD pattern.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formulation of the spin magnetic octupole moment in bulk crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of unconventional antiferromagnets, such as altermagnets, has drawn significant attention to higher-rank magnetic multipoles. Despite the advances in research, a fundamental understanding of multipole moments, particularly octupole moments, remains limited due to the challenges of accurately treating the position operator in bulk crystals, which is integral to their definitions. In this paper, we overcome this problem by using a thermodynamic relation and derive a formula of the spin magnetic octupole moment (SMOM) that can be used in bulk crystals. The resulting formula is gauge invariant and satisfies St\v{r}eda formulas, which relate the SMOM to the spin magnetoelectric dipole-quadrupole susceptibilities. Furthermore, we apply this formula to several models and examine the fundamental properties of the SMOM. One particularly important property is that the SMOM of $d$-wave altermagnets is dominated by nonrelativistic SMOMs regardless of spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, these nonrelativistic SMOMs exhibit a N\'{e}el order dependence that is predicted by the Landau theory of $d$-wave altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{132}$, 176702 (2024)].</description>

      <title>Ultralow-Temperature Thermodynamics and Optical Coherence of Narrow Linewidth Optical Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherence properties of optical emitters in crystals are critical for quantum technologies and optical frequency metrology. Cooling to sub-kelvin temperatures can significantly enhance their coherence, making it essential to identify the key parameters governing emitter and host crystal behavior in this ultra cold regime. We investigate a Czochralski-grown europium doped yttrium orthosilicate crystal, and we report measurements of the heat capacity, a parameter fundamental to evaluating thermal noise limits in metrology schemes based on spectral hole stabilization in such samples. In parallel, we characterize optical coherence via photon echo measurements as a function of temperature. Below 1 K, where phonon contributions diminish, two-level systems (TLS) associated with crystal imperfections may emerge as a limiting factor. A linear-in-temperature term in the heat capacity serves as a signature of TLS, and from our data, we establish an upper bound on this contribution. This, combined with the optical homogeneous linewidth from photon-echo measurements being constant in the interval from 300 mK to 2 K demonstrates a minimal TLSrelated effects in our sample. These findings highlight the promise of ultralow-temperature operation for enhancing the performance of optical quantum devices based on doped crystals.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Ultra-Fast Total Scattering and Pair Distribution Function Data using an X-ray Free Electron Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality total scattering data, a key tool for understanding atomic-scale structure in disordered materials, require stable instrumentation and access to high momentum transfers. This is now routine at dedicated synchrotron instrumentation using high-energy X-ray beams, but it is very challenging to measure a total scattering dataset in less than a few microseconds. This limits their effectiveness for capturing structural changes that occur at the much faster timescales of atomic motion. Current X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) provide femtosecond-pulsed X-ray beams with maximum energies of approximately 24 keV, giving the potential to measure total scattering and the attendant pair distribution functions (PDFs) on femtosecond timescales. Here, we show that this potential has been realised using the HED scientific instrument at the European XFEL and present normalised total scattering data for 0.35 \r{A}-1 &lt; Q &lt; 16.6 \r{A}-1 and their PDFs from a broad spectrum of materials, including crystalline, nanocrystalline and amorphous solids, liquids, and clusters in solution. We analyse the data using a variety of methods, including Rietveld refinement, small-box PDF refinement, joint reciprocal-real space refinement, cluster refinement, and Debye scattering analysis. The resolution function of the setup is also thoroughly characterised. We conclusively show that high-quality data can be obtained from a single approximately 30 fs XFEL pulse. Our efforts not only significantly increase the existing maximum reported Q-range for an S(Q) measured at an XFEL but also mean that XFELs are now a viable X-ray source for the broad community of people using reciprocal space total scattering and PDF methods in their research.</description>

      <title>Monolayer C$_{60}$ networks: A first-principles perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer fullerene (C$_{60}$) networks combine molecular-level rigidity with crystalline connectivity, offering a promising platform for numerous applications. In this Feature article, we review the physical and chemical properties of fullerene monolayers, focusing on first-principles studies. We first explore the structural stability of monolayer phases and investigate their thermal expansion behaviours. We then outline criteria for photocatalytic water splitting and introduce theoretical predictions which are supported by recent experimental verification. Finally, we show how interlayer stacking, molecular size, and dimensional tuning (from 2D monolayers into 3D crystals, 1D chains, or nanoribbons) offer versatile approaches to modulate their chemical functionality. Together, these insights establish fullerene networks as a novel class of carbon-based materials with tailored properties for catalysis, photovoltaics, and flexible electronics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing carrier balance in CsPbBr3 nanocrystal LEDs: The role of alkyl ligands and polar electron transport layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of lead halide perovskite nanocrystal based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has advanced significantly, with notable improvements in stability and optical properties. However, optimizing charge carrier injection and transport remains a challenge. Efficient electroluminescence requires a balanced transport of both holes and electrons within the emitting material. Here, we investigate cubic CsPbBr\textsubscript{3} nanocrystals passivated with oleylamine and oleic acid, comparing them to ligand-exchanged nanocrystals with didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDABr). Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirm successful ligand exchange, revealing reduced ligand coverage in DDABr-treated nanocrystals. Photoelectron spectroscopy, spectroelectrochemistry, and single-carrier devices indicate improved hole injection in DDABr-capped nanocrystals. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the influence of ligand type and coverage on energy levels, with oleic acid introducing localized states in native nanocrystals. Additionally, incorporation of a polar electron transport layer (ETL) enhances LED performance by over an order of magnitude in DDABr-capped nanocrystals, driven by improved charge balance arising from the spontaneous orientation polarization (SOP) of the ETL. These findings highlight the critical role of ligand selection, passivation degree, and charge transport control by the adjacent organic transport layers in optimizing LED efficiency.</description>

      <title>Theoretical modeling of synergistic effect of pores and grains on transmittance in transparent piezoelectric ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transparent piezoelectric ceramics (TPCs) have great application potential in electro-optical-mechanical multi-functional devices. Preparing high-performance TPCs, especially improving the transparency through microstructure regulation, has recently caused extensive discussion. However, there is still controversy about the influence of grains and pores on the transmittance of ceramics, and there is arbitrariness in the estimation of the theoretical transmittance limit. In this paper, taking PMN-PT-based ceramics as an example, theoretical mechanisms for the transmittance are discussed. An inhomogeneous reflection model is derived to improve the theoretical limit of transmittance. The effects of pores and grains scattering on transmittance are investigated. Rayleigh and RGD approximation are discussed to reveal the underlying scattering mechanisms. It is found that Rayleigh approximation is suitable for describing pore scattering, while RGD approximation is suitable for grain scattering. Thus, a Rayleigh-RGD combined model is proposed to describe light scattering in TPCs and successfully employed to fit experimentally measured transmittance curves.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetic Anisotropy and Gradient-Induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction on the Formation of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological spin textures (e.g. skyrmions) can be stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in the magnetic multilayer, which has been intensively studied. Recently, Bloch-type magnetic skyrmions stabilized by composition gradient-induced DMI (g-DMI) have been observed in 10-nm thick CoPt single layer. However, magnetic anisotropy in gradient-composition engineered CoPt (g-CoPt) films is highly sensitive to both the relative Co/Pt composition and the film thickness, leading to a complex interplay with g-DMI. The stability of skyrmions under the combined influence of magnetic anisotropy and g-DMI is crucial yet remains poorly understood. Here, we conduct a systematic study on the characteristics of magnetic skyrmions as a function of gradient polarity and effective gradient strength (defined as gradient/thickness) in g-CoPt single layers (thickness of 10-30 nm) using magnetic force microscopy (MFM), bulk magnetometry, and topological Hall effect measurements. Brillouin light scattering confirms that both the sign and magnitude of g-DMI depend on the polarity and amplitude of the composition gradient in g-CoPt films. MFM reveals that skyrmion size and density vary with g-CoPt film thickness, gradient polarity, and applied magnetic field. An increased skyrmion density is observed in samples exhibiting higher magnetic anisotropy, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations and energy barrier calculations.</description>

      <title>The role of terminal groups in non-chiral rod-like compounds on the formation of polar fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of ferroelectric mesophases in non-chiral liquid crystal (LCs) has sparked fundamental interest in the molecular mechanisms governing polarity. In this study, we investigate how terminal molecular groups influence the formation and stability of polar phases by analyzing six compounds from three homologous series. Specifically, we compare newly synthesized homologs with a nitro group, which predominantly exhibit polar mesophases, to previously reported structurally related analogs containing either a cyano group or a fluorine atom as terminal fragment. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations provide insights into electronic surface potential (ESP) distributions, revealing alternating regions of positive and negative charge density along the molecular axis, consistent with Madhusudana model of polar phase stabilization. We propose the ESP-derived parameter quantifying terminal electrostatic charge, revealing a direct correlation between the negative to positive charge ratio at the molecular termini and the formation of ferroelectric or antiferroelectric mesophases. To validate this hypothesis, we analyze the molecular structure-mesomorphic behavior relationship of other known non-chiral compounds that exhibit polar phases, demonstrating the critical role of terminal groups in determining mesophase polarity. Our findings enhance the understanding of the molecular origins of ferroelectricity in non-chiral LCs, paving the way for the rational design of next-generation functional polar soft materials.</description>

      <title>Observation of Intrinsic and LED Light-Enhanced Memristor Performance in In-Plane Ferroelectric NbOI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) layered ferroelectrics, as an emerging area of research, have attracted extensive attention, while memristors based on new 2D ferroelectric materials have yet to be fully explored, thereby limiting their applications in modern nanoelectronics. In this work, we report the observation of intrinsic memristive behavior in a newly discovered 2D in-plane ferroelectric material, NbOI2, and the giant enhancement of the memristive performance using LED visible light. The results show that NbOI2 exhibits intrinsically strong memristive response with a current on/off ratio of up to 10^4 and stable switching cycles, which is independent of back-gate voltage. Under LED visible light illumination, the current on/off ratio in NbOI2 is over one order of magnitude higher than that without light, meanwhile, the coercive field is significantly reduced to less than 1.22 kVcm-1, much lower than other 2D ferroelectric material-based memristors. Interestingly, both the intrinsic and the light-enhanced resistive switching phenomena only occur along the in-plane b-axis direction, indicating that the memristive behavior in NbOI2 is driven by electric field-induced and optical field-enhanced ferroelectric polarization switching mechanisms, as evidenced by a combined orientation-dependent electrical/optoelectrical measurement and sweep cycle-induced structural evolution analysis. Our study not only provides a materials strategy based on new 2D ferroelectrics for designing memristor applications, but also offers a simple optical method to enhance its performance, paving the path for its implementation in novel nanoelectronics and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Two lock-in amplifiers based $3\omega$ technique: a practical guide for thermal conductivity experiments in bulk samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate determination of thermal conductivity $\kappa(T)$ in bulk materials is essential to assess their performance as candidates for specific applications. The 3$\omega$ technique is an established methodology for studying the thermal conductivity of thin films and becomes particularly suitable in the case of bulk specimens at room temperature and above, where standard stationary techniques require significant corrections for radiative losses. Although this method has been employed in several works, it remains not widely adopted because its implementation demands considerable sophistication, including experiment design, thin film deposition techniques and choices of the geometry of the current/heat transducer, electronics, and analytical treatment of the signals. This work reviews the technique's most crucial technical aspects, providing practical support for a quick and user-friendly implementation, from the design phase to the execution and analysis. We release a Python-based graphical user interface that supports a quick quantitative estimation of the investigated temperature profiles based on the geometrical parameters (width/length) of the deposited transducer (heater/thermometer metal line) before an experiment, guaranteeing an optimal engineering of the experimental conditions for each given material under scrutiny.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic states with zero magnetization but non-relativistic spin splitting are outstanding candidates for the next generation of spintronic devices. Their electron-volt (eV) scale spin splitting, ultrafast spin dynamics and nearly vanishing stray fields make them particularly promising for several applications. A variety of such magnetic states with nontrivial spin textures have been identified recently, including even-parity d, g, or i-wave altermagnets and odd-parity p-wave magnets. Achieving voltage-based control of the nonuniform spin polarization of these magnetic states is of great interest for realizing energyefficient and compact devices for information storage and processing. Spin-spiral type-II multiferroics are optimal candidates for such voltage-based control, as they exhibit an inversion-symmetry-breaking magnetic order which directly induces ferroelectric polarization, allowing for symmetry protected cross-control between spin chirality and polar order. Here we combine photocurrent measurements, first-principle calculations and group-theory analysis to provide direct evidence that the spin polarization of the spin-spiral type-II multiferroic NiI2 exhibits odd-parity character connected to the spiral chirality. The symmetry-protected coupling between chirality and polar order enables electrical control of a primarily non-relativistic spin polarization. Our findings represent the first direct observation of unconventional odd-parity magnetism in a spin-spiral type-II multiferroic, and open a new frontier of voltage-based switching of non-relativistic spin polarization in compensated magnets.</description>

      <title>Tunable stacking-driven topological phase transitions in pnictide layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonmagnetic topological insulators (TIs) are known for their robust metallic surface/edge states that are protected by time-reversal symmetry, making them promising candidates for next-generation spintronic and nanoelectronic devices. Traditional approaches to realizing TIs have focused on inducing band inversion via strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), yet many materials with substantial SOC often remain topologically trivial. In this work, we present a materials-design strategy for engineering topologically non-trivial phases, e.g., quantum spin Hall phases, by vertically stacking topologically trivial Rashba monolayers in an inverted fashion. Using BiSb as a prototype system, we demonstrate that while the BiSb monolayer is topologically trivial (despite having significant SOC), an inverted BiSb-SbBi bilayer configuration realizes a non-trivial topological phase with enhanced spin Hall conductivity. We further reveal a delicate interplay between the SOC strength and the interlayer electron tunneling that governs the emergence of a nontrivial topological phase in the bilayer heterostructure. This phase can be systematically tuned using an external electric field, providing an experimentally accessible means of controlling the system's topology. Our magnetotransport studies further validate this interplay, by revealing g-factor suppression and the emergence a zeroth Landau level. Notably, the inverted bilayer heterostructure exhibits a robust and tunable spin Hall effect, with performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art materials. Thus, our findings unveil an alternative pathway for designing and engineering functional properties in 2D topological systems using topologically trivial constituent monolayers.</description>

      <title>Topotactical hydrogen induced single-band $d$-wave superconductivity in La$_2$NiO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_4$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a structural resemblance to its cuprate counterpart, La$_2$CuO$_4$. However, La$_2$CuO$_4$ has a Cu$^{2+}$ or 3$d^9$ electronic configuration that needs to be hole or electron doped for superconductivity, whereas La$_2$NiO$_4$ is 3$d^8$ with divalent Ni$^{2+}$. Making a cuprate analog through conventional electron doping is impractical due to the rarity of trivalent substituents for La. In this work, we propose an alternative route: intercalating topotactical hydrogen which is possible through electric-field-controlled protonation and transforms La$_2$NiO$_4$ into a 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ single-band two-dimensional anti-ferromagnetic Mott insulator analogous to La$_2$CuO$_4$. This we find through density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations. The furthergoing dynamical vertex approximation predicts that H-La$_2$NiO$_4$ can host $d$-wave superconductivity under 15\% hole doping with a critical temperature above 20\,K. Our findings not only suggest a new method for tuning the electronic structure of layered nickelates but also provides theoretical evidence for a new nickelate superconductor, awaiting experimental synthesis.</description>

      <title>No Evidence of Anomalous Diffusion in Yukawa Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion in Yukawa crystals is stochastic due to the thermally activated formation of vacancy-interstitial pairs, which have poor statistics in simulations. This makes it difficult to argue if Yukawa crystals exhibit normal diffusion, or if they could be subdiffusive or superdiffusive. To resolve this, we run a long molecular dynamics simulation of an idealized Yukawa crystal for a billion timesteps. We find no evidence of anomalous diffusion in the pure crystal, but also caution readers against overinterpreting this result as real crystals have complicated structures including grains and defects.</description>

      <title>Pressure and strain effects on the $\textit{ab initio}$ $GW$ electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at a critical temperature above 80~K points to a non-conventional pairing mechanism in nickelates as in cuprates, possibly due to electronic correlations. We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.00413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effects of strong phonon anharmonicity of a type-I clathrate Ba$_{\rm 8}$Ga$_{\rm 16}$Sn$_{\rm 30}$ induced by quadruple-well potential of guest atoms were investigated. Phonon transport including coherent interbranch component was analyzed using a first-principles-based self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory that gives temperature-dependent harmonic interatomic force constants and by solving off-diagonal components of group velocity operator. Experimentally observed thermal conductivities have been reasonably reproduced by considering both lattice and electron contributions. Through the analysis with the SCP theory, we found that hardening of guest modes leads to an increase in lattice thermal conductivity at frequencies below those of framework-dominant flat modes (&lt; 40 cm$^{\rm -1}$), which finally results in the slow decay and slight increase in the total lattice thermal conductivity with increasing temperature. Detailed analyses revealed that the increase in lattice thermal conductivity at low frequency is attributed to (a) the increase in group velocities of phonon modes located at frequencies below that of the flat guest modes and (b) abnormal increase in lifetimes of phonon modes located between frequencies of the flat guest and framework modes with increasing temperature. From an engineering point of view, this effect may lead to an intriguing phenomenon, a larger decrease in thermal conductivity due to nanostructuring at higher temperatures.</description>

Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent response in systems with broken inversion symmetry, provides a powerful tool for probing topological transport properties. In this context, we investigate copper-substituted lead apatite (LK-99), a material that initially garnered attention for its controversial claim of room-temperature superconductivity. Despite the unresolved nature of its superconducting properties, LK-99's unique electronic structure featuring flat bands near the Fermi level and broken inversion symmetry makes it a promising candidate for exploring Berry curvature-driven phenomena such as the NLHE. Using first-principles density functional theory and a refined tight-binding Hamiltonian model, we investigate LK-99's band topology and transport properties. Our calculations reveal that LK-99 hosts Weyl points near the Fermi level, which contribute significantly to Berry curvature. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling further splits these bands, generating additional Weyl points and enhancing the Berry curvature distribution. Crucially, the absence of inversion symmetry in LK-99 leads to a net Berry curvature dipole, producing a nonlinear Hall current that scales quadratically with the applied electric field. Moreover, we demonstrate that the NLHE in LK-99 can be tuned by varying the direction of the applied electric field, underscoring its potential as a versatile platform for exploring topological transport phenomena and designing next-generation nonlinear electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system that possesses translational symmetry but breaks orientational symmetry is known as a nematic phase. While there are many examples of nematic phases in a wide range of contexts, such as in liquid crystals, complex oxides, and superconductors, of particular interest is the magnetic analogue, where the spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom of the electron are intertwined. The difficulty of spin nematics is the unambiguous realization and characterization of the phase. Here we present an entirely new type of magnetic nematic phase, which replaces the basis of individual spins with magnetic helices. The helical basis allows for the direct measurement of the order parameters with soft X-ray scattering and a thorough characterization of the nematic phase and its thermodynamic transitions. We discover two distinct nematic phases with unique spatio-temporal correlation signatures. Using coherent X-ray methods, we find that near the phase boundary between the two nematic phases, fluctuations coexist on the timescale of both seconds and sub-nanoseconds. Additionally, we have determined that the fluctuations occur simultaneously with a reorientation of the magnetic helices, indicating that there is spontaneous symmetry breaking and new degrees of freedom become available. Our results provide a novel framework for characterizing exotic phases and the phenomena presented can be mapped onto a broad class of physical systems.</description>

Abstract: The Raman active G mode in graphene exhibits strong coupling to electrons, yet the comprehensive treatment of this interaction in the calculation of its temperature-dependent Raman spectrum remains incomplete. In this study, we calculate the temperature dependence of the G mode frequency and linewidth, and successfully explain the experimental trend, by accounting for the contributions arising from the first-order electron-phonon coupling, electron-mediated phonon-phonon coupling, and standard lattice anharmonicity. The generality of our approach enables its broad applicability to study phonon dynamics in materials where both electron-phonon coupling and anharmonicity are important.</description>

      <title>Slow, Nanometer Light Confinement Observed in Atomically Thin TaS2</title>

Abstract: Extreme light confinement down to the atomic scale has been theoretically predicted for ultrathin, Ta-based transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). In this work, we experimentally demonstrate in 2H-TaS$_2$ monolayers and bilayers a lateral confinement ratio up to 300 at large wave vectors of $q = 0.15 \, \r{A}^{-1}$, and slow light behaviour with a group velocity $\sim 10^{-4}c$. Quantitative momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (q-EELS) with a momentum resolution of $0.0056 \, \r{A}^{-1}$ was used as a platform for the nanoscale optical measurements. With it, momentum-dispersed, two-dimensional (2D) plasmon resonances were experimentally observed, showing a transition from 2D to 3D Coulomb interaction in the high-momentum regime, equivalent to light confinement volumes of $1\text{-}2 \, \text{nm}^3$. Remarkably, the resonant modes do not enter the electron-hole continuum, predicting even further enhanced optical field confinements for this material at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>WyckoffDiff -- A Generative Diffusion Model for Crystal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fr\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation.

      <title>Implicit Geometric Descriptor-Enabled ANN Framework for a Unified Structure-Property Relationship in Architected Nanofibrous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchically architected nanofibrous materials, such as the vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) foams, draw their exceptional mechanical properties from the interplay of nanoscale size effects and inter-nanotube interactions within and across architectures. However, the distinct effects of these mechanisms, amplified by the architecture, on different mechanical properties remain elusive, limiting their independent tunability for targeted property combinations. Reliance on architecture-specific explicit design parameters further inhibits the development of a unified structure-property relationship rooted in those nanoscale mechanisms. Here, we introduce two implicit geometric descriptors -- multi-component shape invariants (MCSI) -- in an artificial neural network (ANN) framework to establish a unified structure-property relationship that governs diverse architectures. The MCSIs effectively capture the key nanoscale mechanisms that give rise to the bulk mechanical properties such as specific-energy absorption, peak stress, and average modulus. Exploiting their ability to predict mechanical properties for designs that are even outside of the training data, we propose generalized design strategies to achieve desired mechanical property combinations in architected VACNT foams. Such implicit descriptor-enabled ANN frameworks can guide the accelerated and tractable design of complex hierarchical materials for applications ranging from shock-absorbing layers in extreme environments to functional components in soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-Mediated Hybridization of Wannier-Mott and Frenkel Excitons in a Monolayer WS2 -- J-Aggregate Hybrid System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a tunable plasmonic platform that allows room temperature hybridization of dissimilar excitons, namely of Wannier-Mott excitons in monolayer (1L) WS2 and Frenkel excitons in molecular J-aggregates via simultaneous strong coupling to surface plasmon polaritons. It is based on a simple layered design consisting of a thin planar silver film and a dielectric spacer on which monolayer and the aggregates are assembled. Strong coupling is revealed by angle-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements in total internal reflection geometry by the observation of double Rabi splitting at the two excitonic resonances. We analyze the exciton-exciton-plasmon system with the coupled oscillator model and demonstrate modulation of polariton character and dynamics by the number of molecules participating in the coupling. Furthermore, we propose a route to remotely control the mode splitting at the Frenkel excitonic resonance via electrostatic gating of the 1L-WS2 and to switch the molecule-plasmon interaction between the weak and strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Instability of oxide perovskite surfaces induced by vacancy formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a first principles study of the (001) surface energetics of nine oxide perovskites, with a focus on the role of surface vacancies in determining termination stability. Additionally, investigation into the behaviour of vacancies as a function of depth from the surface in these perovskites, ABO$_{3}$ (A=Ca, Sr, Ba; B=Ti, Zr, Sn), is carried out, and results are compared to formation of the vacancies in bulk. Combining results from these investigations reveals a general trend for all nine perovskites - the undefected AO surface is more energetically favourable to form than the BO2 surface. This dominance of the AO over the BO2 surface is further enforced by the phase diagrams of perovskite surfaces. However, A-site vacancies at the AO surface are far more favourable (1-2 eV lower in energy) than B-site vacancies at the BO2 surface. Charged vacancies only drive this further under oxygen-rich conditions, showing a smaller range of stability for the AO than the BO2 surface. These results indicates that, whilst the AO surface is easier to form, the BO2 surface will display better long term stability, making it more suitable for use in potential applications. This study furthers the understanding of oxide perovskite (001)-terminated surface stability, which will aid in surface growth and manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Nanomechanics and Pore Structure of Sodium and Potassium Geopolymer Gels: Experiments, Molecular Dynamics and Coarse-Grained Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The link between composition, microstructure and mechanics of NASH and KASH gels is elusive, even in pure metakaolin-based geopolymers. This article exploits molecular mechanics, coarse-grained nanomechanics and micromechanics, to interpret new experimental results from microscopy, porosimetry and nanoindentation. KASH displays a finer nanogranular structure than NASH (3 vs 30 nm particle diameters, 5 vs 50 nm average pore diameters), higher skeletal density (2.3 vs 2.02 g/cm$^3$), nanoindentation moduli (9.21 vs 7.5 GPa) and hardness (0.56 vs 0.37 GPa) despite a higher total porosity (0.48-0.53 vs 0.38). This suggests a stiffer and stronger solid skeleton for KASH, confirmed through predictive molecular dynamics simulations on recent and new models of NASH and KASH. The atomistic simulations inform mechanical interactions for new, coarse-grained, particle-based models of NASH and KASH. The resulting simulations predict the nanoindentation result that KASH is stiffer than equally porous NASH and the impact of formation eigenstresses on elastic moduli.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of light with objects and media moving at relativistic and superluminal speeds enables unconventional phenomena such as Fresnel drag, Hawking radiation, and light amplification. Synthetic motion, facilitated by modulated internal degrees of freedom, enables the study of relativistic phenomena unrestricted by the speed of light. In this study, we investigate synthetically moving apertures created by high-contrast reflectivity modulations, which are generated by ultrafast laser pulses on a subwavelength thin film of indium tin oxide. The space-time diffraction of a weaker probe beam reveals a complex, non-separable spatio-temporal transformation, where changes in the frequency of the wave are correlated to changes in its momentum. By using schemes of continuous or discrete modulation we demonstrate tunable frequency-momentum diffraction patterns with gradients that depend upon the relative velocity between the modulation and the probe wave. The diffraction patterns are matched by operator-based theory and the gradients are analytically predicted using a super-relativistic Doppler model, where the modulation is described as a superluminally moving scattering particle. Our experiments open a path towards mimicking relativistic mechanics and developing complex and programmable spatio-temporal transformations of light.</description>

      <title>Adsorb-Agent: Autonomous Identification of Stable Adsorption Configurations via Large Language Model Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key reactivity descriptor in catalysis, enabling efficient screening for optimal catalysts. However, determining adsorption energy typically requires evaluating numerous adsorbate-catalyst configurations. Current algorithmic approaches rely on exhaustive enumeration of adsorption sites and configurations, which makes the process computationally intensive and does not inherently guarantee the identification of the global minimum energy. In this work, we introduce Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently identify system-specific stable adsorption configurations corresponding to the global minimum adsorption energy. Adsorb-Agent leverages its built-in knowledge and emergent reasoning capabilities to strategically explore adsorption configurations likely to hold adsorption energy. By reducing the reliance on exhaustive sampling, it significantly decreases the number of initial configurations required while improving the accuracy of adsorption energy predictions. We evaluate Adsorb-Agent's performance across twenty representative systems encompassing a range of complexities. The Adsorb-Agent successfully identifies comparable adsorption energies for 83.7% of the systems and achieves lower energies, closer to the actual global minimum, for 35% of the systems, while requiring significantly fewer initial configurations than conventional methods. Its capability is particularly evident in complex systems, where it identifies lower adsorption energies for 46.7% of systems involving intermetallic surfaces and 66.7% of systems with large adsorbate molecules. These results demonstrate the potential of Adsorb-Agent to accelerate catalyst discovery by reducing computational costs and improving the reliability of adsorption energy predictions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing light emission with electric fields in polar nitride semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant effort has been devoted to mitigating polarization fields in nitride LEDs, as these fields are traditionally viewed as detrimental to light emission, particularly for red emission. Contrary to this prevailing notion, we demonstrate that strong polarization fields can enhance the optical-transition strength of AlInGaN quantum wells emitting in the red, which has been historically challenging to achieve. By leveraging machine-learning surrogate models trained on multi-scale quantum-mechanical simulations, we globally explore the heterostructure design space and uncover that larger fields correlate with higher electron-hole overlap. This relation arises from the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables thinner wells without requiring higher indium compositions, thus overcoming a key limitation in nitride epitaxy. Structural and compositional engineering of internal fields offers a unique dimension for designing polychromatic nitride LEDs, crucial for miniaturizing LED pixels to the micron scale for extended-reality and biomedical applications. Broadly, our work demonstrates how machine learning can uncover unexpected paradigms for semiconductor design.</description>

      <title>A Density Functional Theory Study of Magnetic Transition in MnO2 adsorbed Vanadium Carbide (V$_2$C) MXene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The work reports nonmagnetic behavior (0.04 $\mu$B) in two-dimensional (2D) V2C-OF MXene and ferromagnetism in MnO$_2$ adsorbed V2C-OF MXene. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the magnetic moments of V$_2$C-OF and MnO$_2$@V$_2$C-OF MXene. The MXene, which is derived from the exfoliation of its parent V$_2$AlC MAX phase, shows a good potential to be a ferromagnetic when MnO$_2$ is adsorbed on it. The V$_2$C MXene and MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene were successfully synthesized, as characterized using X-ray diffraction, showing an increased c-lattice parameter from 22.6{\AA} to 27.2{\AA} after MnO$_2$ adsorption. The DFT study confirmed that MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene changed from nonmagnetic (in V$_2$C MXene) to a strong ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment of 4.48$\mu$B for Mn adsorbed V$_2$C-OF MXene. The current work is a step-forward towards understanding of magnetism in two-dimensional materials for future 2D spintronics.</description>

      <title>Square skyrmion lattice in multiorbital $f$-electron systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the emergence of a square-shaped skyrmion lattice in multi-orbital $f$-electron systems with easy-axis magnetic anisotropy on a centrosymmetric square lattice. By performing mean-field calculations for an effective localized model consisting of two Kramers doublets, we construct the low-temperature phase diagram in a static external magnetic field. Consequently, we find that a square-shaped skyrmion lattice with the skyrmion number of one appears in the intermediate-field region when the crystal field splitting between the two doublets is small. Furthermore, we identify another double-$Q$ state with a nonzero net scalar chirality at zero- and low-field regions, which is attributed to the help of the multi-orbital degree of freedom. Our results offer another route to search for skyrmion-hosting materials in centrosymmetric $f$-electron tetragonal systems with multi-orbital degrees of freedom, e.g., Ce-based compounds. This contrasts with conventional other $f$-electron systems hosting skyrmion lattices, such as Gd- and Eu-based compounds without orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nodal planes, two-dimensional symmetry-enforced band crossings, can carry a topological charge, similar to Weyl points. While the transport properties of Weyl points are well understood, those of nodal planes remain largely unexplored. These properties are influenced not only by the Berry curvature, but also by other quantum geometric quantities. In this work we study the quantum geometry - specifically the Berry curvature and quantum metric - and the linear optical conductivity of topological nodal planes. We introduce a low-energy model and investigate its low-frequency optical responses to determine the unique signatures of topological nodal planes. By comparing these findings to the optical response in a tight-binding model with a topological nodal plane, we observe consistent low-frequency behavior with a cubic power law. This paves the way for the experimental detection of topological nodal planes through optical conductivity measurements.</description>
