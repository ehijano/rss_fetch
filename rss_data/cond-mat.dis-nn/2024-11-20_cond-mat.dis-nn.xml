      <title>Field theory of non-Hermitian disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between non-Hermiticity and disorder gives rise to unique universality classes of Anderson transitions. Here, we develop a field-theoretical description of non-Hermitian disordered systems based on fermionic replica nonlinear sigma models. We classify the target manifolds of the nonlinear sigma models across all the 38-fold symmetry classes of non-Hermitian systems and corroborate the correspondence of the universality classes of Anderson transitions between non-Hermitian systems and Hermitized systems with additional chiral symmetry. We apply the nonlinear sigma model framework to study the spectral properties of non-Hermitian random matrices with particle-hole symmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Anderson transition unique to nonreciprocal disordered systems in one dimension, including the Hatano-Nelson model, originates from the competition between the kinetic and topological terms in a one-dimensional nonlinear sigma model. We also discuss the critical phenomena of non-Hermitian disordered systems with symmetry and topology in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of localization phase transition in the non-Hermitian Disorder-Aubry-Andr\'{e} model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The driven dynamics of localization transitions in a non-Hermitian Disorder-Aubry-Andr\'{e} (DAA) model are thoroughly examined under both open boundary conditions (OBC) and periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Through an analysis of the static properties of observables, including the localization length ($\xi$), inverse participation ratio ($\rm IPR$), and energy gap ($\Delta E$), we found that the critical exponents examined under PBC are also applicable under OBC. The Kibble-Zurek scaling (KZS) for the driven dynamics in the non-Hermitian DAA systems is formulated and numerically verified for different quench directions. Notably, for the dynamical paths considered, boundary conditions had minimal impact on the evolution process. This study generalizes the application of the KZS to the dynamical localization transitions within systems featuring dual localization mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Spectral Coarse-Graining and Rescaling for Preserving Structural and Dynamical Properties in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a graph renormalization procedure based on the coarse-grained Laplacian, which generates reduced-complexity representations for characteristic scales identified through the spectral gap. This method retains both diffusion probabilities and large-scale topological structures, while reducing redundant information, facilitating the analysis of large graphs by decreasing the number of vertices. Applied to graphs derived from EEG recordings of human brain activity, our approach reveals macroscopic properties emerging from neuronal interactions, such as collective behavior in the form of coordinated neuronal activity. Additionally, it shows dynamic reorganization of brain activity across scales, with more generalized patterns during rest and more specialized and scale-invariant activity in the occipital lobe during attention-focused tasks.</description>

      <title>Anderson transition and mobility edges on hyperbolic lattices with randomly connected boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices, formed by tessellating the hyperbolic plane with regular polygons, exhibit a diverse range of exotic physical phenomena beyond conventional Euclidean lattices. Here, we investigate the impact of disorder on hyperbolic lattices and reveal that the Anderson localization occurs at strong disorder strength, accompanied by the presence of mobility edges. Taking the hyperbolic $\{p,q\}=\{3,8\}$ and $\{p,q\}=\{4,8\}$ lattices as examples, we employ finite-size scaling of both spectral statistics and the inverse participation ratio to pinpoint the transition point and critical exponents. Our findings indicate that the transition points tend to increase with larger values of $\{p,q\}$ or curvature. In the limiting case of $\{\infty, q\}$, we further determine its Anderson transition using the cavity method, drawing parallels with the random regular graph. Our work lays the cornerstone for a comprehensive understanding of Anderson transition and mobility edges on hyperbolic lattices.</description>

      <title>Anomalous distribution of magnetization in an Ising spin glass with correlated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of correlations in disorder variables is a largely unexplored topic in spin glass theory. We study this problem through a specific example of correlated disorder introduced in the Ising spin glass model. We prove that the distribution function of the magnetization along the Nishimori line in the present model is identical to the distribution function of the spin glass order parameter in the standard Edwards-Anderson model with symmetrically-distributed independent disorder. This result means that if the Edwards-Anderson model exhibits replica symmetry breaking, the magnetization distribution in the correlated model has support on a finite interval, in sharp contrast to the conventional understanding that the magnetization distribution has at most two delta peaks. This unusual behavior challenges the traditional argument against replica symmetry breaking on the Nishimori line in the Edwards-Anderson model. In addition, we show that when temperature chaos is present in the Edwards-Anderson model, the ferromagnetic phase is strictly confined to the Nishimori line in the present model. These findings are valid not only for finite-dimensional systems but also for the infinite-range model, and highlight the need for a deeper understanding of disorder correlations in spin glass systems.</description>

      <title>A universal approximation theorem for nonlinear resistive networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resistor networks have recently attracted interest as analog computing platforms for machine learning, particularly due to their compatibility with the Equilibrium Propagation training framework. In this work, we explore the computational capabilities of these networks. We prove that electrical networks consisting of voltage sources, linear resistors, diodes, and voltage-controlled voltage sources (VCVS) can approximate any continuous function to arbitrary precision. Central to our proof is a method for translating a ReLU neural network into an approximately equivalent electrical network comprising these four elements. Our proof relies on two assumptions: (a) circuit elements are ideal, and (b) variable resistor conductances and VCVS amplification factors can take any value (arbitrarily small or large). Our findings provide insights that could guide the development of universal self-learning electrical networks.</description>

      <title>Studying power-grid synchronization with incremental refinement of model heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling power-grid systems has got a major importance in present days as transformation to renewable energy sources requires the complete re-design of energy transmission. Renewable energy sources can be located quite far from their consumption points because urban and industrial structures do not follow physical constraints and capabilities. Important examples are the sea coast vs inland divisions in the case of wind power. Ill-constructed high-voltage (HV) power grids can cause catastrophic damages to economies as it was demonstrated in recent history via the emergence of large blackout events. The probability distributions of such events was found to be fat-tailed, exhibiting power-law (PL) tails very often. To understand them, self-organized critical direct current (DC) models have been constructed~\cite{car2} and have been shown to describe well the PL exponents of empirical values. However, many details could not be understood as power-grids work with alternating currents (AC) in which phase differences are the primary causes of the power-flows.</description>
