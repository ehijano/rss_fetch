      <title>BridgeNet: A Hybrid, Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Solving High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear, high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to complex system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spectrally accurate and efficient convolution with the 3D free-space Laplace Green's function via the super-potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-accuracy spectral method for solving the unbounded three-dimensional Poisson equation with smooth, compactly supported sources. The approach is based on a super-potential formulation, where the solution is obtained by applying the Laplacian to a convolution with the biharmonic Green's function. A separable Gaussian-sum (GS) approximation enables efficient FFT-based computation with quasi-linear complexity. Owing to the improved regularity of the biharmonic kernel, the GS cutoff error is of order four, eliminating the need for correction terms or Taylor expansions required in standard GS or Ewald-type methods. Numerical benchmarks demonstrate that the method achieves machine-precision accuracy and outperforms existing GS-based schemes in both error and runtime, making it a robust and efficient tool for free-space Poisson problems on uniform grids.</description>

      <title>A highly scalable numerical framework for reservoir simulation on UG4 platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling and simulation of multiphase fluid flow receive significant attention in reservoir engineering. Many time discretization schemes for multiphase flow equations are either explicit or semi-implicit, relying on the decoupling between the saturation equation and the pressure equation. In this study, we delve into a fully coupled and fully implicit framework for simulating multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media, considering gravity and capillary effects. We utilize the Vertex-Centered Finite Volume Method for spatial discretization and propose an efficient implementation of interface conditions for heterogeneous porous media within the current scheme. Notably, we introduce the Linearly Implicit Extrapolation Method (LIMEX) with an error estimator, adapted for the first time to multiphase flow problems. To solve the resulting linear system, we employ the BiCGSTAB method with the Geometric Multigrid (GMG) preconditioner. The implementations of models and methods are based on the open-source software: UG4. The results from parallel computations on the supercomputer demonstrate that the scalability of our proposed framework is sufficient, supporting a scale of thousands of processors with Degrees of Freedom (DoF) extending up to billions.</description>

      <title>Thermoplasmonics of Gold-Core Silica-Shell Colloidal Nanoparticles under Pulse Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-shell nanoparticles, particularly those having a gold core, have emerged as a highly promising class of materials due to their unique optical and thermal properties, which underpin a wide range of applications in photothermal therapy, imaging, and biosensing. In this study, we present a comprehensive study of the thermal dynamics of gold-core silica-shell nanoparticles immersed in water under pulse illumination. The plasmonic response of the core-shell nanoparticle is described by incorporating Mie theory with electronic temperature corrections to the refractive indices of gold, based on a Drude Lorentz formulation. The thermal response of the core-shell nanoparticles is modeled by coupling the two temperature model with molecular dynamics simulations, providing an atomistic description of nanoscale heat transfer. We investigate nanoparticles with both dense and porous silica shells (with 50% porosity) under laser pulse durations of 100 fs, 10 ps, and 1 ns, and over a range of fluences between 0.05 and 5mJ/cm2. We show that nanoparticles with a thin dense silica shell (5 nm) exhibit significantly faster water heating compared to bare gold nanoparticles. This behavior is attributed to enhanced electron-phonon coupling at the gold silica interface and to the relatively high thermal conductance between silica and water. These findings provide new insights into optimizing nanoparticle design for efficient photothermal applications and establish a robust framework for understanding energy transfer mechanisms in heterogeneous metal dielectric nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Outflow Boundary Influence on Aerodynamic Performance using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate treatment of outflow boundary conditions remains a critical challenge in computational fluid dynamics when predicting aerodynamic forces and/or acoustic emissions. This is particularly evident when employing the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) as the numerical solution technique, which often suffers from inaccuracies induced by artificial reflections from outflow boundaries. This paper investigates the use of neural networks (NN) to mitigate these adverse boundary effects and enable truncated domain requirements. Two distinct NN-based approaches are proposed: (1) direct reconstruction of unknown particle distribution functions at the outflow boundary; and (2) enhancement of established characteristic boundary conditions (CBC) by dynamically tuning their parameters. The direct reconstruction model was trained on data generated from a 2D flow over a cylindrical obstruction. The drag, lift, and Strouhal number were used to test the new boundary condition. We analyzed results for various Reynolds numbers and restricted domain sizes where it demonstrated significantly improved predictions when compared with the traditional Zou &amp; He boundary condition. To examine the robustness of the NN-based reconstruction, the same condition was applied to the simulation of a NACA0012 airfoil, again providing accurate aerodynamic performance predictions. The neural-enhanced CBC were evaluated on a 2D convected vortex benchmark and showed superior performance in minimizing density errors compared to CBCs with fixed parameters. These findings highlight the potential of NN-integrated boundary conditions to improve accuracy and reduce computational expense of aerodynamic and acoustic emissions simulations with the LBM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GollumFit, a framework designed for performing binned-likelihood analyses on neutrino telescope data. GollumFit incorporates model parameters common to any neutrino telescope and also model parameters specific to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We provide a high-level overview of its key features and how the code is organized. We then discuss the performance of the fitting in a typical analysis scenario, highlighting the ability to fit over tens of nuisance parameters. We present some examples showing how to use the package for likelihood minimization tasks. This framework uniquely incorporates the particular model parameters necessary for neutrino telescopes, and solves an associated likelihood problem in a time-efficient manner.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Gradient Training: A novel training paradigm for bridging the gap between deep neural networks and physical reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant energy efficiency gains in AI training.</description>

      <title>Deep learning image burst stacking to reconstruct high-resolution ground-based solar observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large aperture ground based solar telescopes allow the solar atmosphere to be resolved in unprecedented detail. However, observations are limited by Earths turbulent atmosphere, requiring post image corrections. Current reconstruction methods using short exposure bursts face challenges with strong turbulence and high computational costs. We introduce a deep learning approach that reconstructs 100 short exposure images into one high quality image in real time. Using unpaired image to image translation, our model is trained on degraded bursts with speckle reconstructions as references, improving robustness and generalization. Our method shows an improved robustness in terms of perceptual quality, especially when speckle reconstructions show artifacts. An evaluation with a varying number of images per burst demonstrates that our method makes efficient use of the combined image information and achieves the best reconstructions when provided with the full image burst.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method is presented for the fast evaluation of the transient acoustic field generated outside a spherical surface by sources inside the surface. The method employs Lebedev quadratures, which are the optimal method for spatial integration, and Lagrange interpolation and differentiation in an advanced time algorithm for the evaluation of the transient field. Numerical testing demonstrates that the approach gives near machine-precision accuracy and a speed-up in evaluation time which depends on the order of quadrature rule employed but breaks even with direct evaluation at a number of field points about 1.15 times the number of surface quadrature nodes.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification and stability of neural operators for prediction of three-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence poses challenges for numerical simulation due to its chaotic, multiscale nature and high computational cost. Traditional turbulence modeling often struggles with accuracy and long-term stability. Recent scientific machine learning (SciML) models, such as Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), show promise in solving PDEs, but are typically limited to one-step-ahead predictions and often fail over long time horizons, especially in 3D turbulence. This study proposes a framework to assess the reliability of neural operator models in turbulent flows. Using three-dimensional forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) as a benchmark, we evaluate models in terms of uncertainty quantification (UQ), error propagation, and sensitivity to initial perturbations. Statistical tools such as error distribution analysis and autocorrelation functions (ACF) are used to assess predictive robustness and temporal coherence. Our proposed model, the factorized-implicit FNO (F-IFNO), improves long-term stability and accuracy by incorporating implicit factorization into the prediction process. It outperforms conventional LES and other FNO-based models in balancing accuracy, stability, and efficiency. The results highlight the importance of prediction constraints, time interval selection, and UQ in developing robust neural operator frameworks for turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Hubbard model on a graphene hexagon: Strengths of IQPE and noise constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers transformative potential for simulating real-world materials, providing a powerful platform to investigate complex quantum systems across quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE) and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties. Noiseless simulations yield accurate ground-state energies (GSEs), charge and spin densities, and correlation functions, all in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization, underscoring the precision and reliability of quantum simulation for strongly correlated electron systems. However, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly challenging. To examine these limitations, we utilize the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real backend. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Preliminary hardware runs on IBM devices further expose discrepancies between simulated and real-world noise, emphasizing the gap between ideal and practical implementations. Overall, our results highlight the promise of quantum computing for simulating correlated quantum materials, while also revealing the significant challenges posed by hardware noise in achieving accurate and reliable physical predictions using current quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Classification and enumeration of solid-solid phase transition mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal-structure match (CSM), the atom-to-atom correspondence between two crystalline phases, is used extensively to describe solid-solid phase transition (SSPT) mechanisms. However, existing computational methods cannot account for all possible CSMs. Here, we propose a formalism to classify all CSMs into a tree structure, which is independent of the choices of unit cell and supercell. We rigorously proved that only a finite number of noncongruent CSMs are of practical interest. By representing CSMs as integer matrices, we introduce the crystmatch method to exhaustively enumerate them, which uncontroversially solves the CSM optimization problem under any geometric criterion. For most SSPTs, crystmatch can reproduce all known deformation mechanisms and CSMs within 10 CPU minutes, while also revealing thousands of new candidates. The resulting database can be further used for comparing experimental phenomena, high-throughput energy barrier calculations, or machine learning.</description>

      <title>Reactive Transport Simulation of Silicate-Rich Shale Rocks when Exposed to CO2 Saturated Brine Under High Pressure and High Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the feasibility of carbon dioxide storage in shale rocks and the reliability of reactive transport models in achieving accurate replication of the chemo-mechanical interactions and transport processes transpiring in these rocks when subjected to CO2 saturated brine. Owing to the heterogeneity of rocks, experimental testing for adequate deductions and findings, could be an expensive and time-intensive process. Therefore, this study proposes utilization of reactive transport modeling to replicate the pore-scale chemo-mechanical reactions and transport processes occurring in silicate-rich shale rocks in the presence of CO2 saturated brine under high pressure and high temperature. For this study, Crunch Tope has been adopted to simulate a one-dimensional reactive transport model of a Permian rock specimen exposed to the acidic brine at a temperature of 100 {\deg}C and pressure of 12.40 MPa (1800 psi) for a period of 14 and 28 days. The results demonstrated significant dissolution followed by precipitation of quartz rich phases, precipitation and swelling of clay rich phases, and dissolution of feldspar rich phases closer to the acidic brine-rock interface. Moreover, porosity against reaction depth curve showed nearly 1.00% mineral precipitation occur at 14 and 28 days, which is insufficient to completely fill the pore spaces.</description>

      <title>Learning Beyond Experience: Generalizing to Unseen State Space with Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors -- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing -- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.</description>

Abstract: An introduction to numerical large-deviation sampling is provided. First, direct biasing with a known distribution is explained. As simple example, the Bernoulli experiment is used throughout the text. Next, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations are introduced. In particular, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is explained. As first implementation of MCMC, sampling of the plain Bernoulli model is shown. Next, an exponential bias is used for the same model, which allows one to obtain the tails of the distribution of a measurable quantity. This approach is generalized to MCMC simulations, where the states are vectors of $U(0,1)$ random entries. This allows one to use the exponential or any other bias to access the large-deviation properties of rather arbitrary random processes. Finally, some recent research applications to study more complex models are discussed.</description>

      <title>Sparse data assimilation for under-resolved large-eddy simulations</title>

Abstract: The need for accurate and fast scale-resolving simulations of fluid flows, where turbulent dispersion is a crucial physical feature, is evident. Large-eddy simulations (LES) are computationally more affordable than direct numerical simulations, but their accuracy depends on sub-grid scale models and the quality of the computational mesh. In order to compensate related errors, a data assimilation approach for LES is devised in this work.
  The presented method is based on variational assimilation of sparse time-averaged velocity reference data. Working with the time-averaged LES momentum equation allows to employ a stationary discrete adjoint method. Therefore, a stationary corrective force in the unsteady LES momentum equation is iteratively updated within the gradient-based optimization framework in conjunction with the adjoint gradient. After data assimilation, corrected anisotropic Reynolds stresses are inferred from the stationary corrective force. Ultimately, this corrective force that acts on the mean velocity is replaced by a term that scales the velocity fluctuations through nudging of the corrected anisotropic Reynolds stresses.
  Efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated for turbulent flow over periodic hills and around a square cylinder. Coarse meshes are leveraged to further enhance the speed of the optimization procedure. Time- and spanwise-averaged velocity reference data from high-fidelity simulations is taken from the literature.
  Our results demonstrate that adjoint-based assimilation of averaged velocity enables the optimization of the mean flow, vortex shedding frequency (i.e., Strouhal number), and anisotropic Reynolds stresses. This highlights the superiority of scale-resolving simulations such as LES over simulations based on the (unsteady) Reynolds-averaged equations.</description>

      <title>Unified Deep Learning Framework for Many-Body Quantum Chemistry via Green's Functions</title>

Abstract: Quantum many-body methods provide a systematic route to computing electronic properties of molecules and materials, but high computational costs restrict their use in large-scale applications. Due to the complexity in many-electron wavefunctions, machine learning models capable of capturing fundamental many-body physics remain limited. Here, we present a deep learning framework targeting the many-body Green's function, which unifies predictions of electronic properties in ground and excited states, while offering physical insights into many-electron correlation effects. By learning the $GW$ or coupled-cluster self-energy from mean-field features, our graph neural network achieves competitive performance in predicting one- and two-particle excitations and quantities derivable from one-particle density matrix. We demonstrate its high data efficiency and good transferability across chemical species, system sizes, molecular conformations, and correlation strengths in bond breaking, through multiple molecular and nanomaterial benchmarks. This work opens up opportunities for utilizing machine learning to solve many-electron problems.</description>

      <title>Wyckoff Transformer: Generation of Symmetric Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02407</link>

Abstract: Crystal symmetry plays a fundamental role in determining its physical, chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength. Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. However, this is often inadequately addressed by existing generative models, making the consistent generation of stable and symmetrically valid crystal structures a significant challenge. We introduce WyFormer, a generative model that directly tackles this by formally conditioning on space group symmetry. It achieves this by using Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer encoder and an absence of positional encoding. Extensive experimentation demonstrates WyFormer's compelling combination of attributes: it achieves best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, incorporates a physics-motivated inductive bias, produces structures with competitive stability, predicts material properties with competitive accuracy even without atomic coordinates, and exhibits unparalleled inference speed.</description>

      <title>Temperature and pressure reconstruction in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection by Lagrangian velocities using PINN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02580</link>

Abstract: Velocity, pressure, and temperature are the key variables for understanding thermal convection, and measuring them all is a complex task. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to reconstruct temperature and pressure fields based on given Lagrangian velocity data. A physics-informed neural network (PINN) based on a multilayer perceptron architecture and a periodic sine activation function is used to reconstruct both the temperature and the pressure for two cases of turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (Pr = 6.9, Ra = $10^9$). The first dataset is generated with DNS and it includes Lagrangian velocity data of 150000 tracer particles. The second contains a PTV experiment with the same system parameters in a water-filled cubic cell, and we observed about 50000 active particle tracks per time step with the open-source framework proPTV. A realistic temperature and pressure field could be reconstructed in both cases, which underlines the importance of PINNs also in the context of experimental data. In the case of the DNS, the reconstructed temperature and pressure fields show a 90\% correlation over all particles when directly validated against the ground truth. Thus, the proposed method, in combination with particle tracking velocimetry, is able to provide velocity, temperature, and pressure fields in convective flows even in the hard turbulence regime. The PINN used in this paper is compatible with proPTV and is part of an open source project. It is available on request at https://github.com/DLR-AS-BOA.</description>

      <title>SESaMo: Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation for Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have recently garnered significant attention across various fields, from physics to chemistry, where sampling from unnormalized Boltzmann-like distributions represents a fundamental challenge. In particular, autoregressive models and normalizing flows have become prominent due to their appealing ability to yield closed-form probability densities. Moreover, it is well-established that incorporating prior knowledge - such as symmetries - into deep neural networks can substantially improve training performances. In this context, recent advances have focused on developing symmetry-equivariant generative models, achieving remarkable results. Building upon these foundations, this paper introduces Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation (SESaMo). Similar to equivariant normalizing flows, SESaMo enables the incorporation of inductive biases (e.g., symmetries) into normalizing flows through a novel technique called stochastic modulation. This approach enhances the flexibility of the generative model, allowing to effectively learn a variety of exact and broken symmetries. Our numerical experiments benchmark SESaMo in different scenarios, including an 8-Gaussian mixture model and physically relevant field theories, such as the $\phi^4$ theory and the Hubbard model.</description>
