      <title>Trickle groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new family of groups, called trickle groups, is presented. These groups generalize right-angled Artin and Coxeter groups, as well as cactus groups. A trickle group is defined by a presentation with relations of the form $xy = zx$ and $x^\mu = 1$, that are governed by a simplicial graph, called a trickle graph, endowed with a partial ordering on the vertices, a vertex labeling, and an automorphism of the star of each vertex. We show several examples of trickle groups, including extended cactus groups, certain finite-index subgroups of virtual cactus groups, Thompson group F, and ordered quandle groups. A terminating and confluent rewriting system is established for trickle groups, enabling the definition of normal forms and a solution to the word problem. An alternative solution to the word problem is also presented, offering a simpler formulation akin to Tits' approach for Coxeter groups and Green's for graph products of cyclic groups. A natural notion of a parabolic subgraph of a trickle graph is introduced. The subgroup generated by the vertices of such a subgraph is called a standard parabolic subgroup and it is shown to be the trickle group associated with the subgraph itself. The intersection of two standard parabolic subgroups is also proven to be a standard parabolic subgroup. If only relations of the form $xy = zx$ are retained in the definition of a trickle group, then the resulting group is called a preGarside trickle group. Such a group is proved to be a preGarside group, a torsion-free group, and a Garside group if and only if its associated trickle graph is finite and complete.</description>

      <title>Counting minimal cutsets and $p_c&lt;1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove two results concerning percolation on general graphs.
  - We establish the converse of the classical Peierls argument: if the critical parameter for (uniform) percolation satisfies $p_c&lt;1$, then the number of minimal cutsets of size $n$ separating a given vertex from infinity is bounded above exponentially in $n$. This resolves a conjecture of Babson and Benjamini from 1999.
  - We prove that $p_c&lt;1$ for every uniformly transient graph. This solves a problem raised by Duminil-Copin, Goswami, Raoufi, Severo and Yadin, and provides a new proof that $p_c&lt;1$ for every transitive graph of superlinear growth.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Elementary Integrability of Polynomial Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prelle and Singer showed in 1983 that if a system of ordinary differential equations defined on a differential field $K$ has a first integral in an elementrary field extension $L$ of $K$, then it must have a first integral consisting of algebraic elements over $K$ via their constant powers and logarithms. Based on this result they further proved that an elementary integrable planar polynomial differential system has an integrating factor which is a fractional power of a rational function. Here we extend their results and prove that any $n$ dimensional elementary integrable polynomial vector field has $n-1$ functionally independent first integrals being composed of algebraic elements over $K$. Furthermore, using the Galois theory we prove that the vector field has a rational Jacobian multiplier.</description>

      <title>Machine Checked Proofs and Programs in Algebraic Combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a library of formalized results around symmetric functions and the character theory of symmetric groups. Written in Coq/Rocq and based on the Mathematical Components library, it covers a large part of the contents of a graduate level textbook in the field. The flagship result is a proof of the Littlewood-Richardson rule, which computes the structure constants of the algebra of symmetric function in the schur basis which are integer numbers appearing in various fields of mathematics, and which has a long history of wrong proofs. A specific feature of algebraic combinatorics is the constant interplay between algorithms and algebraic constructions: algorithms are not only in computations, but also are key ingredients in definitions and proofs. As such, the proof of the Littlewood-Richardson rule deeply relies on the understanding of the execution of the Robinson-Schensted algorithm. Many results in this library are effective and actually used in computer algebra systems, and we discuss their certified implementation.</description>

      <title>Punctured surfaces, quiver mutations, and quotients of Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2011, Barot and Marsh provided an explicit construction of presentation of a finite Weyl group $W$ by any quiver mutation-equivalent to an orientation of a Dynkin diagram with Weyl group $W$. The construction was extended by the authors of the present paper to obtain presentations for all affine Coxeter groups, as well as to construct groups from triangulations of unpunctured surfaces and orbifolds, where the groups are invariant under change of triangulation and thus are presented as quotients of numerous distinct Coxeter groups. We extend the construction to include most punctured surfaces and orbifolds, providing a new invariant for almost all marked surfaces.</description>

      <title>Profinite rigidity witnessed by Dehn fillings of cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any profinite isomorphism between two cusped finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds carries profinite isomorphisms between their Dehn fillings. With this observation, we prove that some cusped finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds are profinitely rigid among all compact, orientable 3-manifolds, through detecting their exceptional Dehn fillings. In addition, we improved a criteria for profinite rigidity of a hyperbolic knot complement or a hyperbolic-type satellite knot complement among compact, orientable 3-manifolds, through examining its characterising slopes. We obtain the following profinitely rigid examples: the complement of the Whitehead link, Whitehead sister link, $\frac{3}{10}$ two-bridge link; specific surgeries on one component of these links; the complement of (full) twist knots $\mathcal{K}_n$, Eudave-Mu\~noz knots $K(3,1,n,0)$, Pretzel knots $P(-3,3,2n+1)$, $5_2$ knot; the Berge manifold, and many more.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of $E_8 (p)$ via its vanishing elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, and $g \in G$. Then $g$ is said to be a vanishing element of $G$, if there exists an irreducible character $\chi$ of $G$ such that $\chi (g)=0$. Denote by ${\rm Vo} (G)$ the set of the orders of vanishing elements of $G$. We say a non-abelian group $G$ is V-recognizable, if any group $N$ with ${\rm Vo} (N) = {\rm Vo} (G)$ is isomorphic to $G$. In this paper, we investigate the V-recognizability of $E_8 (p)$, where $p$ is a prime number. As an application, among the 610 primes $p$ with $p&lt;10000$ and $p \equiv 0,1,4\,(\!\!\!\mod 5)$, we obtain that the method is always valid for confirming the V-recognizability of $E_8 (p)$ for all such $p$ but $ 919,1289,1931,3911,4691,5381$ and $7589 $.</description>

      <title>On generalized covering and avoidance properties of finite groups and saturated fusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00012v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subgroup $A$ of a finite group $G$ is said to be a $CAP$-subgroup of $G$, if for any chief factor $H/K$ of $G$, either $A H= AK$ or $A\cap H = A \cap K$. Let $p$ be a prime, $S$ be a $p$-group and $\mathcal{F}$ be a saturated fusion system over $S$. Then $\mathcal{F}$ is said to be supersolvable, if there exists a series of $S$, namely $1 = S_0 \leq S_1 \leq \cdots \leq S_n = S$, such that $S_{i+1}/S_i$ is cyclic, and $S_i$ is strongly $\mathcal{F}$-closed for any $i=0,1,\cdots,n$. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of strong $p$-$CAP$-subgroups, and investigate the structure of finite groups under the assumptions that some subgroups of $G$ are partial $CAP$-subgroups or strong $(p)$-$CAP$-subgroups of $G$, and obtain some criteria for a group $G$ to be $p$-supersolvable. After that, we investigate the characterizations for supersolvability of $\mathcal{F}_S (G)$ under the assumptions that some subgroups of $G$ are partial $CAP$-subgroups or strong $(p)$-$CAP$-subgroups of $G$, and obtain some criteria for a fusion system $\mathcal{F}_S (G)$ to be supersolvable. The above results improve some known results and develop some new results about $CAP$-subgroups from fusion systems.</description>

      <title>Primitive permutation groups of finite Morley rank and affine type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a review of one of the lines in development of the theory of groups of finite Morley rank. These groups naturally appear in model theory as model-theoretic analogues of Galois groups, therefore their actions and their role as permutation groups is of primary interest. We restrict our story to the study of connected groups of finite Morley rank $G$ acting in a definably primitive way on a set $X$ and containing a definable abelian normal subgroup $V$ which acts on $X$ regularly -- the so-called \emph{primitive groups of affine type}. For reasons explained in the paper, this case plays a central role in the theory.</description>

      <title>On the abscissae of Weil representation zeta functions for procyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A famous conjecture of Chowla on the least primes in arithmetic progressions implies that the abscissa of convergence of the Weil representation zeta function for a procyclic group $G$ only depends on the set $S$ of primes dividing the order of $G$ and that it agrees with the abscissa of the Dedekind zeta function of $\mathbb{Z}[p^{-1}\mid p \not\in S]$. Here we show that these consequences hold unconditionally for random procyclic groups in a suitable model. As a corollary, every real number $1 \leq \beta \leq 2$ is the Weil abscissa of some procyclic group.</description>
