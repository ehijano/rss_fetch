      <title>Quasilattices of the Spectre monotile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Spectre is a family of recently discovered aperiodic monotiles that tile the plane only in non-periodic ways, and novel physical phenomena have been predicted for planar systems made of aperiodic monotiles. It is shown that point decorations of Tile(1,1), the base tile for all Spectres, supports the generation of a large variety of non-periodic quasilattices, in contrast to Bravais-lattices in which all point decorations would be periodic. A lattice generating function is introduced as a mapping from point decorations to quasilattice space, and investigated systematically. It is found that some lattices result from the properties of nearest-neighbor distances of point decorations, and that other lattices show near-periodicity in projections along one of the symmetry axes of the tiling. It is concluded that the lattice generating function can serve as a template for the design of physical potential landscapes that can be controlled by the point decoration as a parameter.</description>
