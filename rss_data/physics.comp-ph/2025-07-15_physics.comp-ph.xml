      <title>Regularized Fluctuating Lattice Boltzmann Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a regularized fluctuating lattice Boltzmann model (Reg-FLBM) for the D3Q27 lattice, which incorporates thermal fluctuations through Hermite-based projections to ensure compliance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. By leveraging the recursive regularization framework, the model achieves thermodynamic consistency for both hydrodynamic and ghost modes. Compared to the conventional single-relaxation.time BGK-FLBM, the Reg-FLBM provides improved stability and a more accurate description of thermal fluctuations. The implementation is optimized for large-scale parallel simulations on GPU-accelerated architectures, enabling systematic investigation of fluctuation-driven phenomena in mesoscale and nanoscale fluid systems.</description>

      <title>Designing quantum chemistry algorithms with Just-In-Time compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce just-in-time (JIT) compilation to the integral kernels for Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) to enhance the efficiency of electron repulsion integral computations. For Coulomb and exchange (JK) matrices, JIT-based algorithms yield a 2x speedup for the small 6-31G* basis set on an NVIDIA A100-80G GPU. By incorporating a novel algorithm designed for orbitals with high angular momentum, the efficiency of JK evaluations with the large def2-TZVPP basis set is improved by up to 4x. The core CUDA implementation is compact, comprising only ~1,000 lines of code, including support for single-precision arithmetic. Furthermore, the single-precision implementation achieves a 3x speedup over the previous state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>An efficient solution algorithm for force-driven continuum and rarefied flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaseous flows under an external force are intrinsically defined by their multi-scale nature due to the large variation of densities along the forcing direction. Devising a numerical method capable of accurately and efficiently solving force-driven cross-scale flow dynamics, encompassing both continuum and rarefied regimes, continues to pose a formidable and enduring challenge. In this work, a novel solution algorithm for multi-scale and non-equilibrium flow transport under an external force is developed based on the Boltzmann-BGK equation. The core innovation lies in the fusion of the Hermite spectral method (employed to characterize non-equilibrium particle distributions) with a multi-scale evolution model (sourced from the unified gas-kinetic scheme), achieving a seamless connection between computational methods and physical models. To accommodate the properties of the spectral-collocation method, a series of collocation points and weights are adapted based on the Gauss-Hermite quadrature. As a result, the computational efficiency of the solution algorithm is significantly improved (up to 50 times) while maintaining comparable accuracy as the classical discrete velocity method. It is demonstrated that the solution algorithm effectively preserves the key structural features of gas-dynamic systems subjected to an external force, e.g., the well-balanced property. Extensive numerical experiments have been performed to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method, including the one-dimensional hydrostatic equilibrium problem, the Sod shock tube, the Fourier flow, the Poiseuille flow, and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem. The proposed methodology can provide substantive theoretical insights into a wide range of engineering challenges involving force-driven multi-scale flows.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Infinite Variance Problem in Fermionic Monte Carlo Simulations: Retrospective Error Remediation and the Exact Bridge Link Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the infinite variance problem in fermionic Monte Carlo simulations, which is widely encountered in areas ranging from condensed matter to nuclear and high-energy physics. The different algorithms, which we broadly refer to as determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), are applied in many situations and differ in details, but they share a foundation in field theory, and often involve fermion determinants whose symmetry properties make the algorithm sign-problem-free. We show that the infinite variance problem arises as the observables computed in DQMC tend to form heavy-tailed distributions. To remedy this issue retrospectively, we introduce a tail-aware error estimation method to correct the otherwise unreliable estimates of confidence intervals. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to perform DQMC calculations that eliminate the infinite variance problem for a broad class of observables. Our approach is an exact bridge link method, which involves a simple and efficient modification to the standard DQMC algorithm. The method introduces no systematic bias and is straightforward to implement with minimal computational overhead. Our results establish a practical and robust solution to the infinite variance problem, with broad implications for improving the reliability of a variety of fundamental fermion simulations.</description>

      <title>Robust Chiral Edge Dynamics of a Kitaev Honeycomb on a Trapped Ion Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, then apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a nonzero Chern number -- a hallmark of topological order -- which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Simulating Three-dimensional Turbulence with Physics-informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent fluid flows are among the most computationally demanding problems in science, requiring enormous computational resources that become prohibitive at high flow speeds. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a radically different approach that trains neural networks directly from physical equations rather than data, offering the potential for continuous, mesh-free solutions. Here we show that appropriately designed PINNs can successfully simulate fully turbulent flows in both two and three dimensions, directly learning solutions to the fundamental fluid equations without traditional computational grids or training data. Our approach combines several algorithmic innovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and advanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning chaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence problems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics including energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses. Our results demonstrate that neural equation solvers can handle complex chaotic systems, opening new possibilities for continuous turbulence modeling that transcends traditional computational limitations.</description>

      <title>Surprisingly High Redundancy in Electronic Structure Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models for electronic structure rely on large datasets generated through expensive Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory simulations. This study reveals a surprisingly high level of redundancy in such datasets across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and complex alloys. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that large, exhaustive datasets are necessary for accurate ML predictions of electronic structure. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy, while a state-of-the-art coverage-based pruning strategy retains chemical accuracy and model generalizability using up to 100-fold less data and reducing training time by threefold or more. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods, which eliminate seemingly redundant data, can catastrophically fail at higher pruning factors, possibly due to the significant reduction in data coverage. This heretofore unexplored high degree of redundancy in electronic structure data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset representative of each material class.</description>

      <title>Spin current generation driven by skyrmion dynamics under magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the spin-current pumped by the skyrmion-host material with the lack of inversion symmetry through the microwave resonance process. The effects of magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves are examined by micromagnetic simulations. Our results reveal two distinct skyrmion phases, designated as SkX type-I and II, which emerge at low ($K_z&lt;0.1$ meV) and high ($K_z&gt;0.1$ meV) magnetic anisotropy constants, respectively, having different characteristics of spin excitations. The SkX type-I exhibits spin dynamics where the resonant frequency of the breathing mode is lying in between the clockwise and counterclockwise gyration modes of Bloch-type skyrmion at a very low anisotropy, and is crossing over the counterclockwise mode at $K_z \sim 0.04$ meV. Meanwhile, the SkX type-II exhibits distinct spin excitations in which the clockwise mode is notably absent, while the counterclockwise modes exist at both low and high resonant frequencies. This suggests that the magnetic anisotropy plays an essential role in the spin dynamics. Furthermore, the resulting spin excitations induce spin currents with exotic features under the polarized microwaves. The spin currents induced, for instance, by low-lying in-plane excitations are strongly enhanced under the left-handed circularly polarized microwaves, but quenched by the right-handed circularly polarized microwaves regardless of the sign of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. These results may pave the way for understanding the non-trivial interplay between magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves in the generation of spin currents by a resonant process.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric-based optical selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical selection rules dictate symmetry-allowed/forbidden transitions, playing a decisive role in engineering exciton quantum states and designing optoelectronic devices. While both the real (quantum metric) and imaginary (Berry curvature) parts of quantum geometry contribute to optical transitions, the conventional theory of optical selection rules in solids incorporates only Berry curvature. Here, we propose quantum metric-based optical selection rules. We unveil a universal quantum metric-oscillator strength correspondence for linear polarization of light and establish valley-contrasted optical selection rules that lock orthogonal linear polarizations to distinct valleys. Tight-binding and first-principles calculations confirm our theory in two models (altermagnet and Kane-Mele) and monolayer $d$-wave altermagnet $\mathrm{V_2SeSO}$. This work provides a quantum metric paradigm for valley-based spintronic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>WellPINN: Accurate Well Representation for Transient Fluid Pressure Diffusion in Subsurface Reservoirs with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate representation of wells is essential for reliable reservoir characterization and simulation of operational scenarios in subsurface flow models. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a promising method for reservoir modeling, offering seamless integration of monitoring data and governing physical equations. However, existing PINN-based studies face major challenges in capturing fluid pressure near wells, particularly during the early stage after injection begins. To address this, we propose WellPINN, a modeling workflow that combines the outputs of multiple sequentially trained PINN models to accurately represent wells. This workflow iteratively approximates the radius of the equivalent well to match the actual well dimensions by decomposing the domain into stepwise shrinking subdomains with a simultaneously reducing equivalent well radius. Our results demonstrate that sequential training of superimposing networks around the pumping well is the first workflow that focuses on accurate inference of fluid pressure from pumping rates throughout the entire injection period, significantly advancing the potential of PINNs for inverse modeling and operational scenario simulations. All data and code for this paper will be made openly available at https://github.com/linuswalter/WellPINN.</description>

      <title>Unexplored Opportunities for Automatic Differentiation in Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of automatic differentiation (AD) applications in astrophysics, identifying domains where gradient-based optimization could provide significant computational advantages. Building on our previous work with GRAF (Gradient-based Radar Ambiguity Functions), which discovered optimal radar waveforms achieving 4x computational speedup by exploring the trade-off space between conflicting objectives, we extend this discovery-oriented approach to astrophysical parameter spaces. While AD has been successfully implemented in several areas including gravitational wave parameter estimation and exoplanet atmospheric retrieval, we identify nine astrophysical domains where, to our knowledge, gradient-based exploration methods remain unexplored despite favorable mathematical structure. These opportunities range from discovering novel solutions to the Einstein field equations in exotic spacetime configurations to systematically exploring parameter spaces in stellar astrophysics and planetary dynamics. We present the mathematical foundations for implementing AD in each domain and propose GRASP (Gradient-based Reconstruction of Astrophysical Systems &amp; Phenomena), a unified framework for differentiable astrophysical computations that transforms traditional optimization problems into systematic exploration of solution spaces. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically delineate unexplored domains in astrophysics suitable for automatic differentiation and to provide a unified, mathematically grounded framework (GRASP) to guide their implementation.</description>

      <title>GeoWarp: An automatically differentiable and GPU-accelerated implicit MPM framework for geomechanics based on NVIDIA Warp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The material point method (MPM), a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian particle method, is increasingly used to simulate large-deformation and history-dependent behavior of geomaterials. While explicit time integration dominates current MPM implementations due to its algorithmic simplicity, such schemes are unsuitable for quasi-static and long-term processes typical in geomechanics. Implicit MPM formulations are free of these limitations but remain less adopted, largely due to the difficulty of computing the Jacobian matrix required for Newton-type solvers, especially when consistent tangent operators should be derived for complex constitutive models. In this paper, we introduce GeoWarp -- an implicit MPM framework for geomechanics built on NVIDIA Warp -- that exploits GPU parallelism and reverse-mode automatic differentiation to compute Jacobians without manual derivation. To enhance efficiency, we develop a sparse Jacobian construction algorithm that leverages the localized particle-grid interactions intrinsic to MPM. The framework is verified through forward and inverse examples in large-deformation elastoplasticity and coupled poromechanics. Results demonstrate that GeoWarp provides a robust, scalable, and extensible platform for differentiable implicit MPM simulation in computational geomechanics.</description>

      <title>On-the-fly machine learning-augmented constrained AIMD to design new routes from glassy carbon to quenchable amorphous diamond with low pressure and temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have enabled large-scale atomic simulations with first-principles accuracy, allowing precise modeling of disordered materials such as glassy carbon (GC). However, conventional ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) cannot effectively capture anisotropic stress effects, which are believed to play a key role in the transformation of GC into amorphous diamond under extreme conditions. In this work, we present an on-the-fly machine learning-augmented constrained AIMD (ML-augmented CAIMD) approach by modifying VASP 6.3.2. Our simulations not only reproduce major experimental features of GC but also provide restrictive synthesis conditions and microscopic insights. We show that GC exhibits unexpectedly high plasticity, with its compressive and shear strengths enhanced by large strains. Under pressure, increasing annealing temperature promotes the formation of quenchable amorphous diamond via enhanced sp3 preservation, but this trend reverses above 2900 K due to thermal graphitization. Under non-hydrostatic compression, GC transforms into a superhard structure sustaining large stress differences, which sharply increase when confining pressure exceeds 40 GPa. Finally, severe rotational shear at 30 GPa induces sp3 fractions up to 80 percent at 300 to 1000 K. A hardened amorphous carbon retaining 64 percent sp3 content is achieved by decompression at 300 K, marking the lowest pressure-temperature route ever predicted. Our ML-augmented CAIMD provides a general framework for modeling structural transformations in disordered materials under anisotropic stresses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present domain-based local pair natural orbital M{\o}ller--Plesset second order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) with Born--von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n boundary (BvK) conditions. The approach is based on well-localised Wannier functions in a LCAO formalism and extends the molecular DLPNO-MP2 implementation Tubromole program package to periodic systems. The PNOs are formed through a PAO-OSV-PNO cascade, using BvK projected atomic orbitals and orbital specific virtuals as intermediaries in an analogous manner to the molecular scheme. Our chargeless and surface-dipole corrected local density fitting approach is shown to be numerically stable and to ensure convergent lattice summations over the periodic images for the two- and three-index Coulomb integrals. Through careful benchmarking, we show that the DLPNO approximations in the BvK-DLPNO-MP2 methods are entirely consistent with those of molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations, and with an alternative periodic approach Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, reported in Paper II of this series. Smooth convergence to the canonical correlation energy with tightening PNO threshold is observed. Reference MP2 correlation energies are provided for a set of 2D and 3D periodic systems using a triple-zeta basis and supercell sizes up to 11$\times$11 and 7$\times$7$\times$7.</description>

      <title>DLPNO-MP2 for Periodic Systems using Megacell Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a domain-based local pair natural orbital M{\o}ller--Plesset second order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) for periodic systems, working within an LCAO formalism within the Tubromole program package. This approach, Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, embeds a supercell correlation treatment within a megacell and does not involve periodic image summation for the Coulomb integrals. Working in a basis of well-localised Wannier functions, periodicity is instead imposed through rigorous translational symmetry of Hamiltonian integrals and wavefunction parameters. The accuracy of the method is validated through comparison with a complementary periodic DLPNO-MP2 method that employs Born--von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n boundary conditions, described in paper I of this series. The PNO approximations are shown to be equivalent in the two approaches and entirely consistent with molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations. The Megacell-DLPNO-MP2 method displays sub-linear scaling with respect to supercell size at the asymptotic limit and example calculations are presented with up to 15000 basis functions in the correlation treatment.</description>

      <title>The new GATE 10 Monte Carlo particle transport simulation software -- Part II: Architecture and innovations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past years, we have developed GATE version 10, a major re-implementation of the long-standing Geant4-based Monte Carlo application for particle and radiation transport simulation in medical physics. This release introduces many new features and significant improvements, most notably a Python-based user interface replacing the legacy static input files. The new functionality of GATE version 10 is described in the part 1 companion paper. The development brought significant challenges. In this paper, we present the solutions that we have developed to overcome these challenges. In particular, we present a modular design that robustly manages the core components of a simulation: particle sources, geometry, physics processes, and data acquisition. The architecture consists of parts written in C++ and Python, which needed to be coupled. We explain how this framework allows for the precise, time-aware generation of primary particles, a critical requirement for accurately modeling positron emission tomography (PET), radionuclide therapies, and prompt-gamma timing systems. We present how GATE 10 handles complex Geant4 physics settings while exposing a simple interface to the user. Furthermore, we describe the technical solutions that facilitate the seamless integration of advanced physics models and variance reduction techniques. The architecture supports sophisticated scoring of physical quantities (such as Linear Energy Transfer and Relative Biological Effectiveness) and is designed for multithreaded execution. The new user interface allows researchers to script complex simulation workflows and directly couple external tools, such as artificial intelligence models for source generation or detector response. By detailing these architectural innovations, we demonstrate how GATE 10 provides a more powerful and flexible tool for research and innovation in medical physics.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Theory of Five- and Six-Phonon Scatterings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order phonon scatterings beyond fourth order remain largely unexplored despite their potential importance in strongly anharmonic materials at elevated temperatures. We develop a theoretical formalism for first-principles calculation of five- and six-phonon scatterings using Green's function techniques based on a diagrammatic formalism, and systematically investigate multi-phonon interactions in Si, MgO, and BaO from room temperature to near melting points. Our calculation reveals dramatically different material-dependent behaviors: while five- and six-phonon processes remain negligible in Si, they become increasingly important in MgO and dominant in BaO near its melting point, where they surpass three- and four-phonon scattering intensity and significantly reduce lattice thermal conductivity. We demonstrate that the strength of higher-order interactions is primarily governed by interatomic force constants, with BaO exhibiting five- and six-phonon scattering rates over one order of magnitude stronger than MgO despite identical crystal structures, due to large scattering phase space arising from softened harmonic interactions. Our work establishes the theoretical foundation for understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials and at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Effects of structural properties of neural networks on machine learning performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, graph-based machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, have garnered significant attention. While some recent studies have started to explore the relationship between the graph structure of neural networks and their predictive performance, they often limit themselves to a narrow range of model networks, particularly lacking mesoscale structures such as communities. Our work advances this area by conducting a more comprehensive investigation, incorporating realistic network structures characterized by heterogeneous degree distributions and community structures, which are typical characteristics of many real networks. These community structures offer a nuanced perspective on network architecture. Our analysis employs model networks such as random and scale-free networks, alongside a comparison with a biological neural network and its subsets for more detailed analysis. We examine the impact of these structural attributes on the performance of image classification tasks. Our findings reveal that structural properties do affect performance to some extent. Specifically, networks featuring coherent, densely interconnected communities demonstrate enhanced learning capabilities. The comparison with the biological neural network emphasizes the relevance of our findings to real-world structures, suggesting an intriguing connection worth further exploration. This study contributes meaningfully to network science and machine learning, providing insights that could inspire the design of more biologically informed neural networks.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Virtual and Physical Laboratories: A Web-Based Interactive Platform for Undergraduate Physics Practicals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the challenges of maintaining hands-on laboratory instruction in undergraduate physics education. In response, we developed and deployed an interactive online physics laboratory platform designed to closely replicate the experimental setups available and curriculum of St. Xavier's College (Autonomous), Kolkata. The platform is designed to closely replicate real experimental arrangements and is aligned with the curriculum, allowing students to prepare effectively before performing physical experiments. Student feedback revealed that 100% of the respondents rated the platform as beneficial (rating 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale) to improve conceptual understanding and increase confidence in conducting physical experiments. Furthermore, all students agreed that having access to the online prelab simulations is advantageous and recommended its regular use. These findings highlight the effectiveness of web-based simulations as a complementary and sustainable resource for physics education.</description>

      <title>The Associated Volume sampling algorithm as an alternative method for the calculation of ionisation cluster size distributions in computational nanodosimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In computational nanodosimetry, Monte Carlo Track Structure (MCTS) simulations are employed to calculate ionisation cluster size distributions (ICSDs), which are crucial for characterising mixed radiation fields at the nanoscale. The Uniform Sampling (US) algorithm, commonly used for this purpose, is inefficient when evaluating ICSDs conditioned on clusters exceeding a given size $\nu$ threshold. This study investigates a more efficient alternative - the Associated Volume (AV) algorithm - against the US approach for computing conditional ICSDs ($\nu \ge 1$) from proton tracks simulated with Geant4-DNA. Two configurations of the AV algorithm were evaluated: the standard AV-Overlap, allowing sensitive volumes to overlap (with a 1/$\nu$ correction), and the novel AV-No Overlap, which prevents overlap. We compared the conditional ICSDs, mean cluster size ($M_1$), complementary cumulative frequencies ($F_k$ for $k \in [2,7]$), and overall execution time per run and per event. Deviations exceeding two standard deviations of the mean difference were considered statistically significant. Although statistically significant differences in ICSDs, $M_1$ and $F_k$ were observed, the relative differences in the AV-Overlap rarely exceeded 5%, whereas the No Overlap configuration they ranged from $\lt$ 1% to approximately 15% at the higher $F_k$. Both AV configurations achieved execution times one to two orders of magnitude shorter than the US algorithm. Our findings indicate that the AV-Overlap algorithm may be a preferred alternative for calculating conditional ICSDs and derived nanodosimetric quantities, offering a substantial gain in computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>Chemistry Beyond the Scale of Exact Diagonalization on a Quantum-Centric Supercomputer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A universal quantum computer can simulate diverse quantum systems, with electronic structure for chemistry offering challenging problems for practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. While current quantum processors have reached this size, deep circuits and large number of measurements lead to prohibitive runtimes for quantum computers in isolation. Here, we demonstrate the use of classical distributed computing to offload all but an intrinsically quantum component of a workflow for electronic structure simulations. Using a Heron superconducting processor and the supercomputer Fugaku, we simulate the ground-state dissociation of N$_2$ and the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, with circuits up to 77 qubits and 10,570 gates. The proposed algorithm processes quantum samples to produce upper bounds for the ground-state energy and sparse approximations to the ground-state wavefunctions. Our results suggest that, for current error rates, a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture can tackle challenging chemistry problems beyond sizes amenable to exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Bridging Simulations and Observations: New Insights into Galaxy Formation Simulations via Out-of-Distribution Detection and Bayesian Model Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations are a powerful tool to advance our understanding of galaxy formation and many simulations model key properties of real galaxies. A question that naturally arises for such simulations in light of high-quality observational data is: How close are the models to reality? Due to the high-dimensionality of the problem, many previous studies evaluate galaxy simulations using simplified summary statistics of physical properties. In this work, we combine simulation-based Bayesian model comparison with a novel misspecification detection technique to compare simulated galaxy images of 6 hydrodynamical models observations. Since cosmological simulations are computationally costly, we address the problem of low simulation budgets by first training a $k$-sparse variational autoencoder (VAE) on the abundant dataset of SDSS images. The VAE learns to extract informative latent embeddings and delineates the typical set of real images. To reveal simulation gaps, we then perform out-of-distribution detection (OOD) based on the logits of classifiers trained on the embeddings of simulated images. Finally, we perform amortized Bayesian model comparison using probabilistic classification, identifying the relatively best-performing model along with partial explanations through SHAP values.</description>

      <title>Shaping Laser Pulses with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High Power Laser (HPL) systems operate in the attoseconds regime -- the shortest timescale ever created by humanity. HPL systems are instrumental in high-energy physics, leveraging ultra-short impulse durations to yield extremely high intensities, which are essential for both practical applications and theoretical advancements in light-matter interactions. Traditionally, the parameters regulating HPL optical performance have been manually tuned by human experts, or optimized using black-box methods that can be computationally demanding. Critically, black box methods rely on stationarity assumptions overlooking complex dynamics in high-energy physics and day-to-day changes in real-world experimental settings, and thus need to be often restarted. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by enabling sequential decision making in non-static settings. This work explores the feasibility of applying DRL to HPL systems, extending the current research by (1) learning a control policy relying solely on non-destructive image observations obtained from readily available diagnostic devices, and (2) retaining performance when the underlying dynamics vary. We evaluate our method across various test dynamics, and observe that DRL effectively enables cross-domain adaptability, coping with dynamics' fluctuations while achieving 90\% of the target intensity in test environments.</description>

      <title>Reducing Self-Interaction Error in Transition-Metal Oxides with Different Exact-Exchange Fractions for Energy and Density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DFT is vital for materials discovery, materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r$^2$SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r$^2$SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r$^2$SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX uses different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX enhances the r$^2$SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+$U$. The O$_2$ overbinding in r$^2$SCAN (~0.3 eV/O$_2$) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN50, minimizing r$^2$SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r$^2$SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r$^2$SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN, which is 10 to 300x faster than r$^2$SCAN10.</description>

      <title>Excitation of Giant Surface Waves During Laser Wake Field Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have detected the presence of very high intensity surface waves that are excited during plasma waveguided laser wakefield acceleration. Wakefield acceleration can be enchanced by the introduction of an ``all optical" plasma waveguide that confines and guides a laser pulse at the optimal intensity over long distances, producing quasimonoenergetic multi-GeV electron bunches. However strong pulses of radio frequency radiation (RF) are also produced, and particle in cell simulations show why: a continuous stream of multi-MeV electrons are also ejected radially from the plasma due to nonlinear wave breaking, and these excite and copropagate coherently with a giant cylindrical Sommerfeld surface wave. Laboratory measurements, simulations, and analytic approximations all converge on a 20 J laser pulse exciting a 1 Joule, 400 GW broadband THz surface wave, with a peak electric field strength of 35 GV/m.</description>

Abstract: Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\"odinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</description>
