      <title>Towards Affordable, Adaptive and Automatic GNN Training on CPU-GPU Heterogeneous Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted due to their strong performance. However, GNN training often relies on expensive, high-performance computing platforms, limiting accessibility for many tasks. Profiling of representative GNN workloads indicates that substantial efficiency gains are possible on resource-constrained devices by fully exploiting available resources. This paper introduces A3GNN, a framework for affordable, adaptive, and automatic GNN training on heterogeneous CPU-GPU platforms. It improves resource usage through locality-aware sampling and fine-grained parallelism scheduling. Moreover, it leverages reinforcement learning to explore the design space and achieve pareto-optimal trade-offs among throughput, memory footprint, and accuracy. Experiments show that A3GNN can bridge the performance gap, allowing seven Nvidia 2080Ti GPUs to outperform two A100 GPUs by up to 1.8X in throughput with minimal accuracy loss.</description>

      <title>From Attention to Disaggregation: Tracing the Evolution of LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models from the Transformer architecture to models with trillions of parameters has shifted the primary bottleneck from model training to real time inference. Deploying these massive models is a complex distributed systems challenge constrained by memory bandwidth, computational throughput, and latency requirements. LLM inference fundamentally requires solving a multi objective optimization problem to minimize latency, maximize throughput, and reduce cost. This paper explores the necessary architectural shift towards disaggregated inference, which applies distributed systems principles such as service decomposition, resource disaggregation, and workload partitioning to overcome the limitations of traditional monolithic GPU clusters. By decoupling the compute intensive prefill phase from the memory intensive decode phase into independently scalable components, this paradigm mitigates resource contention and enables independent optimization of key metrics like Time to First Token and Inter Token Latency.</description>

      <title>Synera: Synergistic LLM Serving across Device and Cloud at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming key components in various mobile operating systems, driving smart applications like interactive chatbots and personal assistants. While bringing enhanced intelligence to mobile ends, their deployment suffers from a set of performance challenges, especially the generation quality degradation and prolonged latency. Prior works have mainly relied on solutions of cloud offloading or on-device Small Language Models (SLMs). However, the former is usually limited by the communication bottleneck, and the latter sacrifices generation quality due to resource constraints. To mitigate these limitations, this paper proposes Synera, a device-cloud synergistic LLM serving system that applies an efficient SLM-LLM synergistic mechanism. Through empirical studies on LLM's unique computing characteristics, Synera identifies a set of underexplored optimization opportunities in device-cloud synergistic LLM inference, including offloading decisions, pipeline stalls, and batching bottlenecks. To translate them into enhanced performance, Synera introduces tailored designs of communication-efficient selective offloading, stall-free parallel inference, and scalable cloud batching. Extensive evaluations with real-world testbeds show that Synera enables 1.20-5.47x better generation quality against competitive baselines with on-par latency performance. Compared with existing cloud serving, Synera achieves 8.2-16.5% lower cloud serving cost on various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing reliability in AI inference services: An empirical study on real production incidents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperscale large language model (LLM) inference places extraordinary demands on cloud systems, where even brief failures can translate into significant user and business impact. To better understand and mitigate these risks, we present one of the first provider-internal, practice-based analysis of LLM inference incidents. We developed a taxonomy and methodology grounded in a year of operational experience, validating it on 156 high-severity incidents, and conducted a focused quantitative study of Apr-Jun 2025 to ensure recency and relevance. Our approach achieves high labeling consistency (Cohen's K ~0.89), identifies dominant failure modes (in our dataset ~60% inference engine failures, within that category ~40% timeouts), and surfaces mitigation levers (~74% auto-detected; ~28% required hotfix). Beyond hotfixes, many incidents were mitigated via traffic routing, node rebalancing, or capacity increase policies, indicating further automation opportunities. We also show how the taxonomy guided targeted strategies such as connection liveness, GPU capacity-aware routing, and per-endpoint isolation and reduced incident impact and accelerated recovery. Finally, we contribute a practitioner-oriented adoption checklist that enables others to replicate our taxonomy, analysis, and automation opportunities in their own systems. This study demonstrates how systematic, empirically grounded analysis of inference operations can drive more reliable and cost-efficient LLM serving at scale.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation of LLMs Inference on Popular Single-board Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for on-device large language model (LLM) inference is driving interest in deploying lightweight, cost-effective AI solutions on edge hardware. Single-board computers (SBCs) such as the Raspberry Pi and Orange Pi offer a promising platform for localized, privacy-preserving inference-but remain underexplored in the context of LLM workloads. In this work, we benchmark the performance of 25 quantized open-source LLMs across three SBCs-Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 5, and Orange Pi 5 Pro-using two inference runtimes: Ollama and Llamafile. We evaluate generation throughput, memory usage, and power consumption under varying CPU configurations, using multiple prompt types to simulate realistic workloads. Our results show that SBCs can reliably support models up to 1.5B parameters, with Llamafile achieving up to 4x higher throughput and 30-40% lower power usage than Ollama. We identify architecture-specific bottlenecks, highlight runtime-level trade-offs, and provide practical deployment recommendations. This study offers the first broad evaluation of LLM inference on SBCs, bridging the gap between high-performance language models and affordable edge computing.</description>

      <title>Network and Systems Performance Characterization of MCP-Enabled LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Context Protocol (MCP) has recently gained increased attention within the AI community for providing a standardized way for large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and services, significantly enhancing their capabilities. However, the inclusion of extensive contextual information, including system prompts, MCP tool definitions, and context histories, in MCP-enabled LLM interactions, dramatically inflates token usage. Given that LLM providers charge based on tokens, these expanded contexts can quickly escalate monetary costs and increase the computational load on LLM services. This paper presents a comprehensive measurement-based analysis of MCP-enabled interactions with LLMs, revealing trade-offs between capability, performance, and cost. We explore how different LLM models and MCP configurations impact key performance metrics such as token efficiency, monetary cost, task completion times, and task success rates, and suggest potential optimizations, including enabling parallel tool calls and implementing robust task abort mechanisms. These findings provide useful insights for developing more efficient, robust, and cost-effective MCP-enabled workflows.</description>

      <title>DynaKV: Enabling Accurate and Efficient Long-Sequence LLM Decoding on Smartphones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the demand for human-like reasoning, multi-turn dialogues, and long-form responses grows, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to support efficient and effective long-sequence decoding. However, due to limited DRAM capacity, long-seuqence LLM decoding on smartphones is constrained by the key-value cache (KVCache), whose memory footprint increases linearly with sequence length. Retrieval-based methods mitigate DRAM pressure by offloading KVCache to flash and retrieving query-relevant entries through cluster-based indexing. Unfortunately, as decoding progresses, KVCache distribution shifts render static or local cluster updates progressively misaligned, excluding essential entries or fetching redundant ones. These issues are further exacerbated by smartphone-specific limitations in bandwidth, IOPS, and memory capacity.
  We propose DynaKV, the first adaptive KVCache management approach that jointly addresses accuracy and efficiency for long-sequence decoding on smartphones. DynaKV integrates three key techniques: (1) Migration-Free Cluster Adaptation, which adaptively splits clusters during retrieval without incurring additional transfers; (2) Continuity-Centric Flash Management, which co-locates correlated entries and clusters and employs a dual-head layout for efficient updates; and (3) Memory-Efficient Cache Design, which virtualizes cache space across DRAM and flash and extends replacement policies to align with cluster-level access patterns. Evaluations demonstrate that DynaKV improves retrieval accuracy and reduces end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art solutions, achieving average gains of $1.38\times$ in accuracy and $1.47\times$ speedups. Furthermore, the insights of DynaKV naturally extend to other long-context workloads and multi-tier memory hierarchies, underscoring its broader applicability.</description>

      <title>HyProv: Hybrid Provenance Management for Scientific Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Provenance plays a crucial role in scientific workflow execution, for instance by providing data for failure analysis, real-time monitoring, or statistics on resource utilization for right-sizing allocations. The workflows themselves, however, become increasingly complex in terms of involved components. Furthermore, they are executed on distributed cluster infrastructures, which makes the real-time collection, integration, and analysis of provenance data challenging. Existing provenance systems struggle to balance scalability, real-time processing, online provenance analytics, and integration across different components and compute resources. Moreover, most provenance solutions are not workflow-aware; by focusing on arbitrary workloads, they miss opportunities for workflow systems where optimization and analysis can exploit the availability of a workflow specification that dictates, to some degree, task execution orders and provides abstractions for physical tasks at a logical level.
  In this paper, we present HyProv, a hybrid provenance management system that combines centralized and federated paradigms to offer scalable, online, and workflow-aware queries over workflow provenance traces. HyProv uses a centralized component for efficient management of the small and stable workflow-specification-specific provenance, and complements this with federated querying over different scalable monitoring and provenance databases for the large-scale execution logs. This enables low-latency access to current execution data. Furthermore, the design supports complex provenance queries, which we exemplify for the workflow system Airflow in combination with the resource manager Kubernetes. Our experiments indicate that HyProv scales to large workflows, answers provenance queries with sub-second latencies, and adds only modest CPU and memory overhead to the cluster.</description>

      <title>Intelligence per Watt: Measuring Intelligence Efficiency of Local AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) queries are predominantly processed by frontier models in centralized cloud infrastructure. Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (&lt;=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%. Third, local accelerators achieve at least 1.4x lower IPW than cloud accelerators running identical models, revealing significant headroom for optimization. These findings demonstrate that local inference can meaningfully redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure, with IPW serving as the critical metric for tracking this transition. We release our IPW profiling harness for systematic intelligence-per-watt benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Generic Algorithm for Universal TDM Communication Over Inter Satellite Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms is a light FL framework, which provides the three generic algorithms: the centralized federated learning, the decentralized federated learning, and the TDM communication (i.e., peer data exchange) in the current time slot. The limitation of the latter is that it allows communication only between pairs of network nodes. This paper presents the new generic algorithm for the universal TDM communication that overcomes this limitation, such that a node can communicate with an arbitrary number of peers (assuming the peers also want to communicate with it). The paper covers: (i) the algorithm's theoretical foundation, (ii) the system design, and (iii) the system validation. The main advantage of the new algorithm is that it supports real-world TDM communications over inter satellite links.</description>

      <title>UniFormer: Unified and Efficient Transformer for Reasoning Across General and Custom Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been largely attributed to their effective and widespread deployment on customised computing platforms, including field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). In the current era, Transformer-based architectures underpin the majority of state-of-the-art (SOTA) larger models that are also increasingly deployed on customised computing hardware for low-power and real-time applications. However, the fundamentally different parallel computation paradigms between general-purpose and customised computing often lead to compromises in model transfer and deployability, which typically come at the cost of complexity, efficiency or accuracy. Moreover, many cross-platform optimisation principles have also remained underexplored in existing studies. This paper introduces UniFormer, a unified and efficient Transformer architecture for both general-purpose and customised computing platforms. By enabling higher parallelism and compute-storage fusion, UniFormer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy and latency on GPUs while exhibiting strong adaptability on FPGAs. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first efficient Transformer work that jointly considers both general-purpose and customised computing architectures.</description>

      <title>ProbSelect: Stochastic Client Selection for GPU-Accelerated Compute Devices in the 3D Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration of edge, cloud and space devices into a unified 3D continuum imposes significant challenges for client selection in federated learning systems. Traditional approaches rely on continuous monitoring and historical data collection, which becomes impractical in dynamic environments where satellites and mobile devices frequently change operational conditions. Furthermore, existing solutions primarily consider CPU-based computation, failing to capture complex characteristics of GPU-accelerated training that is prevalent across the 3D continuum. This paper introduces ProbSelect, a novel approach utilizing analytical modeling and probabilistic forecasting for client selection on GPU-accelerated devices, without requiring historical data or continuous monitoring. We model client selection within user-defined SLOs. Extensive evaluation across diverse GPU architectures and workloads demonstrates that ProbSelect improves SLO compliance by 13.77% on average while achieving 72.5% computational waste reduction compared to baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>\uline{LO}w-c\uline{O}st yet High-\uline{P}erformant \uline{S}parse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication on Arm SME Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse matrix-dense matrix multiplication (SpMM) is a critical kernel in both scientific computing and emerging graph learning workloads. The recent Armv9 architecture introduces Scalable Matrix Extension (SME), enabling tile-based matrix operations with high throughput. However, effectively exploiting both SME and traditional SIMD resources for unstructured sparse workloads remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose LOOPS, a hybrid execution framework that combines row-wise CSR-part with vector-wise BCSR-part layout, enabling cooperative utilization of vector instructions (NEON) and Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) resources. LOOPS supports multi-precision SpMM across FP64, FP32, and FP16 via an adaptive two-level parallelization scheme guided by a lightweight performance model. Experimental results on the entire SuiteSparse on an Apple's M4Pro CPU show that LOOPS achieves average speedups of 9.93$\times$ (FP32)/14.4$\times$ (FP64) against the CPU baseline TACO and 71.3$\times$ (FP32)/54.8$\times$ (FP64) with respect to Armadillo. A comparison of LOOPS running on the same CPU with two GPU methods (cuSPARSE, Magicube) executed on an NVIDIA A100 GPU show average speedups for LOOPS between 19.8$\times$ and 33.5$\times$, depending on the precision. Notably, LOOPS delivers significantly better energy efficiency than the GPU codes on the A100 GPU.</description>

      <title>Gathering in Vertex- and Edge-Transitive Graphs without Multiplicity Detection under Round Robin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of swarm robotics, one of the most studied problem is Gathering. It asks for a distributed algorithm that brings the robots to a common location, not known in advance. We consider the case of robots constrained to move along the edges of a graph under the well-known OBLOT model. Gathering is then accomplished once all the robots occupy a same vertex. Differently from classical settings, we assume: i) the initial configuration may contain multiplicities, i.e. more than one robot may occupy the same vertex; ii) robots cannot detect multiplicities; iii) robots move along the edges of vertex- and edge-transitive graphs, i.e. graphs where all the vertices (and the edges, resp.) belong to a same class of equivalence. To balance somehow such a `hostile' setting, as a scheduler for the activation of the robots, we consider the round-robin, where robots are cyclically activated one at a time.
  We provide some basic impossibility results and we design two different algorithms approaching the Gathering for robots moving on two specific topologies belonging to edge- and vertex-transitive graphs: infinite grids and hypercubes. The two algorithms are both time-optimal and heavily exploit the properties of the underlying topologies. Because of this, we conjecture that no general algorithm can exist for all the solvable cases.</description>

      <title>Priority Matters: Optimising Kubernetes Clusters Usage with Constraint-Based Pod Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed applications employ Kubernetes for scalable, fault-tolerant deployments over computer clusters, where application components run in groups of containers called pods. The scheduler, at the heart of Kubernetes' architecture, determines the placement of pods given their priority and resource requirements on cluster nodes. To quickly allocate pods, the scheduler uses lightweight heuristics that can lead to suboptimal placements and resource fragmentation, preventing allocations of otherwise deployable pods on the available nodes.
  We propose the usage of constraint programming to find the optimal allocation of pods satisfying all their priorities and resource requests. Implementation-wise, our solution comes as a plug-in to the default scheduler that operates as a fallback mechanism when some pods cannot be allocated. Using the OR-Tools constraint solver, our experiments on small-to-mid-sized clusters indicate that, within a 1-second scheduling window, our approach places more higher-priority pods than the default scheduler (possibly demonstrating allocation optimality) in over 44\% of realisable allocation scenarios where the default scheduler fails, while certifying that the default scheduler's placement is already optimal in over 19\% of scenarios. With a 10-second window, our approach improves placements in over 73\% and still certifies that the default scheduler's placement is already optimal in over 19\% of scenarios.</description>

      <title>SemanticForge: Repository-Level Code Generation through Semantic Knowledge Graphs and Constraint Satisfaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed software development by enabling automated code generation, yet they frequently suffer from systematic errors that limit practical deployment. We identify two critical failure modes: \textit{logical hallucination} (incorrect control/data-flow reasoning) and \textit{schematic hallucination} (type mismatches, signature violations, and architectural inconsistencies). These errors stem from the absence of explicit, queryable representations of repository-wide semantics.
  This paper presents \textbf{SemanticForge}, which introduces four fundamental algorithmic advances for semantically-aware code generation: (1) a novel automatic reconciliation algorithm for dual static-dynamic knowledge graphs, unifying compile-time and runtime program semantics; (2) a neural approach that learns to generate structured graph queries from natural language, achieving 73\% precision versus 51\% for traditional retrieval; (3) a novel beam search algorithm with integrated SMT solving, enabling real-time constraint verification during generation rather than post-hoc validation; and (4) an incremental maintenance algorithm that updates knowledge graphs in $O(|\Delta R| \cdot \log n)$ time while maintaining semantic equivalence.</description>

      <title>Parallel Sampling via Autospeculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present parallel algorithms to accelerate sampling via counting in two settings: any-order autoregressive models and denoising diffusion models. An any-order autoregressive model accesses a target distribution $\mu$ on $[q]^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional marginals, while a denoising diffusion model accesses a target distribution $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional means under Gaussian noise. Standard sequential sampling algorithms require $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time to produce a sample from $\mu$ in either setting. We show that, by issuing oracle calls in parallel, the expected sampling time can be reduced to $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$. This improves the previous $\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ bound for any-order autoregressive models and yields the first parallel speedup for diffusion models in the high-accuracy regime, under the relatively mild assumption that the support of $\mu$ is bounded.
  We introduce a novel technique to obtain our results: speculative rejection sampling. This technique leverages an auxiliary ``speculative'' distribution~$\nu$ that approximates~$\mu$ to accelerate sampling. Our technique is inspired by the well-studied ``speculative decoding'' techniques popular in large language models, but differs in key ways. Firstly, we use ``autospeculation,'' namely we build the speculation $\nu$ out of the same oracle that defines~$\mu$. In contrast, speculative decoding typically requires a separate, faster, but potentially less accurate ``draft'' model $\nu$. Secondly, the key differentiating factor in our technique is that we make and accept speculations at a ``sequence'' level rather than at the level of single (or a few) steps. This last fact is key to unlocking our parallel runtime of $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$.</description>

      <title>ACGraph: An Efficient Asynchronous Out-of-Core Graph Processing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs are a ubiquitous data structure in diverse domains such as machine learning, social networks, and data mining. As real-world graphs continue to grow beyond the memory capacity of single machines, out-of-core graph processing systems have emerged as a viable solution. Yet, existing systems that rely on strictly synchronous, iteration-by-iteration execution incur significant overheads. In particular, their scheduling mechanisms lead to I/O inefficiencies, stemming from read and work amplification, and induce costly synchronization stalls hindering sustained disk utilization. To overcome these limitations, we present {\em ACGraph}, a novel asynchronous graph processing system optimized for SSD-based environments with constrained memory resources. ACGraph employs a dynamic, block-centric priority scheduler that adjusts in real time based on workload, along with an online asynchronous worklist that minimizes redundant disk accesses by efficiently reusing active blocks in memory. Moreover, ACGraph unifies asynchronous I/O with computation in a pipelined execution model that maintains sustained I/O activation, and leverages a highly optimized hybrid storage format to expedite access to low-degree vertices. We implement popular graph algorithms, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Weakly Connected Components (WCC), personalized PageRank (PPR), PageRank (PR), and $k$-core on ACGraph and demonstrate that ACGraph substantially outperforms state-of-the-art out-of-core graph processing systems in both runtime and I/O efficiency.</description>

      <title>Foam Segmentation in Wastewater Treatment Plants: A Federated Learning Approach with Segment Anything Model 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foam formation in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs) is a major challenge that can reduce treatment efficiency and increase costs. The ability to automatically examine changes in real-time with respect to the percentage of foam can be of great benefit to the plant. However, large amounts of labeled data are required to train standard Machine Learning (ML) models. The development of these systems is slow due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data. Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization. This research offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs. The findings highlight the significant potential of integrating large-scale foundational models into FL systems to solve real-world industrial challenges characterized by distributed and sensitive data.</description>

      <title>BIPPO: Budget-Aware Independent PPO for Energy-Efficient Federated Learning Services</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising machine learning solution in large-scale IoT systems, guaranteeing load distribution and privacy. However, FL does not natively consider infrastructure efficiency, a critical concern for systems operating in resource-constrained environments. Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based solutions offer improved client selection for FL; however, they do not consider infrastructure challenges, such as resource limitations and device churn. Furthermore, the training of RL methods is often not designed for practical application, as these approaches frequently do not consider generalizability and are not optimized for energy efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), which is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution that improves performance. We evaluate BIPPO on two image classification tasks run in a highly budget-constrained setting, with FL clients training on non-IID data, a challenging context for vanilla FL. The improved sampler of BIPPO enables it to increase the mean accuracy compared to non-RL mechanisms, traditional PPO, and IPPO. In addition, BIPPO only consumes a negligible proportion of the budget, which stays consistent even if the number of clients increases. Overall, BIPPO delivers a performant, stable, scalable, and sustainable solution for client selection in IoT-FL.</description>

      <title>Forgetting Alternation and Blossoms: A New Framework for Fast Matching Augmentation and Its Applications to Sequential/Distributed/Streaming Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding a maximum cardinality matching in a graph is one of the most fundamental problems. An algorithm proposed by Micali and Vazirani (1980) is well-known to solve the problem in $O(m\sqrt{n})$ time, which is still one of the fastest algorithms in general. While the MV algorithm itself is not so complicated and is indeed convincing, its correctness proof is extremely challenging, which can be seen from the history: after the first algorithm paper had appeared in 1980, Vazirani has made several attempts to give a complete proof for more than 40 years. It seems, roughly speaking, caused by the nice but highly complex structure of the shortest alternating paths in general graphs that are deeply intertwined with the so-called (nested) blossoms.
  In this paper, we propose a new structure theorem on the shortest alternating paths in general graphs without taking into the details of blossoms. The high-level idea is to forget the alternation (of matching and non-matching edges) as early as possible. A key ingredient is a notion of alternating base trees (ABTs) introduced by Izumi, Kitamura, and Yamaguchi (2024) to develop a nearly linear-time distributed algorithm. Our structure theorem refines the properties of ABTs exploited in their algorithm, and we also give simpler alternative proofs for them. Based on our structure theorem, we propose a new algorithm, which is slightly slower but more implementable and much easier to confirm its correctness than the MV algorithm.
  As applications of our framework, we also present new $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation algorithms in the distributed and semi-streaming settings. Both algorithms are deterministic, and substantially improve the best known upper bounds on the running time. The algorithms are built on the top of a novel framework of amplifying approximation factors of given matchings, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>TeleRAG: Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation Inference with Lookahead Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) with external data sources to enhance factual correctness and domain coverage. Modern RAG pipelines rely on large datastores, creating a significant system challenge: achieving high throughput and low latency is difficult, especially when GPU memory is limited. To address these challenges, we propose TeleRAG, an efficient inference system that reduces latency and improves throughput with minimal GPU memory requirements. The core innovation of TeleRAG is lookahead retrieval, a prefetching mechanism that predicts required data and transfers them from CPU to GPU in parallel with LLM generation. In addition, TeleRAG adopts a prefetching scheduler and a cache-aware scheduler to support efficient multi-GPU inference with minimal overhead. Evaluations show TeleRAG achieves up to a 1.53x average end-to-end latency reduction (single-query) and 1.83x higher average throughput (batched), as well as good scalability in throughput. This confirms the practical utility of TeleRAG for faster and more memory-efficient deployments of RAG applications.</description>

      <title>ElasticMM: Efficient Multimodal LLMs Serving with Elastic Multimodal Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to handle images, videos, and audio by incorporating feature extractors and projection modules. However, these additional components -- combined with complex inference pipelines and heterogeneous workloads -- introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge. Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor resource utilization. To address this, we introduce Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling; and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by up to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly accelerated progress in code translation, enabling more accurate and efficient transformation across programming languages. While originally developed for natural language processing, LLMs have shown strong capabilities in modeling programming language syntax and semantics, outperforming traditional rule-based systems in both accuracy and flexibility. These models have streamlined cross-language conversion, reduced development overhead, and accelerated legacy code migration. In this paper, we introduce OMPILOT, a novel domain-specific encoder-decoder transformer tailored for translating C++ code into OpenMP, enabling effective shared-memory parallelization. OMPILOT leverages custom pre-training objectives that incorporate the semantics of parallel constructs and combines both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies to improve code translation robustness. Unlike previous work that focused primarily on loop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a wider semantic context. To evaluate our approach, we propose OMPBLEU, a novel composite metric specifically crafted to assess the correctness and quality of OpenMP parallel constructs, addressing limitations in conventional translation metrics.</description>

      <title>FedSEA-LLaMA: A Secure, Efficient and Adaptive Federated Splitting Framework for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15683v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Private data holds promise for improving LLMs due to its high quality, but its scattered distribution across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based federated split models are proposed, which offload most model parameters to the server (or distributed clients) while retaining only a small portion on the client to ensure data privacy. Despite this design, they still face three challenges: 1) Peer-to-peer key encryption struggles to secure transmitted vectors effectively; 2) The auto-regressive nature of LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially, causing high communication overhead; 3) Fixed partition points lack adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FedSEA-LLaMA, a Secure, Efficient, and Adaptive Federated splitting framework based on LLaMA2. First, we inject Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states to enable secure end-to-end vector transmission. Second, we employ attention-mask compression and KV cache collaboration to reduce communication costs, accelerating training and inference. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements. Experiments on natural language understanding, summarization, and conversational QA tasks show that FedSEA-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2 and achieves up to 8x speedups in training and inference. Further analysis of privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the effectiveness of FedSEA-LLaMA in security and adaptability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning, experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for complex systems problems.</description>
