      <title>Mixed Species Charge and Baryon Balance Functions Studies with PYTHIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed species charge and baryon balance functions are computed based on proton--proton (pp) collisions simulated with the PYTHIA8 model. Simulations are performed with selected values of the collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ and the Monash tune and the Ropes and Shoving modes of PYTHIA8 to explore whether such measurements provide useful new information and constraints on mechanisms of particle production in pp collisions. Charge balance functions are studied based on mixed pairs of pions, kaons, and protons, whereas baryon balance functions are computed for mixed low mass strange and non-strange baryons. Both charge and baryon balance functions of mixed particle pairs feature shapes and amplitudes that sensitively depend on the particle considered owing largely to the particle production mechanisms implemented in PYTHIA. The evolution of balance functions integrals with the longitudinal width of the acceptance are presented and one finds that sums of such integrals for a given reference particle obey expected sum rules for both charge and baryon balance functions. Additionally, both types of balance functions are found to evolve in shape and amplitude with increasing collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ and the PYTHIA tunes considered.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Vector-Like Bottom-Quark Models in the Alignment Limit of the 2-Higgs Doublet Model Type-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding upon our ongoing investigation of Vector-Like Quark (VLQ) phenomenology within a 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) framework, in this paper, we complement a previous one dedicated to Vector-Like Top-quarks (VLTs) by studying Vector-Like Bottom-quarks (VLBs), specifically focusing on their behavior in the alignment limit of a Type-II Yukawa structure. We examine the potential for detecting VLBs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and analyze their decay signatures, encompassing both Standard Model (SM) processes and exotic decays. The objective is to differentiate among singlet, doublet, and triplet configurations of VLBs by identifying distinct decay patterns, thereby providing insights into the structure of Beyond the SM (BSM) physics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basing on Mellin-Barnes representations and Miller's transformation, we present the Gel'fand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky (GKZ) hypergeometric systems of 4-loop vacuum Feynman integrals with arbitrary masses. Through the GKZ hypergeometric systems, the analytical hypergeometric solutions of 4-loop vacuum Feynman integrals with arbitrary masses can be obtained in neighborhoods of origin including infinity. The analytical expressions of 4-loop vacuum Feynman integrals can be formulated as a linear combination of the fundamental solution systems in certain convergent region.</description>

      <title>CP-odd window into long distance dynamics in rare semileptonic $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the combined measurements of CP-averaged decay rates and direct CP asymmetries of $B^\pm\to K^\pm \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $B^\pm\to \pi^\pm \ell^+ \ell^-$ to probe (non-local) four-quark operator matrix element contributions to rare semileptonic B meson decays. We also explore how their effects could be in principle disentangled from possible local new physics effects using $U$-spin relations. To this end, we construct a ratio of CP-odd decay rate differences which are exactly predicted within the standard model in the $U$-spin limit, while the leading $U$-spin breaking effects can also be systematically calculated. Our results motivate binned measurements of the direct CP asymmetry in $B^\pm\to \pi^\pm \ell^+ \ell^-$ as well as dedicated theoretical estimates of $U$-spin breaking both in local form factors as well as in four-quark matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Aligned Yet Large Dipoles: a SMEFT Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a non-universal flavor scenario at the level of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, according to which the matrix of Wilson coefficients $c_{uW}$ of an up-type electroweak quark dipole operator is aligned with the up-type Yukawa coupling. Such an alignment usually follows from the assumption of Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV), away from which we step by allowing the entries of $c_{uW}$ to be sizable along the first quark generations. A particular example, which we refer to as ``inverse hierarchy MFV", features Wilson coefficients inversely proportional to quark masses, and arises from BSM models respecting MFV and containing heavy fields that replicate the mass hierarchy of SM quarks. We then analyze the phenomenology driven by $c_{uW}$ at colliders and at lower-energy flavor experiments. We show that precision measurements of the process $pp\rightarrow W h\rightarrow \gamma\gamma\ell\nu$ at FCC-$hh$ could set an upper bound on $|c_{uW}|\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})(\Lambda/{\rm TeV})^{2}$, with $\Lambda$ the cutoff of the effective field theory. This bound is an order of magnitude stronger than the existing LHC bounds. Moreover, we estimate that $W h\rightarrow b\bar b \ell\nu$ at HL-LHC could also give competitive bounds. In the low-energy regime, we consider bounds arising from rare kaon decays, which turn out to be loose, $|c_{uW}^{11}|&lt;\mathcal{O}(1)(\Lambda/{\rm TeV})^{2}$. We finally demonstrate that our flavor and operator assumptions can be derived from a weakly-coupled UV model, which we choose to simultaneously illustrate the UV origin of inverse hierarchy MFV.</description>

      <title>An improved calculation of the $D_{(s)}^*D_{(s)}V$ and $B_{(s)}^*B_{(s)}V$ couplings from light-cone sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improved calculation of the $D_{(s)}^*D_{(s)}V$ and $B_{(s)}^*B_{(s)}V$ coupling constants, where $V$ denotes $\rho$, $K^\ast$, $\omega$, and $\phi$ meson. These couplings govern the QCD long-distance dynamics in interactions between heavy pseudoscalar/vector mesons and light vector mesons. Our analysis is conducted within the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules (LCSRs) by utilizing the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of light vector mesons. By systematically incorporating the subleading power corrections and higher-twist contributions at leading order (LO) and including the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections at leading power, we achieve enhanced accuracy in the light-cone operator product expansion (OPE) for the underlying correlation function. In assessing the reliability of the established LCSRs, we consider uncertainties arising from the choice of the quark-hadron duality region in the double dispersion relation. Building upon these improvements, we accomplish an optimized computation and analysis for the strong coupling constants $g_{H^\ast HV}$ which are used to extract the effective coupling $\lambda$ in the heavy meson chiral perturbation theory (HM$\chi$PT). Furthermore, we investigate the $SU(3)$ flavour symmetry breaking effects in detail and compare our sum rule calculations with previous studies in an exploratory way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deep inelastic scattering data on the nucleon F_2 structure function, accumulated by BCDMS, SLAC and NMC collaborations in fixed-target experiments, are analyzed in the non-singlet approximation within the frameworks of both conventional \overline{\mathbf{MS}} scheme as well as those with resummations of logarithms at large Bjorken x values. The use of the latter is important because they greatly modify the values of the twist four corrections while leaving a strong coupling constant almost intact.</description>

      <title>Improving probes of $hAA$ coupling in the Type-X two Higgs Doublet Model scenario: the crucial role of $\tau$-jet charge identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exotic decay modes of the already discovered 125-GeV scalar into a pair of light pseudoscalars is a good probe of those new physics scenarios where such pseudoscalars exist. Searches in the mass region where the pseudoscalar ($A$) is lighter than 62.5 GeV have yielded null findings so far. No search has yet examined $m_A &gt; 62.5$ GeV where the cross section is suppressed by the off-shell pseudoscalar. We point out a possible enhancement of the sensitivity of probing $hAA$ coupling in the context of a Type-X two Higgs doublet model. We focus on $h\to A A^{(*)} \to 4\tau$, and select events with two same-sign $\tau$-jets along with a pair of same-sign leptons. This enables much more effective background elimination than in the erstwhile proposed channels. Taking two values of the $\tau\tau A$ coupling into account, we obtain limits on the $hAA$ coupling that can be probed at 2$\sigma$ and 3$\sigma$ significance, for $m_A$ ranging up to 85 GeV. For $m_A &lt; 62.5$ GeV, too, we find the probe through our suggested channel exhibits considerable improvement upon the usual $2\mu 2\tau$-based searches conducted at the LHC. Within this region, achieving the reach of $y_{hAA}$ coupling at 3000 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity using our strategy would require approximately $\sim$ 3.6$\times 10^{5}$ fb$^{-1}$ luminosity using conventional $2\mu 2\tau$-based searches.</description>

      <title>Mass and decay of the pentaquark state $QQQn\bar{n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, our main focus is on calculation the mass and partial decay width ratios of the triply heavy pentaquark state \(QQQn\bar{n}(Q=b,c)\). By the MIT bag model, we conduct fitting and variational calculations to obtain the mass spectrum of the \(QQQn\bar{n}\) system. By excluding scattering states based on the color-spin wave functions corresponding to the obtained masses, we derive the partial decay width ratios for the compact pentaquark states and their potential decay products. By analyzing the width ratio of different decay channels, we can get the main decay modes of the studied \(QQQn\bar{n}\) system, and get the specific characteristics of decay channels under different flavor configurations.</description>

      <title>Novel imprint of a dark photon from the 3-3-1-1 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a dark photon that arises from the UV model based upon $SU(3)_C\otimes SU(3)_L\otimes U(1)_X \otimes U(1)_G$ (3-3-1-1) gauge symmetry, where the last three factors enlarge the electroweak symmetry encompassing electric charge $Q=T_3 - 1/ \sqrt{3}T_8 +X$ and dark charge $D = -2/\sqrt{3} T_8 +G$. It is well-established that this model addresses the questions of family number, neutrino mass, and dark matter. It is shown in this work that if the 3-3-1-1 breaking scale is much bigger than the dark charge breaking scale, the relevant dark gauge boson $Z'$ is uniquely imprinted at TeV, avoiding dangerous FCNC processes, obeying precision electroweak measurements, as well as contributing to collider phenomena, even if no kinetic mixing is presented. The dark matter observables are perhaps governed by the dark charge breaking Higgs field instead of the dark photon.</description>

      <title>Absence of strong CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics admits a CP-violating contribution to the action, the $\theta$ term, which is expected to give rise to a nonvanishing electric dipole moment of the neutron. Despite intensive search, no CP violations have been found in the strong interaction. This puzzle is referred to as the strong CP problem. There is evidence that CP is conserved in the confining theory, to the extent that color charges are totally screened for $\theta &gt; 0$ at large distances. It is not immediately obvious that this implies a vanishing dipole moment though. With this Letter I will close the gap. It is shown that in the infinite volume hadron correlation functions decouple from the topological charge, expressed in terms of the zero modes. The reason is that hadrons have a limited range of interaction, while the density of zero modes vanishes with the inverse root of the volume, thus reducing the probability of finding a zero mode in the vicinity to zero. This implies, beyond doubt, that CP is conserved in the strong interaction.</description>

      <title>Scalar Dark Matter and Stability of Higgs Vacuum within a Minimal SO(10) GUT Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we delve to investigate a feasible range of dark matter (DM) masses within a non-supersymmetric $SO(10)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scalar dark matter model, in freeze-out scenario. This model includes a singlet scalar denoted as S and an inert doublet represented by $\phi$. Being part of SO(10), the quantum numbers of DM particles are assigned and hence we know their nature. These fields are odd under a discrete $Z_2$ matter parity $(-1)^{3(B-L)}$. The dark matter with mass 300 $\leq M_{DM} \leq$ 1000 GeV emerges as a mixture of the $Z_2$-odd scalar singlet $S$ and the neutral element of the doublet $\phi$, both residing within a \textbf{16}-dim scalar representation of $SO(10)$. In this work we consider a real scalar \textbf{S} belonging to \textbf{16} of SO(10) as DM. We also investigate the one-loop vacuum stability through the solution of Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) for the model's parameters. Subsequently, we scrutinize the model's predictions within the confines of contemporary theoretical and experimental restrictions. In addition to achieving vacuum stability in the SO(10) framework, the DM mass is found to lie in the previously unaddressed (theoretically) intermediate mass region of 300$\leqslant$ MDM $\leqslant$ 1000 GeV which also adheres to many current phenomenological constraints, like recent direct experimental bounds from XENON1T, indirect detection bounds from Fermi-LAT experiment, Higgs invisible decay and Electroweak Precision Test. The stability of the electroweak vacuum is seen to be present up to the Planck scale. These model predictions possess the potential for future validation through dark matter search experiments, as they are testable in future DM search experiments, along with the added feature that the model is a part of an elegant grand unified theory.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the composition of the single-charm molecular pentaquarks: insights from M1 radiative decays and magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to unravel the composition of the isoscalar $DN$, $D^*N$, $D_1N$, and $D_2^*N$ molecular pentaquarks, this study systematically investigates their electromagnetic properties, including the M1 radiative decays and the magnetic moment properties. Using the constituent quark model and taking into account both the $S$-$D$ wave mixing effect and the coupled channel effect, our analysis yields numerical results indicating that the M1 radiative decays and the magnetic moment properties of these molecular pentaquarks provide some insights into their inner structures. These results can serve as crucial clues for distinguishing their spin-parity quantum numbers and configurations in experimental studies. In addition, we highlight the importance of the electromagnetic properties as key observables for elucidating the inner structures of the observed $\Lambda_c^{+} (2940)$ and $\Lambda_c^{+} (2910)$. We expect that these discoveries will inspire our experimental colleagues to further explore the family of the single-charm molecular pentaquarks and to investigate the inner structures of the $\Lambda_c^{+} (2940)$ and $\Lambda_c^{+} (2910)$ in future studies.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic description of direct photon spectra and elliptic flow in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high energy heavy ion collisions a new state of matter, the strongly coupled quark gluon plasma is formed that exhibits the similar properties as our Universe had just a couple of microseconds after the Big Bang, hence such collisions are usually referred as Little Bangs. Subsequent investigations showed that the created medium is a nearly perfect fluid whose time evolution can be described by hydrodynamic models. The distribution of the hadrons that are created in the freeze-out after a rapid expansion carry information about the final state. On the other hand, with penetrating probes, e.g., with direct photons, one can model the time evolution of the quark gluon plasma. In this paper, we present a hydrodynamic model that was inspired by an analytical solution of relativistic hydrodynamics, calculate the invariant transverse momentum spectrum and the elliptic flow of direct photons and compare our results to LHC ALICE data to obtain the value of the model parameters. Based on the the results we give an estimation for the initial temperature of the plasma.</description>

      <title>The electric dipole moment in a model for neutrino mass, dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric dipole moment is examined in a three-loop neutrino mass model with dark matter originally proposed in Aoki et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 051805 (2009)]. The model contains a $CP$-violating phase in the Higgs potential which plays an important role in electroweak baryogenesis and is thus expected to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe simultaneously. However, such a $CP$-violating phase is severely constrained by the measurements of the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM), and a suppression mechanism for the eEDM is necessary to explain the observed baryon asymmetry while avoiding the constraint. In this paper, we examine neutrino mass, lepton-flavor-violating processes, dark matter, and the eEDM in the model. We show that the eEDM can be suppressed by destructive interference between the $CP$-violating phases in the Higgs sector and the dark sector with large $CP$-violating phases. We propose some benchmark scenarios including $O(1)$ $CP$-violating phases where tiny neutrino mass and dark matter can be explained while avoiding all current experimental and theoretical constraints. These $CP$-violating phases are expected to be large enough to generate the observed baryon asymmetry in the electroweak baryogenesis scenario.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model of proton geometry where the number and size of gluon density hotspots in the proton's thickness function evolves with the resolution scale of the event given by the Mandelstam $t$ variable in exclusive diffractive $ep$ collisions. We use the impact-parameter dependent saturation dipole model bSat/IPSat, as well as its linearised (non-saturated) version bNonSat. In the latter the proton thickness has a clear interpretation as a thickness and in the former it is directly related to the saturation scale. The resulting phenomenological model for the splitting of hotspots, making full use of earlier experimental and phenomenological studies, is able to describe the entire incoherent $t$-spectrum for $|t|&gt;1.1~$GeV$^2$ with a single phenomenological parameter. We use the previously suggested hotspot model as an initial condition for our evolution. The resulting model is a resolution scale-evolution in the same vein as a parton shower.The incoherent cross section is directly proportional to geometrical fluctuations in the proton's inital state. The hotspot evolution give rise to several kinds of event-by-event fluctuations such as in the hotspot number, width and normalization, and saturation scale fluctuations is a direct effect of these. A natural consequence of our resolution based evolution is that the hotspots obtain an effective repulsion. We use our hotspot evolution model to investigate saturation scale effects in the $t$-spectrum, and found that HERA data is not sensitive to this physics.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised learning in particle physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the main applications of unsupervised learning methods in particle physics, i.e., clustering, anomaly detection, detector simulation, and unfolding. Unsupervised methods are ideal for anomaly detection tasks -- machine learning models can be trained on background data to identify deviations if we model the background data precisely. The learning can also be partially unsupervised when we can provide some information about the anomalies at the data level. Generative models are useful in speeding up detector simulations -- they can mimic the computationally intensive task without large resources. They can also efficiently map detector-level data to parton-level data (i.e., data unfolding). In this review, we focus on interesting ideas and connections and briefly overview the underlying techniques wherever necessary.</description>

      <title>Locally finite two-loop amplitudes for electroweak production through gluon fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of two-loop amplitudes for the production of multiple Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons via gluon fusion with exact dependence on quark masses relies primarily on numerical methods. We propose a framework that enables their numerical evaluation in momentum space. The method is inspired by the factorization of infrared divergences in QCD scattering amplitudes. It extends techniques introduced for electroweak gauge boson production from quark-antiquark annihilation to processes with external gluons. By combining diagrammatic integrands, we make use of local cancellations between diagrams that automatically eliminate most non-factoring infrared singularities. With a limited number of counterterms, we then derive two-loop integrands for which all soft and collinear singularities factorize locally. We hope that the local subtraction techniques presented in this article will play a useful role in extending the local factorization formalism to two-loop amplitudes for arbitrary processes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel theory was proposed earlier to model systems with thermal gradients, based on the postulate that the spatial and temporal variation in temperature can be recast as a variation in the metric. Combining the variation in the metric due to the thermal variations and gravity, leads to the concept of thermal gravity in a 5-D space-time-temperature setting. When the 5-D Einstein field equations are projected to a 4-D space, they result in additional terms in the field equations. This may lead to unique phenomena such as the spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar particles in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This theory, originally conceived in a quantum mechanical framework, is now adapted to explain the galaxy rotation curves. A galaxy is not in a state of thermal equilibrium. A parameter called the "degree of thermalization" is introduced to model partially thermalized systems. The generalization of thermal gravity to partially thermalized systems, leads to the theory of many-body gravity. The theory of many-body gravity is now shown to be able to explain the rotation curves of the Milky Way and the M31 (Andromeda) galaxies, to a fair extent. The radial acceleration relation (RAR) for 21 galaxies, with variations spanning three orders of magnitude in galactic mass, is also reproduced.</description>

      <title>Revisiting shear stress tensor evolution: Non-resistive magnetohydrodynamics with momentum-dependent relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to develop second-order relativistic viscous magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) derived from kinetic theory within an extended relaxation time approximation (momentum/energy dependent) for the collision kernel. The investigation involves a detailed examination of shear stress tensor evolution equations and associated transport coefficients. The Boltzmann equation is solved using a Chapman-Enskog-like gradient expansion for a charge-conserved conformal system, incorporating a momentum-dependent relaxation time. The derived relativistic non-resistive, viscous second-order MHD equations for the shear stress tensor reveal significant modifications in the coupling with dissipative charge current and magnetic field due to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time. By utilizing a power law parametrization to quantify the momentum dependence of the relaxation time, the anisotropic magnetic field-dependent shear coefficients in the Navier-Stokes limit have been investigated. The resulting viscous coefficients are seen to be sensitive to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that electric fields in compactified spaces may cause breakdown of four dimensional (4D) effective description of higher-dimensional theory. We consider a charged massless complex scalar coupled to U(1) gauge theory in $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times {\mathbb S}^1$ and discuss the effect of background gauge potential along a compact direction. The electric field produces the charged particle non-perturbatively, which we call Kaluza-Klein (KK) Schwinger effect. We quantitatively show that KK modes can be produced even when the electric field energy is much below the KK scale. The mechanism is rather general and similar phenomena would occur in any compactification models when a gauge potential along compact direction evolves in time and experiences large enough field excursion.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Effective Field Theory of Stochastic Single Field Inflation at NNNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>

      <title>A novel PBH production mechanism from non-Abelian gauge fields during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the case of axion-like particles (ALPs) during inflation. When coupled to a non-Abelian gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term, ALPs support an intriguing, testable, phenomenology with very distinctive features including chiral primordial gravitational waves. For sufficiently small values of the gauge vev and coupling, scalar perturbations in the gauge sector exhibit a known instability. We harness the power of such instability for primordial black hole (PBH) generation. In the case of an axion-inflaton, one is dynamically driven into a strong-backreaction regime that crosses the instability band thereby sourcing a peaked scalar spectrum leading to PBH production and the related scalar-induced gravitational waves. Remarkably, this dynamics is largely insensitive to the initial conditions and the shape of the potential, highlighting the universal nature of the sourcing mechanism. In the case of spectator ALPs one can identify the parameter space that sets off the strong backreaction regime and the ensuing features. We show that spectator ALP models may also access the scalar instability region without triggering strong backreaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of topology in the lattice determination of the renormalized strong coupling via the gradient flow. This is done adopting the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions to deal with the infamous topological freezing problem that affects standard local updating algorithms. We show that, even in the presence of severe topological freezing, both algorithms yield the same strong coupling once projected onto a fixed topological sector. Moreover, we show that using a non-projected definition of the coupling leads to the same step-scaling sequence. This means that projecting the coupling onto a fixed topological sector does not affect the determination of the dynamically-generated scale of the theory $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Effective Field Theory below the Electroweak Scale: Operators and Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:1709.04486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gauge-invariant operators up to dimension six in the low-energy effective field theory below the electroweak scale are classified. There are 70 Hermitian dimension-five and 3631 Hermitian dimension-six operators that conserve baryon and lepton number, as well as $\Delta B= \pm \Delta L = \pm 1$, $\Delta L=\pm 2$, and $\Delta L=\pm 4$ operators. The matching onto these operators from the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) up to order $1/\Lambda^2$ is computed at tree level. SMEFT imposes constraints on the coefficients of the low-energy effective theory, which can be checked experimentally to determine whether the electroweak gauge symmetry is broken by a single fundamental scalar doublet as in SMEFT. Our results, when combined with the one-loop anomalous dimensions of the low-energy theory and the one-loop anomalous dimensions of SMEFT, allow one to compute the low-energy implications of new physics to leading-log accuracy, and combine them consistently with high-energy LHC constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1711.05270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop anomalous dimensions of the low-energy effective Lagrangian below the electroweak scale, up to terms of dimension six. The theory has 70 dimension-five and 3631 dimension-six Hermitian operators that preserve baryon and lepton number, as well as additional operators that violate baryon number and lepton number. The renormalization group equations for the quark and lepton masses and the QCD and QED gauge couplings are modified by dimension-five and dimension-six operator contributions. We compute the renormalization group equations from one insertion of dimension-five and dimension-six operators, as well as two insertions of dimension-five operators, to all terms of dimension less than or equal to six. The use of the equations of motion to eliminate operators can be ambiguous, and we show how to resolve this ambiguity by a careful use of field redefinitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two newly proposed Regge trajectory relations are employed to analyze the heavy-light systems. One of the relations is $M=m_1+m_2+C'+\beta_x\sqrt{x+c_{0x}}$, $(x=l,\,n_r)$. Another reads $M=m_1+C'+\sqrt{\beta_x^2(x+c_{0x})+\frac{4}{3}\sqrt{{\pi}{\beta_x}}m^{3/2}_2(x+c_{0x})^{1/4}}$. $M$ is the bound state mass. $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the heavy constituent and the light constituent, respectively. $l$ is the orbital angular momentum and $n_r$ is the radial quantum number. $\beta_x$ and $c_{0x}$ are fitted. $m_1$, $m_2$ and $C'$ are input parameters. These two formulas consider both of the masses of heavy constituent and light constituent. We find that the heavy-light diquarks, the heavy-light mesons, the heavy-light baryons and the heavy-light tetraquarks satisfy these two formulas. When applying the first formula, the heavy-light systems satisfy the universal description irrespective of both of the masses of the light constituents and the heavy constituent. When using the second relation, the heavy-light systems satisfy the universal description irrespective of the mass of the heavy constituent. The fitted slopes differ distinctively for the heavy-light mesons, baryons and tetraquarks, respectively. When employing the first relation, the average values of $c_{fn_r}$ ($c_{fl}$) are $1.026$, $0.794$ and $0.553$ ($1.026$, $0.749$ and $0.579$) for the heavy-light mesons, the heavy-light baryons and the heavy-light tetraquarks, respectively. Upon application of the second relation, the mean values of $c_{fn_r}$ ($c_{fl}$) are $1.108$, $0.896$ and $0.647$ ($1.114$, $0.855$ and $0.676$) for the heavy-light mesons, the heavy-light baryons and the heavy-light tetraquarks, respectively. Moreover, the fitted results show that the Regge trajectories for the heavy-light systems are concave downwards in the $(M^2,\,n_r)$ and $(M^2,\,l)$ planes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cross sections with angular cuts, an intricate pattern of enhanced higher-order corrections known as non-global logarithms arises. The leading logarithmic terms were computed numerically two decades ago, but the resummation of subleading non-global logarithms remained a challenge that we solve in this Letter using renormalization group methods in effective field theory. To achieve next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, we implement the two-loop anomalous dimension governing the resummation of non-global logarithms into a large-$N_c$ parton shower framework, together with one-loop matching corrections. As a first application, we study the interjet energy flow in $e^+e^-$ annihilation into two jets. We then present, for the first time, resummed predictions at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy for a gap-between-jets observable at hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Ruling out models of vector dark matter in asymptotically safe quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is a problem with too many potential solutions. We investigate whether a consistent embedding into quantum gravity can decimate the number of solutions to the dark-matter problem. Concretely, we focus on a hidden sector composed of a gauge field and a charged scalar, with gauge group U(1)$_{\textmd{D}}$ or SU(2)$_\textmd{D}$. The gauge field is the dark matter candidate, if the gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously. Phenomenological constraints on the couplings in this model arise from requiring that the correct dark matter relic density is produced via thermal freeze-out and that recent bounds from direct-detection experiments are respected. We find that the consistent embedding into asymptotically safe quantum gravity gives rise to additional constraints on the couplings at the Planck scale, from which we calculate corresponding constraints at low energy scales. We discover that phenomenological constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously with theoretical constraints from asymptotically safe quantum gravity, ruling out these dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Contributions of the subprocess $K^*_0(1430) \to K\eta^{\prime}$ in the charmless three-body $B$ meson decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the contributions for $K\eta^{\prime}$ pair originating from the scalar intermediate state $K_0^{*}(1430)$ in the three-body decays $B\to K\eta^{\prime} h$ ($h=\pi, K$) within the perturbative QCD approach. The contribution of $K^*_0(1430)\to K\eta^{\prime}$ is described by the Flatt${\rm \acute{e}}$ formula with coupled channels $K\pi$, $K\eta$ and $K\eta^{\prime}$. The strong coupling constants $g_{K^*_0K\eta^{(\prime)}}$ are extracted from $g_{K^*_0 K\pi}$ within flavor SU$(3)$ symmetry. In spite of the strong depression by phase space near the threshold of $K\eta^\prime$, the $CP$ averaged branching fractions for the $B\to K^*_0(1430) h \to K\eta^\prime h$ decays are predicted to be on the order of $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-5}$, which are non-negligible for the corresponding three-body $B$ decays. Since the K$\eta$ system is almost decoupled from the even-spin strange mesons under flavor SU$(3)$ symmetry, those quasi-two-body $B$ decays with subprocess $K^*_0(1430) \to K \eta$ shall have quite small branching ratios and are not taken into account in this work. We also estimate that the branching fraction for $K_0^{*}(1430)\to K\eta^{\prime}$ is about one fifth of that for $K_0^{*}(1430)\to K\pi$. The predictions for the relevant decays are expected to be tested by the LHCb and Belle-II experiments in the future.</description>

      <title>NNLO QCD corrections to semi-inclusive DIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results for the next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) corrections to the semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering process in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. We consider the quark initiated flavor non-singlet process and obtain the complete contributions analytically at leading color. All relevant virtual and real emission Feynman diagrams have been computed using integration-by-parts reduction to master integrals and two approaches for their subsequent evaluation (parametric phase-space integration and method of differential equations). The numerical analysis demonstrates the significance of the NNLO corrections and their great impact on the reduction of the residual scale dependence.</description>

      <title>The role of electromagnetic interaction in the $X(3872)$ and its analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the electromagnetic interaction in the formation and decay of the $X(3872)$. The binding properties of the $X(3872)$ are studied by assuming the molecular nature and considering the $S$-$D$ wave mixing, isospin breaking, and coupled channel effects, and in particular the correction from the electromagnetic interaction. The radiative decays can better reflect the difference between the charged and neutral $D\bar D^*$ components, since the electromagnetic interaction explicitly breaks the isospin symmetry. We further study the radiative decay widths with the obtained wave functions for different $D\bar D^*$ channels. We also explore other similar hidden-charm molecular states. The electromagnetic interaction can make the molecule tighter. Our result of the radiative decay width for $X(3872)\rightarrow \gamma J/\psi$ is in agreement with the experiment. The branching ratio $R_{\gamma\psi}$ is less than 1 in our framework, which supports the Belle and BESIII measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum detection of new physics in top-quark pair production at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent observation of entanglement between top and anti-top quarks at the LHC opens the way to interpreting collider data with quantum information tools. In this work we investigate the relevance of quantum observables in searches of new physics. To this aim, we study spin correlations of top/anti-top pairs originating from various intermediate resonances, and compare the discovery reach of quantum observables compared to classical ones. We find that they provide complementary information and, in several notable cases, also the additional leverage necessary to detect new effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of finite coupling corrections to the Langevin diffusion coefficients on a moving heavy quark in the Super Yang-Mills plasma is investigated. These corrections are related to curvature squared corrections in the corresponding gravity sector. We compare the results of both longitudinal and perpendicular Langevin diffusion coefficients with those in $\mathcal{N}$=4 Super Yang-Mills plasma. It is observed that the curvature-squared corrections influence the Langevin diffusion coefficients, and the corrections for both Langevin diffusion coefficients demonstrate the dependence on the velocity of the moving heavy quark and the specifics of the higher derivative correction. In addition, we conduct calculations for the Langevin diffusion coefficients of a moving heavy quark within the Gauss-Bonnet background.</description>

      <title>Features of strangeness production in pp and heavy ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the existing experimental data for A-A collisions starting from the AGS energies up to the LHC ones, various systematics related to strange hadrons and anti-hadrons are presented. The ratio between the average transverse momentum and the square root of the total particle multiplicity per unit rapidity and unit transverse overlap area decreases with collision energy for a given centrality or with centrality for a given collision energy, thus supporting the predictions of CGC and percolation based approaches. The dependence on the square root of the total multiplicity per unit rapidity and unit transverse overlap area of the slope and offset extracted from the $\langle p_T\rangle$-particle mass correlation and of the average transverse expansion velocity and kinetic freeze-out temperature parameters obtained from BGBW fits of the pT spectra for strange hadrons is compared to that for pions, kaons and protons. The detailed study of the entropy density dependence of the ratio of strange hadron yields per unit rapidity to the total particle multiplicity per unit rapidity, at different collision energies and centralities, reveals the necessity to study separately strange hadrons and anti-hadrons. The correlation between the ratio of the single- and multi- strange anti-hadron yield per unit rapidity to the total particle multiplicity per unit rapidity and the entropy density is presented as a function of the fireball size. A maximum is evidenced in the similar correlation established for combined and separate species of strange hadrons, at different centralities, in the region where a transition from the baryon-dominated matter to the meson-dominated one takes place. The position of this maximum does not depend on the mass of the corresponding strange hadron. Comparison with pp experimental data reveals another similarity between pp and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze theoretically the coupled-channel meson-baryon interaction with global flavor $\bar c c s s n$ and $\bar c c s s s$, where mesons are pseudoscalars or vectors and baryons have $J ^P=1/2^+$ or $3/2^+$. The aim is to explore whether the nonlinear dynamics inherent in the unitarization process within coupled channels can dynamically generate double- and triple-strange pentaquark-type states ($P_{css}$ and $P_{csss}$ respectively), for which there is no experimental evidence to date. We evaluate the s-wave scattering matrix by implementing unitarity in coupled channels, using potential kernels obtained from t-channel vector meson exchange. The required $PPV$ and $VVV$ vertices are obtained from Lagrangians derived through appropriate extensions of the local hidden gauge symmetry approach to the charm sector, while capitalizing on the symmetry of the spin and flavor wave function to evaluate the $BBV$ vertex. We find four different poles in the double strange sector, some of them degenerate in spin. For the triple-strange channel we find the meson-baryon interaction insufficient to generate a bound or resonance state through the unitary coupled-channel dynamics.</description>

      <title>Beyond (and back to) Palatini quadratic gravity and inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11869v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study single-field slow-roll inflation embedded in Palatini $F(R)$ gravity where $F(R)$ grows faster than $R^2$. Surprisingly, the consistency of the theory requires the Jordan frame inflaton potential to be unbounded from below. Even more surprisingly, this corresponds to an Einstein frame inflaton potential bounded from below and positive definite. We prove that for all such Palatini $F(R)$'s, there exists a universal strong coupling limit corresponding to a quadratic $F(R)$ with the wrong sign for the linear term and a cosmological constant in the Jordan frame. In such a limit, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ does not depend on the original inflaton potential, while the scalar spectral index $n_s$ does. Unfortunately, the system is ill-defined out of the slow-roll regime. A possible way out is to upgrade to a $F(R,X)$ model, with $X$ the Jordan frame inflaton kinetic term. Such a modification essentially leaves the inflationary predictions unaffected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the temporal evolution of quantum mechanical fermionic particles exhibiting one bound state within a one-dimensional attractive square-well potential in a heat bath of bosonic particles. For this open quantum system we formulate the non-equilibrium Kadanoff-Baym equations for the system particles by taking the interactions to be elastic 2-2 scatterings with the heat-bath particles. The corresponding spatially imhomogeneous integro-differential equations for the one-particle Greens's function are solved numerically. We demonstrate how the system particles equilibrate and thermalize with the heat bath and how the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, expressed in the one-particle energy eigenbasis, decohere, so that only the diagonal entries, i.e. the occupation numbers, survive. In addition, the time evolution of the (retarded) Green's function also determines the spectral properties of the various one-particle quantum states.</description>

      <title>An alternative to perturbative renormalization in 3+1 dimensional field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbative renormalization provides the bedrock of understanding quantum field theories. In this work, I point out an alternative way of renormalizing quantum field theories, which is naturally encountered and well known for the case of large N scalar field theories. In terms of bare parameters, this non-perturbative alternative renormalization differs qualitatively from its perturbative cousin: in the continuum limit, the bare coupling constant goes to zero instead of infinity, and there is no wave-function counterterm. Despite these differences, the resulting n-point functions of the theory are finite. I provide explicit results for alternative renormalization for the O(N) model and QCD with $N_f=12$ flavors in 3+1 dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Sun and core-collapse supernovae are leading probes of the neutrino lifetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large distances travelled by neutrinos emitted from the Sun and core-collapse supernovae together with the characteristic energy of such neutrinos provide ideal conditions to probe their lifetime, when the decay products evade detection. We investigate the prospects of probing invisible neutrino decay capitalising on the detection of solar and supernova neutrinos as well as the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) in the next-generation neutrino observatories Hyper-Kamiokande, DUNE, JUNO, DARWIN, and RES-NOVA. We find that future solar neutrino data will be sensitive to values of the lifetime-to-mass ratio $\tau_1/m_1$ and $\tau_2/m_2$ of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1} - 10^{-2})$ s/eV. From a core-collapse supernova explosion at $10$ kpc, lifetime-to-mass ratios of the three mass eigenstates of $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ s/eV could be tested. After $20$ years of data taking, the DSNB would extend the sensitivity reach of $\tau_1/m_1$ to $10^{8}$ s/eV. These results promise an improvement of about $6 -15$ orders of magnitude on the values of the decay parameters with respect to existing limits.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Vision Transformers for Event Classification in High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models based on vision transformer architectures are considered state-of-the-art when it comes to image classification tasks. However, they require extensive computational resources both for training and deployment. The problem is exacerbated as the amount and complexity of the data increases. Quantum-based vision transformer models could potentially alleviate this issue by reducing the training and operating time while maintaining the same predictive power. Although current quantum computers are not yet able to perform high-dimensional tasks yet, they do offer one of the most efficient solutions for the future. In this work, we construct several variations of a quantum hybrid vision transformer for a classification problem in high energy physics (distinguishing photons and electrons in the electromagnetic calorimeter). We test them against classical vision transformer architectures. Our findings indicate that the hybrid models can achieve comparable performance to their classical analogues with a similar number of parameters.</description>
