      <title>No [CII] or dust detection in two Little Red Dots at z$_{\rm spec}$ &gt; 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, point-like sources characterized by their red color and broad Balmer lines, which have been debated to be either dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) or dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Here we report two LRDs (ID9094 and ID2756) at z$_{\rm spec}$&gt;7, recently discovered in the JWST FRESCO GOODS-North field. Both satisfy the "v-shape" colors and compactness criteria for LRDs and are identified as Type-I AGN candidates based on their broad H$\beta$ emission lines (full width at half maximum: 2276$\pm$492 km/s for ID9094 and 1069$\pm$239 km/s for ID2756) and narrow [OI] lines ($\sim$ 300-400 km/s). To investigate their nature, we conduct deep NOEMA follow-up observations targeting the [CII] 158${\rm \mu m}$ emission line and the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We do not detect [CII] or 1.3 mm continuum emission for either source. Notably, in the scenario that the two LRDs were DSFGs, we would expect significant detections: $&gt;16\sigma$ for [CII] and $&gt;3\sigma$ for the 1.3 mm continuum of ID9094, and $&gt;5\sigma$ for [CII] of ID2756. Using the 3$\sigma$ upper limits of [CII] and 1.3 mm, we perform two analyses: (1) UV-to-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with and without AGN components, and (2) comparison of their properties with the L$_{[CII]}$-SFR$_{tot}$ empirical relation. Both analyses indicate that LRDs favor the presence of AGN to explain their observed properties. Our results highlight the importance of far-infrared observations for studying LRDs, a regime that remains largely unexplored.</description>

      <title>PAC in DESI. I. Galaxy Stellar Mass Function into the $10^{6}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Photometric Objects Around Cosmic Webs (PAC) method integrates cosmological photometric and spectroscopic surveys, offering valuable insights into galaxy formation. PAC measures the excess surface density of photometric objects, $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$, with specific physical properties around spectroscopic tracers. In this study, we improve the PAC method to make it more rigorous and eliminate the need for redshift bins. We apply the enhanced PAC method to the DESI Y1 BGS Bright spectroscopic sample and the deep DECaLS photometric sample, obtaining $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$ measurements across the complete stellar mass range, from $10^{5.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for blue galaxies, and from $10^{6.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.9}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for red galaxies. We combine $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$ with $w_{\rm{p}}$ measurements from the BGS sample, which is not necessarily complete in stellar mass. Assuming that galaxy bias is primarily determined by stellar mass and colour, we derive the galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) down to $10^{5.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for blue galaxies and $10^{6.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for red galaxies, while also setting lower limits for smaller masses. The blue and red GSMFs are well described by single and double Schechter functions, respectively, with low-mass end slopes of $\alpha_{\rm{blue}}=-1.54^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ and $\alpha_{\rm{red}}=-2.50^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$, resulting in the dominance of red galaxies below $10^{7.6}{\rm M}_{\odot}$. Stage-IV cosmological photometric surveys, capable of reaching 2-3 magnitudes deeper than DECaLS, present an opportunity to explore the entire galaxy population in the local universe with PAC. This advancement allows us to address critical questions regarding the nature of dark matter, the physics of reionization, and the formation of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Star-formation efficiencies in high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations hint at unexpectedly intense cosmic star-formation in the early Universe, often attributed to enhanced star-formation efficiencies (SFEs). Here, we analyze the SFE in THESAN-ZOOM, a novel zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamic simulation campaign of high-redshift ($z \gtrsim 3$) galaxies employing a state-of-the-art galaxy formation model resolving the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM). The halo-scale SFE ($\epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo}$) - the fraction of baryons accreted by a halo that are converted to stars - follows a double power-law dependence on halo mass, with a mild redshift evolution above $M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{9.5}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$. The power-law slope is roughly $1/3$ at large halo masses, consistent with expectations when gas outflows are momentum-driven. At lower masses, the slope is roughly $2/3$ and is more aligned with the energy-driven outflow scenario. $\epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo}$ is a factor of $2-3$ larger than commonly assumed in empirical galaxy-formation models at $M_{\rm halo} \lesssim 10^{11}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$. On galactic (kpc) scales, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation of neutral gas is universal in THESAN-ZOOM, following $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \propto \Sigma_{\rm gas}^2$, indicative of a turbulent energy balance in the ISM maintained by stellar feedback. The rise of $\epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo}$ with halo mass can be traced primarily to increasing gas surface densities in massive galaxies, while the underlying KS relation and neutral, star-forming gas fraction remain unchanged. Although the increase in $\epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo}$ with redshift is relatively modest, it is sufficient to explain the large observed number density of UV-bright galaxies at $z \gtrsim 12$. However, reproducing the brightest sources at $M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -21$ may require extrapolating the SFE beyond the halo mass range directly covered by THESAN-ZOOM.</description>

      <title>A merging pair of massive quiescent galaxies at $z=3.44$ in the Cosmic Vine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the spectroscopic confirmation of a merging pair of massive quiescent galaxies at $z=3.44$. Using JWST observations, we confirm that the two galaxies lie at a projected separation of 4.5 kpc with a velocity offset of $\sim 680\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}\ (\delta_z \sim 0.01)$. The pair resides in the core of a known rich overdensity of galaxies, dubbed the "Cosmic Vine". For both pair members, modeling of the Spectral Energy Distributions and faint rest-frame optical emission lines indicate high stellar masses ($\log{(M_\star/M_\odot)}\sim10.9$) and suppressed star formation ($\log{\rm (sSFR/yr^{-1})}&lt;-10$), more than an order of magnitude below the level of the star formation main sequence at this redshift. We then explore the Illustris-TNG simulation and the GAEA and SHARK semi-analytical models to examine whether they produce a pair of massive quiescent galaxies akin to that of the Cosmic Vine. While all models produce close pairs of massive quiescent galaxies at $2&lt;z&lt;4$ with comparable separations and velocity offsets, their predicted number densities are $10-80$ times lower than our observational constraint. This discrepancy cannot be fully explained by coarse time sampling in these models or the general challenge of forming early massive quiescent galaxies in simulations. Given that $&gt;90\%$ of simulated pairs in the models that we analyzed merge by $z=0$, our findings suggest that our observed pair will likely coalesce into a single massive galaxy. The merger, occurring in the dense core of a large-scale structure, might represent a critical event in the formation of a brightest cluster galaxy and the morphological transformation of high-redshift disky quiescent galaxies into early-type ellipticals.</description>

      <title>The abundance and origin of cool gas in galaxy clusters in the TNG-Cluster simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to the hot intracluster medium, massive galaxy clusters host complex, multi-phase gaseous halos. In this work, we quantify the abundance, spatial distribution, and origin of the cool T &lt; 10^4.5 K gas within clusters. To do so, we combine the TNG-Cluster and TNG300 cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations, yielding a sample of 632 simulated galaxy clusters at z=0 with masses M_200c ~ 10^14-15.4 solar masses. We find that cool gas is present in every cluster at z=0, although it constitutes only a small fraction of the total gas mass within twice the virial radius, ranging from ~10^-4 to a few per cent. The majority of cool gas resides in the cluster outskirts in infalling satellites and other halos. More rarely, cool gas can also be present in the central regions of clusters. More massive halos contain larger amounts (but not fractions) of cool gas ~10^10-12 solar masses, and we identify correlations between cluster cool gas fraction and several global halo and galaxy properties at fixed halo mass. Using Monte-Carlo Lagrangian tracer particles, we then track the origin of cool gas in present-day clusters. We find that the primary source is recent accretion at z &lt; 0.1, predominantly in the form of pre-cooled gas carried by infalling satellite galaxies and other halos. However, in-situ cooling of the hot intracluster medium gas accreted at earlier epochs also contributes, especially in present-day cool-core clusters.</description>

      <title>Projection-angle effects when "observing" a turbulent magnetized collapsing molecular cloud. I. Chemistry and line transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of our knowledge regarding molecular clouds and the early stages of star formation stems from molecular spectral-line observations. However, the various chemical and radiative-transfer effects, in combination with projection effects, can lead to a distorted view of molecular clouds. Our objective is to simultaneously study all of these effects by creating synthetic spectral-line observations based on a chemo-dynamical simulation of a collapsing molecular cloud. We performed a 3D ideal MHD simulation of a supercritical turbulent collapsing molecular cloud where the dynamical evolution was coupled to a nonequilibrium gas-grain chemical network consisting of 115 species, the evolution of which was governed by &gt;1600 chemical reactions. We post-processed this simulation with a multilevel non-LTE radiative-transfer code to produce synthetic PPV data cubes of the CO, HCO+, HCN, and N2H+ (J = 1-0) transitions under various projection angles with respect to the mean component of the magnetic field. We find that the chemical abundances of various species in our simulated cloud tend to be over-predicted in comparison to observationally derived abundances and attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the cloud collapses rapidly and therefore the various species do not have enough time to deplete onto dust grains. This suggests that our initial conditions may not correspond to the initial conditions of real molecular clouds and cores. We show that the projection angle has a notable effect on the moment maps of the species for which we produced synthetic observations. Specifically, the integrated emission and velocity dispersion of CO, HCO+, and HCN are higher when the cloud is observed "face on" compared to "edge on," whereas column density maps exhibit an opposite trend. Finally, we show that only N2H+ is an accurate tracer of the column density of the cloud across all projection angles.</description>

      <title>X-ray cavities in TNG-Cluster: a direct comparison to observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations, produce a diverse population of X-ray cavities in the intracluster medium (ICM) of simulated galaxy clusters. These arise from episodic, high velocity, kinetic energy injections from the central active supermassive black hole (AGN, SMBH). Here, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of X-ray cavities in TNG-Cluster with observational data. First, we select a volume-limited sample of 35 real clusters ($z \leq 0.071$, M$_\text{500c}$ = 10$^{14-14.8}$ M$_\odot$) observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, identify 3 analogs for each in TNG-Cluster (total of 105) and generate mock Chandra images using same exposure times as their observed counterparts. We identify X-ray cavities and measure their properties in both datasets using identical techniques, ensuring a direct, apples-to-apples comparison. Our analysis reveals that both samples have a similar fraction of X-ray cavities (35-43 per cent). They exhibit comparable sizes and morphologies, although the sizes of simulated X-ray cavities still attached to the SMBH are somewhat larger in TNG-Cluster -- a scarcity at $&lt; 10$ kpc. The area of TNG X-ray cavities increases as they rise in the ICM, consistent with the trend seen in the observational sample. The cavity powers, estimated using observational techniques, show good agreement between the two samples (10$^{42-45}$ erg.s$^{-1}$), suggesting that X-ray cavities in the simulation are an important heating mechanism in cluster cores. Overall, the rather simple AGN feedback model of TNG, with no model choices made to reproduce X-ray morphological features, and without cosmic rays, creates a quantitatively realistic population of X-ray cavities at cluster scales.</description>

      <title>Can primordial black holes explain the overabundance of bright super-early galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST is detecting an excess of high-redshift ($z\gtrsim 10$), bright galaxies challenging most theoretical predictions. To address this issue, we investigate the impact of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) on the halo mass function and UV luminosity function (LF) of super-early galaxies. We explore two key effects: (i) the enhancement of massive halos abundance due to the compact nature and spatial distribution of PBHs, and (ii) the luminosity boost, characterized by the Eddington ratio $\lambda_E$, due to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) powered by matter accretion onto PBHs. We build an effective model, calibrated using data at lower redshifts ($z\approx 4-9$), to derive the evolution of the LF including the additional PBH contribution. Via Bayesian analysis, we find that: (a) Although a small fraction ($\log f_{\rm PBH} \approx -5.42$) of massive ($\log M_{\rm PBH} / {\rm M_{\odot}} \approx 8.37$), non-emitting ($\lambda_E=0$) PBHs can explain the galaxy excess via the halo abundance enhancement, this solution is excluded by CMB $\mu$-distortion constraints on monochromatic PBHs. (b) If PBHs power an AGN emitting at super-Eddington luminosity ($\lambda_E \approx 10$), the observed LF can be reproduced by a PBH population with characteristic mass $\log M_{\rm PBH} / {\rm M_{\odot}} \approx 3.69$ constituting a tiny ($\log f_{\rm PBH} \approx -8.16$) fraction of the cosmic dark matter content. In the AGN scenario, about 75% of the observed galaxies with ${\rm M_{UV}}=-21$ at $z=11$ should host a PBH-powered AGN and typically reside in low mass halos, $M_h = 10^{8-9} {\rm M_{\odot}}$. These predictions can be tested with available and forthcoming JWST spectroscopic data. We note that our analysis considers a lognormal PBH mass function and compares its parameters with monochromatic limits on PBH abundance. Further work is required to relax such limitations.</description>

      <title>What Drives Cluster Cool-Core Transformations? A Population Level Analysis of TNG-Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the frequency and physical drivers of transformations from cool-core (CC) to non-cool-core (NCC) clusters, and vice versa, in a sample of 352 massive galaxy clusters (M_vir = 10^14-15.3 M_sun) from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation of galaxies. By identifying transformations based on the evolution of central entropy and focusing on z&lt;2.5, we find that clusters frequently undergo such events, depending on their assembly and supermassive black hole histories. On average, clusters experience 2 to 3 transformations. Transformations can occur in both directions and can be temporary, but those to higher entropy cores, i.e. in the direction from CC to NCC states, are the vast majority. CC phases are shorter than NCC phases, and thus overall the TNG-Cluster population forms with low-entropy cores and moves towards NCC states with time. We study the role that mergers play in driving transformations, and find that mergers within ~1Gyr prior to a transformation toward higher (but not lower) entropy cores occur statistically more often than in a random control sample. Most importantly, we find examples of mergers associated with CC disruption regardless of their mass ratio or angular momentum. However, past merger activity is not a good predictor for z=0 CC status, at least based on core entropy, even though clusters undergoing more mergers eventually have the highest core entropy values at z=0. We consider the interplay between AGN feedback and evolving cluster core thermodynamics. We find that core transformations are accompanied by an increase in AGN activity, whereby frequent and repeated (kinetic) energy injections from the central SMBHs can produce a collective, long-term impact on central entropy, ultimately heating cluster cores. Whether such fast-paced periods of AGN activity are triggered by mergers is plausible, but not necessary.</description>

      <title>Projection-angle effects when "observing" a turbulent magnetized collapsing molecular cloud. II. Magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar magnetic fields are thought to play a fundamental role in the evolution of star-forming regions. Polarized thermal dust emission serves as a key probe for understanding the structure of the POS component of the magnetic field. However, inclination effects can significantly influence the apparent morphology of the magnetic field and lead to erroneous conclusions regarding its dynamical importance. Our aim is to investigate how projection-angle effects impact dust polarization maps and to explore new ways for accessing the inclination angle of the mean component of the magnetic field with respect to the POS. We post-processed a 3D ideal MHD simulation of a turbulent collapsing molecular cloud and produced synthetic dust polarization measurements under various projection angles, ranging from "face-on" (i.e., viewed along the mean magnetic field direction) to "edge-on" (perpendicular to the mean magnetic field direction). Additionally, we used synthetic PPV data cubes from the CO (J = 1-0) transition, presented in a companion paper. The projected magnetic-field morphology is found to be highly affected by the projection angle with the hourglass morphology being clearly visible only for projection angles close to edge-on. We find that the direction of the apparent "flow" between successive velocity channels in the simulated PPV data cubes shows an increasing correlation with the synthetic dust polarization observations, as the cloud is observed closer to an edge-on orientation. Based on this property, we developed a new method to probe the inclination angle of the magnetic field relative to the POS. We validated our approach by generating additional synthetic data (PPV cubes and polarization maps) at an earlier stage of the cloud's evolution and demonstrated an excellent quantitative agreement between the derived inclination angle and the true observational angle.</description>

      <title>Forming the local starburst galaxy Haro 11 through hydrodynamical merger simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haro 11 is the closest known Lyman continuum leaking galaxy and serves as an important laboratory for studying the escape of Lyman continuum radiation. The galaxy is a metal-poor, starburst galaxy believed to be undergoing a merger that might help facilitate the escape of radiation. In this study, we carry out a large suite of numerical simulations of a merger between two disc galaxies, to study possible origins of Haro 11 and understand under which conditions various features of the galaxy are formed. By varying galaxy parameters describing the orbital configurations, masses, and their inclination, we perform a total of ~500 simulations. We demonstrate that a two-disc galaxy merger is able to reproduce key, observed features of Haro 11, including its morphology, gas kinematics, star formation history, and stellar population ages and masses. We also find that small parameter variations have minimal impact on the orbits and resulting galaxy properties. In particular, we present a fiducial Haro 11 model that produces the single observed tidal tail, the presence of three stellar knots, and inner gas morphology and kinematics. By performing mock observations, we compare with the results of observational data and discuss possible origins for various features. Furthermore, we present newly gathered observational data that confirms the presence of a stellar tidal tail with similar length and direction as our simulations.</description>

      <title>The temperature and metallicity distributions of the ICM: insights with TNG-Cluster for XRISM-like observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new era of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy will significantly improve our understanding of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) by providing precise constraints on its underlying physical properties. However, spectral fitting requires reasonable assumptions on the thermal and chemical distributions of the gas. We use the output of TNG-Cluster, the newest addition to the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations, to provide theoretical expectations for the multi-phase nature of the ICM across hundreds of z=0 clusters (M$_{500c}$ = 10$^{14.0-15.3}$ M$_\odot$) based upon a realistic model for galaxy formation and evolution. We create and analyse, in an observer-like manner, end-to-end XRISM/Resolve mock observations towards cluster centres. We then systematically compare the intrinsic properties of the simulated gas with the inferred ones from spectral fitting via a variety of commonly used spectral-emission models. Our analysis suggests that models with a distribution of temperatures, such as bvlognorm and bvgadem, better describe the complex thermal structure of the ICM, as predicted by TNG-Cluster, but incur biases of 0.5-2 keV (16th-84th percentiles). The 1T bvapec is too simplistic for the predicted broad temperature distributions, while a 2T double bvapec model systematically fails to capture the input temperature structure. However, all spectral emission models systematically underestimate the Fe abundance of the central ICM by ~0.1 Solar (~ 20 per cent) primarily due to projection effects. Selecting only strong cool core clusters leads to minor improvements on inference quality, removing the majority of outliers but maintaining similar overall biases and cluster-to-cluster scatter.</description>

      <title>Gas outflows in two recently quenched galaxies at z = 4 and 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outflows are a key element in the baryon cycle of galaxies, and their properties provide a fundamental test for our models of how star formation quenches in galaxies. Here we report the detection of outflowing gas in two recently quenched, massive ($M_\star\sim10^{10.2}M_\odot$) galaxies at z=4.106 (NS_274) and z=7.276 (RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The outflows are traced by blue-shifted MgII absorption lines, and in the case of the z=4.1 system, also by FeII and NaI features. The spectra of the two sources are similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer features and minimal star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack of bright emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and radiatively efficient AGN. The galaxies' SFHs are consistent with an abrupt quenching of star formation, which continued at rates of $\sim15\,M_\odot$/yr averaged over 100 Myr timescales. Dedicated millimeter observations of NS_274 constrain its dust obscured SFR to $&lt;12\,M_\odot$/yr. Under simple geometrical assumptions, we derive mass loading factors $\lesssim1$ and $\sim50$ for the z=4.1 and z=7.3 systems, respectively, and similarly different energies carried by the outflows. Supernovae feedback can account for the mass and energy of the outflow in NS_274. However, the low mass loading factor and average gas velocity suggest that the observed outflow is unlikely to be the reason behind its quenching. SF-related processes seem to be insufficient to explain the extreme mass outflow rate of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7, which would require an additional ejective mechanism such as an undetected AGN. Finally, the average outflow velocities per unit $M_\star$, SFR, or its surface area are consistent with those of lower-redshift post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that outflows in rapidly quenched galaxies might occur similarly across cosmic time.

      <title>SPYGLASS. VI. Feedback-Driven Star Formation in the Circinus Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young associations provide a record that traces the star formation process, and the youngest populations connect progenitor gas dynamics to the resulting stellar populations. We therefore conduct the first comprehensive overview of the Circinus Complex, an under-studied and massive ($\sim$1500 M$_{\odot}$) region consisting of approximately 3100 recently formed stars alongside the Circinus Molecular Cloud (CMC). We find a clear age pattern in the contiguous central region (CirCe), where younger stars are found further from the massive central cluster, and where the velocities are consistent with uniform expansion. By comparing this structure to an analogous STARFORGE simulation, we find that the age structure and dynamics of the association are consistent with star formation in two stages: the global collapse of the parent cloud that builds the $500 M_{\odot}$ central cluster ASCC 79, followed by triggered star formation in a shell swept up after the first massive stars form. We also find that filaments with a range of distances from the central cluster can naturally produce multi-generational age sequences due to differences in feedback strength and exposure. Outlying populations show velocities consistent with formation independent from the CirCe region, but with similar enough velocities that they may be difficult to distinguish from one another later in their expansion. We therefore provide a new alternative view of sequential star formation that relies on feedback from a single central cluster rather than the multiple sequential generations that are traditionally invoked, while also providing insight into the star formation history of older populations.</description>

      <title>A confirmed deficit of hot and cold dust emission in the most luminous Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminous broad H$\alpha$ emission and red rest-optical SEDs are the hallmark of compact Little Red Dots (LRDs), implying highly attenuated dusty starbursts and/or obscured active galactic nuclei. However, the lack of observed FIR emission has proved difficult to reconcile with the implied attenuated luminosity in these models. Here, we utilize deep new ALMA imaging, new and existing JWST/MIRI imaging, and archival Spitzer/Herschel imaging of two of the rest-optically brightest LRDs ($z=3.1$ and $z=4.47$) to place the strongest constraints on the IR luminosity in LRDs to date. The detections at $\lambda_\mathrm{rest}=1-4 \ \mu$m imply flat slopes in the rest-IR, ruling out a contribution from hot ($T\gtrsim500$ K) dust. Similarly, FIR non-detections rule out any appreciable cold ($T\lesssim75$ K) dust component. Assuming energy balance, these observations are inconsistent with the typical FIR dust emission of dusty starbursts and quasar torii, which usually show a mixture of cold and hot dust. Additionally, our [$\mathrm{C}_{II}$] non-detections rule out typical dusty starbursts. We compute empirical maximum IR SEDs and find that both LRDs must have $\log(L_\mathrm{IR}/L_\odot) \lesssim 12.2$ at the $3\sigma$ level. These limits are in tension with the predictions of rest-optical spectrophotometric fits, be they galaxy only, AGN only, or composite. It is unlikely that LRDs are highly dust-reddened intrinsically blue sources with a dust temperature distribution that conspires to avoid current observing facilities. Rather, we favor an intrinsically redder LRD SED model that alleviates the need for strong dust attenuation.</description>

      <title>Discovery of A Low-mass Strong-lens System in SMACS J0723.3-7327</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an intriguing, low-mass galaxy-scale strong-lens system in the SMACS J0723.3-7327 galaxy cluster. By modeling James Webb Space Telescope imaging and Very Large Telescope Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer spectroscopic data, we find that the lens is cluster member galaxy at $z=0.397$ with an Einstein radius of $0^{\prime \prime}.424$ $\pm$ $0^{\prime \prime}.012$, stellar mass of $M_* = (3.3 \pm 0.8) \times 10^{10} M_\odot$, half-light radius of $\sim 1$ kpc, and central stellar velocity dispersion of $140 \pm 6$ km s$^{-1}$. This lens galaxy is one of the few strong lens galaxies known to date that have stellar mass as low as $M_* \sim 10^{10.5} M_\odot$, offering an exceptional opportunity to peek into the population of low-mass galaxies that has largely remained unexplored in the context of strong-lensing studies. This strong lens system can also assist in assessing the systematic uncertainty in the lens modeling of cluster member galaxies.</description>

      <title>The brightest X-ray AGNs at redshift $3\lesssim z \lesssim 6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given recent X-ray observations of high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we consider whether the extreme luminosities of these AGNs are consistent with current semi-analytical models. In particular, we apply extreme-value statistics (EVS) to obtain predictions of extreme X-ray luminosities of AGNs in the redshift range $3\lesssim z\lesssim 6$. We apply this formalism using different X-ray luminosity functions and compare the predicted extreme luminosities to AGNs in the Stripe-82 X-ray catalogue. We find a general consistency between data and the EVS predictions although there is some tension with certain luminosity functions. In addition, the extreme X-ray luminosities are found to be at least an order of magnitude below the Eddington luminosity limit. We discuss possible extensions to this model, including extrapolating our results to even higher redshifts ($z\gtrsim10$) where AGNs have recently been observed.</description>

      <title>Supernova remnant candidates identified using MWA Galactic Plane Monitoring over 285deg &lt; l &lt; 70deg and |b| &lt; 16deg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) are crucial to understanding supernova explosion mechanisms and their impact on our Galaxy's evolution. SNRs are usually identified by searching for extended, circular structures in all-sky surveys. However, the resolution and sensitivity of any given survey results in selection biases related to the brightness and angular scale of a subset of the total SNR population. As a result, we have only identified 1/3 of the expected number of SNRs in our Galaxy. We used data collected by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) to perform a visual search for SNR candidates over 285deg &lt; l &lt; 70deg and |b| &lt; 16deg. We then used the Widefield Infrared Survey Explorer to eliminate likely HII regions from our SNR candidate sample. By exploiting the resolution and sensitivity of MWA data, we have successfully detected 10 new candidates using our proposed method. In addition, our method has also enabled us to detect and verify 10 previously known but unconfirmed candidates. The 20 SNR candidates described in the paper will increase the known SNR population in the Galaxy by 7{\%}.</description>

      <title>SDSS-IV MaNGA: Spatial Evolution of Gas-Phase Metallicity Changes Induced by Galaxy Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas-phase metallicity in interacting and merging galaxies offers key insights into their star formation processes and evolutionary histories. This study investigates the spatial evolution of gas-phase metallicity (i.e, oxygen abundance, 12 $+$ log(O/H)) in these galaxies using integral field unit (IFU) data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey, focusing on changes in metallicity gradients across different stages of interactions -- from early encounters to final coalescence. By comparing interacting and merging galaxies with isolated counterparts, we identify characteristic trends in how interactions influence metallicity gradients over time. Our analysis reveals that metallicity gradients typically flatten shortly after the first pericenter passage, likely due to radial gas mixing, with later stages showing either metallicity enrichment or dilution depending on the intensity of the interaction and star formation activity. These changes can result in gradients that are either flatter or steeper than the initial profiles. Notably, we observe steeper metallicity gradients in interacting galaxies at certain merger stages, which is inconsistent with predictions from some galaxy simulations. This discrepancy emphasizes the complexity of galaxy interactions. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into how galaxy interactions reshape metallicity distribution, enhancing our understanding of the processes driving galaxy evolution during mergers.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Milky Way in 5-D with 170 Million Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present "augustus", a catalog of distance, extinction, and stellar parameter estimates to 170 million stars from $14\,{\rm mag} &lt; r &lt; 20\,{\rm mag}$ and with $|b| &gt; 10^\circ$ drawing on a combination of optical to near-IR photometry from Pan-STARRS, 2MASS, UKIDSS, and unWISE along with parallax measurements from \textit{Gaia} DR2 and 3-D dust extinction maps. After applying quality cuts, we find 125 million objects have "high-quality" posteriors with statistical distance uncertainties of $\lesssim 10\%$ for objects with well-constrained stellar types. This is a substantial improvement over distance estimates derived from Gaia parallaxes alone and in line with results from previous work. We find the fits are able to accurately reproduce the de-reddened Gaia color-magnitude diagram, which serves as a useful consistency check of our results. We show that we are able to clearly detect large, kinematically-coherent substructures in our data relative to the input priors, including the Monoceros Ring and the Sagittarius stream, attesting to the quality of the catalog. Our results are publicly available at doi:10.7910/DVN/WYMSXV. An accompanying interactive visualization can be found at http://allsky.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com.</description>

      <title>Deuterated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the Interstellar Medium: Constraints from the Orion Bar as Observed by the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas-phase abundances of deuterium (D) in the local interstellar medium (ISM) exhibit considerable regional variations. Particularly, in some regions the gas-phase D abundances are substantially lower than the primordial D abundance generated in the Big Bang, after subtracting the astration reduction caused by the Galactic chemical evolution. Deuterated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have been suggested as a potential reservoir of the D atoms missing from the gas-phase. Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope's Near Infrared Spectrograph have revealed the widespread of deuterated PAHs in the Orion Bar through their aliphatic C--D emission at 4.65${\,{\rm \mu m}}$ and possibly aromatic C--D emission at 4.4${\,{\rm \mu m}}$ as well. To examine the viability of deuterated PAHs as the D reservoir, we model the infrared (IR) emission spectra of small PAH molecules containing various aromatic and aliphatic D atoms in the Orion Bar. We find that small deuterated PAHs exhibit a noticeable emission band at 4.4 or 4.65${\,{\rm \mu m}}$ even if they contain only one aromatic or aliphatic D atom. We derive ${{N_{\rm D,ali}}}/{N_{\rm H}}\approx3.4\%$, the deuteration degree of PAHs measured as the number of aliphatic D atoms (relative to H), from the observed intensity ratios of the 4.65${\,{\rm \mu m}}$ band to the 3.3${\,{\rm \mu m}}$ aromatic C--H band. The deuteration degree for aromatically-deuterated PAHs is less certain as C--N stretch also contributes to the observed emission around 4.4${\,{\rm \mu m}}$. If we attribute it exclusively to aromatic C--D, we derive an upper limit of $\approx14\%$ on the deuteration degree, which is capable of accounting for an appreciable fraction of the missing D budget.</description>

      <title>The large-scale structure supplies the formation of gas-star misaligned galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the integral field unit data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, we build a sample of gas-star misaligned galaxies. The large-scale environment of misaligned galaxies is dominated by filaments and clusters, while is less dense relative to the gas-star aligned control galaxies. The direction of the large-scale structure (LSS) is defined by its minor axis ($\vec{e_{3}}$), which indicates the slowest collapsing direction. For the aligned controls, the gas and stellar spins are preferentially perpendicular to $\vec{e_{3}}$, since these galaxies reside in high-mass host haloes. For the misaligned galaxies, the gas spins also tend to be perpendicular to $\vec{e_{3}}$, suggesting that misaligned gas is recently accreted from the LSS. Meanwhile, there is no correlation between their stellar spins and $\vec{e_{3}}$. There are two possible explanations for this observational phenomenon: (1) the large-scale environments of misaligned galaxies evolve as they grow, with stellar angular momenta acquiring in different environments having different orientations; (2) the correlation between stellar spins and the LSS is smeared out since a relatively higher portion of misaligned galaxies in sheet environments are statistically analysed together with those in filament environments.</description>

      <title>SpecDis: Value added distance catalogue for 4 million stars from DESI Year-1 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the SpecDis value added stellar distance catalogue accompanying DESI DR1. SpecDis trains a feed-forward Neural Network (NN) on a large sample of stars with Gaia parallaxes, but without applying selections on parallax error or signal-to-noise (S/N) of the stellar spectra. We incorporate parallax error into the loss function for training. This approach ensures the training sample not suffering from biases. Moreover, SpecDis predicts the reciprocal of the square root of luminosity, which is linearly proportional to parallax and helps to avoid excluding negative parallaxes. To enhance the precision of distance predictions, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the noise and dimensionality of stellar spectra. Validated by independent external samples of member stars with precise distances from globular clusters, dwarf galaxies, and stellar streams, combined with BHB stars, we demonstrate that our distance measurements show no significant bias up to 100 kpc, and are much more precise than Gaia parallax beyond 7 kpc. The median distance uncertainties are 23 %, 19 %, 11 % and 7 % for S/N$&lt;$20, 20$\leq$S/N$&lt;$ 60, 60$\leq$ S/N $&lt;$ 100 and S/N$\geq$100. Selecting stars with $\log g&lt;3.8$ and distance uncertainties smaller than 25 %, we have more than 74,000 giant candidates within 50 kpc to the Galactic center and 1,500 candidates beyond this distance. Additionally, we develop a Gaussian mixture model to identify binaries and identify 120,000 possible binaries, and discover that the binary fraction increases with [Fe/H] and $\log g$ and declines with [$\alpha$/Fe] and $T_\mathrm{eff}$, indicating stars with low Fe and high $\alpha$, which form early, may have experienced more encounters and tidal effects to disrupt binaries. Our final catalogue provides distances and distance uncertainties for $&gt;$4 million stars, offering a valuable resource for Galactic astronomy.</description>

      <title>Microphysics of Circumgalactic Turbulence Probed by Fast Radio Bursts and Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is poorly constrained at the sub-parsec scales relevant to turbulent energy dissipation and regulation of multi-phase structure. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are sensitive to small-scale plasma density fluctuations, which can induce multipath propagation (scattering). The amount of scattering depends on the density fluctuation spectrum, including its amplitude $C_{\rm n}^2$, spectral index $\beta$, and dissipation scale $l_{\rm i}$. We use quasar observations of CGM turbulence at $\gtrsim$ pc scales to infer $C_{\rm n}^2$, finding it to be $10^{-16}\lesssim C_{\rm n}^2\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m$^{-20/3}$ for hot ($T&gt;10^6$ K) gas and $10^{-9}\lesssim C_{\rm n}^2\lesssim 10^{-5}$ m$^{-20/3}$ for cool ($10^4\lesssim T\lesssim 10^5$ K) gas, depending on the gas sound speed and density. These values of $C_{\rm n}^2$ are much smaller than those inferred in the interstellar medium at similar physical scales. For most FRB sightline geometries, the scattering delays from the CGM are negligible ($\ll10$ $\mu$s at 1 GHz), but are more detectable from the cool gas as radio scintillation. Joint quasar-FRB observations of individual galaxies can yield lower limits on $l_{\rm i}$, even if the CGM is not a significant scattering site. An initial comparison between quasar and FRB observations (albeit for different systems) suggests $l_{\rm i}\gtrsim200$ km in $\sim10^4$ K gas in order for the quasar and FRB constraints to be consistent. If a foreground CGM is completely ruled out as a source of scattering along an FRB sightline then $l_{\rm i}$ may be comparable to the smallest cloud sizes ($\lesssim$ pc) inferred from photoionization modeling of quasar absorption lines.</description>

      <title>Inferring Galactic Parameters from Chemical Abundances with Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic chemical abundances provide crucial insights into fundamental galactic parameters, such as the high-mass slope of the initial mass function (IMF) and the normalization of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rates. Constraining these parameters is essential for advancing our understanding of stellar feedback, metal enrichment, and galaxy formation processes. However, traditional Bayesian inference techniques, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), are computationally prohibitive when applied to large datasets of modern stellar surveys. We leverage simulation-based-inference (SBI) as a scalable, robust, and efficient method for constraining galactic parameters from stellar chemical abundances and demonstrate its the advantages over HMC in terms of speed, scalability, and robustness against model misspecifications. We combine a Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) model, CHEMPY, with a neural network emulator and a Neural Posterior Estimator (NPE) to train our SBI pipeline. Mock datasets are generated using CHEMPY, including scenarios with mismatched nucleosynthetic yields, with additional tests conducted on data from a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy. SBI results are benchmarked against HMC-based inference, focusing on computational performance, accuracy, and resilience to systematic discrepancies. SBI achieves a $\sim75,600\times$ speed-up compared to HMC, reducing inference runtime from $\gtrsim42$ hours to mere seconds for thousands of stars. Inference on $1,000$ stars yields precise estimates for the IMF slope ($\alpha_{\rm IMF} = -2.298 \pm 0.002$) and SN Ia normalization ($\log_{10}(N_{\rm Ia}) = -2.885 \pm 0.003$), deviating less than 0.05% from the ground truth. SBI also demonstrates similar robustness to model misspecification than HMC, recovering accurate parameters even with alternate yield tables or data from a cosmological simulation.

      <title>$^{14}$N$/^{15}$N abundance ratio toward massive star-forming regions with different Galactic distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance ratio of $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N is, in principle, a powerful tool for tracing stellar nucleosynthesis. This work aims to measure and analyze ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) and $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N abundance ratios in massive star-forming regions across a range of galactocentric distances to provide constraints on galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models. We present H$^{13}$CN and HC$^{15}$N J=2-1 results toward 51massive star-forming regions obtained with the Institut de Radioastronomie Millim\'etrique (IRAM) 30 meter telescope.\ We used these results to derive ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) abundance ratios as well as $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N ratios using the double isotope method. We find an overall decreasing trend in the ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) abundance ratio and an increasing trend in the $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N ratio with increasing galactocentric distance ($D_{\rm GC}$), which provides a good constraint for the GCE model based on high signal to noise ratio measurements. While the predicted ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) ratios between 6 and 12 kpc determined using current GCE models are consistent with our observational results, the ratios from models for $D_{\rm GC}$ less than 6 kpc are significantly higher than the observational results, which indicates GCE models for $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N and/or $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C ratios need to be updated for at least this range.</description>

      <title>Identification of high-redshift X-ray active galactic nuclei in the 4XMM-DR11 serendipitous catalogue using DES data: Comparative analysis with optically-selected QSOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-rays provide a robust method in identifying AGN. However, in the high-redshift Universe, their space density is relatively low, and, in combination with the small areas covered by X-ray surveys, the selected AGN are poorly sampled. Deep optical/infrared data are essential for locating counterparts and determining redshifts. In this work, we leverage the XMM-Newton 4XMM-DR11 serendipitous catalogue alongside the extensive optical Dark Energy Survey and the near-infrared VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) to select one of the largest high-z X-ray AGN samples to date. Our analysis focuses on the overlapping area of these surveys, covering about 185 $deg^2$. In addition, we aspire to compare the properties of the X-ray AGN with the optically-selected QSOs. For sources without spectroscopic data (80%), we estimated the photometric redshifts using both SED fitting and machine-learning algorithms. Among the 65,000 X-ray sources in the 4XMM-DES-VHS area, we ended up with 833 z&gt;3.5 AGN (11% having spec-z information) with high reliability and a fraction of outliers {\eta}&lt;10%. The sample completeness is 90%, driven by the depth of DES data. Only 10% of the X-ray selected AGN are also optical QSOs and vice versa. Our findings indicate an observed absorbed fraction ($\log N_H~[cm^{-2}] \geq 23$) of 20-40% for the X-ray AGN, significantly higher than that of optical QSOs. X-ray AGN exhibit fainter observed optical magnitudes and brighter mid-IR magnitudes than optical QSOs. Their median rest-frame SED shapes differ notably with optical QSOs being dominated by AGN emission in the UV-optical wavelengths. While the median SEDs of X-ray AGN suggest extinction in the UV-optical range, individual sources exhibit a wide range of spectral shapes, indicating significant diversity within the population. This analysis supports that X-ray and optically-selected AGN represent distinct and complementary populations.</description>

      <title>Universal Density and Velocity Distributions of Dark Matter around Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of dark matter at the galactic center, crucial for indirect searches, remains uncertain. In particular, in the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of a galaxy where indirect signals may be stronger, the density of a dark matter spike may undergo redistribution. Here we calculate the density surrounding Schwarzschild black holes that originate from diverse initial dark halos and estimate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. By employing a series of Hernquist and power-law initial dark halos, we obtain a fitting formula between dark matter spikes and black hole masses. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is utilized to approximate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. As an application, taking into account dark matter self-annihilation, we assess the relic densities of dark matter spikes around black holes. We find that the relic spikes for s-wave annihilation are higher than p-wave annihilation, and the relic densities obtained for p-wave annihilation depend on the velocity distribution, varying significantly with distance. The findings shall further provide useful insights for multi-messenger dark matter detections in the future.</description>

      <title>Assessing Galaxy Rotation Kinematics: Insights from Convolutional Neural Networks on Velocity Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing galaxies as either fast or slow rotators plays a vital role in understanding the processes behind galaxy formation and evolution. Standard techniques, which are based on the $\lambda_R$-spin parameter obtained from stellar kinematics, frequently face difficulties to classify fast and slow rotators accurately. These challenges arise particularly in cases where galaxies have complex interaction histories or exhibit significant morphological diversity. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on classifying galaxy rotation kinematics based on stellar kinematic maps from the SAMI survey. Our results show that the optimal CNN architecture achieves an accuracy and precision of approximately 91% and 95% on the test dataset, respectively. Subsequently, we apply our trained model to classify previously unknown rotator galaxies for which traditional statistical tools have been unable to determine whether they exhibit fast or slow rotation, such as certain irregular galaxies or those in dense clusters. We also used Integrated Gradients (IG) to reveal the crucial kinematic features that influenced the CNN's classifications. This research highlights the power of CNNs to improve our comprehension of galaxy dynamics and emphasizes their potential to contribute to upcoming large-scale Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) surveys.</description>

      <title>A Deep, High-Angular Resolution 3D Dust Map of the Southern Galactic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deep, high-angular resolution 3D dust map of the southern Galactic plane over $239^\circ &lt; \ell &lt; 6^\circ$ and $|b| &lt; 10^\circ$ built on photometry from the DECaPS2 survey, in combination with photometry from VVV, 2MASS, and unWISE and parallaxes from Gaia DR3 where available. To construct the map, we first infer the distance, extinction, and stellar types of over 700 million stars using the brutus stellar inference framework with a set of theoretical MIST stellar models. Our resultant 3D dust map has an angular resolution of $1'$, roughly an order of magnitude finer than existing 3D dust maps and comparable to the angular resolution of the Herschel 2D dust emission maps. We detect complexes at the range of distances associated with the Sagittarius-Carina and Scutum-Centaurus arms in the fourth quadrant, as well as more distant structures out to a maximum reliable distance of $d \approx$ 10 kpc from the Sun. The map is sensitive up to a maximum extinction of roughly $A_V \approx 12$ mag. We publicly release both the stellar catalog and the 3D dust map, the latter of which can easily be queried via the Python package dustmaps. When combined with the existing Bayestar19 3D dust map of the northern sky, the DECaPS 3D dust map fills in the missing piece of the Galactic plane, enabling extinction corrections over the entire disk $|b| &lt; 10^\circ$. Our map serves as a pathfinder for the future of 3D dust mapping in the era of LSST and Roman, targeting regimes accessible with deep optical and near-infrared photometry but often inaccessible with Gaia.</description>

      <title>Varstrometry for Dual AGN using Radio interferometry: VaDAR with the VLBA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple active galactic nuclei (multi-AGN) are a known result of galaxy mergers. Therefore, they are an important tool for studying the formation and dynamical evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). A novel method for the selection of multi-AGN leverages the exquisite positional accuracy of Gaia to detect astrometrically-variable quasars. Previous work has paired this method with radio interferometry on sub-arcsecond scales. In this paper, we present a follow-up study of seven astrometrically-variable quasars from the pilot sample using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We targeted these seven quasars with the VLBA at 2.0-2.4 GHz (S-band) and 8.0-8.4 GHz (X-band), reaching milliarcsecond resolutions, in order to study the radio properties at smaller scales and to constrain the origin of the astrometric variability. The new observations are also used to identify significant radio-optical offsets in all seven objects, suggesting that many astrometrically-variable quasars also exhibit significant radio-optical offsets. We find that four of the seven sources are possible candidate multi-AGN based on their radio properties and radio-optical offsets. Overall, we use this follow-up study to constrain the smaller-scale radio properties of this sample of astrometrically-variable quasars, and continue to explore the use of this method in the field of multi-AGN.</description>

      <title>Early-Type Galaxies: Elliptical and S0 Galaxies, or Fast and Slow Rotators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early-type galaxies (ETGs) show a bimodal distribution in key structural properties like stellar specific angular momentum, kinematic morphology, and nuclear surface brightness profiles. Slow rotator ETGs, mostly found in the densest regions of galaxy clusters, become common when the stellar mass exceeds a critical value of around $M_*^\mathrm{crit}\approx2\times 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, or more precisely when $\lg(R_\mathrm{e}/\mathrm{kpc}) \gtrsim 12.4 - \lg(M_*/M_\odot)$. These galaxies have low specific angular momentum, spheroidal shapes, and stellar populations that are old, metal-rich, and $\alpha$-enhanced. In contrast, fast rotator ETGs form a continuous sequence of properties with spiral galaxies. In these galaxies, the age, metallicity, and $\alpha$-enhancement of the stellar population correlate best with the effective stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_\mathrm{e} \propto \sqrt{M_*/R_\mathrm{e}}$ (i.e., properties are similar for $R_\mathrm{e}\propto M_*$), or with proxies approximating their bulge mass fraction. This sequence spans from star-forming spiral disks to quenched, passive, spheroid-dominated fast rotator ETGs. Notably, at a fixed $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$, younger galaxies show lower metallicity. The structural differences and environmental distributions of ETGs suggest two distinct formation pathways: slow rotators undergo early intense star formation followed by rapid quenching via their dark halos and supermassive black holes, and later evolve through dry mergers during hierarchical cluster assembly; fast rotators, on the other hand, develop more gradually through gas accretion and minor mergers, becoming quenched by internal feedback above a characteristic $\lg(\mathrm{\sigma_e^{crit}}/\text{ km s}^{-1})\gtrsim2.3$ (in the local Universe) or due to environmental effects.</description>

      <title>The hot corino-like chemistry of four FUor-like protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Compared to Class 0 protostars, the higher densities and lower temperatures of the disk midplanes of Class I young stellar objects (YSOs) limit the detectability of complex organic molecules (COMs). The elevated luminosities of eruptive YSOs increase disk temperatures sublimating frozen molecules and easing their detection.
  Aims: Our aim is to investigate the chemical composition of four FUor-like Class I YSOs: L1551 IRS 5, Haro 5a IRS, V346 Nor, and OO Ser, and to compare their abundances of COMs with other YSOs in the literature.
  Methods: We search for COMs line emission in ALMA Band 6 observations. We use the CASSIS software to determine their column densities (N) and excitation temperatures (T_ex) assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium.
  Results: We detect 249 transitions from 12 COMs. In L1551 IRS 5 we identified CH3OH, 13CH3OH, CH318OH, CH2DOH, CH3CHO, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, CH3COCH3, C2H5OH, C2H5CN, 13CH3CN, and CH3C15)N. Haro 5a IRS and OO Ser have emission from CH3OH, CH3CHO, CH3OCH3, and CH3OCHO. CH3COCH3 is also detected in OO Ser. In V346 Nor we found CH3OH, CH2DOH, CH3CHO, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, and C2H5CN. The emission of COMs is compact in all targets. The analysis indicates their temperatures are above 100K. The abundance ratios of COMs derived for these eruptive YSOs, as well as for other protostars in the literature, span several orders of magnitude without any clear differentiation between the eruptive and quiescent YSOs. The column density of the main isotopologue of CH3OH should not be used as a reference, as most of the lines are optically thick.
  Conclusions: The hot and compact emission of COMs indicates that the four FUor-like targets are hot corino-like. Spectral studies of such objects can be useful to investigate the complex organic chemistry at later evolutionary stages than the usual Class 0 stage.</description>

      <title>Star formation in interacting galaxy systems: UVIT imaging of NGC 7252 and NGC 5291</title>

Abstract: Interactions play a significant role in the formation and evolution of galaxies in the Universe. The galaxy systems, NGC 7252 and NGC 5291 are two nearby interacting systems that are hosting Tidal Dwarf Galaxies (TDGs) and star-forming knots. The present work aims (a) To determine the attenuation-corrected star formation rate (SFR) of the interacting system NGC 7252 (b) To compare the star formation in the NGC 7252 system with that of the NGC 5291 system (c) To explore the relation between surface densities of gas and SFR in these two systems. The study utilises high-resolution FUV and NUV imaging data from the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board AstroSat. Six star-forming regions, including the merger remnant, were identified in the NGC 7252 system. The SFR corrected for attenuation of the knots in the NGC 7252 system is determined using the continuum slope (\beta) calculated from the FUV-NUV colour. It has been observed that the attenuation-corrected SFR values of the knots in this system fall within the range of SFR values determined for the NGC 5291 knots. The TDGs in both systems adhere to the same Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation as regular spiral galaxies.</description>

      <title>Lost in the FoG: Pitfalls of Models for Large-Scale Hydrogen Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale HI surveys and their cross-correlations with galaxy distributions have immense potential as cosmological probes. Interpreting these measurements requires theoretical models that must incorporate redshift-space distortions (RSDs), such as the Kaiser and fingers-of-God (FoG) effect, and differences in the tracer and matter distributions via the tracer bias. These effects are commonly approximated with assumptions that should be tested on simulated distributions. In this work, we use the hydrodynamical simulation suite IllustrisTNG to assess the performance of models of $z \leq 1$ HI auto and HI-galaxy cross-power spectra, finding that the models employed by recent observations introduce errors comparable to or exceeding their measurement uncertainties. In particular, neglecting FoG causes $\gtrsim 10\%$ deviations between the modeled and simulated power spectra at $k \gtrsim 0.1$ $h$ / Mpc, larger than assuming a constant bias which reaches the same error threshold at slightly smaller scales. However, even without these assumptions, models can still err by $\sim 10\%$ on relevant scales. These remaining errors arise from multiple RSD damping sources on HI clustering, which are not sufficiently described with a single FoG term. Overall, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of RSDs to harness the capabilities of future measurements of HI distributions.</description>

      <title>The properties of supermassive stars in galaxy merger driven direct collapse I: models without rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of the most massive quasars observed at high redshifts requires extreme accretion rates ($&gt;1$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$). Inflows of $10-1000$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ are found in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers, leading to the formation of supermassive discs (SMDs) with high metallicities ($&gt;$ Z$_\odot$). Supermassive stars (SMSs) born in these SMDs could be the progenitors of the most extreme quasars. Here, we study the properties of non-rotating SMSs forming in high metallicity SMDs. Using the stellar evolution code GENEC, we compute numerically the hydrostatic structures of non-rotating SMSs with metallicities $Z=1-10$ Z$_\odot$ by following their evolution under constant accretion at rates $10-1000$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We determine the final mass of the SMSs, set by the general-relativistic (GR) instability, by applying the relativistic equation of adiabatic pulsations to the hydrostatic structures. We find that non-rotating SMSs with metallicities $Z=1-10$ Z$_\odot$ accreting at rates $10-1000$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ evolve as red supergiant protostars until their final collapse. All the models reach the GR instability during H-burning. The final mass is $\sim10^6$ M$_\odot$, nearly independently of the metallicity and the accretion rate.</description>

      <title>Probing the Gaia atmospheric parameters of stars in globular clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous stellar surveys have been or will provide photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic data for a large number of stars in the Milky Way and neighbouring galaxies. Modern data processing tools and analysis methods are needed to deal with these data sets and obtain accurate and precise results. In this context, we are developing a new spectroscopic analysis pipeline based on the differential analysis method. The CHEmical Survey analysis System (CHESS) aims to automate the steps needed to obtain high-quality stellar parameters and abundances from large samples of spectra. To automatically identify the spectra of similar stars that are suitable for a differential analysis, CHESS first performs what we call a similarity analysis by directly using the observed spectra. This step of analysis uses unsupervised machine learning algorithms (such as dimensionality reduction methods). To validate the findings, we used atmospheric parameters from several catalogues (in particular those available in Gaia DR3). Alternatively, such a similarity analysis also serves as a consistency check of the atmospheric parameters in these catalogues. Here, we present our method for finding similar stars in globular clusters and the first preliminary results of their atmospheric parameters.</description>

      <title>Long-term Fermi observations of Mrk 421: clues for different non-stationary processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the gamma-ray spectral and timing results from the long-term regular observations of Mrk 421 with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard Fermi during 2008 August - 2023 August. We discerned six periods the relatively stronger 0.3-300 GeV activity compared to other time intervals. The baseline brightness level varied on timescales from several months to years during these periods, which was superimposed by shorter-term flares of the different asymmetry associated with various interplay between the light-crossing, particle acceleration and cooling timescales. The source also frequently exhibited two-peak flares, to be triggered by the propagation of forward and reverse shocks after collision between the shells of high-energy plasma, moving with different speeds down the jet. The strongest long-term flaring activity was recorded during 2012 June - 2013 October and 2017 October - 2018 March, when the source was robustly detectable even on intraday timescales. We detected 25 instances of intraday variability and a large number of the flux doubling or halving instances. The source generally showed a lognormal variability in the LAT energy range, explained as an imprinting of the disc nonstationary processes on the jet, proton-initiated hadronic cascades or random fluctuations in the particle acceleration rate. Most of the 0.3-300 GeV spectra were well-fit with a simple power-law model and showed a very broad range of the photon-index from 2.8 down to 1.2, with the mean values of 1.75-1.84 and distribution peaks at 1.73-1.82 during the periods of strong activity. Our spectral study also revealed the features of inverse-Compton upscatter of X-ray photons in the Klein-Nishina regime, relativistic magnetic reconnection, first-order Fermi mechanism within the magnetic field of different confinement efficiencies and stochastic acceleration</description>

Abstract: In 1962, Yoshihide Kozai reported his findings on the secular dynamics of asteroids moving in orbits with high inclination and eccentricity. In contrast to the classic understanding of the stability of planetary motion in the solar system, Kozai showed that asteroids can significantly change their orbital shape over a long timescale in an oscillatory manner between nearly circular orbits and highly elliptic orbits. An anti-correlated variation between orbital inclination and eccentricity characterizes this oscillation. The importance of Kozai's work in understanding the dynamical evolution of various systems was recognized decades later, including the fields of irregular satellites of planets, Oort Cloud, extrasolar planets, binary star systems, type Ia supernovae, planet climate, merging black hole systems, and so on.</description>

      <title>Deriving Stellar Properties, Distances, and Reddenings using Photometry and Astrometry with BRUTUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present brutus, an open source Python package for quickly deriving stellar properties, distances, and reddenings to stars based on grids of stellar models constrained by photometric and astrometric data. We outline the statistical framework for deriving these quantities, its implementation, and various Galactic priors over the 3-D distribution of stars, stellar properties, and dust extinction (including $R_V$ variation). We establish a procedure to empirically calibrate MIST v1.2 isochrones by using open clusters to derive corrections to the effective temperatures and radii of the isochrones, which reduces systematic errors on the lower main sequence. We also describe and apply a method to estimate photometric offsets between stellar models and observed data using nearby, low-reddening field stars. We perform a series of tests on mock and real data to examine parameter recovery with MIST under different modeling assumptions, illustrating that brutus is able to recover distances and other stellar properties using optical to near-infrared photometry and astrometry. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/joshspeagle/brutus.</description>

      <title>SN 2021hpr: A Normal Type Ia Supernova Showing Excess Emission in the Early Rising Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present extensive optical observations of a nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), SN 2021hpr, located in the spiral galaxy NGC 3147 at a distance of $\sim$ 45 Mpc. Our observations cover a phase within $\sim 1-2$ days to $\sim 290$ days after the explosion. SN 2021hpr is found to be a spectroscopically normal SN Ia, with an absolute B-band peak magnitude of $M_{max}(B) \approx -19.16 \pm 0.14$ mag and a post-peak decline rate of $\Delta m_{15}(B)= 1.00 \pm 0.01 $ mag. Early-time light curves showed a $\sim 7.0 \%$ excess emission compared to a homogeneously expanding fireball model, likely due to SN ejecta interacting with a companion or immediate circumstellar matter. The optical spectra of SN 2021hpr are overall similar to those of normal SNe Ia, but characterized by prominent detached high-velocity features (HVFs) of Si {\sc ii} and Ca {\sc ii} in the early phase. After examining a small sample of well-observed normal SNe Ia, we find that the HVFs are likely common for the subgroup with early-excess emission. The association of early bump feature with the HVFs could be attributed to density or abundance enhancement at the outer layer of the exploding star, likely as a result of interactions with companion$/$CSM or experiencing more complete burning. Nevertheless, the redshifted Fe {\sc ii} and Ni {\sc ii} lines in the nebular-phase spectra of SN 2021hpr, contrary to the blueshift trend seen in other SNe Ia showing early bump features, indicate its peculiarity in the explosion that remains to be understood.</description>

      <title>Observational evidence for a correlation between the magnetic field of jets and star formation rate in host galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion supermassive black holes in the center of active galaxies usually produce ``jets''-collimated bipolar outflows of relativistic particles. Magnetic fields near the black hole event horizon may play a crucial role in the formation of jets/outflows. Both theory and observation indicate that jets/outflows driven by centrally active supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have a feedback effect on the overall properties of the host galaxies. Therefore, the magnetic field is a key ingredient for the formation and evolution of galaxies. Here we report a clear correlation between the magnetic field of jets and star formation rate (SFR) for a large sample of 96 galaxies hosting supermassive black holes, which suggests that the star formation of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies may be powered by the jets.</description>

      <title>A Spectroastrometric Study of the Low-velocity Wind from DG Tau A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtained high spectral resolution spectra ($\Delta v$ $\sim$ 2.5 km s$^{-1}$) for DG Tau A from 4800 \r{A} to 7500 \r{A} using Subaru High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) for the first time. The low-velocity components (LVCs, |$v$| &lt; 100 km s$^{-1}$) were observed in the [O I] 5577, 6300, 6364 \r{A}, [S II] 6716, 6731 \r{A} lines. The offset position spectra observed in the LVCs show a "negative velocity gradient", supporting the presence of a wide-angled wind associated with the LVC emission. The offset position spectra observed in a component within the LVC velocity range between -16 km s$^{-1}$ to -41 km s$^{-1}$, namely, LVC-M, show a "negative velocity gradient'', supporting the presence of a wide-angled wind. With 12-70 au wind lengths measured using spectroastrometry, we estimate a lower limit to the wind mass-loss rate of $\sim$10$^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. In addition to the LVCs, we identify two high-velocity components (HVCs, |$v$| &gt; 100 km s$^{-1}$) associated with the collimated jet in 26 lines ([N I], [N II], [O I], [O II], [O III], [S II], [Ca II], [Fe II], H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, He I). The one with a clear spatial offset from the star ($n_e$ $\sim$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, HVC1) is associated with an internal shock surface of the jet, while the other at the base ($n_e$ $\sim$10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$, HVC2) may be a stationary shock component. We find that the observed line profiles and the spatial scales of the LVC emission do not agree with the existing predictions for photoevaporative or magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) disk winds. These could be explained by the X-wind model, but synthetic observations are required for detailed comparisons.</description>

      <title>The kinematic contribution to the cosmic number count dipole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the number count dipole with large surveys have shown amplitudes in tension with kinematic predictions based on the observed Doppler dipole of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These observations seem to be in direct conflict with a homogeneous and isotropic Universe as asserted by the cosmological principle, demanding further investigation into the origin of the tension. Here, we investigate whether the observed number count dipoles are consistent with being fully kinematic or if there is any residual anisotropy contributing to the total observed dipole. To disentangle these contributions, we aim to leverage the fact that the kinematic matter dipole expected in a given galaxy catalogue scales with observed properties of the sample, and different catalogues used in the literature therefore have different kinematic dipole expectations. We here perform joint dipole fits using the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), and the AGN catalogue derived from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (CatWISE). Assuming a common kinematic and non-kinematic dipole component between all catalogues, we find that a large residual, non-kinematic dipole anisotropy is detected, though a common direction between the two components is disfavoured by model selection. Freeing up both amplitude and direction for this residual dipole while fixing the kinematic dipole to the CMB dipole expectation, we recover a significant residual dipole with $\mathcal{D}_{resid} = (0.81\pm0.14)\times10^{-2}$, that is offset from the CMB dipole direction by $39\pm8$ degrees. While the present work provides a valuable first test of this concept, its scrutinising power is limited by the currently employed catalogues. Larger catalogues, especially in radio, will be needed to further lift the degeneracy between the kinematic and residual dipole components.</description>

      <title>Episodic outbursts during brown dwarf formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is evidence that stars and browns dwarfs grow through episodic rather than continuous gas accretion. However, the role of episodic accretion in the formation of brown dwarfs remains mostly unexplored. We investigate the role of episodic accretion, triggered by the magnetorotational instability in the inner disk regions, resulting in episodic outbursts during the formation of brown dwarfs, and its implications for their early formation stages. We use hydrodynamical simulations coupled with a sub-grid accretion model to investigate the formation of young proto-brown dwarfs and protostars, taking into account the effects of episodic accretion resulting in episodic radiative feedback, i.e. in luminosity outbursts. The formation timescale for proto brown dwarfs is at least one order of magnitude shorter than that of protostars. Episodic accretion leads to a shorter main accretion phase compared to continuous accretion in brown dwarfs, whereas the opposite is true for low-mass stars. Episodic accretion can accelerate early mass accretion in proto-brown dwarfs and protostars, but it results in less massive objects by the end of the main phase compared to continuous accretion. We find an approximately linear correlation between an object's mass at the end of the main accretion phase and the timing of the last episodic outburst: later events result in more massive brown dwarfs but less massive low-mass stars. Episodic outbursts have a stronger effect on brown dwarf-forming cloud cores, with the last outburst essentially splitting the brown dwarf evolution into a short high-accretion and a much longer low-accretion phase.</description>

      <title>An SS433 flare caught by TESS. Fast rise times and evidence for a 13 hours quasi-period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SS433 is an exotic Galactic microquasar in which there is a supercritical inflow of matter into a compact object of likely black hole nature. Here I report on an SS433 flare that occurred during a TESS observation of Sector 54 in June of 2022. The flare lasted for about 10 days and culminated in a flux increase by a factor of three relative to quiescence. The unprecedented continuous photometric coverage of the flare afforded by TESS shows that the flux can rise and fall by up to a factor of two within 4 to 7 hours. Furthermore, there is evidence that the flare peaks occur with a quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}} = 13.3$ hours. The flare can be most naturally explained by accretion rate ($\dot{M}$) variations due to oscillations in the donor star mass loss rate. We estimate $\dot{M}$ variations up to a factor of two with an increase in the photospheric radius of the accretion disk by about the same factor, implying that a transient ``common envelope'' enshrouds the binary system during the flares. If the flares are due to radial pulsations in the donor star envelope then their quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}}$ could imply a mean density $\left &lt; \rho \right &gt; \sim 18 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for the donor star, compared to $\left &lt; \rho_{\mathrm{RL}} \right &gt; = 0.7-1 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for a synchronized Roche-lobe filling donor star. Another SS433 lightcurve from a Sector 80 TESS observation in 2024 hints that there may be an outflow from behind the the donor star.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey: View of the Fornax galaxy cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fornax cluster is one of the most nearby X-ray bright galaxy clusters. Previous observations of the intracluster medium were limited to less than R500. We aim to significantly extend the X-ray coverage. We use data from five SRG/eROSITA all-sky surveys and perform a detailed one- and two-dimensional X-ray surface brightness analysis, allowing us to trace hot gas emission from kpc to Mpc scales with a single instrument. We compare the results to those from a recent numerical simulation of the local Universe (SLOW) and correlate the X-ray emission distribution with that of other tracers, including cluster member galaxies, ultra compact dwarf galaxies, intracluster globular clusters, and HI-tail galaxies. We detect X-ray emission out to well beyond the virial radius, R100=2.2 deg. We do not find obvious evidence for the bow shock several hundred kpc south of the cluster center predicted by previous numerical simulations of the Fornax cluster. Instead, we discover finger-like structures beyond R500 to the west and south-east that stretch out far beyond the virial radius. They might be due to gas being pushed outward by the previous merger with NGC 1404 or due to warm-hot gas infall along large-scale filaments. Intriguingly, we find the distributions of the other tracers -- galaxies and globular clusters -- to be correlated with the X-ray excess regions, favoring the latter infall scenario. Interestingly, we also discover an apparent Bridge of low surface brightness emission beyond the virial radius connecting to the Fornax A galaxy group, which is also traced by the member galaxy and globular cluster distribution. This X-ray Bridge furthermore approximately coincides with a region of enhanced Faraday depth detected previously. The gas distribution in the SLOW simulation shows similar features as those we have discovered with SRG/eROSITA.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Current Star Formation Rate and Nebula Ratio of Star-Formation Galaxies at z &lt; 0.4 with FADO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The star formation rate is a crucial astrophysical tracer for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies, determining the interaction between interstellar medium properties and star formation, thereby inferring the evolutionary laws of cosmic star formation history and cosmic energy density. The mainstream approach to studying the stellar property in galaxies relies on pure stellar population synthesis models. However, these methods fail to account for the contamination of SFR caused by nebular gas radiation. Recent studies have indicated that neglecting nebular radiation contamination appears non-negligible in galaxies with intense star-forming activities and at relatively high redshifts, potentially leading to overestimating stellar masses. However, there is currently limited targeted research, particularly regarding galaxies at redshifts (z $&lt;$ 0.4). In this work, 6,511 star-formation galaxies are selected from the SDSS-DR18, and FADO fits their spectra. This tool can exclude nebular radiation contributions in the spectral fitting. A tentative work is carried out to explore the SFR of these galaxies. The results indicate that the median \( H_{\alpha} \) flux obtained from FADO fitting differs from that obtained using the pure stellar population synthesis model {\it qsofitmore} by approximately 0.034 dex. Preliminary evidence suggests that the average nebula ratio increases with redshift. Additionally, we investigated the impact of stellar mass on the nebula ratio at low to moderate redshifts. By comparing two spectral fitting software packages, we found that although the contribution of nebular emission is minimal, it generally shows an increasing trend with redshift. We anticipate that by combining optical and near-infrared spectral data, the influence of nebulae may become more prominent in star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts (e.g., up to z $\sim$ 2).</description>

      <title>Bar formation and evolution in the cosmological context: Inputs from the Auriga simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic bars drive the internal evolution of spiral galaxies, while their formation is tightly coupled to the properties of their host galaxy and dark matter halo. To explore what drives bar formation in the cosmological context and how these structures evolve throughout cosmic history, we use the Auriga suite of magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations. We find that bars are robust and long-lived structures, and we recover a decreasing bar fraction with increasing redshift which plateaus around $\sim20\%$ at $z\sim3$. We find that bars which form at low and intermediate redshifts grow longer with time, while bars that form at high redshifts are born `saturated' in length, likely due to their merger-induced formation pathway. This leads to a larger bar-to-disc size ratio at high redshifts as compared to the local Universe. We subsequently examine the multi-dimensional parameter space thought to drive bar formation. We find that barred galaxies tend to have lower Toomre $Q$ values at the time of their formation, while we do not find a difference in the gas fraction of barred and unbarred populations when controlling for stellar mass. Barred galaxies tend to be more baryon-dominated at all redshifts and assemble their stellar mass earlier, while galaxies that are baryon-dominated but that do not host a bar, have a higher ex-situ bulge fraction. We explore the implications of the baryon-dominance of barred galaxies on the Tully-Fisher relation, finding an offset from the unbarred relation; confirming this in observations would serve as additional evidence for dark matter, as this behaviour is not readily explained in modified gravity scenarios.</description>

      <title>Searching for Low-Redshift Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs), discovered by the "W1W2 dropout" selection at high redshifts ($z\sim$ 2-4), are a rare population of hyper-luminous obscured quasars. Their number density is comparable to similarly luminous type 1 quasars in the same redshift range, potentially representing a short, yet critical stage in galaxy evolution. The evolution in their number density towards low redshift, however, remains unclear as their selection function is heavily biased against objects at $z\lesssim2$. We combine data from the WISE and Herschel archives to search for Hot DOGs at $z&lt;0.5$ based on their unique spectral energy distributions. We find 68 candidates, and spectroscopic observations confirm that 3 of them are at $z&lt;0.5$. For those 3 we find their black hole accretion is close to the Eddington limit, with lower bolometric luminosities and black hole masses than those of higher-$z$ Hot DOGs. Compared to high-$z$ systems, these low-$z$ systems are closer to the local relation between host galaxy stellar mass and black hole mass but still lie above it, and we discuss several possible scenarios for it. Finally, we also find the surface number density of $z&lt;$0.5 Hot DOGs is $\rm 2.4 \times 10^{-3}$ deg$^{-2}$, about an order of magnitude lower than high-$z$ Hot DOGs but comparable to hyper-luminous unobscured quasars in the same redshift range. These results further support the idea that Hot DOGs may be a transitional phase of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>The JCMT BISTRO Survey: Magnetic Fields Align with Orbital Structure in the Galactic Center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the magnetic field in the dense material of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way, traced in 850 $\mu$m polarized dust emission as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) B-fields In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) Survey. We observe a highly ordered magnetic field across the CMZ between Sgr B2 and Sgr C, which is strongly preferentially aligned with the orbital gas flows within the clouds of the CMZ. We find that the observed relative orientations are non-random at a $&gt;$99% confidence level and are consistent with models in which the magnetic field vectors are aligned within 30$^{o}$ to the gas flows in 3D. The deviations from aligned magnetic fields are most prominent at positive Galactic longitudes, where the CMZ clouds are more massive, denser, and more actively forming stars. Our observed strongly preferentially parallel magnetic field morphology leads us to hypothesize that in the absence of star formation, the magnetic field in the CMZ is entrained in the orbital gas flows around Sgr A$^{*}$, while gravitational collapse and feedback in star-forming regions can locally reorder the field. This magnetic field behavior is similar to that observed in the CMZ of the nuclear starburst galaxy NGC 253. This suggests that despite its current low star formation rate, the CMZ of the Milky Way is analogous to those of more distant, actively star-forming, galaxies.</description>

      <title>CANUCS/Technicolor: JWST Medium Band Photometry Finds Half of the Star Formation at $z&gt;7.5$ is Obscured</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a sample of 146 high-redshift ($z&gt;7.5$) galaxies from the CANUCS/Technicolor surveys, showcasing photometry in every wide- and medium-band NIRCam filter in addition to ancillary HST data sampling $0.4-5 \mu m$ (22 JWST bands out of 29 bands total). Additionally, 48 ($33\%$) galaxies in our sample meet criteria to be classified as extreme emission line galaxies, 15 ($10\%$) of which are completely missed by typical dropout selections due to faint UV emission. By fitting the SEDs covering the rest-frame UV to optical at $z &gt; 7.5$, we investigate the dust obscuration properties, giving an unbiased view of dust buildup in high-redshift galaxies free from spectroscopic follow-up selection effects. Dust attenuation correlates with stellar mass, but more strongly with star formation rate. We find typical galaxies at $z&gt;7.5$ have $\sim 25 \%$ of their star formation obscured. However, since galaxies with higher star formation rates suffer more attenuation, $\sim 50 \%$ of the total star formation rate density at $7.5&lt;z&lt;9$ is obscured. The obscured fraction drops to $\sim 35 \%$ in our $9&lt;z&lt;12$ bin, possibly due to substantial dust grain growth in the interstellar medium not having time to occur. Extrapolating the decline in dust obscuration of galaxies to higher redshifts, we infer that dust obscuration should approach zero at $z &gt; 15$, implying that epoch as when dust first forms in bright galaxies.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies imply dark matter is heavier than $\mathbf{2.2 \times 10^{-21}} \, \mathbf{eV}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is widely established that a lower bound on the dark matter particle mass, $m$, can be obtained by demanding that the de Broglie wavelength in a given galaxy must be smaller than the virial radius of the galaxy, leading to $m\gtrsim 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ when applied to typical dwarf galaxies. This lower limit has never been derived precisely or rigorously. We use stellar kinematical data for the Milky Way satellite galaxy Leo II to self-consistently reconstruct a statistical ensemble of dark matter wavefunctions and corresponding density profiles. By comparison to a data-driven, model-independent reconstruction, and using a variant of the maximum mean discrepancy as a statistical measure, we determine that a self-consistent description of dark matter in the local Universe requires $m&gt;2.2 \times 10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}\;\mathrm{(CL&gt;95\%)}$. This lower limit is free of any assumptions pertaining to cosmology, microphysics (including spin), or dynamics of dark matter, and only assumes that it is predominantly composed of a single bosonic particle species.</description>

      <title>Where has all the $r$-process gone? Timescales for GRB-Kilonovae to Enrich their Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron star (NS) mergers are currently the only observed source of $r$-process production in the Universe. Yet, it is unclear how much $r$-process mass from these mergers is incorporated into star-forming gas to enrich stars. This is crucial to consider as all other $r$-process mass estimates in the Universe beyond Earth are based on stellar $r$-process abundances. Here, we explore the extent to which merger location and host galaxy properties affect the incorporation of $r$-process elements into star-forming gas, and quantify an ``enrichment" timescale to account for this process. To put this timescale in context, we analyze a population of 12 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with probable associations to $r$-process kilonovae (GRB-KNe) and 74 short GRBs without claimed KNe, including new non-parametric star formation histories for the GRB-KN hosts. We find enrichment timescales for this sample are between $\approx7$ Myr$-1.6$ Gyr, suggesting that environmental enrichment is delayed from NS merger occurrence. Moreover, we find a correlation between the amount of environmental enrichment from a single event and increasing host specific star formation rate (sSFR), and little correlation with stellar mass and GRB galactocentric offset. Environments with low sSFRs ($&lt;10^{-10.5}$ yr$^{-1}$), which comprise 18% of short GRB hosts and the host of GW170817, will have little to no capacity for stellar enrichment. Our results indicate that not all $r$-process from NS mergers is incorporated into newly-forming stars, and instead some remains ``lost" to the CGM or IGM. Future studies should consider these losses to understand the total contribution from NS mergers to the Universe's $r$-process budget.</description>

      <title>Ultraluminous X-ray sources in Globular Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the formation, populations, and evolutionary paths of UltraLuminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) within Globular Clusters (GCs). ULXs, characterised by their extreme X-ray luminosities, present a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics and compact object formation. While previous studies have largely focused on field populations, this research examines the unique environment of GCs, where dynamical interactions play a significant role. Using the MOCCA Monte Carlo code, we explore how dynamics influences ULX populations within these dense stellar clusters.
  Our findings reveal that dynamical processes, such as binary hardening and exchanges, can both facilitate and impede ULX formation in GCs. The study explores the impact of parameters including the initial binary fraction, tidal filling, and multiple stellar populations on the evolution of ULXs. We find that non-tidally filling clusters exhibit significantly larger ULX populations compared to tidally filling ones.
  The results indicate that the apparent scarcity of ULXs in GCs may be related to the older stellar populations of GCs relative to the field. Furthermore, the study identifies a population of "escaper" ULXs, which originate in GCs but are ejected and emit X-rays outside the cluster. These escapers may significantly contribute to the observed field ULX population.</description>

      <title>PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 III: weak-lensing analysis and merging scenario reconstruction of a low-mass cluster with exceptionally-distant radio relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The galaxy cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 ($z=0.234$) is a post-merging system that exhibits symmetric double radio relics separated by ~2.7 Mpc. We present the first weak-lensing analysis of PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 and propose possible merging scenarios using numerical simulations. Our analysis with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging identifies a binary dark matter structure consisting of northern and southern components, separated by ~500 kpc. Assuming Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halos, the masses for the northern and southern subclusters are $M_{200c}^{N} = 0.88_{-0.30}^{+0.35} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ and $M_{200c}^{S} = 2.71_{-0.48}^{+0.51} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$, respectively. By superposing the two NFW halos, we determine the total mass of the cluster to be $M_{200c} = 4.22_{-1.00}^{+1.10} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ ($M_{500c} = 2.90_{-0.69}^{+0.75} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$). Our mass estimate suggests that the two relics are located around the cluster $R_{200c}$, where the density of the intracluster medium is very low. Our idealized simulations find that an off-axis collision of a 3:1 major merger can simultaneously reproduce the observed relic and dark matter halo separations. From these findings, we suggest that the system is observed ~0.9 Gyr after the first pericenter passage and is returning from the first apocenter.</description>

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations bring broadband internet and cellular service to the most remote locations on the planet. Unfortunately, many of these locations also host some of the world's best optical and radio astronomy (RA) observatories. With the number of LEO satellites expected to increase by an order of magnitude in the upcoming decade, satellite downlink radio frequency interference (RFI) is a growing concern in protected radio-quiet areas like the United States National Radio Quiet Zone. When these satellites transmit in the spectrum near protected RA bands, undesired out-of-band emission can leak into these protected bands and impact scientific observations. In this paper, we present a self-reporting system - Operational Data Sharing (ODS) - which enables mutual awareness by publishing radio telescopes' operational information to a protected database that is available to satellite operators through a representational state transfer application programming interface (REST API). Satellite operators can use the ODS data to adapt their downlink tasking algorithms in real time to avoid overwhelming sensitive RA facilities, particularly, through the novel Telescope Boresight Avoidance (TBA) technique. Preliminary results from recent experiments between the NRAO and the SpaceX Starlink teams demonstrate the effectiveness of the ODS and TBA in reducing downlink RFI in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array's observations in the 1990-1995 MHz and 10.7-12.7 GHz bands. This automated ODS system is beginning to be implemented by other RA facilities and could be utilized by other satellite operators in the near future.</description>
