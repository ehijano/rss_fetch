      <title>Weighted Boundedness of a Composition of Paraproducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we offer alternate upper bound for the operator $\Pi_b^*\Pi_d$ to the ones present in literature, thus extending the known upper bounds from the $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ setting to $L^p(w)$, for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty,$ and a Muckenhoupt weight $w$. In the $L^2(w)$ setting, we fully characterize the boundedness of the operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend some results of Kwok-Pun Ho. In particular, it will be shown that every rearrangement-invariant quasi-Banach function space E on a totally sigma-finite measure space with a non-atomic measure can be expressed is the form E=F(L(p0,q0),L(p1,q1)) for an interpolation functor F, where the construction of the functor F is given based on the space E itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a general way to obtain Pr\'ekopa-Leindler and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb type inequalities from Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities and provide numerous examples. We use the same heuristic to prove a discrete version of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities for functions over $\mathbb{Z}^d$. These are the functional extensions of the discrete Brunn-Minkowski inequality conjectured by Ruzsa and recently established by Keevash, Tiba, and the author.</description>

      <title>Fractional Schr\"odinger-Poisson-Slater equations in Coulomb-Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove existence and multiplicity results for the fractional Schroedinger--Poisson--Slater equation $(-\Delta)^s u + (I_\alpha * u^2)u = f(|x|,u)$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$, where $0&lt;s&lt;1$ and $\alpha \in (1,N)$. We seek solutions in a fractional Coulomb-Sobolev space and employ new tools in critical point theory that link the behavior of $f$ at zero and at infinity to the scaling properties of the left-hand side. For several regimes of $f$, we establish compactness for an associated action functional and obtain multiple solutions as critical points, with the number governed by the interaction of $f$ with a sequence of eigenvalues $\{\lambda_k\}$ defined via the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ cohomological index of Fadell and Rabinowitz (rather than the classical Krasnosel'skii genus). In this fractional setting we also prove new regularity results and necessary conditions for the existence of solutions.</description>

      <title>Besov-Bergman spaces of $M$-harmonic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We~show that the weighted Bergman spaces of M-harmonic functions (functions annihilated by the invariant Laplacian on the unit ball of the complex n-space), as~well as their analytic continuation (in~the spirit of Rossi and Vergne), coincide with the certain Besov-type spaces, which were studied by Folland. Characterizations in terms of tangential derivatives are given, and for appropriate values of the weight parameter, these spaces are also shown to coincide with the subspaces of all M-harmonic fucntions in the Sobolev space of order~$t$ on the~ball, $0\le t\le n$. Unlike the holomorphic case, the~last result is shown to fail in general for other values of~$t$. The~main tool in the proofs are asymptotic estimates for certain integrals of squared hypergeometric functions, which seem to be of interest in their own right and may find other applications.</description>

      <title>Bimodule KMS Symmetric Quantum Markov Semigroups and Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bimodule KMS symmetry of a bimodule quantum Markov semigroup extends the classical KMS symmetry of a quantum Markov semigroup. Compared with (bimodule) GNS symmetry, the (bimodule) KMS symmetry retains significantly more of the underlying noncommutativity. In this paper, we study bimodule KMS symmetric quantum Markov semigroups and introduce directional matrices for such semigroups, which reduce to diagonal matrices in the GNS symmetric setting. Using these directional matrices, we establish a corresponding gradient-flow structure. As a consequence, we obtain both a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality and a Talagrand inequality for bimodule KMS symmetric quantum Markov semigroups.</description>

      <title>Kac's Program and Relative Entropy Decay for Nonlinear Spin-Exchange Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a nonlinear exchange dynamics for Ising spin systems with arbitrary interactions. The evolution is governed by a quadratic Boltzmann-type equation that conserves the mean magnetization. Collisions are encoded through a spin-exchange kernel chosen so that the dynamics converge to the Ising model with the prescribed interaction and mean magnetization profile determined by the initial state. We prove a general convergence theorem, valid for any interaction and any transport kernel. Moreover, we show that, for sufficiently weak interactions, the system relaxes exponentially fast to equilibrium in relative entropy, with optimal decay rate independent of the initial condition. The proof relies on establishing a strong version of the Kac program from kinetic theory. In particular, we show that the associated Kac particle system satisfies a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality with constants uniform in the number of particles. This is achieved by adapting the method of stochastic localization to the present conservative setting.</description>

      <title>Pairs of Clark Unitary Operators on the Bidisk and their Taylor Joint Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Clark theory for commuting compressed shift operators on model spaces $K_{\phi}$ associated with inner functions $\phi$ on the bidisk, which exhibits both similarities and marked differences compared to the classical one-variable version. We first identify the adjoint of the embedding operator $J_{\alpha} \colon K_{\phi}\to L^2(\sigma_{\alpha})$ as a weighted Cauchy transform of the Clark measure $\sigma_{\alpha}$. Under natural assumptions, which generically include the case when $\phi$ is rational inner, we then use $J_{\alpha}^*$ to obtain commuting unitaries on $K_{\phi}$ which are often infinite-dimensional perturbations of compressed shift operators. Finally, we show that the Taylor joint spectrum of these Clark unitaries coincides with $\mathrm{supp}(\sigma_{\alpha})\subset \mathbb{T}^2$ when $\phi$ is a rational inner function.</description>

      <title>Subdifferentials of Convex Operators Valued in the Space of Integrable Functions with Application to Risk-Averse Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study differentiability properties of convex operators defined on a Banach space with values in an $\Lc_p$ space and of their compositions with monotonic convex functionals on this space. We develop new tools for operators enjoying an additional feature known as the local property. The new approach and results go beyond the classical theory of normal integrands and lattice-valued operators. We further describe the subdifferentials of compositions of such operators with convex monotonic functionals. The new results are applied to obtain novel optimality conditions in the subdifferential form for a broad class of risk-averse stochastic optimization problems with risk functionals as objectives, with partial information, and with stochastic dominance constraints. While our analysis is motivated by the theory and methods of risk-averse optimization, it addresses problems of a more general structure and has potential for further applications.</description>

      <title>CLT for $\beta$-ensembles with Freud weights, application to the KLS conjecture in Schatten balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the $\beta$-ensembles (or 1D log-gas) with Freud weights, namely with a potential of the from $|x|^{p}$ with $p \geq 2$. Since this potential is not of class $\mathcal{C}^{3}$ when $p \in (2,3]$, most of the literature does not apply. In this singular setting, we prove the central limit theorem for linear statistics with general test-functions and compute the subleading correction to the free energy. Our strategy relies on establishing an optimal local law in the spirit of [Bourgade, Mody, Pain 22'].
  Our results allow us to give a large $N$ expansion up to $o(N)$ of the log-volume of the unit balls of $N\times N$ self-adjoint matrices for the $p$-Schatten norms and to give a consistency check of the KLS conjecture. For the latter, we consider the functions $f(X)=\mathrm{Tr}\left(X^r\right)^q$ and the uniform distributions on these same Schatten balls for $N$ large enough. While the case $p&gt;3$, $r=2, q=1$ was proven in [Dadoun, Fradelizi, Gu\'edon, Zitt 23'], we address in the present paper the case $p\geq2$, $r\geq1$, $q\geq1$. The proofs are based on a link between the moments of norms of uniform laws on $p$-Schatten balls and the $\beta$-ensembles with Freud weights.</description>

      <title>The ergodicity of Orlicz sequence spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that non-Hilbertian separable Orlicz sequence spaces are ergodic, i.e., the equivalence relation $\mathbb{E}_0$ Borel reduces to the isomorphism relation between subspaces of every such space. This is done by exhibiting non-Hilbertian asymptotically Hilbertian subspaces in those spaces, and appealing to a result by Anisca. In particular, each non-Hilbertian Orlicz sequence space contains continuum many pairwise non-isomorphic subspaces.
  As a consequence, we prove that the twisted Hilbert spaces $\ell_2(\phi)$ constructed by Kalton and Peck are either Hilbertian, or ergodic. This applies in particular to the Kalton--Peck space $Z_2$ and all twisted Hilbert spaces generated by complex interpolation between Orlicz sequence spaces.</description>

Abstract: For every couple of Hausdorff functions $ \psi$ and $\varphi $ verifying some mild assumptions, there exists a compact subset $ K $ of the Baire space such that the $ \varphi$-Hausdorff measure and the $ \psi$-packing measure on $ K$ are both finite and positive. Such examples are then embedded in any infinite dimensional Banach space to answer positively a question of Fan on the existence of metric spaces with arbitrary scales.</description>

Abstract: We study the Hilbert space obtained by completing the space of all smooth and compactly supported functions on the real line with respect to the hermitian form arising from the Weil distribution under the Riemann hypothesis. It turns out that this Hilbert space is isomorphic to a de Branges space by a composition of the Fourier transform and a simple map.This result is applied to state a new equivalence condition for the Riemann hypothesis in a series of equalities.</description>

      <title>Sharp conditions for the BBM formula and asymptotics of heat content-type energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $p\in[1,\infty)$, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions on the non-negative measurable kernels $(\rho_t)_{t\in(0,1)}$ ensuring convergence of the associated Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu (BBM) energies $(\mathscr{F}_{t,p})_{t\in(0,1)}$ to a variant of the $p$-Dirichlet energy on $\mathbb R^N$ as $t\to0^+$ both in the pointwise and in the $\Gamma$-sense. We also devise sufficient conditions on $(\rho_t)_{t\in(0,1)}$ yielding local compactness in $L^p(\mathbb R^N)$ of sequences with bounded BBM energy. Moreover, we give sufficient conditions on $(\rho_t)_{t\in(0,1)}$ implying pointwise and $\Gamma$-convergence and compactness of $(\mathscr{F}_{t,p})_{t\in(0,1)}$ when the limit $p$-energy is of non-local type. Finally, we apply our results to provide asymptotic formulas in the pointwise and $\Gamma$-sense for heat content-type energies both in the local and non-local settings.</description>
