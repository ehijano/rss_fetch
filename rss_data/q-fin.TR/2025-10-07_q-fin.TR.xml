      <title>Risk-Sensitive Option Market Making with Arbitrage-Free eSSVI Surfaces: A Constrained RL and Stochastic Control Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate option market making as a constrained, risk-sensitive control problem that unifies execution, hedging, and arbitrage-free implied-volatility surfaces inside a single learning loop. A fully differentiable eSSVI layer enforces static no-arbitrage conditions (butterfly and calendar) while the policy controls half-spreads, hedge intensity, and structured surface deformations (state-dependent rho-shift and psi-scale). Executions are intensity-driven and respond monotonically to spreads and relative mispricing; tail risk is shaped with a differentiable CVaR objective via the Rockafellar--Uryasev program. We provide theory for (i) grid-consistency and rates for butterfly/calendar surrogates, (ii) a primal--dual grounding of a learnable dual action acting as a state-dependent Lagrange multiplier, (iii) differentiable CVaR estimators with mixed pathwise and likelihood-ratio gradients and epi-convergence to the nonsmooth objective, (iv) an eSSVI wing-growth bound aligned with Lee's moment constraints, and (v) policy-gradient validity under smooth surrogates. In simulation (Heston fallback; ABIDES-ready), the agent attains positive adjusted P\&amp;L on most intraday segments while keeping calendar violations at numerical zero and butterfly violations at the numerical floor; ex-post tails remain realistic and can be tuned through the CVaR weight. The five control heads admit clear economic semantics and analytic sensitivities, yielding a white-box learner that unifies pricing consistency and execution control in a reproducible pipeline.</description>

      <title>Tail-Safe Hedging: Explainable Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning with a White-Box CBF--QP Safety Layer in Arbitrage-Free Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Tail-Safe, a deployability-oriented framework for derivatives hedging that unifies distributional, risk-sensitive reinforcement learning with a white-box control-barrier-function (CBF) quadratic-program (QP) safety layer tailored to financial constraints. The learning component combines an IQN-based distributional critic with a CVaR objective (IQN--CVaR--PPO) and a Tail-Coverage Controller that regulates quantile sampling through temperature tilting and tail boosting to stabilize small-$\alpha$ estimation. The safety component enforces discrete-time CBF inequalities together with domain-specific constraints -- ellipsoidal no-trade bands, box and rate limits, and a sign-consistency gate -- solved as a convex QP whose telemetry (active sets, tightness, rate utilization, gate scores, slack, and solver status) forms an auditable trail for governance. We provide guarantees of robust forward invariance of the safe set under bounded model mismatch, a minimal-deviation projection interpretation of the QP, a KL-to-DRO upper bound linking per-state KL regularization to worst-case CVaR, concentration and sample-complexity results for the temperature-tilted CVaR estimator, and a CVaR trust-region improvement inequality under KL limits, together with feasibility persistence under expiry-aware tightening. Empirically, in arbitrage-free, microstructure-aware synthetic markets (SSVI $\to$ Dupire $\to$ VIX with ABIDES/MockLOB execution), Tail-Safe improves left-tail risk without degrading central performance and yields zero hard-constraint violations whenever the QP is feasible with zero slack. Telemetry is mapped to governance dashboards and incident workflows to support explainability and auditability. Limitations include reliance on synthetic data and simplified execution to isolate methodological contributions.</description>
