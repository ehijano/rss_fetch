      <title>Coordinated Space and Ground-Based Monitoring of Accretion Bursts in a Protoplanetary Disk: Establishing Mid-Infrared Hydrogen Lines as Accretion Diagnostics for JWST-MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish and calibrate mid-infrared hydrogen recombination lines observed with JWST as accretion tracers for pre-main-sequence stars that accrete from circumstellar disks. This work is part of a coordinated, multi-observatory effort that monitored the well-known binary system DQ Tau over three orbital periods, capturing its periodic accretion bursts. In this first paper, we present 9 epochs of MIRI-MRS spectra with near-simultaneous LCO photometry and VLT X-Shooter spectroscopy. This program caught exceptional accretion variability, spanning almost two orders of magnitude between the peak of the first periastron accretion burst and the following quiescent phases. The MIRI spectra show H I line luminosities that vary in step with the accretion-luminosity time series measured with LCO and X-Shooter. The tight correlation with accretion and the large line widths, which MIRI resolves for the first time, support an accretion-flow origin for mid-infrared H I transitions. Combining these three exceptional datasets, we derive accurate relations between mid-infrared line and accretion luminosities for three H I transitions (10-7, 7-6, 8-7), and improve upon a previous relation based on Spitzer spectra. These new relations equip the community with a direct measurement of the accretion luminosity from MIRI-MRS spectra. A MIRI-derived accretion luminosity is fundamental for time-domain chemistry studies, as well as for studies of accretion in embedded/distant sources that are currently inaccessible in the optical. With these new relations, we provide accretion luminosities for an archival sample of 38 MRS spectra of protoplanetary disks published to date.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of actinides and short-lived radionuclides during i-process nucleosynthesis in AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complex interplay between mixing and nucleosynthesis is at work in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. In addition to the slow neutron capture process (s-process), the intermediate neutron capture process (i-process) can develop during protons ingestion events (PIEs). In this paper, after quickly reviewing the different modes of production of heavy elements in AGB stars that were identified so far, we investigate the synthesis of actinides and other short-lived radioactive nuclei (SLRs, $^{60}$Fe, $^{107}$Pd, $^{126}$Sn, $^{129}$I, $^{135}$Cs and $^{182}$Hf) during i-process nucleosynthesis. AGB stellar models with initial masses $1 \leq M_{\rm ini}/M_{\odot} \leq 3$, metallicities $-3 \leq $ [Fe/H] $ \leq 0$ and different overshoot strengths were computed with the stellar evolution code STAREVOL. During PIEs, a nuclear network of 1160 isotopes is used and coupled to the transport equations. We found that AGB models with [Fe/H] $&lt;-2$ can synthesize actinides with sometimes abundances greater than solar. The $^{60}$Fe yield scales with the initial metallicity while the $^{107}$Pd, $^{126}$Sn, $^{129}$I, $^{135}$Cs and $^{182}$Hf yields follow a similar pattern as a function of metallicity, with a production peak at [Fe/H] $\simeq -1.3$. At [Fe/H] $&lt;-1$, the fraction of odd Ba isotopes $f_{\rm Ba,odd}$ is predicted to vary between 0.6 and 0.8 depending on the initial mass and metallicity. Nuclear uncertainties on our $1 M_{\odot}$, [Fe/H] $=-2.5$ model lead to $f_{\rm Ba,odd}$ ranging between 0.27 and 0.76, which is clearly above the s-process value. AGB stars experiencing PIEs appear to be potential producers of actinides and SLRs, particularly at low metallicity (except for $^{60}$Fe). Galactic chemical evolution modeling are required to assess their possible contribution to the galactic enrichment.</description>

      <title>Revisiting open clusters within 200 pc in the solar neighbourhood with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a membership identification method and apply it for 30 open clusters (OCs) within 200 pc of the Sun using astrometric data of Gaia DR3. By accounting for projection effects that distort apparent stellar motions, our approach converts astrometric data into accurate five-dimensional positions and velocities. This approach enables better identification of members in nearby open clusters. We then compare our refined membership lists with previous catalogs, revealing more members in most open clusters, but also the identification of elongated structures in Melotte 25 (Hyades), NGC 2632 (Praesepe), Melotte 111 (Coma Berenices), Platais 3, Melotte 22 (Pleiades), NGC 2451A, Platais 9, IC 2391, Platais 8, UPK 640, HSC 2986, which we studied in detail. An analysis of the ages of their members reveals the members within and outside of the tidal radius are distinctly coeval, further validating our methodology. This study suggests that for OCs in the solar neighborhood, correcting for the projection effect is very important for identification of OC members.</description>

      <title>Seismic constraints on the spin evolution of slowly rotating young intermediate-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\delta$ Scuti stars are hot, rapid rotators and are a poorly understood class of pulsators. Asteroseismology provides the only means with which to probe their interior dynamics. However, their complex and unexplained oscillation patterns restrict analyses to only a small fraction with interpretable pulsations. Here, we identify 5381 $\delta$ Scuti stars from 63 sectors of TESS observations, of which 300 had interpretable oscillations, with 24 showing rotational splittings. We inferred compositions and ages ($\tau$) for the 300 stars finding them in near-ZAMS states (Bedding et al. 2020), and measured the mean envelope rotation rates ($&lt; f_{rot} &gt;$) for 24 of them. Analyzing their age-dependent rotation, we found these stars essentially exhibit weak-to-no spindown, while evolving past the ZAMS across a narrow time-span during which they show regular pulsations. A quantitative fit to their spin-evolution results in a trend $f_{rot} (d^{-1}) \propto (\tau/{Gyr})^{-0.048 \pm 0.016}$, much slower than the spindown of cooler late-type stars due to magnetic braking (Skumanich's law: $f_{rot} (d^{-1}) \propto (\tau/{Gyr})^{-0.5}$). Based on stellar evolution calculations, we show this weak spindown is consistent with the gradual increase in their moment-of-inertia.</description>

      <title>Exploring the origin of multi-periodic pulsations during a white-light flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explored the quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) at multiple periods during an X4.0 flare on 2024 May 10 (SOL2024-05-10T06:27), which occurred in the complex active region of NOAA 13664. The flare radiation reveals five prominent periods in multiple wavelengths. A 8-min QPP is simultaneously detected in wavelengths of HXR, radio, UV/EUV, Lya, and white light, which may be associated with nonthermal electrons periodically accelerated by intermittent magnetic reconnection that is modulated by the slow wave. A quasi-period at 14 minutes is observed in the SXR and high-temperature EUV wavebands, and it may be caused by repeatedly heated plasmas in hot flare loops. A quasiperiod at about 18 minutes is only observed by STIX, with reconstructed SXR images suggesting that the 18-min period pulsations should be considered as different flares. Meanwhile, a 3-min QPP is simultaneously detected in wavelengths of HXR, radio, and UV/ EUV, which is directly modulated by the slow magnetoacoustic wave leaking from sunspot umbrae. At last, a 2-min QPP is simultaneously detected in HXR and radio emissions during the pre-flare phase, which is possibly generated by a quasi-periodic regime of magnetic reconnection that is triggered by the kink wave.</description>

      <title>The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs. Cluster analysis of signals from spectral activity indicators to search for shared periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multitude of spectral activity indicators are routinely computed nowadays from the spectra generated as part of planet-hunting radial velocity surveys. Searching for shared periods among them can help to robustly identify astrophysical quantities of interest, such as the stellar rotation period. However, this identification can be complicated due to the fact that many different peaks occurring in the periodograms. This is especially true in the presence of aliasing and spurious signals caused by environmental influences affecting the instrument. Our goal is to test a clustering algorithm to find signals with the same periodicity, (i.e. with the stellar rotation period) in the periodograms of a large number of activity indicators. On this basis, we have looked to evaluate the correlations between activity indicators and fundamental stellar parameters. We used generalised Lomb-Scargle periodograms to find periodic signals in 24 activity indicators, spanning the VIS and NIR channels of the CARMENES spectrograph. Common periods were subsequently determined by a machine learning algorithm for density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). The clustering analysis of the signals apparent in the spectral activity indicators is a powerful tool for the detection of stellar rotation periods. It is straightforward to implement and can be easily automated, so that large data sets can be analysed. For a sample of 136 stars, we were able to recover the stellar rotation period in a total of 59 cases, including 3 with a previously unknown rotation period. In addition, we analysed spurious signals frequently occurring at the period of one year and its integer fractions, concluding that they are likely aliases of one underlying signal. Furthermore, we reproduced the results of several previous studies on the relationships between activity indicators and the stellar characteristics.</description>

      <title>Radio dimming associated with filament eruptions in the meter and decimeter wavebands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filament eruptions are considered to be a common phenomenon on the Sun and other stars, yet they are rarely directly imaged in the meter and decimeter wavebands. Using imaging data from the DAocheng solar Radio Telescope (DART) in the 150-450 MHz frequency range, we present two eruptive filaments that manifest as radio dimmings (i.e., emission depressions). Simultaneously, portions of these eruptive filaments are discernible as dark features in the chromospheric images. The sun-as-a-star flux curves of brightness temperature, derived from the DART images, exhibit obvious radio dimmings. The dimming depths range from 1.5% to 8% of the background level and show a negative correlation with radio frequencies and a positive correlation with filament areas. Our investigation suggests that radio dimming is caused by free-free absorption during filament eruptions obscuring the solar corona. This may provide a new method for detecting stellar filament eruptions.</description>

      <title>Tayler instability as possible reason for the period changes in Ap star 56 Ari</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical mechanism responsible for the photometric period changes in chemically peculiar star 56 Ari was searched. It was previously shown that rate of the star's period increase is few orders of magnitude larger than the rates expected from the evolutionary changes of the angular momentum or due to magnetic braking. Also no secular changes were detected in the surface structure or visibility of chemical spots which are responsible for the rotational modulation of stellar brightness. We hypothesise that period changes in 56 Ari are caused by the drift of surface magnetic and associated abundance structures as a result of the kink-type (Tayler) instability of the background magnetic field in the radiative zone of the star. Results of the numerical simulation presented in the paper yield growth and drift rates of the most rapidly developing non-axisymmetric mode of the instability, consistent with the observed rate of period changes in 56 Ari. The surface geometry of the 56 Ari magnetic field is also reproduces in the calculations. The proposed mechanism may also be used to explain the character of period changes in other Ap/Bp stars demonstrating such an effect.</description>

      <title>Modelling Stellar Irradiances II: Correlations of solar irradiances with proxies of activity along a cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a pressing need to model X-ray Ultra-Violet (XUV: 1-30 nm) stellar irradiances, given the scarcity of current measurements. One of the measurable effects of a stellar cycle is the significant (more than one order of magnitude) variation in XUV irradiance. As a first step in modelling stellar irradiances, we present EUV irradiances in a sample of strong spectral lines formed in different layers and regions of the solar atmosphere, obtained from Solar Dynamics Observatory Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (SDO EVE). These irradiances span half a solar cycle. We present correlations with several proxies of solar activity, such as the Mg II index, sunspot numbers, and cm radio fluxes. Among these, the sunspot number proves to be the poorest proxy, whereas the Mg II index is a very good proxy for coronal lines (hotter temperature lines). We find a relatively strong linear relationship, which enables us to build a model essential for various applications. Additionally, we compare our results with the previous EUV standard solar irradiances reported by Del Zanna and Andretta 2014, derived from Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (SOHO CDS) data, as well as historical records from the literature. We have also run a DEM analysis on Quiet Sun (QS) and Active Regions (AR) and list the blends and formation temperatures for the strong lines. Finally we provide a simple routine for deriving the irradiances of the strong lines based on proxy values.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic predictions for a massive main-sequence merger product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The products of stellar mergers between two massive main-sequence (MS) stars appear as seemingly normal MS stars after a phase of thermal relaxation, if not for certain peculiarities. Since these peculiarities are not limited to the merger product's surface, we use asteroseismology to predict how the differences in the internal structure of a merger product and a genuine single star manifest via properties of non-radial stellar pulsations. We mapped the result of a 3D MHD stellar merger simulation between a 9 and an 8 solar-mass MS star to 1D and evolved it through the MS. We compare the predicted pressure (p) and gravity (g) modes for the merger product model with those predicted for a corresponding genuine single-star model. The p-mode frequencies are consistently lower for the merger product than for the genuine single star, and the differences between them are more than a thousand times larger than the current best observational uncertainties for measured mode frequencies of this kind. Even though g-mode period spacing differences vary in value and sign throughout the MS, they, too, are larger than the current best observational uncertainties for such long-period modes. This, combined with additional variability in the merger product's period spacing patterns, shows the potential of identifying merger products in future-forward modelling. We also attempt to replicate the merger product's structure using three widely applied 1D merger prescriptions and repeat the asteroseismic analysis. Although none of the 1D prescriptions reproduces the entire merger product's structure, we conclude that the prescription with shock heating shows the highest potential, provided that it can be calibrated on binary-evolution-driven 3D merger simulations. Our work should be expanded to encompass the various possible merger product structures predicted to exist in the Universe. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Long-term evolution of the temperature structure in magnetized protoplanetary disks and its implication for the dichotomy of planetary composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks play a crucial role in planet formation. In addition to stellar irradiation, accretion heating is also believed to significantly affect the disk thermal structure and planet formation processes. We present the long-term evolution (from the beginning of Class II to disk dissipation) of thermal structures in laminar magnetized disks to investigate where and when accretion heating is a dominant heat source. In addition, we demonstrate how the difference in disk structures affects the water content of forming planets. We consider the mass loss by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and photoevaporative disk winds to investigate the influence of wind mass loss on the accretion rate profile. Our model includes the recent understanding of accretion heating; that is, the accretion heating in the laminar disks is less efficient than that in turbulent disks because of surface heating at optically thinner altitudes and energy removal by disk winds. We find that the accretion heating is weaker than irradiation heating at around 1--10 au even in the early Class II disk, whereas it can affect the temperature in the inner 1-au region. We also find that the MHD-wind mass loss in the inner region can significantly reduce the accretion rate compared with that in the outer region, in turn reducing accretion heating. Furthermore, using evolving disk structures, we demonstrate that updating accretion heating models impacts the evolution of protoplanets. In particular, we find that our model may produce a dichotomy of the planetary water fraction of 1--10 $M_\oplus$.</description>

      <title>ZTF IC 10 variable catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To study how massive variable stars effect their environment, we search for variability among Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) sources located within the optical extent of a nearby starburst galaxy IC 10. We present the ZTF IC 10 catalog, which classifies 1516 $r$ band sources and 864 $g$ band sources within a $225''$ radius around IC 10 into three categories: 1388 (767) $r$ ($g$) band non-variables, 150 (85) $r$ ($g$) band non-periodic variables, and 37 (12) $r$ ($g$) band periodic variables. Among them 101 (48) $r$ ($g$) band non-periodic variables, and 22 (4) $r$ ($g$) band periodic variables are inside IC 10. We verify our classification by cross-matching with previous variability catalogs and machine learning powered classifications. Various analysis including population demographics, color-magnitude diagrams, and cross matching with a set of different surveys and database such as Gaia, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and SIMBAD are also presented. Based on source density and parallax, we distinguish sources within IC 10 from non-IC 10 sources. For IC 10 sources, we highlight flaring super giants, a source with long secondary period, periodic super giants including possible S Doradus luminous blue variable and candidate Miras. For non-IC 10 sources, we present super red sources and compact objects such as a possible long period subdwarf and a periodic X-ray source. The catalog can serve as a useful database to study the connection between various type of massive stars and their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>Sunward Flows in the Magnetosheath Associated with Magnetic Pressure Gradient and Magnetosheath Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A density structure within the magnetic cloud of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection impacted Earth and caused significant perturbations in plasma boundaries. We describe the effects of this structure on the magnetosheath plasma downstream of the bow shock using spacecraft observations. During this event, the bow shock breathing motion is evident due to the changes in the upstream dynamic pressure. A magnetic enhancement forms in the inner magnetosheath and ahead of a plasma compression region. The structure has the characteristics of a fast magnetosonic shock wave, propagating earthward and perpendicular to the background magnetic field further accelerating the already heated magnetosheath plasma. Following these events, a sunward motion of the magnetosheath plasma is observed. Ion distributions show that both the high density core population as well as the high energy tail of the distribution have a sunward directed flow indicating that the sunward flows are caused by magnetic field line expansion in the very low $\beta$ magnetosheath plasma. Rarefaction effects and enhancement of the magnetic pressure in the magnetosheath result in magnetic pressure gradient forcing that drives the expansion of magnetosheath magnetic field lines. This picture is supported by a reasonable agreement between the estimated plasma accelerations and the magnetic pressure gradient force.</description>

      <title>Multi-MeV electrons observed by CRRES during solar cycle 22</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) observed the response of the Van Allen radiation belts to peak solar activity within solar cycle 22. This study analyses the occurrence and loss timescales of relativistic electrons within the CRRES High Energy Electron Fluxometer (HEEF) dataset, including during several large geomagnetic storms that flooded the slot region with multi-MeV electrons and which allow the first definitive multi-MeV lifetimes to be calculated in this region. The HEEF loss timescales are otherwise broadly in agreement with those from later solar cycles but differences include longer-lasting sub-MeV electrons near the inner region of the outer belt and faster decaying multi-MeV electrons near geosynchronous orbit. These differences are associated with higher levels of geomagnetic activity, a phenomenon that enables the spread in the results to be parameterised accordingly. The timescales generally appear well-bounded by Kp-dependent theoretical predictions but the variability within the spread is however not always well-ordered by geomagnetic activity. This reveals the limits of pitch-angle diffusion in accounting for the decay of elevated electron fluxes following geomagnetic storms.</description>

      <title>Optical constraints on the coldest metal-poor population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coldest metal-poor population made of T and Y dwarfs are archaeological tracers of our Galaxy because they are very old and have kept the pristine material. The optical properties of these objects are important to characterise their atmospheric properties. We aim at characterising further the optical properties of ultracool metal-poor population with deep far-red optical images and parallax determinations.
  With a two-year baseline, we solved trigonometric parallaxes of the five metal-poor T dwarf candidates using Calar-Alto 3.5-m telescope. We obtained $z'$-band photometry for the other 12 metal-poor T dwarf candidates using 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias, the 8.2-m European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope, and the Dark Energy Survey, increasing the sample of T subdwarfs with optical photometry from 12 to 24. We report a 3-$\sigma$ limit for the only potential metal-poor Y dwarf, a.k.a., the Accident in five optical bands using the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We compared these objects with a known subdwarf benchmark and solar-metallicity dwarfs in colour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams, as well as with state-of-the-art theoretical ultracool models. We confirm three more T subdwarfs and show that the Accident is subluminous compared to the current Y dwarf limit. Additionally, we propose two more Y subdwarf candidates.
  We emphasise that the $z_{PS1} - W1$ colour combining with the $W1 - W2$ colour could break the metallicity-temperature degeneracy for T and possibly for Y dwarfs. The $z_{PS1} - W1$ colour shifts redward when metallicity decreases for a certain temperature, which is not predicted by models. The Accident has the reddest $z_{PS1} - W1$ colour among our sample. The $z_{PS1} - W1$ colour will be useful to search for other examples of this cold and old population in upcoming and existing deep optical and infrared large-area surveys.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional simulations of accretion disks in pre-CE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Before a binary system enters into a common envelope (CE) phase, accretion from the primary star onto the companion star through Roche Lobe overflow (RLOF) will lead to the formation of an accretion disk, which may generate jets. Accretion before and during the CE may alter the outcome of the interaction. Previous studies have considered different aspects of this physical mechanism. Here we study the properties of an accretion disk formed via 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the RLOF mass transfer between a 7 M$_\odot$, red supergiant star and a 1.4 M$_\odot$, neutron star companion. We simulate only the volume around the companion for improved resolution. We use a 1D implicit MESA simulation of the evolution of the system during 30,000 years between the on-set of the RLOF and the CE to guide the binary parameters and the mass-transfer rate, while we simulate only 21 years of the last part of the RLOF in 3D using an ideal gas isothermal equation of state. We expect that a pre-CE disk under these parameters will have a mass of $\sim 5\times 10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ and a radius of $\sim$40 R$_\odot$ with a scale height of $\sim$5 R$_\odot$. The temperature profile of the disk is shallower than that predicted by the formalism of Shakura and Sunyaev, but more reasonable cooling physics would need to be included. We stress test these results with respect to a number of physical and numerical parameters, as well as simulation choices, and we expect them to be reasonable within a factor of a few for the mass and 15% for the radius. We also contextualize our results within those presented in the literature, in particular with respect to the dimensionality of simulations and the adiabatic index. We discuss the measured accretion rate in the context of the Shakura and Sunyaev formalism and debate the viscous mechanisms at play, finishing with a list of prospects for future work.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Reconnection in a Compact Magnetic Dome: Chromospheric Emissions and High-velocity Plasma Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection at small spatial scales is a fundamental driver of energy release and plasma dynamics in the lower solar atmosphere. We present observations of a brightening in an active region, captured in high-resolution data from the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) using the Visible Broadband Imager (VBI) and the Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP). The event exhibits Ellerman bomb-like morphology in the H$\beta$ filter, associated with flux cancellation between a small negative polarity patch adjacent to opposite-polarity plage. Additionally, it displays enhanced emissions in Ca II K, hot elongated features containing Alfv\'enic plasma flows, and cooler blue-shifted structures. We employ multi-line, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) inversions of the spectropolarimetric data to infer the stratification of the physical parameters of the atmosphere. Furthermore, we use the photospheric vector magnetogram inferred from the ViSP spectra as a boundary condition for nonlinear force-free field extrapolations, revealing the three-dimensional distribution of squashing factors. We find significant enhancements in temperature, velocity, and microturbulence confined to the upper photosphere and low chromosphere. Our findings provide observational evidence of low-altitude magnetic reconnection along quasi-separatrix layers in a compact fan-spine-type configuration, highlighting the complex interplay between magnetic topology, energy release, and plasma flows.</description>

      <title>A systematic method to identify runaways from star clusters produced from single-binary interactions: A case study of M67</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One hypothesis for runaway stars (RSs) is that they are ejected from star clusters with high velocities relative to the cluster center-of-mass motion. There are two competing mechanisms for their production: supernova-based ejections in binaries, where one companion explodes, leaves no remnant, and launches the other companion at the instantaneous orbital velocity, and the disintegration of triples (or higher-order multiples), which produces a recoiled runaway binary (RB) and an RS. We search for RS candidates using data from the Gaia DR3 survey with a focus on triple disintegration since in this case the product is always a binary and a single star that should be moving in opposite directions. We created a systematic methodology to look for candidate RS-RB runaway pairs produced from the disintegration of bound three-body systems formed from single-binary interactions based on momentum conservation and causality. The method we use is general and can be applied to any cluster with a 5D kinematic data set. We used our criteria to search for these pairs in a 150 pc circular field of view surrounding the open cluster M67, which we used as a benchmark cluster to test the robustness of our method. Our results reveal only one RS-RB pair that is consistent with all of our selection criteria out of an initial sample of $10^8$ pairs.</description>

      <title>Doppler Shifted Transient Sodium Detection by KECK/HIRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carried out the first high-resolution transit observations of the exoplanet WASP-49 Ab with Keck/HIRES. Upon custom wavelength calibration we achieve a Doppler RV precision of $&lt;$ 60 ${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$. This is an improvement in RV stability of roughly 240 ${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$ with respect to the instrument standard. We report an average sodium flux residual of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD}/ \mathcal{F}_{\star} (\lambda) \sim$ 3.2 $\pm$ 0.4 $\%$ (8.0 $\sigma$) comparable to previous studies. Interestingly, an average Doppler shift of -6.2 $\pm$ 0.5 ${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$ (12.4 $\sigma$) is identified offset from the exoplanet rest frame. The velocity residuals \textit{in time} trace a blueshift (v$_{\Gamma, ingress} \sim$ -10.3 $\pm$ 1.9 ${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$) to redshift (v$_{\Gamma, egress} \sim$ +4.1 $\pm$ 1.5 ${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$) suggesting the origin of the observed sodium is unlikely from the atmosphere of the planet. The average Na light curves indicate a depth of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD} /\mathcal{F}_{\star} (t) \sim$ 0.47 $\pm$ 0.04 % (11.7 $\sigma$) enduring $\lesssim$ 90 minutes with a half-max duration of $\sim$ 40.1 minutes. Frequent high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be able to characterize the periodicity of the observed Doppler shifts. Considering the origin of the transient sodium gas is of unknown geometry, a co-orbiting natural satellite may be a likely source.</description>
