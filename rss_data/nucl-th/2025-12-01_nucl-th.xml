      <title>Symmetry energy in dilute matter and the neutron skin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy density functional (EDF) theory provides a unified framework for the description of nuclei and of infinite nuclear matter. In principle, it facilitates direct connections between nuclear data and the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Although in practice traditional nuclear EDF theory has strained to describe finite nuclei and infinite systems at the same time, recently developed extended EDF models overcome many of the limitations of traditional models in that respect. A recent challenge to EDF and EoS studies has come entirely from within nuclear structure, namely how to account both for the relatively thin neutron skin in 48Ca as extracted by the CREX experiment and the relatively thick neutron skin of 208Pb exctracted by the PREX-II experiment. The discrepancy suggests a surface and structure effect. The present study shows that the puzzle can be resolved in a non-relativistic framework by revisiting the nuclear surface tension and diffuseness, as driven in part by the EoS in dilute matter well below the saturation point and in part by the isovector gradient terms and spin-orbit potential. Such effects have no bearing on the EoS near and above saturation.</description>

      <title>Study of $0^+$ and $8^-$ states in even-even $^{250-260}$No isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-lying $K^{\pi}=0^+$ and isomeric $8^-$ states in even-even isotopes $^{250-260}$No are explored within the Quasiparticle Random-Phase Approximation (QRPA) method with Skyrme parametrization SLy4. The deformations, single-particle (s-p) spectra and pairing in the isotopes are inspected. The calculations predict a pronounced minimum in the neutron pairing at $A$=252, 254, which significantly affects the properties of $0^+$ and $8^-$ states and leads to a correlation of their spectra. It is shown that $8^-$ isomers are basically low-energy two-quasiparticle (2qp) states. The appearance or absence of these isomers in $^{250-260}$No is explained as a combined effect of the s-p spectra and pairing. The collective $0^+$ states are predicted in all the isotopes as the lowest multipole non-rotational excitations. These states are interpreted as a superposition of pairing vibrations and $\beta$-vibrations. The results are in a reasonable agreement with available experimental data for $^{252,254}$No.</description>

      <title>Relations between three-particle interactions in nuclear matter to observable quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we use the framework of the Fermi liquid theory to derive model-independent relations between the slope parameters of the symmetry energy and of the incompressibility in nuclear matter to three-particle interaction parameters. Based on these relations, we present simple estimates and compare with the empirical information. In the second part, we discuss the general structure of the three-particle scattering amplitude in nuclear matter, and use methods similar to the Bethe-Brueckner-Goldstone theory to show how three-particle cluster diagrams emerge naturally in the Fermi liquid theory.</description>

      <title>NuclearConfectionery: Multi-stage Simulation Framework for Modeling Relativistic Heavy-ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the NuclearConfectionery, a modular framework for simulating the full dynamical evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Its core hydrodynamic module, CCAKE 2.0, represents a major advance over previous SPH-based relativistic hydrodynamic codes. CCAKE 2.0 simultaneously evolves energy-momentum and multiple conserved charges (B, S, Q) with a four-dimensional equation of state, and can be run in either Cartesian or hyperbolic coordinates, enabling consistent simulations from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan to LHC energies. We have implemented a particlization module that supports global BSQ charge conservation on the freeze-out surface; the resulting hadron ensemble is then propagated through a hadronic transport afterburner. A source term is included in the equations of motion to couple jets to the fluid, allowing simultaneous bulk and hard-probe evolution or, alternatively, for stopped baryons at low beam energies. The framework offers flexible choices of equations of motion (Israel-Stewart, DNMR, ADNH) and transport coefficients, along with GPU-ready performance via Kokkos/Cabana, offline equation of state inversion for 4D tables, and containerized portability. We validate the code with semi-analytical benchmarks (including BSQ Gubser and Landau-Khalatnikov solutions) and extensive convergence studies. The NuclearConfectionery provides a user-friendly, high-performance, open-source tool for event-by-event simulations across collision energies, offering flexibility to study QCD matter at both vanishing and finite densities.</description>

      <title>Constraining of Nuclear Matter Equations of State With Rotating Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars can be regarded as natural laboratories that enable us to investigate nuclear matter properties under extreme conditions that are otherwise impossible to access in terrestrial experiments. Astrophysical observations of neutron stars provide invaluable information on existing nuclear interaction models and equations of state (EoSs) at various densities. Most studies of neutron star structure employ the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation which describes spherically symmetric, non-rotating stars in hydrostatic equilibrium. However, since neutron stars rotate fast, they could experience significant centrifugal deformation, and axially-symmetric calculations are required for accurate description of internal structure. The Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method is well known for modeling rapidly-rotating compact objects in a fully general relativistic manner. In this contribution, we report results of KEH calculations for rapidly-rotating neutron stars using EoSs based on Gogny-type finite-range effective nucleon-nucleon interactions. Our results show that the mass-radius relation systematically changes with increasing angular velocity, highlighting the importance of including rotational effects when confronting theoretical EoSs with observational data.</description>

      <title>Accuracy, asymptotes, and applications of the Born approximations to the calculation of the Mott scattering cross section, the primary atomic displacement cross section, and the energy-loss straggling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first, second and third Born approximations of the Mott scattering cross section are considered. The relative error of all three Born approximations averaged by angles and energies is calculated for the first 30 elements of the Mendeleev periodic table of elements and also of the second and third-Born approximation for the first hundred elements of the Mendeleev table. The accuracy of the second and third Born approximations for calculating the normalized Mott scattering cross section are compared on the wide range of nuclei of elments. The accuracy of the Born approximations for calculating the Mott correction in the Bethe-Bloch formula for for the second Born approximation and the third approximation is analyzed. An expression is obtained for the cross section of the primary displacement of the atom in the third Born approximation. For iron, silver and lead, the cross section of the primary displacement of the atom for a number of electron energies is calculated. For a number of examples, it is calculated starting from the electron energy. The difference of the cross section is obtained by the asymptotic formula from by the McKinley-Feshbach formula, it will be less than one percent. Accuracy of the Born approximations for calculating energy-loss straggling is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Unmasking short-range correlations via initial-state fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although relativistic heavy-ion collisions have emerged as a powerful probe for studying nuclear structure, the potential influence of nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations (NN-SRCs) on the initial state has remained an open question. By incorporating NN-SRCs into the initial conditions, we demonstrate that higher-order fluctuations of the initial transverse size, $n$-particle $c_{E/S}\{n\}$, which can be directly mapped to final-state mean transverse momentum fluctuations, exhibit remarkable sensitivity to NN-SRCs. Quantitatively, $c_{E/S}\{3\}$ and $c_{E/S}\{4\}$ differ by more than 10\% between systems with and without NN correlations. Moreover, we report a universal scaling of these quantities with $A^{-1/3}$ and the average nuclear density, mirroring the connection between the SRC effect and the EMC effect in electron scatterings. This work establishes relativistic heavy-ion collisions as a new tool for probing nuclear structure and constraining two-body or many-body NN interactions across different energy scales and system sizes.</description>

      <title>Wavelet analysis of monopole strength in highly deformed $^{24}$Mg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental data on $\alpha$-particle inelastic scattering for monopole excitations in $^{24}$Mg in the excitation-energy region $E_{\rm x}$$=$$9$$-$$25$ MeV, obtained at the iThemba Laboratory for Accelerator Based Sciences (iThemba LABS), have been analyzed within a fully self-consistent quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) framework using two Skyrme parametrizations. A good overall agreement with the experimental data is achieved, particularly with the SkP$^{\delta}$ force, which corresponds to a low nuclear incompressibility of $K_{\infty}$$=$$202$ MeV. Extraction of energy scales, by means of wavelet analysis, characterizing the observed fine structure of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) as well as the low-energy region $10$$-$$18$ MeV of the deformation-induced monopole-quadrupole coupling (MQC) in order to investigate the damping mechanism contributing to their decay widths. Characteristic energy scales are extracted from the fine structure using continuous wavelet transforms. The experimental results are compared to QRPA calculations employing the Skyrme parameterizations SkP$^{\delta}$ and SVbas. A significant, if not decisive, impact of the MQC strength on the wavelet power spectra is observed across the entire excitation-energy range of $10$$-$$24$ MeV. Wavelet features derived from the QRPA and from unperturbed two-quasiparticle (2qp) monopole strengths are compared. The results demonstrate that the residual interaction plays a key role in reproducing realistic wavelet powers and characteristic energy scales. Overall, a continuous range of scales $\delta E$$=$$200$$-$$1000$ keV is obtained rather than distinct isolated scales. The deformation softness of $^{24}$Mg is found to significantly influence both the monopole strength distribution and the wavelet characteristics.</description>

      <title>Energy-momentum tensor form factor D(t) of proton and neutron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy-momentum tensor (EMT) form factor $D(t)$ is
  finite and negative in hadronic models and lattice QCD when only
  strong forces are included. However, when electromagnetic forces are
  considered, the $D(t)$ of charged hadrons undergoes a dramatic change:
  at small $t$, it changes sign and diverges like $1/\sqrt{-t}$ as shown
  for the proton in the classical model by Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula based on
  residual nuclear forces which can be understood as a mean field approach.
  We construct an analogous neutron model and show that this framework
  accurately explains the electromagnetic proton-neutron mass difference.
  We demonstrate that, after appropriately rescaling the residual nuclear
  forces, the model can reproduce lattice data on the nucleon $D(t)$ up to
  $(-t)\lesssim 1\,$GeV$^2$ as well as QED effects.
  Based on this realistic model description, we show that the proton and
  neutron $D(t)$ form factors are practically indistinguishable down to
  $(-t) \approx 10^{-4}\rm GeV^2$ far below what can currently be accessed
  experimentally. We conclude that in the foreseeable future the $D(t)$
  form factors of proton and neutron will practically
  look the same in experiments and phenomenology.</description>

      <title>QCD axions and domain walls in dense matter under compact stellar conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In compact stellar environments, the stability of dense QCD matter requires the simultaneous fulfillment of charge neutrality and beta equilibrium. In this work, we study how temperature and finite chemical potential affect QCD topology and axion properties within this medium, analyzing both cases with and without the charge neutrality condition. Our results show that the topological susceptibility and axion properties are highly sensitive to the critical behavior of the chiral phase transition in both cases. In particular, the axion mass is strongly suppressed near the transition, while the axion self-coupling constant develops a pronounced peak whose magnitude depends on the temperature and density of the medium. Remarkably, around the critical point at $T\simeq70$ MeV and $\mu\simeq346$ MeV, the self-coupling constant is enhanced by more than a factor of seven compared to its vacuum value, a feature that to the best of our knowledge has not been reported in previous studies. Such a strong amplification at the phase boundary indicates that axion-mediated interactions could play an important role in shaping the structure and stability of compact stars, with potential implications for their evolution and observable astrophysical signatures.</description>

      <title>Does the suppression shown at LHC in O-O collisions follow the systematics obtained for A-A collisions ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we want to see to what extent recent experimental results obtained for $\pi^{0}$ suppression in O-O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=5.36 TeV fit into the systematics for much heavier systems. The systematics with which the comparison is made was published a few years ago \cite{Pet_1} in terms of charged particles suppression $R_{AA}$ as a function of $\langle N_{part} \rangle$ and $\langle dN_{ch}/d\eta \rangle$ and the newly introduced $R_{AA}^N=\frac{(\frac{d^{2}N}{dp_{T}d\eta}/\langle \frac{dN_{ch}}{d\eta}\rangle)^{cen}}{(\frac{d^2N}{dp_Td\eta}/\langle\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\eta}\rangle)^{pp,INEL}}$ as a function of $\langle dN_{ch}/d\eta\rangle$. The values of $R_{AA}$ and $R_{AA}^N$ at $\langle dN_{ch}/d\eta\rangle$ and $\langle N_{part} \rangle$ experimentally measured and estimated by Glauber MC, respectively, for O-O collisions
  are in good agreement with the systematics obtained for
  A-A collisions.</description>

      <title>Topological production of charmonia with event-shape engineering in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV using PYTHIA8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production of heavy quarks (charm and beauty) in high-energy hadronic and nuclear collisions provides an excellent testing ground for the theory of strong interaction and validates models based on quantum chromodynamics. In this work, prompt and nonprompt production of $\rm{J/}\psi$ in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV are studied as a function of transverse spherocity using PYTHIA8. $\rm{J/}\psi$ is reconstructed via its electromagnetic decay to dielectrons and dimuons, in mid- and forward-rapidity, respectively. Transverse spherocity, an event shape observable, is used to distinguish hard QCD events from the softer, isotropic ones. In PYTHIA8, the production of $\rm{J/}\psi$ can be influenced by the average number of multiple parton interactions ($\langle N_{\rm mpi} \rangle$), owing to the underlying events (UE), which have a dominant contribution to particle production at lower transverse momentum. Since transverse spherocity is correlated to $\langle N_{\rm mpi} \rangle$, this can serve as an experimentally available tool for event selection to study the underlying QCD processes influencing the prompt and nonprompt $\rm{J/}\psi$ production. This study reveals the correlation between heavy-flavor production dynamics and topological event selection in $pp$ collisions using PYTHIA8, whose relevance awaits experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Relativistic recoil as a key to the fine-structure puzzle in muonic $^{90}\text{Zr}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-standing fine-structure anomaly in muonic $^{90}$Zr is resolved through a rigorous treatment of the relativistic-recoil effect. From a fit of ab initio QED calculations of the muonic $^{90}$Zr spectrum to precision measurements performed four decades ago, we extract a significantly more precise root-mean-square (rms) charge radius with 6-fold improvement in quality of the fit. A 2-parameter Fermi (2pF) distribution is assumed to model the nuclear charge density and yields a best-fit value of rms charge radius of $r_\text{rms}[^{90}\text{Zr}]=4.2732(7)$ fm ($\chi^2 /{\text{DoF}} = 0.995$), in agreement with the previous muonic spectroscopy value, but a factor $6$ more precise, and 3$\sigma$ larger than the accepted literature value. Additionally, the same analysis has been performed for $^{120}$Sn, where the extracted value of $r_\text{rms}[^{120}\text{Sn}]=4.6518(34)$ fm ($\chi^2 /{\text{DoF}} = 0.88$) is consistent with the accepted value. These results confirm our assumption that the muonic fine-structure puzzle arose from an incomplete treatment of QED effects and their uncertainties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work [B. J. P. Jones and J. A. Formaggio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 111801 (2025)], the possibility of superradiant neutrino emission from atomic condensates has been theoretically proposed. Subsequent analysis by Y. K. Lu, H. Lin, and W. Ketterle [arXiv:2510.21705] questioned this scenario, emphasizing the limiting role of the fermionic nature of the decayed atoms. In this study, we revisit the problem and discuss under which conditions collective emission phenomena might still emerge in cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>New Physics Searches via Beam Normal Spin Asymmetry in Bhabha Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the sensitivity of the beam normal spin asymmetry in Bhabha scattering to beyond the Standard Model (BSM) mediators, in the context of the JLab polarized positron program. A key property of this observable is that the Standard Model contribution exhibits a zero crossing at a fixed scattering angle, providing a clean, effectively background-free point for these searches. We consider scalar, vector and axial-vector mediators and present projected bounds, finding scalar and vector scenarios allowing to extend their search ranges significantly beyond existing constraints.</description>

      <title>Short-range production of three bottom mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous investigations of the three-body dynamics of $B$ mesons have shown that no Efimov effect arises in systems composed of three $B$ and $B^*$ mesons. This implies that the properties of such three-body systems can be described reliably in nonrelativistic effective field theory (NREFT) with two-body input alone, as three-body forces are strongly suppressed. In this work, we present leading-order predictions for the three-body point production rates of systems consisting of three $B$ and $B^*$ mesons. These predictions provide a novel way to experimentally probe the $B^{(*)}$-$\bar{B}^{(*)}$ interactions, which play a crucial role in the hadronic-molecule interpretation of the $T_{b\bar{b}1}(10610)$ and $T_{b\bar{b}1}(10650)$ states. Moreover, they provide a way to test the approximate conformal symmetry predicted for such systems at low energies experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate saturation effects in exclusive vector meson production in deep inelastic scattering (DIS), where we model fluctuations within the target protons as localized color-charge hotspots. Based on the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework and the dipole picture for vector meson production, we examine the dependencies of coherent and incoherent scattering cross sections on the momentum transfer. We draw conclusions on the effectiveness of our hot spot model and the strength of the suppression of the scattering cross sections caused by saturation effects. We find that saturation has mild effects in the given energy and charge-density ranges, but can also show that suppression becomes more prominent as the color-charge density inside the proton increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the phase structure and the equation of state (EoS) for dense two-color QCD at low temperatures using the lattice Monte Carlo simulations. A rich phase structure below the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of quark chemical potential has been revealed. In a high-density regime, we can see a superfluid phase, where the diquark condensate takes a non-zero expectation value. We have newly found that the speed of sound exceeds the conformal bound, which is the value of the relativistic free theory. This talk is based on Refs.~\cite{Iida:2022hyy, Iida:2024irv, Itou:2025vcy}.</description>

      <title>Analytical Soft Functions for Heavy-Quark Final States at Hadron Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first computation of the complete two-loop, fully-differential soft function describing the production of a heavy-quark pair in association with a color-singlet system at hadron colliders. This result constitutes one of the most complex soft functions known to date and it is obtained in closed analytic form for generic multi-dimensional kinematics. This allows us to obtain novel analytic results for the transverse-momentum-dependent and threshold soft functions in this class of processes. We further obtain a decomposition of the soft function into dipole and tripole color correlators, thereby supplying essential building blocks for processes involving a heavy-quark pair produced together with additional light jets at both hadron and lepton colliders. These results represent a key ingredient for advancing precision predictions for heavy-quark physics at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Dispersion effects in elastic electron scattering from $^{208}$Pb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dispersion corrections to elastic electron scattering from $^{208}$Pb at energies up to 150 MeV are estimated within the second-order Born approximation. All strong transient nuclear excited states with angular momentum up to $L=3$ and natural parity are taken into consideration. It is found that at small scattering angles the high-lying $L=1$ isovector states provide the dominant contribution to the dispersive change of the differential cross section and of the beam-normal spin asymmetry. At the backmost angles these changes are considerably smaller and are basically due to the isoscalar $L=2$ and, to a lesser extent, $L=3$ states. In comparison with the findings for $^{12}$C, the dispersive cross-section modifications for $^{208}$Pb are significantly larger, while the spin-asymmetry changes are much smaller at all angles. The latter originates from the destructive interference of the multipole contributions in $^{208}$Pb that switch sign when proceeding from $L$ to $L+1$. This mechanism might be the origin of the small beam-normal spin asymmetries recently measured in ${}^{208}$Pb at much larger energies.</description>

Abstract: In July 2025 the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will collide $^{16}$O$^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne$^{20}$Ne isotopes in a quest to understand the physics of ultrarelativistic light ion collisions. One particular feature is that there are many smaller isotopes with the exact same charge over mass ratio that potentially can be produced and contaminate the beam composition. Using the Trajectum framework together with the GEMINI code we provide an estimate of the production cross-section and its consequences. A potential benefit could be the interesting measurement of the multiplicity and mean transverse momentum of $^{16}$O$^{4}$He collisions.</description>

      <title>Polarized Electron Scattering from Light Nuclei at High Energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical approach to investigate the scattering of polarized electrons from light nuclei using the multipole expansion for the scattering cross section within the framework of the unified electroweak theory. Scattering processes corresponding to different electron polarizations are analyzed and compared with the unpolarized electron scattering investigated earlier. Besides, the contribution of both polarized and unpolarized terms to the scattering cross section is examined. Numerical calculations for stable $^{6,7}$Li and unstable $^7$Be nuclei using the Weinberg-Salam model show that the longitudinal polarization and weak interaction are not explicitly correlated when electrons scatter at $ \theta \simeq 0^{\circ}$ across all energy scales. A strong correlation emerges at the other scattering angles when the electron energy exceeds 10 GeV. This study provides additional information about nuclear structure and uncovers the role of electron polarization and its correlation with the weak interaction in each process, thus offering a more complete picture of electron-nucleus scattering.</description>

      <title>A Bottom-Up EFT Approach To Superdense Baryonic Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How to arrive at the densest matter in massive compact stars starting from Walecka's linear $\omega$-$\sigma$ mean-field model is described in a series of arguments anchored on hidden local symmetry, hidden scale symmetry and emergent parity-doublet symmetry. I follow the bottom-up approach from chiral symmetry with pions, coupled to hidden local and scale symmetry degrees of freedom. Exploiting the renormalization-group treatment \`a la Shankar and Polchinski of the fermionic interactions on the Fermi sphere, leading to Landau-Migdal Fermi-liquid, one obtains a sort of generalized ``Density Functional" that allows via a topology change hadrons transform to quarks without phase changes at the center of massive stars. The highly dense matter is ``pseudo-conformal" with the sound velocity $v_{pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$ but the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is not equal to zero, hence the matter is non-conformal.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity and electric conductivity of quark matter at finite temperature and chemical potential with QCD phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Beam Energy Scan phase II (BES-II) experiments at RHIC STAR, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced with changing collision energies may probe different regions of the QCD phase diagram. Correspondingly, studying the transport coefficients of quark matter in these regions will contribute to extracting the QCD phase structure through hydrodynamic approaches. We investigate the shear viscosity and electric conductivity within the framework of kinetic theory with the relaxation time approximation, in particular their behaviors near the Mott and first-order phase transitions with a spinodal structure as well as along the isentropic trajectories. To derived the scattering cross-section under different conditions, the temperature and chemical potential dependent masses of quarks, antiquarks and exchanged mesons are calculated in the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona Lasinio (PNJL) model. The numerical results indicate that, at small chemical potential, the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\eta/s$) has a minimum near the Mott phase transition and increases rapidly in the lower-temperature side of the chiral crossover phase transition. At large chemical potential (high baryon density), $\eta/s$ in the QGP phase is dominated by temperature, and the value of $\eta/s$ is greatly enhanced at low temperatures. At intermediate temperature and chemical potential near the QCD phase transition, the behavior of $\eta/s$ is influenced by the competition between temperature, density, and QCD phase transition. The electirc conductivity ($\sigma/T$) roughly exhibits similar characteristics to $\eta/s$ in the QCD phase diagram, whereas the dimensionless ratio of $\eta/s$ to $\sigma/T$ decreases monotonically with growing temperature, approaching a constant in the high-temperature limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions remains challenging due to substantial background contributions that obscure the expected signal. In this Letter, we present a novel machine learning approach for constructing optimized observables that significantly enhance CME detection capabilities. By parameterizing generic observables constructed from flow harmonics and optimizing them to maximize the signal-to-background ratio, we systematically develop CME-sensitive measures that outperform conventional methods. Using simulated data from the Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics framework, our machine learning observables demonstrate up to 90\% higher sensitivity to CME signals compared to traditional $\gamma$ and $\delta$ correlators, while maintaining minimal background contamination. The constructed observables provide physical insight into optimal CME detection strategies, and offer a promising path forward for experimental searches of CME at RHIC and the LHC.</description>

Abstract: We report nuclear charge radii for the isotopes $^{104-134}$Sn, measured using two different collinear laser spectroscopy techniques at ISOLDE-CERN. These measurements clarify the arch-like trend in charge radii along the isotopic chain and reveal an odd-even staggering that is more pronounced near the $N=50$ and $N=82$ shell closures. The observed local trends are well described by both nuclear density functional theory and valence space in-medium similarity renormalization group calculations. Both theories predict appreciable contributions from beyond-mean-field correlations to the charge radii of the neutron-deficient tin isotopes. The models, however, fall short of reproducing the magnitude of the known $B(E2)$ transition probabilities, highlighting the remaining challenges in achieving a unified description of both ground-state properties and collective phenomena.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of magnetized BPS baryonic layers and the effects of the Isospin chemical potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics, BPS magnetized Baryonic layers (possessing both baryonic charge and magnetic flux) have been constructed in the gauged non-linear sigma model (G-NLSM) minimally coupled to Maxwell theory, which is one of the most relevant effective theories for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the strongly interacting low-energy limit which also takes into account the electromagnetic interactions. Since the topological charge that naturally appears on the right hand side of the BPS bound is a non-linear function of the baryonic charge, the thermodynamics of these magnetized Baryonic layers is highly non-trivial. In this work, using tools from the theory of Casimir effect, we derive analytical relationship between baryonic charge, topological charge, magnetic flux and relevant thermodynamical quantities (such as pressure, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility) of these layers. The critical Baryonic chemical potential is identified. Quite interestingly, the grand canonical partition function can be related with the Riemann zeta function. On the technical side, it is quite a remarkable result to derive explicit expressions for all these thermodynamics quantities of a strongly interacting magnetized system at finite Baryon density. The effects of the Isospin chemical potential can be included as well: in particular, we will be able to construct explicitly the BPS bound and the corresponding BPS configurations also in the case in which the Isospin chemical potential is non-zero. The physical interpretations of our analytical results will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Susceptibilities of rotating quark matter in Fourier-Bessel basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze various two-point correlation functions of fermionic bilinears in a rotating finite-size cylinder at finite temperatures, with a focus on susceptibility functions. Due to the noninvariance of radial translation, the susceptibility functions are constructed using the Dirac propagator in the Fourier-Bessel basis instead of the plane-wave basis. As a specific model to demonstrate the susceptibility functions in an interacting theory, we employ the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. We show that the incompatibility between the mean-field analysis and the Fourier-Bessel basis is evaded under the local density approximation, and derive the resummation formulas of susceptibilities with the help of a Ward-Takahashi identity. The resulting formulation reveals the rotational effects on meson, baryon number, and topological susceptibilities, as well as the moment of inertia. Our results may serve a useful benchmark for future lattice QCD simulations in rotating frames.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of the CP-violating $\theta$ term on isospin symmetry breaking in quark matter and compact star properties using a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. By incorporating the $\theta$ parameter through the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT) determinant interaction, we derive the thermodynamic potential and gap equations under finite temperature, baryon chemical potential, and isospin chemical potential. At zero temperature and baryon density, $\theta$ suppresses conventional chiral ($\sigma$) and pion ($\pi$) condensates while promoting pseudo-scalar ($\eta$) and scalar-isovector ($\delta$) condensates, thereby reducing the critical isospin chemical potential $\mu_I^{\text{crit}}$ for spontaneous symmetry breaking. For $\theta=\pi$, a first-order phase transition emerges at $\mu_I^{\text{crit}} = 0.021$ GeV, accompanied by CP symmetry restoration. Extending the investigation to finite temperature and baryon chemical potential reveals that these $\theta$-term-induced effects persist. Axion effects (modeled via $\theta\equiv a/f_a$) stiffen the equation of state (EOS) of non-strange quark stars, increasing their maximum mass and radii, in agreement with multimessenger constraints from pulsar observations and gravitational wave events. These results establish $\theta$ as a critical parameter modulating both the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase structure and compact star observables.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Kinetic Mixing of Dark Photons from Dilepton Spectra</title>

Abstract: Dark photons, the hypothetical gauge bosons associated with an additional $U(1)^{\prime}$ symmetry, can couple to Standard Model particles through a small kinetic mixing parameter $\varepsilon$ with the ordinary photon. This mechanism provides a portal between the dark sector and visible matter. In this study, we present a procedure to derive theoretical upper bounds on the kinetic mixing parameter $\varepsilon^2(M_U)$ by analyzing dilepton spectra from heavy-ion collisions across a broad energy range, from SIS to LHC energies. Our analysis is based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, which successfully reproduces the measured dilepton spectra in $p+p$, $p+A$, and $A+A$ collisions across the same energy range. Besides the dilepton channels resulting from interactions and decays of Standard Model particles (such as mesons and baryons), the PHSD has been extended to include the decay of hypothetical dark photons into dileptons, $U \to e^+ e^-$. The production of these dark photons occurs via Dalitz decays of $\pi^0$, $\eta$, $\omega$, $\eta^{\prime}$, and $\Delta$ resonances; direct decays of $\rho$, $\omega$, and $\phi$; the kaon mode $K^+ \to \pi^+ U$; and thermal $q\bar q$ annihilation in the quark-gluon plasma. Our results show that high-precision measurements of dilepton spectra in heavy-ion collisions provide a sensitive and competitive probe of dark photons in the MeV to multi-GeV mass range. Furthermore, we quantify the experimental accuracy required to constrain the remaining viable parameter space of kinetic mixing in dark photon scenarios.</description>

      <title>Probing the nonstrange quark star equation of state with compact stars and gravitational waves</title>

Abstract: A recent study shows that incorporating a new term into the thermodynamic potential density, as required by the thermodynamic consistency criterion, can effectively resolve the thermodynamic inconsistency problems of the conventional perturbative QCD model. This additional term plays a crucial role in resolving inconsistencies at relatively low densities and becomes negligible at extremely high densities. Within this revised perturbative QCD model, we find that if we require only that the energy per baryon of up-down ($ud$) quark matter exceeds 930 MeV so as not to contradict the standard nuclear physics, the maximum mass of an $ud$ quark star allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model can reach up to 2.17 $M_{\odot}$. From this perspective, the observed 2.14 $M_{\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0740+6620 may be an $ud$ quark star. However, if we further impose the constraint that the tidal deformability of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ $ud$ quark star must be consistent with the GW170817 event, the maximum mass allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model would decrease to no more than 2.08 $M_{\odot}$. Consequently, our results suggest that the compact object with a mass of 2.50-2.67 $M_{\odot}$, as observed in the GW190814 event, cannot be an $ud$ quark star, according to the revised perturbative QCD model.</description>
