      <title>Neural networks for neurocomputing circuits: a computational study of tolerance to noise and activation function non-uniformity when machine learning materials properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dedicated analog neurocomputing circuits are promising for high-throughput, low power consumption applications of machine learning (ML) and for applications where implementing a digital computer is unwieldy (remote locations; small, mobile, and autonomous devices, extreme conditions, etc.). Neural networks (NN) implemented in such circuits, however, must contend with circuit noise and the non-uniform shapes of the neuron activation function (NAF) due to the dispersion of performance characteristics of circuit elements (such as transistors or diodes implementing the neurons). We present a computational study of the impact of circuit noise and NAF inhomogeneity in function of NN architecture and training regimes. We focus on one application that requires high-throughput ML: materials informatics, using as representative problem ML of formation energies vs. lowest-energy isomer of peri-condensed hydrocarbons, formation energies and band gaps of double perovskites, and zero point vibrational energies of molecules from QM9 dataset. We show that NNs generally possess low noise tolerance with the model accuracy rapidly degrading with noise level. Single-hidden layer NNs, and NNs with larger-than-optimal sizes are somewhat more noise-tolerant. Models that show less overfitting (not necessarily the lowest test set error) are more noise-tolerant. Importantly, we demonstrate that the effect of activation function inhomogeneity can be palliated by retraining the NN using practically realized shapes of NAFs.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the branches of recursive and recurrent neural networks are classified in detail according to the network structure, training objective function and learning algorithm implementation. They are roughly divided into three categories: The first category is General Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, including Basic Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolutional Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, Differential Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, One-Layer Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, High-Order Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, Highway Networks, Multidimensional Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, Bidirectional Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks; the second category is Structured Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, including Grid Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, Temporal Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, Lattice Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, Hierarchical Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, Tree Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks; the third category is Other Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, including Array Long Short Term Memory, Nested and Stacked Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks, Memory Recursive and Recurrent Neural Networks. Various networks cross each other and even rely on each other to form a complex network of relationships. In the context of the development and convergence of various networks, many complex sequence, speech and image problems are solved. After a detailed description of the principle and structure of the above model and model deformation, the research progress and application of each model are described, and finally the recursive and recurrent neural network models are prospected and summarized.</description>

      <title>Decoding Listeners Identity: Person Identification from EEG Signals Using a Lightweight Spiking Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EEG-based person identification enables applications in security, personalized brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and cognitive monitoring. However, existing techniques often rely on deep learning architectures at high computational cost, limiting their scope of applications. In this study, we propose a novel EEG person identification approach using spiking neural networks (SNNs) with a lightweight spiking transformer for efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed SNN model is capable of handling the temporal complexities inherent in EEG signals. On the EEG-Music Emotion Recognition Challenge dataset, the proposed model achieves 100% classification accuracy with less than 10% energy consumption of traditional deep neural networks. This study offers a promising direction for energy-efficient and high-performance BCIs. The source code is available at https://github.com/PatrickZLin/Decode-ListenerIdentity.</description>

      <title>Self-Evidencing Through Hierarchical Gradient Decomposition: A Dissipative System That Maintains Non-Equilibrium Steady-State by Minimizing Variational Free Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that self-organizing systems must minimize variational free energy to persist, but the path from principle to implementable algorithm has remained unclear. We present a constructive proof that the FEP can be realized through exact local credit assignment. The system decomposes gradient computation hierarchically: spatial credit via feedback alignment, temporal credit via eligibility traces, and structural credit via a Trophic Field Map (TFM) that estimates expected gradient magnitude for each connection block. We prove these mechanisms are exact at their respective levels and validate the central claim empirically: the TFM achieves 0.9693 Pearson correlation with oracle gradients. This exactness produces emergent capabilities including 98.6% retention after task interference, autonomous recovery from 75% structural damage, self-organized criticality (spectral radius p ~= 1.0$), and sample-efficient reinforcement learning on continuous control tasks without replay buffers. The architecture unifies Prigogine's dissipative structures, Friston's free energy minimization, and Hopfield's attractor dynamics, demonstrating that exact hierarchical inference over network topology can be implemented with local, biologically plausible rules.</description>

      <title>Automated Algorithm Design for Auto-Tuning Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is essential for optimizing high-performance applications, where vast and irregular parameter spaces make manual exploration infeasible. Traditionally, auto-tuning relies on well-established optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms, annealing methods, or surrogate model-based optimizers to efficiently find near-optimal configurations. However, designing effective optimizers remains challenging, as no single method performs best across all tuning tasks.
  In this work, we explore a new paradigm: using large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate optimization algorithms tailored to auto-tuning problems. We introduce a framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions and search-space characteristics results to produce specialized optimization strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.
  These generated algorithms are evaluated on four real-world auto-tuning applications across six hardware platforms and compared against the state-of-the-art in optimization algorithms of two contemporary auto-tuning frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates that providing additional application- and search space-specific information in the generation stage results in an average performance improvement of 30.7\% and 14.6\%, respectively. In addition, our results show that LLM-generated optimizers can rival, and in various cases outperform, existing human-designed algorithms, with our best-performing generated optimization algorithms achieving, on average, 72.4\% improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers for auto-tuning.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Post-Hoc Calibration: Mitigating Confidently Incorrect Predictions Beyond Calibration Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on neural network calibration, existing methods typically apply global transformations that treat all predictions uniformly, overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions. Furthermore, the relationship between improved calibration and effective uncertainty-aware decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a post-hoc calibration framework that leverages prediction reliability assessment to jointly enhance calibration quality and uncertainty-aware decision-making. The framework employs proximity-based conformal prediction to stratify calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. A dual calibration strategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in putatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic regression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively incorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further investigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration metrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones show that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions, and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and focal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc solution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making.</description>

      <title>EvoSyn: Generalizable Evolutionary Data Synthesis for Verifiable Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math, coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled, universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust generalization of our framework.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Complex Behavior in Large-Scale Ecological Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18221v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how physical scale and population size shape the emergence of complex behaviors in open-ended ecological environments. In our setting, agents are unsupervised and have no explicit rewards or learning objectives but instead evolve over time according to reproduction, mutation, and natural selection. As they act, agents also shape their environment and the population around them in an ongoing dynamic ecology. Our goal is not to optimize a single high-performance policy, but instead to examine how behaviors emerge and evolve across large populations due to natural competition and environmental pressures. In an effort to discover how complex behaviors naturally emerge, we conduct experiments in large-scale worlds that reach populations of more than 60,000 individual agents, each with their own evolved neural network policy. We identify various emergent behaviors such as long-range resource extraction, vision-based foraging, and predation that arise under competitive and survival pressures. We examine how sensing modalities and environmental scale affect the emergence of these behaviors, finding that some appear only in sufficiently large environments and populations, with larger scales increasing behavioral stability and consistency. While there is a rich history of research in evolutionary settings, our scaling results provide promising new directions to explore ecology as an instrument of machine learning in an era of abundant computational resources. Experimental code is available at https://github.com/jbejjani2022/ecological-emergent-behavior.</description>

      <title>Binary Quadratic Quantization: Beyond First-Order Quantization for Real-Valued Matrix Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order quantization approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization (PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios, respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient matrix approximation and neural network compression.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Emulators for Cosmology: Accelerating Cosmological Analyses Without Sacrificing Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cosmology, emulators play a crucial role by providing fast and accurate predictions of complex physical models, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces that would be computationally prohibitive with direct numerical simulations. Symbolic emulators have emerged as promising alternatives to numerical approaches, delivering comparable accuracy with significantly faster evaluation times. While previous symbolic emulators were limited to relatively narrow prior ranges, we expand these to cover the parameter space relevant for current cosmological analyses. We introduce approximations to hypergeometric functions used for the $\Lambda$CDM comoving distance and linear growth factor which are accurate to better than 0.001% and 0.05%, respectively, for all redshifts and for $\Omega_{\rm m} \in [0.1, 0.5]$. We show that integrating symbolic emulators into a Dark Energy Survey-like $3\times2$pt analysis produces cosmological constraints consistent with those obtained using standard numerical methods. Our symbolic emulators offer substantial improvements in speed and memory usage, demonstrating their practical potential for scalable, likelihood-based inference.</description>

      <title>MetaBox-v2: A Unified Benchmark Platform for Meta-Black-Box Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) streamlines the automation of optimization algorithm design through meta-learning. It typically employs a bi-level structure: the meta-level policy undergoes meta-training to reduce the manual effort required in developing algorithms for low-level optimization tasks. The original MetaBox (2023) provided the first open-source framework for reinforcement learning-based single-objective MetaBBO. However, its relatively narrow scope no longer keep pace with the swift advancement in this field. In this paper, we introduce MetaBox-v2 (https://github.com/MetaEvo/MetaBox) as a milestone upgrade with four novel features: 1) a unified architecture supporting RL, evolutionary, and gradient-based approaches, by which we reproduce $23$ up-to-date baselines; 2) efficient parallelization schemes, which reduce the training/testing time by $10-40$x; 3) a comprehensive benchmark suite of $18$ synthetic/realistic tasks ($1900$+ instances) spanning single-objective, multi-objective, multi-model, and multi-task optimization scenarios; 4) plentiful and extensible interfaces for custom analysis/visualization and integrating to external optimization tools/benchmarks. To show the utility of MetaBox-v2, we carry out a systematic case study that evaluates the built-in baselines in terms of the optimization performance, generalization ability and learning efficiency. Valuable insights are concluded from thorough and detailed analysis for practitioners and those new to the field.</description>

      <title>Brain-Like Processing Pathways Form in Models With Heterogeneous Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Examples of such pathways can be found in the interactions between cortical and subcortical networks during learning, or in sub-networks specializing for task characteristics such as difficulty or modality. Despite the large role these pathways play in cognition, the mechanisms through which brain regions organize into pathways remain unclear. In this work, we use an extension of the Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts architecture to show that heterogeneous regions do not form processing pathways by themselves, implying that the brain likely implements specific constraints which result in the reliable formation of pathways. We identify three biologically relevant inductive biases that encourage pathway formation: a routing cost imposed on the use of more complex regions, a scaling factor that reduces this cost when task performance is low, and randomized expert dropout. When comparing our resulting \textit{Mixture-of-Pathways} model with the brain, we observe that the artificial pathways in our model match how the brain uses cortical and subcortical systems to learn and solve tasks of varying difficulty. In summary, we introduce a novel framework for investigating how the brain forms task-specific pathways through inductive biases, and the effects these biases have on the behavior of Mixture-of-Experts models.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Measures: Discriminative Capacity of Representational Similarity Metrics Across Model Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04622v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.</description>
