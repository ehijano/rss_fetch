      <title>Contact-conditioned learning of locomotion policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locomotion is realized through making and breaking contact. State-of-the-art constrained nonlinear model predictive controllers (NMPC) generate whole-body trajectories for a given contact sequence. However, these approaches are computationally expensive at run-time. Hence it is desirable to offload some of this computation to an offline phase. In this paper, we hypothesize that conditioning a learned policy on the locations and timings of contact is a suitable representation for learning a single policy that can generate multiple gaits (contact sequences). In this way, we can build a single generalist policy to realize different gaited and non-gaited locomotion skills and the transitions among them. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate the validity of our hypothesis for learning multiple gaits for a biped robot.</description>

      <title>Occupation-aware planning method for robotic monitoring missions in dynamic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for robotic monitoring missions in the presence of moving obstacles. Although the scenario map is known, the robot lacks information about the movement of dynamic obstacles during the monitoring mission. Numerous local planners have been developed in recent years for navigating highly dynamic environments. However, the absence of a global planner for these environments can result in unavoidable collisions or the inability to successfully complete missions in densely populated areas, such as a scenario monitoring in our case. This work addresses the development and evaluation of a global planner, $MADA$ (Monitoring Avoiding Dynamic Areas), aimed at enhancing the deployment of robots in such challenging conditions. The robot plans and executes the mission using the proposed two-step approach. The first step involves selecting the observation goal based on the environment's distribution and estimated monitoring costs. In the second step, the robot identifies areas with moving obstacles and obtains paths avoiding densely occupied dynamic regions based on their occupation. Quantitative and qualitative results based on simulations and on real-world experimentation, confirm that the proposed method allows the robot to effectively monitor most of the environment while avoiding densely occupied dynamic areas.</description>

      <title>Real-time Dexterous Telemanipulation with an End-Effect-Oriented Learning-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dexterous telemanipulation is crucial in advancing human-robot systems, especially in tasks requiring precise and safe manipulation. However, it faces significant challenges due to the physical differences between human and robotic hands, the dynamic interaction with objects, and the indirect control and perception of the remote environment. Current approaches predominantly focus on mapping the human hand onto robotic counterparts to replicate motions, which exhibits a critical oversight: it often neglects the physical interaction with objects and relegates the interaction burden to the human to adapt and make laborious adjustments in response to the indirect and counter-intuitive observation of the remote environment. This work develops an End-Effects-Oriented Learning-based Dexterous Telemanipulation (EFOLD) framework to address telemanipulation tasks. EFOLD models telemanipulation as a Markov Game, introducing multiple end-effect features to interpret the human operator's commands during interaction with objects. These features are used by a Deep Reinforcement Learning policy to control the robot and reproduce such end effects. EFOLD was evaluated with real human subjects and two end-effect extraction methods for controlling a virtual Shadow Robot Hand in telemanipulation tasks. EFOLD achieved real-time control capability with low command following latency (delay&lt;0.11s) and highly accurate tracking (MSE&lt;0.084 rad).</description>

      <title>The Harmonic Exponential Filter for Nonparametric Estimation on Motion Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian estimation is a vital tool in robotics as it allows systems to update the belief of the robot state using incomplete information from noisy sensors. To render the state estimation problem tractable, many systems assume that the motion and measurement noise, as well as the state distribution, are all unimodal and Gaussian. However, there are numerous scenarios and systems that do not comply with these assumptions. Existing non-parametric filters that are used to model multimodal distributions have drawbacks that limit their ability to represent a diverse set of distributions. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to nonparametric Bayesian filtering to cope with multimodal distributions using harmonic exponential distributions. This approach leverages two key insights of harmonic exponential distributions: a) the product of two distributions can be expressed as the element-wise addition of their log-likelihood Fourier coefficients, and b) the convolution of two distributions can be efficiently computed as the tensor product of their Fourier coefficients. These observations enable the development of an efficient and exact solution to the Bayes filter up to the band limit of a Fourier transform. We demonstrate our filter's superior performance compared with established nonparametric filtering methods across a range of simulated and real-world localization tasks.</description>

      <title>Structure from Motion-based Motion Estimation and 3D Reconstruction of Unknown Shaped Space Debris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the boost in the number of spacecraft launches in the current decades, the space debris problem is daily becoming significantly crucial. For sustainable space utilization, the continuous removal of space debris is the most severe problem for humanity. To maximize the reliability of the debris capture mission in orbit, accurate motion estimation of the target is essential. Space debris has lost its attitude and orbit control capabilities, and its shape is unknown due to the break. This paper proposes the Structure from Motion-based algorithm to perform unknown shaped space debris motion estimation with limited resources, where only 2D images are required as input. The method then outputs the reconstructed shape of the unknown object and the relative pose trajectory between the target and the camera simultaneously, which are exploited to estimate the target's motion. The method is quantitatively validated with the realistic image dataset generated by the microgravity experiment in a 2D air-floating testbed and 3D kinematic simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent surge of interest in agile humanoid robots achieving dynamic tasks like jumping and flipping necessitates the concurrent design of a robot platform that combines exceptional hardware performance with effective control algorithms. This paper introduces the NING Humanoid, an agile and robust platform aimed at achieving human-like athletic capabilities. The NING humanoid features high-torque actuators, a resilient mechanical co-design based on the Centroidal dynamics, and a whole-body model predictive control (WB-MPC) framework. It stands at 1.1 meters tall and weighs 20 kg with 18 degrees of freedom (DOFs). It demonstrates impressive abilities such as walking, push recovery, and stair climbing at a high control bandwidth. Our presentation will encompass a hardware co-design, the control framework, as well as simulation and real-time experiments.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop underwater soft robotic foil shape control using flexible e-skin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of soft robotics for real-world underwater applications is limited, even more than in terrestrial applications, by the ability to accurately measure and control the deformation of the soft materials in real time without the need for feedback from an external sensor. Real-time underwater shape estimation would allow for accurate closed-loop control of soft propulsors, enabling high-performance swimming and manoeuvring. We propose and demonstrate a method for closed-loop underwater soft robotic foil control based on a flexible capacitive e-skin and machine learning which does not necessitate feedback from an external sensor. The underwater e-skin is applied to a highly flexible foil undergoing deformations from 2% to 9% of its camber by means of soft hydraulic actuators. Accurate set point regulation of the camber is successfully tracked during sinusoidal and triangle actuation routines with an amplitude of 5% peak-to-peak and 10-second period with a normalised RMS error of 0.11, and 2% peak-to-peak amplitude with a period of 5 seconds with a normalised RMS error of 0.03. The tail tip deflection can be measured across a 30 mm (0.15 chords) range. These results pave the way for using e-skin technology for underwater soft robotic closed-loop control applications.</description>

      <title>Actra: Optimized Transformer Architecture for Vision-Language-Action Models in Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language-action models have gained significant attention for their ability to model trajectories in robot learning. However, most existing models rely on Transformer models with vanilla causal attention, which we find suboptimal for processing segmented multi-modal sequences. Additionally, the autoregressive generation approach falls short in generating multi-dimensional actions. In this paper, we introduce Actra, an optimized Transformer architecture featuring trajectory attention and learnable action queries, designed for effective encoding and decoding of segmented vision-language-action trajectories in robot imitation learning. Furthermore, we devise a multi-modal contrastive learning objective to explicitly align different modalities, complementing the primary behavior cloning objective. Through extensive experiments conducted across various environments, Actra exhibits substantial performance improvement when compared to state-of-the-art models in terms of generalizability, dexterity, and precision.</description>

      <title>From Problem to Solution: Bio-inspired 3D Printing for Bonding Soft and Rigid Materials via Underextrusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertebrate animals benefit from a combination of rigidity for structural support and softness for adaptation. Similarly, integrating rigidity and softness can enhance the versatility of soft robotics. However, the challenges associated with creating durable bonding interfaces between soft and rigid materials have limited the development of hybrid robots. Existing solutions require specialized machinery, such as polyjet 3D printers, which are not commonly available. In response to these challenges, we have developed a 3D printing technique that can be used with almost all commercially available FDM printers. This technique leverages the common issue of underextrusion to create a strong bond between soft and rigid materials. Underextrusion generates a porous structure, similar to fibrous connective tissues, that provides a robust interface with the rigid part through layer fusion, while the porosity enables interlocking with the soft material. Our experiments demonstrated that this method outperforms conventional adhesives commonly used in soft robotics, achieving nearly 200\% of the bonding strength in both lap shear and peeling tests. Additionally, we investigated how different porosity levels affect bonding strength. We tested the technique under pressure scenarios critical to soft and hybrid robots and achieved three times more pressure than the current adhesion solution. Finally, we fabricated various hybrid robots using this technique to demonstrate the wide range of capabilities this approach and hybridity can bring to soft robotics. has context menu</description>

      <title>Reality Fusion: Robust Real-time Immersive Mobile Robot Teleoperation with Volumetric Visual Data Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Reality Fusion, a novel robot teleoperation system that localizes, streams, projects, and merges a typical onboard depth sensor with a photorealistic, high resolution, high framerate, and wide field of view (FoV) rendering of the complex remote environment represented as 3D Gaussian splats (3DGS). Our framework enables robust egocentric and exocentric robot teleoperation in immersive VR, with the 3DGS effectively extending spatial information of a depth sensor with limited FoV and balancing the trade-off between data streaming costs and data visual quality. We evaluated our framework through a user study with 24 participants, which revealed that Reality Fusion leads to significantly better user performance, situation awareness, and user preferences. To support further research and development, we provide an open-source implementation with an easy-to-replicate custom-made telepresence robot, a high-performance virtual reality 3DGS renderer, and an immersive robot control package.

      <title>HeteroMorpheus: Universal Control Based on Morphological Heterogeneity Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of robotic control, designing individual controllers for each robot leads to high computational costs. Universal control policies, applicable across diverse robot morphologies, promise to mitigate this challenge. Predominantly, models based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformers are employed, owing to their effectiveness in capturing relational dynamics across a robot's limbs. However, these models typically employ homogeneous graph structures that overlook the functional diversity of different limbs. To bridge this gap, we introduce HeteroMorpheus, a novel method based on heterogeneous graph Transformer. This method uniquely addresses limb heterogeneity, fostering better representation of robot dynamics of various morphologies. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate the superiority of HeteroMorpheus against state-of-the-art methods in the capability of policy generalization, including zero-shot generalization and sample-efficient transfer to unfamiliar robot morphologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) models in extending the regions of operation of a mobile robot, controlled by Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) via static CCTV cameras. Using NeRF as a 3D-representation prior, the robot's footprint may be extrapolated geometrically and used to train a CNN-based network to extract it online from the robot's appearance alone. The resulting footprint results in a tighter bound than a robot-wide bounding box, allowing the robot's controller to prescribe more optimal trajectories and expand its safe operational floor area.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation is challenging due to discontinuous dynamics, as well as high-dimensional state and action spaces. Data-driven approaches that succeed in manipulation tasks require large amounts of data and expert demonstrations, typically from humans. Existing manipulation planners are restricted to specific systems and often depend on specialized algorithms for using demonstration. Therefore, we introduce a flexible motion planner tailored to dexterous and whole-body manipulation tasks. Our planner creates readily usable demonstrations for reinforcement learning algorithms, eliminating the need for additional training pipeline complexities. With this approach, we can efficiently learn policies for complex manipulation tasks, where traditional reinforcement learning alone only makes little progress. Furthermore, we demonstrate that learned policies are transferable to real robotic systems for solving complex dexterous manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Control Inputs in the Estimation of Continuous Mobile Robot Trajectories and Continuum Robot Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time batch state estimation using Gaussian processes is an efficient approach to estimate the trajectories of robots over time. In the past, relatively simple physics-motivated priors have been considered for such approaches, using assumptions such as constant velocity or acceleration. This paper presents an approach to incorporating exogenous control inputs, such as velocity or acceleration commands, into the continuous Gaussian process state-estimation framework. It is shown that this approach generalizes across different domains in robotics, making it applicable to both the estimation of continuous-time trajectories for mobile robots and continuum-robot shapes. Results show that incorporating control inputs leads to more informed priors, potentially requiring less measurements and estimation nodes to obtain accurate estimates. This makes the approach particularly useful in situations in which limited sensing is available.</description>

      <title>A Backbone for Long-Horizon Robot Task Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end robot learning, particularly for long-horizon tasks, often results in unpredictable outcomes and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Therblig-based Backbone Framework (TBBF) to enhance robot task understanding and transferability. This framework uses therbligs (basic action elements) as the backbone to decompose high-level robot tasks into elemental robot configurations, which are then integrated with current foundation models to improve task understanding. The approach consists of two stages: offline training and online testing. During the offline training stage, we developed the Meta-RGate SynerFusion (MGSF) network for accurate therblig segmentation across various tasks. In the online testing stage, after a one-shot demonstration of a new task is collected, our MGSF network extracts high-level knowledge, which is then encoded into the image using Action Registration (ActionREG). Additionally, the Large Language Model (LLM)-Alignment Policy for Visual Correction (LAP-VC) is employed to ensure precise action execution, facilitating trajectory transfer in novel robot scenarios. Experimental results validate these methods, achieving 94.37% recall in therblig segmentation and success rates of 94.4% and 80% in real-world online robot testing for simple and complex scenarios, respectively.

      <title>Play to the Score: Stage-Guided Dynamic Multi-Sensory Fusion for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable talent for flexibly alternating to different senses when interacting with the environment. Picture a chef skillfully gauging the timing of ingredient additions and controlling the heat according to the colors, sounds, and aromas, seamlessly navigating through every stage of the complex cooking process. This ability is founded upon a thorough comprehension of task stages, as achieving the sub-goal within each stage can necessitate the utilization of different senses. In order to endow robots with similar ability, we incorporate the task stages divided by sub-goals into the imitation learning process to accordingly guide dynamic multi-sensory fusion. We propose MS-Bot, a stage-guided dynamic multi-sensory fusion method with coarse-to-fine stage understanding, which dynamically adjusts the priority of modalities based on the fine-grained state within the predicted current stage. We train a robot system equipped with visual, auditory, and tactile sensors to accomplish challenging robotic manipulation tasks: pouring and peg insertion with keyway. Experimental results indicate that our approach enables more effective and explainable dynamic fusion, aligning more closely with the human fusion process than existing methods.</description>

Abstract: Combining machine learning and formal methods (FMs) provides a possible solution to overcome the safety issue of autonomous driving (AD) vehicles. However, there are gaps to be bridged before this combination becomes practically applicable and useful. In an attempt to facilitate researchers in both FMs and AD areas, this paper proposes a framework that combines two well-known tools, namely CommonRoad and UPPAAL. On the one hand, CommonRoad can be enhanced by the rigorous semantics of models in UPPAAL, which enables a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the AD system's behaviour and thus strengthens the safety of the system. On the other hand, controllers synthesised by UPPAAL can be visualised by CommonRoad in real-world road networks, which facilitates AD vehicle designers greatly adopting formal models in system design. In this framework, we provide automatic model conversions between CommonRoad and UPPAAL. Therefore, users only need to program in Python and the framework takes care of the formal models, learning, and verification in the backend. We perform experiments to demonstrate the applicability of our framework in various AD scenarios, discuss the advantages of solving motion planning in our framework, and show the scalability limit and possible solutions.</description>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently shown promising results as an alternative scene representation in SLAM systems to neural implicit representations. However, current methods either lack dense depth maps to supervise the mapping process or detailed training designs that consider the scale of the environment. To address these drawbacks, we present IG-SLAM, a dense RGB-only SLAM system that employs robust Dense-SLAM methods for tracking and combines them with Gaussian Splatting. A 3D map of the environment is constructed using accurate pose and dense depth provided by tracking. Additionally, we utilize depth uncertainty in map optimization to improve 3D reconstruction. Our decay strategy in map optimization enhances convergence and allows the system to run at 10 fps in a single process. We demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art RGB-only SLAM systems while achieving faster operation speeds. We present our experiments on the Replica, TUM-RGBD, ScanNet, and EuRoC datasets. The system achieves photo-realistic 3D reconstruction in large-scale sequences, particularly in the EuRoC dataset.</description>

      <title>EVIT: Event-based Visual-Inertial Tracking in Semi-Dense Maps Using Windowed Nonlinear Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras are an interesting visual exteroceptive sensor that reacts to brightness changes rather than integrating absolute image intensities. Owing to this design, the sensor exhibits strong performance in situations of challenging dynamics and illumination conditions. While event-based simultaneous tracking and mapping remains a challenging problem, a number of recent works have pointed out the sensor's suitability for prior map-based tracking. By making use of cross-modal registration paradigms, the camera's ego-motion can be tracked across a large spectrum of illumination and dynamics conditions on top of accurate maps that have been created a priori by more traditional sensors. The present paper follows up on a recently introduced event-based geometric semi-dense tracking paradigm, and proposes the addition of inertial signals in order to robustify the estimation. More specifically, the added signals provide strong cues for pose initialization as well as regularization during windowed, multi-frame tracking. As a result, the proposed framework achieves increased performance under challenging illumination conditions as well as a reduction of the rate at which intermediate event representations need to be registered in order to maintain stable tracking across highly dynamic sequences. Our evaluation focuses on a diverse set of real world sequences and comprises a comparison of our proposed method against a purely event-based alternative running at different rates.</description>

      <title>Temporal Transfer Learning for Traffic Optimization with Coarse-grained Advisory Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent development of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies has spurred investigations to optimize dense urban traffic to maximize vehicle speed and throughput. This paper explores advisory autonomy, in which real-time driving advisories are issued to the human drivers, thus achieving near-term performance of automated vehicles. Due to the complexity of traffic systems, recent studies of coordinating CAVs have resorted to leveraging deep reinforcement learning (RL). Coarse-grained advisory is formalized as zero-order holds, and we consider a range of hold duration from 0.1 to 40 seconds. However, despite the similarity of the higher frequency tasks on CAVs, a direct application of deep RL fails to be generalized to advisory autonomy tasks. To overcome this, we utilize zero-shot transfer, training policies on a set of source tasks--specific traffic scenarios with designated hold durations--and then evaluating the efficacy of these policies on different target tasks. We introduce Temporal Transfer Learning (TTL) algorithms to select source tasks for zero-shot transfer, systematically leveraging the temporal structure to solve the full range of tasks. TTL selects the most suitable source tasks to maximize the performance of the range of tasks. We validate our algorithms on diverse mixed-traffic scenarios, demonstrating that TTL more reliably solves the tasks than baselines. This paper underscores the potential of coarse-grained advisory autonomy with TTL in traffic flow optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework, DISORF, to enable online 3D reconstruction and visualization of scenes captured by resource-constrained mobile robots and edge devices. To address the limited computing capabilities of edge devices and potentially limited network availability, we design a framework that efficiently distributes computation between the edge device and the remote server. We leverage on-device SLAM systems to generate posed keyframes and transmit them to remote servers that can perform high-quality 3D reconstruction and visualization at runtime by leveraging recent advances in neural 3D methods. We identify a key challenge with online training where naive image sampling strategies can lead to significant degradation in rendering quality. We propose a novel shifted exponential frame sampling method that addresses this challenge for online training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enabling high-quality real-time reconstruction and visualization of unknown scenes as they are captured and streamed from cameras in mobile robots and edge devices.</description>

      <title>MAC: Graph Sparsification by Maximizing Algebraic Connectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a critical capability in autonomous navigation, but memory and computational limits make long-term application of common SLAM techniques impractical; a robot must be able to determine what information should be retained and what can safely be forgotten. In graph-based SLAM, the number of edges (measurements) in a pose graph determines both the memory requirements of storing a robot's observations and the computational expense of algorithms deployed for performing state estimation using those observations, both of which can grow unbounded during long-term navigation. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a new general purpose approach to sparsify graphs in a manner that maximizes algebraic connectivity, a key spectral property of graphs which has been shown to control the estimation error of pose graph SLAM solutions. Our algorithm, MAC (for maximizing algebraic connectivity), is simple and computationally inexpensive, and admits formal post hoc performance guarantees on the quality of the solution that it provides. In application to the problem of pose-graph SLAM, we show on several benchmark datasets that our approach quickly produces high-quality sparsification results which retain the connectivity of the graph and, in turn, the quality of corresponding SLAM solutions.</description>

      <title>Learning Visual Quadrupedal Loco-Manipulation from Demonstrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadruped robots are progressively being integrated into human environments. Despite the growing locomotion capabilities of quadrupedal robots, their interaction with objects in realistic scenes is still limited. While additional robotic arms on quadrupedal robots enable manipulating objects, they are sometimes redundant given that a quadruped robot is essentially a mobile unit equipped with four limbs, each possessing 3 degrees of freedom (DoFs). Hence, we aim to empower a quadruped robot to execute real-world manipulation tasks using only its legs. We decompose the loco-manipulation process into a low-level reinforcement learning (RL)-based controller and a high-level Behavior Cloning (BC)-based planner. By parameterizing the manipulation trajectory, we synchronize the efforts of the upper and lower layers, thereby leveraging the advantages of both RL and BC. Our approach is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating the robot's ability to perform tasks that demand mobility and high precision, such as lifting a basket from the ground while moving, closing a dishwasher, pressing a button, and pushing a door.

Abstract: Recent research in affective robots has recognized their potential in supporting human well-being. Due to rapidly developing affective and artificial intelligence technologies, this field of research has undergone explosive expansion and advancement in recent years. In order to develop a deeper understanding of recent advancements, we present a systematic review of the past 10 years of research in affective robotics for wellbeing.

      <title>MSMA: Multi-agent Trajectory Prediction in Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Environment with Multi-source Data Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prediction of surrounding vehicle trajectories is crucial for collision-free path planning. In this study, we focus on a scenario where a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) serves as the central agent, utilizing both sensors and communication technologies to perceive its surrounding traffics consisting of autonomous vehicles (AVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Our trajectory prediction task is aimed at all the detected surrounding vehicles. To effectively integrate the multi-source data from both sensor and communication technologies, we propose a deep learning framework called MSMA utilizing a cross-attention module for multi-source data fusion. Vector map data is utilized to provide contextual information. The trajectory dataset is collected in CARLA simulator with synthesized data errors introduced. Numerical experiments demonstrate that in a mixed traffic flow scenario, the integration of data from different sources enhances our understanding of the environment. This notably improves trajectory prediction accuracy, particularly in situations with a high CV market penetration rate. The code is available at: https://github.com/xichennn/MSMA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In robotics, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized for their largely-unrealized potential energy efficiency and low latency particularly when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. Our paper highlights three advancements for SNNs in Visual Place Recognition (VPR). Firstly, we propose Modular SNNs, where each SNN represents a set of non-overlapping geographically distinct places, enabling scalable networks for large environments. Secondly, we present Ensembles of Modular SNNs, where multiple networks represent the same place, significantly enhancing accuracy compared to single-network models. Each of our Modular SNN modules is compact, comprising only 1500 neurons and 474k synapses, making them ideally suited for ensembling due to their small size. Lastly, we investigate the role of sequence matching in SNN-based VPR, a technique where consecutive images are used to refine place recognition. We analyze the responsiveness of SNNs to ensembling and sequence matching compared to other VPR techniques. Our contributions highlight the viability of SNNs for VPR, offering scalable and robust solutions, and paving the way for their application in various energy-sensitive robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Set-Membership Estimation in Control and Perception: Revisiting the Minimum Enclosing Ellipsoid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15962v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Set-membership estimation (SME) outputs a set estimator that guarantees to cover the groundtruth. Such sets are, however, defined by (many) abstract (and potentially nonconvex) constraints and therefore difficult to manipulate. We present tractable algorithms to compute simple and tight overapproximations of SME in the form of minimum enclosing ellipsoids (MEE). We first introduce the hierarchy of enclosing ellipsoids proposed by Nie and Demmel (2005), based on sums-of-squares relaxations, that asymptotically converge to the MEE of a basic semialgebraic set. This framework, however, struggles in modern control and perception problems due to computational challenges. We contribute three computational enhancements to make this framework practical, namely constraints pruning, generalized relaxed Chebyshev center, and handling non-Euclidean geometry. We showcase numerical examples on system identification and object pose estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) rely on various avionics systems that are safety-critical and mission-critical. A major requirement of international safety standards is to perform rigorous system-level testing of avionics software systems. The current industrial practice is to manually create test scenarios, manually/automatically execute these scenarios using simulators, and manually evaluate outcomes. The test scenarios typically consist of setting certain flight or environment conditions and testing the system under test in these settings. The state-of-the-art approaches for this purpose also require manual test scenario development and evaluation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automate the system-level testing of the UAS. The proposed approach (AITester) utilizes model-based testing and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automatically generate, execute, and evaluate various test scenarios. The test scenarios are generated on the fly, i.e., during test execution based on the environmental context at runtime. The approach is supported by a toolset. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach on two core components of UAS, an autopilot system of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and cockpit display systems (CDS) of the ground control station (GCS). The results show that the AITester effectively generates test scenarios causing deviations from the expected behavior of the UAV autopilot and reveals potential flaws in the GCS-CDS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a setting in which $N$ agents aim to speedup a common Stochastic Approximation (SA) problem by acting in parallel and communicating with a central server. We assume that the up-link transmissions to the server are subject to asynchronous and potentially unbounded time-varying delays. To mitigate the effect of delays and stragglers while reaping the benefits of distributed computation, we propose \texttt{DASA}, a Delay-Adaptive algorithm for multi-agent Stochastic Approximation. We provide a finite-time analysis of \texttt{DASA} assuming that the agents' stochastic observation processes are independent Markov chains. Significantly advancing existing results, \texttt{DASA} is the first algorithm whose convergence rate depends only on the mixing time $\tau_{mix}$ and on the average delay $\tau_{avg}$ while jointly achieving an $N$-fold convergence speedup under Markovian sampling. Our work is relevant for various SA applications, including multi-agent and distributed temporal difference (TD) learning, Q-learning and stochastic optimization with correlated data.</description>

      <title>L-PR: Exploiting LiDAR Fiducial Marker for Unordered Low Overlap Multiview Point Cloud Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point cloud registration is a prerequisite for many applications in computer vision and robotics. Most existing methods focus on pairwise registration of two point clouds with high overlap. Although there have been some methods for low overlap cases, they struggle in degraded scenarios. This paper introduces a novel framework dubbed L-PR, designed to register unordered low overlap multiview point clouds leveraging LiDAR fiducial markers. We refer to them as LiDAR fiducial markers, but they are the same as the popular AprilTag and ArUco markers, thin sheets of paper that do not affect the 3D geometry of the environment. We first propose an improved adaptive threshold marker detection method to provide robust detection results when the viewpoints among point clouds change dramatically. Then, we formulate the unordered multiview point cloud registration problem as a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) problem and develop a framework consisting of two levels of graphs to address it. The first-level graph, constructed as a weighted graph, is designed to efficiently and optimally infer initial values of scan poses from the unordered set. The second-level graph is constructed as a factor graph. By globally optimizing the variables on the graph, including scan poses, marker poses, and marker corner positions, we tackle the MAP problem. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and to showcase that L-PR can serve as a low-cost and efficient tool for 3D asset collection and training data collection. In particular, we collect a new dataset named Livox-3DMatch using L-PR and incorporate it into the training of the SOTA learning-based method, SGHR, which brings evident improvements for SGHR on various benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00741v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent advancements in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), its application has extended to various safety-critical scenarios. However, most methods focus on online learning, which presents substantial risks when deployed in real-world settings. Addressing this challenge, we introduce an innovative framework integrating diffusion models within the MARL paradigm. This approach notably enhances the safety of actions taken by multiple agents through risk mitigation while modeling coordinated action. Our framework is grounded in the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) architecture, augmented by a Diffusion Model for prediction trajectory generation. Additionally, we incorporate a specialized algorithm to further ensure operational safety. We evaluate our model against baselines on the DSRL benchmark. Experiment results demonstrate that our model not only adheres to stringent safety constraints but also achieves superior performance compared to existing methodologies. This underscores the potential of our approach in advancing the safety and efficacy of MARL in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Corki: Enabling Real-time Embodied AI Robots via Algorithm-Architecture Co-Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embodied AI robots have the potential to fundamentally improve the way human beings live and manufacture. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame-basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes Corki, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI robot control. Our idea is to decouple LLM inference, robotic control and data communication in the embodied AI robots compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, Corki predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. Corki largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to 8.0x, resulting in up to 3.6x speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 17.3%. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/hyy0613/Corki</description>

Abstract: How can intelligent machines assess their competencies in completing tasks? This question has come into focus for autonomous systems that algorithmically reason and make decisions under uncertainty. It is argued here that machine self-confidence - a form of meta-reasoning based on self-assessments of an agent's knowledge about the state of the world and itself, as well as its ability to reason about and execute tasks - leads to many eminently computable and useful competency indicators for such agents. This paper presents a culmination of work on this concept in the form of a computational framework called Factorized Machine Self-confidence (FaMSeC), which provides a holistic engineering-focused description of factors driving an algorithmic decision-making process, including: outcome assessment, solver quality, model quality, alignment quality, and past experience. In FaMSeC, self confidence indicators are derived from hierarchical `problem-solving statistics' embedded within broad classes of probabilistic decision-making algorithms such as Markov decision processes. The problem-solving statistics are obtained by evaluating and grading probabilistic exceedance margins with respect to given competency standards, which are specified for each of the various decision-making competency factors by the informee (e.g. a non-expert user or an expert system designer). This approach allows `algorithmic goodness of fit' evaluations to be easily incorporated into the design of many kinds of autonomous agents in the form of human-interpretable competency self-assessment reports. Detailed descriptions and application examples for a Markov decision process agent show how two of the FaMSeC factors (outcome assessment and solver quality) can be computed and reported for a range of possible tasking contexts through novel use of meta-utility functions, behavior simulations, and surrogate prediction models.</description>
