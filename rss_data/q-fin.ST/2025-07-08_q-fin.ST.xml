      <title>High Frequency Quoting Under Liquidity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quoting algorithms are fundamental to electronic trading systems, enabling participants to post limit orders in a systematic and adaptive manner. In multi-asset or multi-contract settings, selecting the appropriate reference instrument for pricing quotes is essential to managing execution risk and minimizing trading costs. This work presents a framework for reference selection based on predictive modeling of short-term price stability. We employ multivariate Hawkes processes to model the temporal clustering and cross-excitation of order flow events, capturing the dynamics of activity at the top of the limit order book. To complement this, we introduce a Composite Liquidity Factor (CLF) that provides instantaneous estimates of slippage based on structural features of the book, such as price discontinuities and depth variation across levels. Unlike Hawkes processes, which capture temporal dependencies but not the absolute price structure of the book, the CLF offers a static snapshot of liquidity. A rolling voting mechanism is used to convert these signals into real-time reference decisions. Empirical evaluation on high-frequency market data demonstrates that forecasts derived from the Hawkes process align more closely with market-optimal quoting choices than those based on CLF. These findings highlight the complementary roles of dynamic event modeling and structural liquidity metrics in guiding quoting behavior under execution constraints.</description>
