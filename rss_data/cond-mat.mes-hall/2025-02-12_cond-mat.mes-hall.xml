      <title>Effect of disorder and strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Germanium quantum dots in strained $\text{Ge}/\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_{x}$ heterostructures exhibit fast and coherent hole qubit control in experiments. In this work, we theoretically and numerically address the effects of random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits. Electrical operation of hole quantum dot spin qubits is enabled by the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) originating from the intrinsic SOC in the Ge valence band as well as from the structural inversion asymmetry inherent in the underlying 2D hole gas. We use the atomistic valence force field (VFF) method to compute the strain due to random alloy disorder, and thermal expansion models in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the strain from a realistic gate-stack of planar hole quantum dot confinement. Recently, spin-orbit coupling terms $\propto k$ have been shown to be induced by strain inhomogeneity. Our hybrid approach to realistic device modeling suggests that strain inhomogeneity due to both random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain make a strong contribution to the linear-$k$ Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, which eventually dominates hole spin EDSR; and there exist specific in-plane orientations of the global magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ and the microwave drive $\mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{\text{ac}}$ for maximum EDSR Rabi frequency of the hole spin qubit. The current model including strain inhomogeneity accurately predicts the EDSR Rabi frequency to be $\!\sim\!100$ MHz for typical electric and magnetic fields in experiments, which represents at least an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over phenomenological models assuming uniform uniaxial strain. State-of-the-art atomistic tight binding calculations via nano-electronic modeling (NEMO3D) are in agreement with the $\mathbf{k}{\cdot}\mathbf{p}$ description.</description>

      <title>Majorana quasiparticles in atomic spin chains on superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the past decade, Majorana quasiparticles have become one of the hot topics in condensed matter research. Besides the fundamental interest in the realization of particles being their own antiparticles, going back to basic concepts of elementary particle physics, Majorana quasiparticles in condensed matter systems offer exciting potential applications in topological quantum computation due to their non-Abelian quantum exchange statistics. Motivated by theoretical predictions about possible realizations of Majorana quasiparticles as zero-energy modes at boundaries of topological superconductors, experimental efforts have focussed in particular on quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor and magnet-superconductor hybrid systems. However, an unambiguous proof of the existence of Majorana quasiparticles is still challenging and requires considerable improvements in materials science, atomic-scale characterization and control of interface quality, as well as complementary approaches of detecting various facets of Majorana quasiparticles. Bottom-up atom-by-atom fabrication of disorder-free atomic spin chains on atomically clean superconducting substrates has recently allowed deep insight into the emergence of topological sub-gap Shiba bands and associated Majorana states from the level of individual atoms up to extended chains, thereby offering the possibility for critical tests of Majorana physics in disorder-free model-type 1D hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Density Functional Tight-Binding Captures Plasmon-Driven H$_2$ Dissociation on Al Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum nanocrystals offer a promising platform for plasmonic photocatalysis, yet a detailed understanding of their electron dynamics and consequent photocatalytic performance has been challenging thus far due to computational limitations. Here, we employ density functional tight-binding methods (DFTB) to investigate the optical properties and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation dynamics of Al nanocrystals with varying sizes and geometries. Our real-time simulations reveal that Al's unique free-electron nature enables efficient light-matter interactions and rapid electronic thermalization. Cubic and octahedral nanocrystals ranging from 0.5 to 4.5 nm exhibit size-dependent plasmon resonances in the UV, with distinct spectral features arising from the particle geometry and electronic structure. By simulating H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation near Al nanocrystals, we demonstrate that hot electrons generated through plasmon excitation can overcome the molecule's strong chemical bond within tens of femtoseconds. The laser intensity threshold is comparable to previous reports for Ag nanocrystals, though significantly lower than that of Au. Notably, the dipolar plasmon mode demonstrates higher efficiency for this reaction than the localized interband transition for particles at these sizes. Taken together, this work provides mechanistic insights into plasmon-driven catalysis and showcases DFTB's capability to study quantum plasmonics at unprecedented length and time scales.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic resonance energy transfer with strained phosphorene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the resonance energy transfer (RET) rate between quantum emitters (QEs) near a phosphorene/SiC interface under the effects of uniaxial strain. Using a low-energy tight-binding model, we describe the electronic structure of strained phosphorene in an experimentally feasible situation. Due to the anisotropic electronic structure of phosphorene, we demonstrate that the RET rate drastically depends on the direction in which the QEs are separated relative to the phosphorene lattice. More specifically, we obtain a large variation in the RET rate when the QEs are separated along the zigzag direction, in contrast to a rather small variation when separated along the armchair direction of phosphorene's crystalline structure. Furthermore, our results reveal that the RET rate can be highly modulated by uniaxial strain in phosphorene when considering emitters placed along the zigzag direction. Finally, by means of a simple toy model, we also show that this anisotropy in the RET rate is a general characteristic produced by anisotropic 2D materials.</description>

      <title>An Unconventional Ultra-Sub-Wavelength Receiving Nano-Antenna Activated by ac Spin Pumping and the ac Inverse Spin Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an extreme sub-wavelength unconventional receiving antenna. It consists of an array of nanomagnets connected to heavy metal nanostrips. Incident electromagnetic (EM) radiation generates intrinsic and extrinsic spin waves in the nanomagnets, which pump spin into the heavy metal nanostrips at their own frequencies giving rise to a polychromatic alternating voltage across the latter owing to the ac inverse spin Hall effect. This implements a receiving nano-antenna. We demonstrate its operation at two different EM wave frequencies of 1.5 GHz and 2.4 GHz - the latter being the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi frequency. We measure the receiving gain at 2.4 GHz to be approximately -9 db. The free space radiated wavelength "lambda" at 2.4 GHz is 12.5 cm while the antenna area A is merely 160 micron^2, making the ratio A/lambda^2 = 0.97x10^-8. This antenna's receiving gain should be very poor because of the tiny size. Yet the measured gain is more than 4000 times larger than the theoretical limit for a conventional antenna of this size at this wavelength because of the unconventional operating principle.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Bloch States at Integer Flux Quanta Induced by Super-moir\'e Potential in Graphene Aligned with Twisted Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electron systems in both magnetic fields and periodic potentials are described by Hofstadter butterfly, a fundamental problem of solid-state physics.While moir\'e systems provide a powerful method to realize this spectrum, previous experiments, however, have been limited to fractional flux quanta regime due to the difficulty of building ~ 50 nm periodic modulations.Here, we demonstrate a super-moir\'e strategy to overcome this challenge. By aligning monolayer graphene (G) with 1.0{\deg} twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-hBN), a 63.2 nm bichromatic G/t-hBN super-moir\'e is constructed, made possible by exploiting the electrostatic nature of t-hBN potential.Under magnetic field B, magnetic Bloch states at integer flux quanta (1-9) are achieved and observed as integer Brown-Zak oscillations, expanding the flux quanta from factions to integers.Theoretical analysis reproduces these experimental findings. This work opens new avenues to study unexplored Hofstadter butterfly, explore emergent topological order at integer flux quanta and engineer long-wavelength periodic modulations.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Volkov interference in a semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intense light-field can dress both Bloch electrons inside crystals and photo-emitted free electrons in the vacuum, dubbed as Floquet and Volkov states respectively. These quantum states can further interfere coherently, modulating light-field dressed states. Here, we report experimental evidence of the Floquet-Volkov interference in a semiconductor - black phosphorus. A highly asymmetric modulation of the spectral weight is observed for the Floquet-Volkov states, and such asymmetry can be further controlled by rotating the pump polarization. Our work reveals the quantum interference between different light-field dressed electronic states, providing insights for material engineering on the ultrafast timescale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A robust and efficient model for investigating the ultrafast dynamics of magnetic materials excited by laser pulses has been created, integrating dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equations with a quantum thermostat and a two-temperature model. The model has been successfully applied to three archetypal materials in the literature: nickel, cobalt, and iron. Additionally, analysis of the ultrafast dynamic susceptibility tensor indicates that off-diagonal components display specific features depending on whether a continuous external magnetic field is present.</description>

      <title>Robust zero modes in PbTe-Pb hybrid nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes in tunneling conductance are expected to manifest as robust zero bias peaks (ZBPs). While ZBPs alone are not conclusive evidence of Majorana modes due to alternative explanations, robust ZBPs remain a crucial and necessary first-step indicator in the search for topological states. Here, we report the observation of robust ZBPs in PbTe-Pb hybrid nanowires. The peak height can reach $2e^2/h$, though it does not yet form a quantized plateau. Importantly, these ZBPs can remain non-split over sizable ranges in both magnetic field and gate voltage scans, highlighting their robustness. We discuss possible interpretations based on Majorana zero modes as well as Andreev bound states.</description>

      <title>From surface Fermi arcs to Fermi loops in the Dirac semimetal Cd3As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arc-like topological surface states, i.e., surface Fermi arcs, have long been recognized as the hallmark of Dirac semimetals. However, recent theories suggest that the surface Fermi arcs could evolve into closed Fermi loops, akin to surface states in topological insulators, while preserving the bulk Dirac semimetal phase. Here we experimentally reveal the evolution of Fermi arcs to Fermi loops in the surface-modified Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 nanoplate through gate voltage-dependent spin transport and quantum oscillation measurements. Surface modification, achieved by heavy metal atom deposition and water molecule adsorption, leads to an increase in the current-induced spin polarization at higher gate voltages, contrasting with the decrease observed in the pristine nanoplate. We also observe surface Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations with frequencies that scale linearly with gate voltage, aligning with a Fermi loop scenario. These findings indicate a transition from Fermi arcs to a closed Fermi loop in the surface-modified Cd3As2 nanoplate, consistent with the theoretically predicted fragile topological nature of Cd3As2. Our research offers profound insights into the transitions among these subtle topological states in Dirac semimetals, paving the way for manipulating topological surface states for high-performance spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Revealing Higher-Order Topological Bulk-boundary Correspondence in Bismuth Crystal with Spin-helical Hinge State Loop and Proximity Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials are typically characterized by gapless boundary states originated from nontrivial bulk band topology, known as topological bulk-boundary correspondence. Recently, this fundamental concept has been generalized in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs). E.g., a second-order three-dimensional (3D) TI hosts one-dimensional (1D) topological hinge states winding around the crystal. However, a complete verification of higher-order topology is still lacking as it requires probing all the crystal boundaries. Here we studied a promising candidate of second-order TI, bismuth (Bi), in the form of mesoscopic crystals grown on superconducting V3Si. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we directly observed dispersive 1D states on various hinges of the crystal. Upon introducing magnetic scatterers, new scattering channels emerged selectively on certain hinges, revealing their spin-helical nature. Combining first-principle calculation and global symmetry analysis, we find these hinge states are topological and formed a closed loop encircling the crystal. This provides direct evidence on the higher-order topology in Bi. Moreover, proximity superconductivity is observed in the topological hinge states, enabling HOTI as a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of Cavity Vacuum and Emergent Gyrotropic Effects in Embedded moir\'{e} Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an electronic system, spontaneous symmetry breaking can arise from many-body interaction between electrons, leading to degenerate ground states distinguishable by emergent effects otherwise prohibited by the symmetry. Here we show that ultrastrong coupling of a mesoscopic electronic system to the vacuum of a cavity resonator can lead to another paradigm of spontaneous breaking of spatial symmetries in both systems. As a pertinent example, we consider the orbital gyrotropic effects in a moir\'{e} superlattice embedded in a THz split ring cavity resonator. Our mean-field and exact diagonalization calculations consistently demonstrate a spontaneous parity symmetry breaking in both the electronic ground state and the cavity vacuum, leading to two degenerate hybrid ground states distinguished by their opposite orbital gyrotropic Hall and magnetic effects. These sizable responses in the cavity-embedded moir\'{e} superlattice are highly tunable by both the cavity field polarization and interlayer bias on the moir\'{e} superlattice, providing an advanced platform for manipulating gyrotropic effects.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of ac-driven quantum transport and minimal excitations in the fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the challenges of achieving minimal excitations in the fractional quantum Hall effect and addressing Hong-Ou-Mandel -type setups under ac drives when the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid description is adopted. We apply the unifying non-equilibrium perturbative approach to weak backscattering through a quantum point contact in a two or three terminal geometry such as the "anyon collider". We show that the photoassisted noise is always higher than the photoassisted current, thus is super-Poissonian. This is an alternative theorem to Levitov's one, violated in the TLL model, thus questioning the expression "photoassisted". In the two-terminal geometry, we analyze carefully the validity domain of the perturbative approach and the possibility to achieve the quantum regime close to frequency locking, where singularities give access to the fractional charge. Then we show the persistence of equilibrium contributions to photoassisted noise that prevent access to zero-temperature and Poissonian limits under Lorentzian pulses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prior works on similar setups, as well as "Leviton crystallization" where the zero-temperature limit is inappropriate, may be unreliable. Our findings are also applicable to Hall interferometers, coherent conductors, and Josephson or phase-slip junctions strongly coupled to an ohmic environment under an ac bias.</description>

Abstract: Self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) are of particular importance for the deterministic generation of spin-photon entanglement. One promising scheme relies on the Larmor precession of a spin in a transverse magnetic field, which is governed by the in-plane $g$-factors of the electron and valence band heavy-hole. We probe the origin of heavy-hole $g$-factor anisotropy with respect to the in-plane magnetic field direction and uncover how it impacts the entanglement generated between the spin and the photon polarization. First, using polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements on a single QD, we determine that the impact of valence-band mixing dominates over effects due to a confinement-renormalized cubic Luttinger $q$ parameter. From this, we construct a comprehensive hole $g$-tensor model. We then use this model to simulate the concurrence and fidelity of spin-photon entanglement generation with anisotropic hole $g$-factors, which can be tuned via magnetic field angle and excitation polarization. The results demonstrate that post-growth control of the hole $g$-factor can be used to improve spin-photon cluster state generation.</description>

      <title>Tomographic Signatures of Interacting Majorana and Andreev States in Superconductor-Semiconductor Transmon Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor-based Josephson junctions embedded within a Cooper-pair-box can host complex many-body states, such as interacting Andreev states and potentially other quasi-particles of topological origin. Here, we study the insights that could be revealed from a tomographic reconstruction of the Cooper-pair charge distribution of the junction prepared in its ground state. We posit that interacting and topological states can be identified from distinct signatures within the probability distribution of the charge states. Furthermore, the comprehensive dataset provides direct access to information theory metrics elucidating the entanglement between the charge sector of the superconductor and the microscopic degrees of freedom in the junction. We demonstrate how these metrics serve to further classify differences between the types of excitations in the junction.</description>

      <title>On the Entire Structure of the Energy Bands of 1D Moir\'{e} Superchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a general model of two atomic chains forming a moir\'{e} pattern due to a small mismatch in their lattice spacings, given by $\theta = (a_{1} - a_{2})/a_{2}$. Assuming arbitrary single-band dispersion relations $\varepsilon_{1}(p)$ and $\varepsilon_{2}(q)$ for the chains, along with an arbitrary inter-chain coupling term $T(x)$, we show that the entire spectrum of such a one-dimensional moir\'{e} superchain is governed by a single three-term recurrence (TTR) relation. We analyze this TTR relation using the discrete WKB method and demonstrate how the entire structure of the spectrum as well as emergence of flat bands can be easily identified from a pair of upper and lower potential functions of the TTR relation. We also comment on the chiral limit of the moir\'{e} superchain, which can be viewed, in some sense, as a 1D analog of the chiral limit of Twisted Bilayer Graphene.</description>

      <title>Many-body perturbation theory for moir\'{e} systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'{e} systems such as magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene have attracted significant attention due to their ability to host correlated phenomena including superconductivity and strongly correlated insulating states. By defining the single-particle Green's function in the band basis, we systematically develop a many-body perturbation theory framework to address correlations beyond the usual mean-field Hartree-Fock approaches. As a specific example, we first analyze twisted bilayer graphene within the Hartree-Fock approximation. We derive analytical solutions for symmetry-breaking states at integer fillings and the finite-temperature metal-insulator transition that closely match previously known numerical results in the literature. Moving beyond Hartree-Fock, we incorporate self-consistent GW corrections demonstrating that first-order diagrams significantly overestimate the filling-dependent fluctuations in the electronic compressibility. This framework provides a comprehensive pathway for exploring strong electronic correlations in moir\'{e} systems beyond mean-field, giving new insights into the interplay of symmetry breaking and electron correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in coherently strained, low-dislocation AlN/GaN/AlN quantum wells (QWs), including both undoped and $\delta$-doped structures. SdH measurements reveal a single subband occupation in the undoped GaN QW and two subband occupation in the $\delta$-doped GaN QW. More importantly, SdH oscillations enable direct measurement of critical two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) parameters at the Fermi level: carrier density and ground state energy level, electron effective mass ($m^* \approx 0.289\,m_{\rm e}$ for undoped GaN QW and $m^* \approx 0.298\,m_{\rm e}$ for $\delta$-doped GaN QW), and quantum scattering time ($\tau_{\rm q} \approx 83.4 \, \text{fs}$ for undoped GaN QW and $\tau_{\rm q} \approx 130.6 \, \text{fs}$ for $\delta$-doped GaN QW). These findings provide important insights into the fundamental properties of 2DEGs that are strongly quantum confined in the thin GaN QWs, essential for designing nitride heterostructures for high-performance electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Mixed-state geometric phases of coherent and squeezed spin states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two mixed-state geometric phases, known as the Uhlmann phase and interferometric phase (IGP), of spin coherent states (CSSs) and spin squeezed states (SSSs) are analyzed. While each phase follows its parallel-transport condition, we also consider the non-adiabatic IGP for arbitrary unitary evolution beyond parallel transport. For the $j=3/2$ CSS, the Uhlmann phase shows temperature-induced topological phase transitions with jumps. The IGP and non-adiabatic IGP for the $j=3/2$ CSS also exhibits temperature-induced jumps. In contrast, the Uhlmann phase of the $j=1$ SSS exhibits smooth behavior without any temperature-induced transition. Interestingly, the parallel-transport condition of the IGP of the $j=1$ SSS in general does not allow a solution at finite temperature. Instead, the non-adiabatic IGP for the $j=1$ SSS has a solution showing smooth behavior as the squeezing parameter and temperature change. We also briefly discuss possible experimental implications and simulations.</description>

      <title>A multiscale Bayesian approach to quantification and denoising of energy-dispersive x-ray data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum imaging yields compositional information with a spatial resolution down to the atomic level. However, experimental limitations often produce extremely sparse and noisy EDX spectra. Under such conditions, every detected X-ray must be leveraged to obtain the maximum possible amount of information about the sample. To this end, we introduce a robust multiscale Bayesian approach that accounts for the Poisson statistics in the EDX data and leverages their underlying spatial correlations. This is combined with EDX spectral simulation (elemental contributions and Bremsstrahlung background) into a Bayesian estimation strategy. When tested using simulated datasets, the chemical maps obtained with this approach are more accurate and preserve a higher spatial resolution than those obtained by standard methods. These properties translate to experimental datasets, where the method enhances the atomic resolution chemical maps of a canonical tetragonal ferroelectric PbTiO3 sample, such that ferroelectric domains are mapped with unit-cell resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general protocol for obtaining the charge basis density matrix of a superconducting quantum circuit. Inspired by cavity state tomography, our protocol combines Josephson-energy pulse sequences and projective charge-basis readout to access the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, a scheme we thus dub charge basis tomography. We simulate the reconstruction of the ground state of a target transmon using the Aharonov-Casher effect in a probe qubit to realise projective readout and show the Hilbert-Schmidt distance can detect deviations from the correct model Hamiltonian. Unlocking this ability to validate models using the ground state sets the stage for using transmons to detect interacting and topological phases, particularly in materials where time-domain and spectroscopic probes can be limited by intrinsic noise.</description>

      <title>Spin-valley locked excited states spectroscopy in a one-particle bilayer graphene quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current semiconductor qubits rely either on the spin or on the charge degree of freedom to encode quantum information. By contrast, in bilayer graphene the valley degree of freedom, stemming from the crystal lattice symmetry, is a robust quantum number that can therefore be harnessed for this purpose. The simplest implementation of a valley qubit would rely on two states with opposite valleys as in the case of a single-carrier bilayer graphene quantum dot immersed in a small perpendicular magnetic field ($B_\perp\lesssim 100$mT). However, the single-carrier quantum dot excited states spectrum has not been resolved to date in the relevant magnetic field range. Here, we fill this gap, by measuring the parallel and perpendicular magnetic field dependence of this spectrum with an unprecedented resolution of $4\mu$eV. We use a time-resolved charge detection technique that gives us access to individual tunnel events. Our results come as a direct verification of the predicted spectrum and establish a new upper-bound on inter-valley mixing, equal to our energy resolution. Our charge detection technique opens the door to measuring the relaxation time of a valley qubit in a single-carrier bilayer graphene quantum dot.</description>

Abstract: We show that driving optical phonons above a threshold fluence induces spatiotemporal orders, where material properties oscillate at an incommensurate wavevector $q_0$ in space and at half the drive frequency in time. The order is robust against temperature on timescales much larger than the lifetime of the excited modes and can be accompanied by a static $2q_0$ modulation. We make predictions for time-resolved diffraction and provide estimates for candidate materials. Our results show the possibility of using THz waves in solids to realize tunable incommensurate order on the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Majorana qubit readout by a point-contact detector under finite bias voltages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the problem of a Majorana box qubit (MBQ) readout by a point-contact (PC) detector. The logic states of the MBQ are associated with the combined fermion parities of the MBQ and its tunnel-coupled quantum dot, which is measured by a PC detector. Beyond the existing studies on limiting bias voltage regimes, we analyze the steady-state current and the current power spectrum across all bias voltages. Our results indicate that the MBQ readout via the parity-dependent detector current is effective only at low bias voltage regime and requires the dot energy level to be off-resonance with the Majorana qubit. In contrast, the current power spectrum allows MBQ readout through the parity-dependent Rabi oscillation peak signals for arbitrary bias voltages, without restrictions on the dot energy level. Particularly, with focus on the MBQ measurement visibility, we analyze the peak-to-pedestal ratio for each characteristic peak (associated with each logic state of the qubit) and the signal-to-noise ratio of the two peaks. By examining these two metrics, we identify the optimal bias voltage window for the PC detector at low temperature limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest for platforms to generate and control exotic excitonic states has greatly benefited from the advent of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers and their heterostructures. Among the unconventional excitonic states, quadrupolar excitons - a superposition of two dipolar excitons with anti-aligned dipole moments - are of great interest for applications in quantum simulations and for the investigation of many-body physics. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate the emergence of quadrupolar excitons in natural MoSe$_2$ homobilayers, whose energy shifts quadratically in electric field. In contrast to trilayer systems, MoSe$_2$ homobilayers have many advantages, which include a larger coupling between dipolar excitons. Our experimental observations are complemented by many-particle theory calculations offering microscopic insights in the formation of quadrupolar excitons. Our results suggest TMD homobilayers as ideal platform for the engineering of excitonic states and their interaction with light and thus candidate for carrying out on-chip quantum simulations.</description>

Abstract: Based on the correspondence between circuit Laplacian and Schrodinger equation, recent investigations have shown that classical electric circuits can be used to simulate various topological physics and the Schrodinger's equation. Furthermore, a series of quantum-inspired information processing have been implemented by using classical electric circuit networks. In this review, we begin by analyzing the similarity between circuit Laplacian and lattice Hamiltonian, introducing topological physics based on classical circuits. Subsequently, we provide reviews of the research progress in quantum-inspired information processing based on the electric circuit, including discussions of topological quantum computing with classical circuits, quantum walk based on classical circuits, quantum combinational logics based on classical circuits, electric-circuit realization of fast quantum search, implementing unitary transforms and so on.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</description>

However, due to its vanishing magnetization and two-dimensional nature, it is challenging to detect the existence of its noncollinear magnetization. Here, we show that a van der Waals junction based on a spin-spiral magnet and a quantum spin Hall insulator enables obtaining signatures of noncollinear magnetization directly from electrical measurements. Our strategy exploits the sensitivity of helical states to local breaking of time-reversal symmetry, enabling the detection of local magnetic orders even in the absence of net magnetization. We show that the combination of spin-spiral order and nonmagnetic disorder gives rise to scattering in the helical channels that can be directly associated with the spiral exchange coupling and residual nonmagnetic disorder strength. Our results show how electrical transport measurement provides a method to detect spin-spiral magnets by leveraging helical states in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Cubic silicon-carbide crystals (3C-SiC), known for their high thermal conductivity and in-plane stress, hold significant promise for the development of high-quality ($Q$) mechanical oscillators. We reveal degeneracy-breaking phenomena in 3C-phase crystalline silicon-carbide membrane and present high-$Q$ mechanical modes in pairs or clusters. The 3C-SiC material demonstrates excellent microwave compatibility with superconducting circuits. Thus, we can establish a coherent electromechanical interface, enabling precise control over 21 high-$Q$ mechanical modes from a single 3C-SiC square membrane. Benefiting from extremely high mechanical frequency stability, this interface enables tunable light slowing with group delays extending up to an impressive duration of \emph{an hour}. Coherent energy transfer between distinct mechanical modes are also presented. In this work, the studied 3C-SiC membrane crystal with their significant properties of multiple acoustic modes and high-quality factors, provide unique opportunities for the encoding, storage, and transmission of quantum information via bosonic phonon channels.</description>

      <title>Topological transitions in quantum jump dynamics: Hidden exceptional points</title>

Abstract: Complex spectra of dissipative quantum systems may exhibit degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs). At these points the systems' dynamics may undergo drastic changes. Phenomena associated with EPs and their applications have been extensively studied in relation to various experimental platforms, including, i.a., the superconducting circuits. While most of the studies focus on EPs appearing due to the variation of the system's physical parameters, we focus on EPs emerging in the full counting statistics of the system. We consider a monitored three level system and find multiple EPs in the Lindbladian eigenvalues considered as functions of a counting field. These "hidden" EPs are not accessible without the insertion of the counting field into the Linbladian, i.e., if only the density matrix of the system is studied. Nevertheless, we show that the "hidden" EPs are accessible experimentally. We demonstrate that these EPs signify transitions between different topological classes which are rigorously characterized in terms of the braid theory. Furthermore, we identify dynamical observables affected by these transitions and demonstrate how experimentally measured quantum jump distributions can be used to spot transitions between different topological regimes. Additionally, we establish a duality between the conventional Lindbladian EPs (zero counting field) and some of the "hidden" ones. Our findings allow for easier experimental observations of the EP transitions, normally concealed by the Lindbladian steady state, without applying postselection schemes. These results can be directly generalized to any monitored open system as long as it is described within the Lindbladian formalism.</description>

      <title>Broadband light extraction from near-surface NV centers using crystalline-silicon antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use crystalline silicon (Si) antennas to efficiently extract broadband single-photon fluorescence from shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond into free space. Our design features relatively easy-to-pattern high-index Si resonators on the diamond surface to boost photon extraction by overcoming total internal reflection and Fresnel reflection at the diamond-air interface, and providing modest Purcell enhancement, without etching or otherwise damaging the diamond surface. In simulations, ~17 times more single photons are collected from a single NV center compared to the case without the antenna; in experiments, we observe an enhancement of ~9 times, limited by spatial alignment between the NV and the antenna. Our approach can be readily applied to other color centers in diamond, and more generally to the extraction of light from quantum emitters in wide-bandgap materials.</description>

      <title>Simulating a quasiparticle on a quantum device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a variational approach to explore quasiparticle excitations in interacting quantum many-body systems, motivated by the potential in leveraging near-term noisy intermediate scale quantum devices for quantum state preparation. By exploiting translation invariance and potentially other abelian symmetries of the many-body Hamiltonian, we extend the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach to construct spatially localized quasiparticle states that encode information on the whole excited band, allowing us to achieve quantum parallelism. We benchmark the proposed algorithm via numerical simulations performed on the one-dimension transverse field Ising chain. We show that VQE can capture both the magnon quasiparticles of the paramagnetic phase, and the topologically non-trivial domain wall excitations in the ferromagnetic regime. We show that the localized quasiparticle states constructed with VQE contain accessible information on the full band of quasiparticles, and provide valuable insight into the way interactions renormalize the bare spin flip or domain wall excitations of the simple, trivially solvable limits of the model. These results serve as important theoretical input towards utilizing quantum simulators to directly access the quasiparticles of strongly interacting quantum systems, as well as to gain insight into crucial experimentally measured properties directly determined by the nature of these quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>High-impedance resonators for strong coupling to an electron on helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The in-plane motion of an electron on helium can couple to superconducting microwave resonators via electrical dipole coupling, offering a robust and rapid readout scheme. In previous efforts, microwave resonator designs for electrons on helium have lacked the coupling strength to reach the strong coupling regime, where coherent quantum effects outlast both electron and resonator decoherence rates. High-impedance superconducting microwave resonators offer a path to strong coupling, but integrating such resonators with electrons on helium remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we introduce a high-impedance resonator design compatible with strong coupling to electrons on helium. We fabricate and measure titanium nitride resonators with median internal quality factors of $3.9\times 10^5$ and average impedance of 2.5 k$\Omega$, promising a seven-fold increase in coupling strength compared with standard 50$\Omega$ resonators. Additionally, we develop a simplified resonator model from the capacitance matrix and sheet inductance that accurately predicts the mode frequencies, significantly simplifying the design process of future resonators for investigating quantum effects with electrons on helium.</description>

      <title>Ultra-sensitive integrated circuit sensors based on high-order nonHermitian topological physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-precision sensors are of fundamental importance in modern society and technology.Although numerous sensors have been developed, obtaining sensors with higher levels of sensitivity and stronger robustness has always been expected. Here, we propose theoretically and demonstrate experimentally a novel class of sensors with superior performances based on exotic properties of highorder non-Hermitian topological physics. The frequency shift induced by perturbations for these sensors can show an exponential growth with respect to the size of the device, which can well beyond the limitations of conventional sensors. The fully integrated circuit chips have been designed and fabricated in a standard 65nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor process technology. The sensitivity of systems not only less than 0.001fF has been experimentally verified, they are also robust against disorders.Our proposed ultra-sensitive integrated circuit sensors can possess a wide range of applications in various fields and show an exciting prospect for next-generation sensing technologies.</description>
