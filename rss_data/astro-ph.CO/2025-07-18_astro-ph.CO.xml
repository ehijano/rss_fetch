      <title>Reconstruction of Dark Matter and Baryon Density From Galaxies: A Comparison of Linear, Halo Model and Machine Learning-Based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many analyses in cosmology it is necessary to reconstruct the likely distribution of unobserved fields, such as dark matter or baryons, from observed luminous tracers. The dominant approach in cosmology has been to use the so-called halo model, which assumes radially symmetric profiles centered around luminous tracers such as galaxies. More recently, field-level machine learning methods have been proposed that can learn to estimate the unobserved field after being trained on simulations. However, it is unclear whether machine learning methods indeed significantly improve over linear methods or the halo model. In this paper we make a systematic comparison of different approaches to reconstruct dark matter and baryons from galaxy data using the CAMELS simulations. We find the best results using a combined GNN-CNN approach. We also provide a general analysis and visualization of the relationship of matter, baryons, halos and galaxies in these simulations to interpret our results.</description>

      <title>Sample Variance Denoising in Cylindrical 21-cm Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art simulations of reionisation-era 21-cm signal have limited volumes, generally orders of magnitude smaller than observations. Consequently, the Fourier modes in common between simulation and observation have limited overlap, especially in cylindrical (2D) k-space that is natural for 21-cm interferometry. This makes sample variance (i.e. the deviation of the simulated sample from the population mean due to finite box size) a potential issue when interpreting upcoming 21-cm observations. We introduce \texttt{21cmPSDenoiser}, a score-based diffusion model that can be applied to a single, forward-modelled realisation of the 21-cm 2D power spectrum (PS), predicting the corresponding \textit{population mean} on-the-fly during Bayesian inference. Individual samples of 2D Fourier amplitudes of wave modes relevant to current 21-cm observations can deviate from the mean by over 50\% for 300 cMpc simulations, even when only considering stochasticity due to sampling of Gaussian initial conditions. \texttt{21cmPSDenoiser} reduces this deviation by an order of magnitude, outperforming current state-of-the-art sample variance mitigation techniques like Fixing \&amp; Pairing by a factor of few at almost no additional computational cost ($\sim6$s per PS). Unlike emulators, the denoiser is not tied to a particular model or simulator since its input is a (model-agnostic) realisation of the 2D 21-cm PS. Indeed, we confirm that it generalises to PS produced with a different 21-cm simulator than those on which it was trained. To quantify the improvement in parameter recovery, we simulate a 21-cm PS detection by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA) and run different inference pipelines corresponding to commonly-used approximations. We find that using \texttt{21cmPSDenoiser} in the inference pipeline outperforms other approaches, yielding an unbiased posterior that is 50\% narrower.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Mass-sheet Degeneracy in Time-delay Cosmology with Lensed and Unlensed Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an innovative framework aimed at overcoming the ongoing issue of mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in time-delay cosmography by incorporating observations of both gravitationally lensed and unlensed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). By simultaneously using lensing magnification measurements $\mu^{\rm{obs}}$ and cosmic distance ratios ($D_s/D_{ds}$), we develop a Bayesian framework capable of breaking the MSD. Specifically, we reconstruct the distance-redshift and magnitude-redshift relations from unlensed Type Ia supernovae using Gaussian process to avoid dependence on specific cosmological models. Our framework shows substantial efficacy in resolving the MSD by imposing constraints on the MSD parameter $\lambda$. Furthermore, we extend this framework to analyze multiple gravitational lensing systems. The results show strong agreement with the fiducial MSD parameters used in the data simulation, confirming our method's effectiveness in mitigating the MSD. Ultimately, this technique enables the derivation of corrected time-delay distance measurements under the MSD, improving the precision of cosmological parameters inferred from strong lensing systems.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave standard sirens: A brief review of cosmological parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations are expected to serve as a powerful and independent probe of the expansion history of the universe. By providing direct and calibration-free measurements of luminosity distances through waveform analysis, GWs provide a fundamentally different and potentially more robust approach to measuring cosmic-scale distances compared to traditional electromagnetic observations, which is known as the standard siren method. In this review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren cosmology, the latest observational results, and prospects for constraining cosmological parameters using future GW detections. We first introduce standard sirens based on how redshift information is obtained and outline the Bayesian framework used in cosmological parameter estimation. We then review the measurements on the Hubble constant from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and present the potential role of future standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimations. A central focus of this review is the unique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies inherent in the EM observations. Since the cosmological parameter degeneracy directions of GW and EM observations are quite different (roughly orthogonal in some cases), their combination can significantly improve constraints on cosmological parameters. This complementarity is expected to become one of the most critical advantages for GW standard siren cosmology. Looking forward, we highlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging late-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity mapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe for exploring the late universe. Finally, we introduce the challenges and the role of machine learning in future standard siren analysis.</description>

      <title>Analytic Gravitational Wave Spectrum in Next-to-Minimal Bouncing Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bouncing cosmology offers a singularity-free alternative to inflation, but its minimal realization-comprising only four cosmic phases-predicts a simple power-law stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) with a narrow observational window. We introduce the next-to-minimal bouncing cosmology (NMBC), which adds an extra early contraction phase that imprints a broken power-law feature in the SGWB spectrum, enhancing detectability. Using our matrix-representation method grounded in an inequality algebra, we derive a closed-form expression for the NMBC SGWB spectrum. From this analytical result, we show that all NMBC models satisfying the current \(\Delta N_{\rm eff}\) bound \(\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2(f)&lt;1.7\times10^{-6}\) automatically avoid the trans-Planckian problem, \(\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}&lt;0.79\,m_{\rm pl}\). These findings establish the NMBC as a self-consistent, self-contained framework capable of generating a potentially detectable SGWB in both astrophysical and laboratory searches, and demonstrate the broad utility of our matrix-representation method for future SGWB analyses in multi-phase cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from First-Order Phase Transitions Assisted by Temperature-Enhanced Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scatterings whose cross sections increase as the cosmic temperature decreases, known as temperature-enhanced scatterings, can have a significant impact on the thermal effective potential of scalar fields responsible for driving cosmological first-order phase transitions. In this work, we systematically investigate how the inclusion of temperature-dependent corrections to the effective potential affects key phase transition parameters, including the nucleation temperature, latent heat release, and inverse duration parameter. These modifications influence both the strength and duration of the phase transition, which in turn determine the properties of the resulting stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Employing semi-analytic computational methods, we evaluate the GW spectra generated under these conditions and compare our predictions with the projected sensitivities of forthcoming detectors such as LISA, DECIGO, and BBO. Our analysis demonstrates that temperature-enhanced scatterings can substantially strengthen the phase transition and produce GW signals that lie within the reach of future observational facilities. This study highlights the importance of temperature-dependent microphysical processes in shaping early Universe cosmological signatures.</description>

      <title>Testing halo models for constraining astrophysical feedback with multi-probe modeling: I. 3D Power spectra and mass fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming Stage-IV surveys will deliver measurements of distribution of matter with unprecedented precision, demanding highly accurate theoretical models for cosmological parameter inference. A major source of modeling uncertainty lies in astrophysical processes associated with galaxy formation and evolution, which remain poorly understood. Probes such as the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, X-rays, and dispersion measure from fast radio bursts offer a promising avenue for mapping the distribution and thermal properties of cosmic baryons. A unified analytical framework capable of jointly modeling these observables is essential for fully harnessing the complementary information while mitigating probe-specific systematics. In this work, we present a detailed assessment of existing analytical models, which differ in their assumptions and prescriptions for simultaneously describing the distribution of matter and baryons in the universe. Using the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation, we test these models by jointly analyzing the 3D auto- and cross-power spectra of the matter and baryonic fields that underpin the above probes. We find that all models can reproduce the power spectra at sub-percent to few-percent accuracy, depending on the tracer combination and number of free parameters. Their ability to recover underlying halo properties, such as the evolution of gas abundance and thermodynamic profiles with halo mass, varies considerably. Our results suggest that these models require further refinement and testing for reliable interpretation of multi-wavelength datasets.</description>

      <title>ColdPress: Efficient Quantile-Based Compression of Photometric Redshift PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ColdPress is a Python module that compresses photometric redshift probability distribution functions (PDFs) by encoding quantiles of their cumulative distribution. For a fixed packet size (the default is 80 bytes per PDF), ColdPress attains a reconstruction accuracy comparable to the sparse-basis representation method implemented in the pdf_storage module of Carrasco-Kind &amp; Brunner (2014), yet reduces the computational cost by a factor of ~7000. I describe the implementation and quantify its compression speed and reconstruction accuracy in comparison to pdf_storage for real-life PDFs from two different photometric redshift codes. ColdPress is free software, available at https://github.com/ahc-photoz/coldpress-project.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields in the intracluster medium with TNG-Cluster: properties, morphology, and tangential anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the magnetic field properties of 352 massive galaxy clusters from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation with a focus on central magnetic field morphology in cool-core (CC) vs non-cool-core (NCC) clusters. We present the central values and radial profiles of magnetic field strength and plasma parameter as a function of mass, cooling status and redshift. Compared to low-redshift observations, TNG-Cluster produces reasonable magnetic field amplitudes in the central regions of clusters spanning a range of 1-200 muG. We then discuss the main finding of this work: z=0 cool-core clusters have preferentially tangential magnetic fields at a characteristic scale of ~ 0.1 r500c. These strongly tangential field orientations are specific to CCs. In contrast, across the full cluster population, magnetic fields show isotropic configurations at all radii and redshifts. As individual halos grow, the evolution of their magnetic field topologies is diverse: tangential features can be short-lived, persist over large cosmological time-scales, or periodically appear, vanish, and reappear towards z=0. We discuss the underlying physics and possible physical scenarios to explain the origin of these structures. We argue that both AGN feedback-driven outflows, and merger-driven sloshing motions, cannot explain the population-wide tangential bias in magnetic field orientation. Instead, we propose that the trapping of internal gravity waves is responsible for the tangentially biased magnetic field topologies that we find in cool-core TNG-Cluster halos, due to the strong entropy gradient in these clusters.</description>

      <title>A Step in Flux to Suppress Axion Isocurvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion in the pre-inflation scenario faces a stringent isocurvature constraint, which requires a relatively low Hubble scale during inflation. If the axion was heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, its isocurvature is suppressed and the constraint disappears. We point out a novel mechanism for achieving this, relying on the topological nature of a BF-type (monodromy) mass for the axion. Such a mass term has an integer coefficient, so it could naturally have been very large during inflation and exactly zero by the time of the QCD phase transition. This integer can be viewed as a quantized flux, which is discharged in a first-order phase transition that proceeds by the nucleation of charged branes. This mechanism can be embedded in cosmology in several different ways, with tunneling during, at the end of, or after inflation. We provide a detailed case study of the scenario in which the tunneling event occurs during inflation. We also comment briefly on possible UV completions within extra-dimensional gauge theories and string theory. Intriguingly, the phase transition could be accompanied by the emergence of the chiral Standard Model field content from a non-chiral theory during inflation.</description>

      <title>Sommerfeld Enhancement from Quantum Forces for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum forces are long-range interactions that arise only at the loop level. In this work, we study the Sommerfeld enhancement of dark matter (DM) annihilation cross sections caused by quantum forces. One notable feature of quantum forces is that they are subject to coherent enhancement in the presence of a background of mediator particles, which occurs in many situations in cosmology. We show that this effect has important implications for the Sommerfeld enhancement and DM physics. For the first time, we calculate the Sommerfeld factor induced by quantum forces for both bosonic and fermionic mediators, including the background corrections. We observe several novel features of the Sommerfeld factor that do not exist in the case of the Yukawa potential, such as temperature-induced resonance peaks for massless mediators, and having both enhancement and suppression effects in the same model with different DM masses. As direct applications, we discuss the DM phenomenology affected by the Sommerfeld enhancement from quantum forces, including thermal freeze-out, CMB spectral distortion from DM annihilation, and DM indirect detection. We highlight one particularly interesting effect relevant to indirect detection caused by the Sommerfeld enhancement in a non-thermal background of bosonic mediators in the galaxy, in which case the DM mass is shifted due to the background correction and the effective cross section for DM annihilation can be either enhanced or suppressed. This may be important for DM searches in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Bar-driven Streaming Motions Mimic a Massive Bulge in the Inner Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circular speed curve of the Milky Way provides a key constraint on its mass distribution, reflecting the axisymmetric component of the gravitational potential. This is especially critical in the inner Galaxy ($R \lesssim 4$ kpc), where non-axisymmetric structures such as the stellar bar and nuclear stellar disk strongly influence dynamics. However, significant discrepancies remain between circular speed curves inferred from stellar dynamical modeling and those derived from the terminal-velocity method applied to gas kinematics. To investigate this, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including cooling, heating, star formation, and feedback, under a realistic gravitational potential derived from stellar dynamical models calibrated to observational data. This potential includes the Galactic bar, stellar disks, dark matter halo, nuclear stellar disk, and nuclear star cluster. We generate synthetic longitude-velocity ($l$-$v$) diagrams and apply the terminal-velocity method to derive circular speeds. The simulated gas reproduces the observed terminal-velocity envelope, including a steep inner rise. We find this feature arises from bar-driven non-circular motions, which cause the terminal-velocity method to overestimate circular speeds by up to a factor of 2 at $R \sim 0.4$ kpc, and enclosed mass by up to a factor of 4. These results suggest that inner gas-based rotation curves can significantly overestimate central mass concentrations. The steep inner rise in gas-derived circular speeds does not require a massive classical bulge but can be explained by bar-induced streaming motions. Rather than proposing a new mechanism, our study provides a clear, Milky Way-specific demonstration of this effect, emphasizing the importance of dynamical modeling that explicitly includes non-circular motions for accurate mass inference in the inner Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Dark matter detection using optically trapped Rydberg atom tweezer arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new scheme for detecting wave-like dark matter (DM) using Rydberg atoms is proposed. Recent advances in trapping and manipulating Rydberg atoms make it possible to use Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays for DM detection. We present a simple and innovative experimental procedure that searches for excitations of trapped Rydberg atoms due to DM-induced electric field. A scan over DM mass is enabled with the use of the Zeeman and diamagnetic shifts of energy levels under an applied external magnetic field. Taking dark photon DM as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed experiment can have high sensitivity enough to probe previously unexplored regions of the parameter space of dark photon coupling strengths and masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression is the machine learning method for learning functions from data. After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.</description>

      <title>Robust Extraction of Global 21 cm Spectrum from Experiments with a Chromatic Beam Based on Physics-Motivated Error Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extraction of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization faces significant challenges. The bright and anisotropic Galactic foreground, which is 4 - 6 orders of magnitude brighter than the 21 cm signal, when convolved with the inevitably chromatic beam, introduces additional spectral structures that can easily mimic the real 21 cm signal. In this paper, we investigate the signal extraction for a lunar-orbit experiment, where the antenna moves fast in orbit and data from multiple orbits have to be used. We propose a physics-motivated and correlated modeling of both the foreground and the measurement errors. By dividing the sky into multiple regions according to the spectral index distribution and accounting for the full covariance of modeling errors, we jointly fit both the foreground and the 21 cm signal using simulated data for the Discovering the Sky at the Longest wavelength lunar orbit experiment. This method successfully extracts the 21 cm signals of various amplitudes from the simulated data even for a testing antenna with a relatively high level of chromaticity. This approach, which is robust against moderate beam chromaticity, significantly relaxes the stringent design and manufacturing requirements for the antenna, offering a practical solution for future 21 cm global signal experiments either on the ground or in space.</description>

      <title>Generation of Axions and Axion-Like Particles through Mass Parametric Resonance induced by Scalar Perturbations in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles can be generated in the early universe through misalignment production, thermal processes, the decay of topological defects, etc. In this paper, we show that scalar perturbations in the early universe could produce a significant amount of these particles primarily through mass parametric resonance effects. Scalar perturbations induce temperature fluctuations during the particle mass transition era, e.g. during the QCD phase transition. These temperature fluctuations modulate the particle mass, transferring energy into the field through a parametric mass resonance, which is a nonlinear effect. This process exhibits a substantially unstable region that could lead to explosive particle production. Notably, this mechanism does not generate additional isocurvature perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism of non-thermal particle production during inflation based on a narrow parametric resonance, akin to the dynamics of post-inflationary preheating. The mechanism is based on the production of scalar particles with a mass that is an oscillating function of the slowly-rolling inflaton field. This is achieved in a scenario for the collective spontaneous breaking of a U(1) gauge symmetry that, while originally proposed in the context of warm inflation, leads to non-equilibrium particle production sustaining a (sub-dominant) non-thermal radiation bath throughout inflation. We show that this may leave an observational imprint, namely oscillatory features in the primordial curvature power spectrum alongside a (mild) resonant enhancement of its amplitude, as well as secondary gravitational waves that can be probed with future CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing the nature of gravity in the low-acceleration limit: wide binaries of extreme separations with perspective effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have revealed a boost in gravitational acceleration with respect to the prediction by Newtonian gravity at low internal accelerations $\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m\,s$^{-2}$. This phenomenon is important because it does not permit the dark matter interpretation, unlike galaxy rotation curves. We extend previous analyses by increasing the maximum sky-projected separation from 30 to 50 kilo astronomical units (kau). We show that the so-called ``perspective effects'' are not negligible at this extended separation and, thus, incorporate it in our analysis. With wide binaries selected with very stringent criteria, we find that the gravitational acceleration boost factor, $\gamma_g \equiv g_{\rm obs}/g_{\mathrm N}$, is $1.61^{+0.37}_{-0.29}$ (from $\delta_{\rm obs-newt}\equiv (\log_{10}\gamma_g)/\sqrt{2}=0.147\pm0.062$) at Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-11.0}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, corresponding to separations of tens of kau for solar-mass binaries. At Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-10.3}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, we find $\gamma_g=1.26^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.072\pm0.027$). For all binaries with $g_{\rm N}\lesssim10^{-10}$ m\,$s^{-2}$ from our sample, we find $\gamma_g=1.32^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.085\pm0.027$). These results are consistent with the generic prediction of MOND-type modified gravity, although the current data are not sufficient to pin down the low-acceleration limiting behavior. Finally, we emphasize that the observed deviation from Newtonian gravity cannot be explained by the perspective effects or any separation-dependent eccentricity variation which we take into account.</description>

      <title>Decay and lifetime of oscillons coupled to an external scalar field: Insights from instability band analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillons are long-lived, spherically symmetric solitons that can arise in real scalar field theories with potentials shallower than quadratic ones. They are considered to form via parametric resonance during the preheating stage after inflation and have extended lifetimes. However, the estimation of their lifespan becomes complicated when taking into account the interactions between the inflaton field and other fields, as naturally expected in realistic reheating scenarios. In this study, we investigate how the lifetime of a single oscillon is affected by the coupling to the external real scalar field. By numerically computing the instability bands of the external field with the inhomogeneous oscillon profile as background, we show that the resonance behavior depends intricately on the coupling strength and shape of the oscillon. We analyze distinct instability mechanisms that dominate across different regimes of the coupling strength and oscillon shapes. Especially, we show that the parametric resonance fails to occur when the oscillon size is too limited to drive enhancement of the external field. Furthermore, our simulations show that as the oscillon loses energy, the exponential growth of the external field can terminate before the oscillon reaches its critical energy for collapse, which indicates that the external field does not necessarily lead to rapid destruction of oscillons even in the presence of strong coupling or with large amplitudes. These results suggest that oscillons can remain long-lived across a wide range of coupling strengths, with potential implications for their role in cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>Clustering of Primordial Black Holes from QCD Axion Bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13023v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the clustering of primordial black holes (PBHs) and axion miniclusters produced in the model proposed to explain the LIGO/Virgo events or the seeds of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in arXiv:2006.13137. It is found that this model predicts large isocurvature perturbations due to the clustering of PBHs and axion miniclusters, from which we obtain stringent constraints on the model parameters. Specifically, for the axion decay constant $f_a=10^{16}~\mathrm{GeV}$, which potentially accounts for the seeds of the SMBHs, the PBH fraction in dark matter should be $f_\mathrm{PBH}\lesssim7\times 10^{-10}$. Assuming that the mass of PBHs increases by more than a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ due to accretion, this is consistent with the observed abundance of SMBHs. On the other hand, for $f_a=10^{17}~\mathrm{GeV}$ required to produce PBHs of masses detected in the LIGO/Virgo, the PBH fraction should be $f_\mathrm{PBH}\lesssim6\times 10^{-8}$, which may be too small to explain the LIGO/Virgo events, although there is a significant uncertainty in calculating the merger rate in the presence of clustering.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Systematic Effects Using the Inferred Initial Power Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next generation of galaxy surveys has the potential to substantially deepen our understanding of the Universe. This potential hinges on our ability to rigorously address systematic uncertainties. Until now, diagnosing systematic effects prior to inferring cosmological parameters has been out of reach in field-based implicit likelihood cosmological inference frameworks. As a solution, we aim to diagnose a variety of systematic effects in galaxy surveys prior to inferring cosmological parameters, using the inferred initial matter power spectrum. Our approach is built upon a two-step framework. First, we employed the SELFI algorithm to infer the initial matter power spectrum, which we utilised to thoroughly investigate the impact of systematic effects. This investigation relies on a single set of $N$-body simulations. Second, we obtained a posterior on cosmological parameters via implicit likelihood inference, recycling the simulations from the first step for data compression. For demonstration, we relied on a model of large-scale spectroscopic galaxy surveys that incorporates fully non-linear gravitational evolution with COLA and simulates multiple systematic effects encountered in real surveys. We provide a practical guide on how the SELFI posterior can be used to assess the impact of misspecified galaxy bias parameters, selection functions, survey masks, inaccurate redshifts, and approximate gravity models on the inferred initial matter power spectrum. We show that a subtly misspecified model can lead to a bias exceeding $2\sigma$ in the $(\Omega_\mathrm{m}, \sigma_8)$ plane, which we are able to detect and avoid prior to inferring the cosmological parameters. This framework has the potential to significantly enhance the robustness of physical information extraction from full forward models of large-scale galaxy surveys such as DESI, Euclid, and LSST.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Soliton-Halo Relation in Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soliton cores at the center of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos provide a promising way to distinguish FDM from other dark matter models. However, the relation between solitons and their host halos remains contentious. Here, we rigorously examine this soliton-halo relation (SHR) using a rich set of cosmological simulations across various FDM particle masses, halo masses, and redshifts. We explicitly demonstrate thermal equilibrium between solitons and surrounding halo granules, energy equipartition within halos, and an FDM concentration-mass-nonisothermality relation. For each FDM halo, we confirm that its density profile outside the central soliton matches a collisionless N-body simulation from the same initial condition, serving as stringent numerical convergence tests. Our refined SHR agrees well with virialized halos in simulations, with a $1\sigma$ deviation of less than $30\%$. These findings not only reaffirm the SHR proposed by Schive et al. (2014) but also offer a more comprehensive understanding that extends its applicability. The simulation code GAMER is accessible at https://github.com/gamer-project/gamer. A Python script for computing the theoretical SHR is available at https://github.com/calab-ntu/fdm-soliton-halo-relation.</description>

      <title>The DESI DR1/DR2 evidence for dynamical dark energy is biased by low-redshift supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04212v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a $3\sim4\sigma$ preference for dynamical dark energy has been reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, which has inspired hot debates on new physics or systematics. In this paper, we reveal that this preference is significantly biased by an external low-redshift supernova (low-$z$ SN) sample, which was combined with the Dark Energy Survey SN program (DES-SN) in their Year-Five data release (DESY5). Using the intercept in the SN magnitude-distance relation as a diagnostic for systematics, we find not only large dispersions but also a large discrepancy in the low-$z$ SN sample when compared to the high-$z$ DES-SN sample within the single DESY5 compilation, in contrast to the uniform behavior found in the PantheonPlus data. Correcting for this low-$z$ systematics with or without including the cosmic microwave background data can largely reduce the preference for dynamical DE to be less than $2\sigma$. Therefore, the DESI preference for dynamical DE is biased by some unknown systematics in the low-$z$ SN sample.</description>

      <title>Extending evolution mapping to massive neutrinos with COMET</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the evolution mapping framework to cosmological models that include massive neutrinos. The original evolution mapping framework exploits a degeneracy in the linear matter power spectrum when expressed in ${\rm Mpc}$ units, which compresses its dependence on cosmological parameters into those that affect its shape and a single extra parameter $\sigma_{12}$, defined as the RMS linear variance in spheres of radius $12 {\rm Mpc}$. We show that by promoting the scalar amplitude of fluctuations, $A_{\rm s}$, to a shape parameter, we can additionally describe the suppression due to massive neutrinos at any redshift to sub-0.01\% accuracy across a wide range of masses and for different numbers of mass eigenstates. This methodology has been integrated into the public COMET package, enhancing its ability to emulate predictions of state-of-the-art perturbative models for galaxy clustering, such as the effective field theory (EFT) model. Additionally, the updated software now accommodates a broader cosmological parameter space for the emulator, enables the simultaneous generation of multiple predictions to reduce computation time, and incorporates analytic marginalisation over nuisance parameters to expedite posterior estimation. Finally, we explore the impact of different infrared resummation techniques on galaxy power spectrum multipoles, demonstrating that any discrepancies can be mitigated by EFT counterterms without impacting the cosmological parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-delay distance measurements from strongly lensed quasars provide a robust, independent method for determining the Hubble constant ($H_0$). This approach cross-checks $H_0$ estimates from the distance ladder in the late universe and the cosmic microwave background in the early universe. However, the mass-sheet degeneracy in lensing models introduces systematic uncertainty, limiting precision. Dynamical modeling complements strong lensing by constraining the mass distribution with independent observational data. We develop a methodology and software framework for joint modeling of stellar kinematics and lensing data. Using simulated data for the lensed quasar RXJ1131$-$1131, we demonstrate that high-quality kinematic data can achieve $\sim$4% precision on $H_0$. Through extensive modeling, we examine the impact of the presence of a supermassive black hole in the lens galaxy and potential systematic biases in kinematic data on $H_0$ measurements. Our results show that imposing priors on black hole mass and orbital anisotropy, or excluding central kinematic bins, mitigates biases in $H_0$ estimates. By testing on mock kinematic data with systematic biases, we highlight the need for sub-percent control of kinematic systematics, which is achievable with current technology. Additionally, we leverage GPU parallelization to accelerate Bayesian inference, reducing a previously month-long process by an order of magnitude. This pipeline offers significant potential for advancing cosmological and galaxy evolution studies with large datasets.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum of Gravitational Waves from Annihilating Domain Walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks of cosmic domain walls can form in the early Universe as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries. We study the production of a cosmological background of gravitational waves (GWs) from such networks, when they annihilate due to a small explicit symmetry breaking term. Averaging over several 3+1-dimensional high-resolution lattice field simulations, we obtain a GW spectrum with the following characteristics: (1) a broad asymmetric peak, roughly located at frequency (at the time of emission) $f\sim 2 H_{\rm gw}$, where $H_{\rm gw}$ is the Hubble rate at the end of GW production, shortly after annihilation, (2) a doubly broken power law spectrum $\propto k^{-n}$, with initial slope $n \sim 0.5$ after the main peak and $n \sim 1.8$ at high $f$, while the low frequency region $f&lt;f_p$ agrees with the causality behavior $\sim k^3$. Additionally, extending previous results, we find that GW production continues to be efficient until a value of the Hubble scale $H_{\text gw}$ that is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the naive estimate $\sigma H = \Delta V$, where $\sigma$ is the wall tension and $\Delta V$ the size of the symmetry breaking term, thereby leading to a $O(100)$ larger GW signal. We find such results to be robust when changing the shape of the scalar field potential or including a time-dependent symmetry breaking term. Our findings have important implications for GW searches, especially in light of the reported evidence for a stochastic GW background in Pulsar Timing Array data.</description>

Abstract: We study the reheating phase following inflation in the context of single-field models, focusing on the perturbative decay of the inflaton into lighter particles. A general analytical framework is presented to compute the reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and related quantities by combining cosmological observations with model-dependent parameters. We derive expressions for $T_{re}$ for three types of interactions: gravitational, scalar, and Yukawa-type fermionic couplings, and apply these results to the class of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, which exhibit attractor behavior in the $(n_s, r)$ plane. The main goal of this work is to investigate how key cosmological quantities such as $T_{re}$, $N_{re}$, and $m_\phi$ among others, evolve with the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the Yukawa coupling constant $y$, within a consistent analytical framework. Although the formulas used are approximate, they are sufficient to capture the qualitative behavior of the relevant quantities across a wide range of parameter values. Here, we are not interested in precise numerical approximations or data analysis, but rather in understanding the general trends and dependence of cosmological quantities of interest. In particular, tendencies observed in the figures, such as the sensitivity of $T_{re}$ to the coupling strength and the equation-of-state parameter $\omega_{re}$, reflect physical features that are not strongly affected by the approximations involved.</description>

      <title>CSST Cosmological Emulator III: Hybrid Lagrangian Bias Expansion Emulation of Galaxy Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy clustering is an important probe in the upcoming China Space Station Telescope (CSST) survey to understand the structure growth and reveal the nature of the dark sector. However, it is a long-term challenge to model this biased tracer and connect the observable to the underlying physics. In this work, we present a hybrid Lagrangian bias expansion emulator, combining the Lagrangian bias expansion and the accurate dynamical evolution from $N$-body simulation, to predict the power spectrum of the biased tracer in real space. We employ the Kun simulation suite to construct the emulator, emulating across the space of 8 cosmological parameters including dynamic dark energy $w_0$, $w_a$, and total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. The sample variance due to the finite simulation box is further reduced using the Zel'dovich variance control, and it enables the precise measurement of the Lagrangian basis spectra up to the quadratic order. The emulation of basis spectra realizes 1% level accuracy, covering wavelength $ k \leq 1 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}h$ and redshift $0\leq z\leq 3$ up to the quadratic order field. To validate the emulator, we perform a joint fit to the halo auto power spectrum and the halo-matter cross power spectrum measured from 46 independent simulations. Depending on the choice of counterterm, the joint fit is unbiased up to $k_{\rm max}\simeq 0.7\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}h$ within $1\sim 2$ percent accuracy, for all the redshift and halo mass samples. As part of the CSST cosmological emulator series, this emulator is expected to provide accurate theoretical predictions for the galaxy power spectrum in upcoming CSST survey.</description>

      <title>Quantum stress-energy at timelike boundaries: testing a new beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameter with cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the basic cosmological effects of a population of timelike boundaries -- a form of nontrivial spacetime topology -- containing a boundary layer of quantum stress energy. This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an additional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter and dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed comoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the Friedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for scale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times ($a\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such as big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination. For a wide window of parameters, the boundaries can be larger than the Planck length throughout their history, back through the start of inflation at any viable scale. We analyze CMB and BAO data sets (Planck, ACT, and DESI) allowing for this component, finding a slight preference ($\sim 2\sigma$) and a relaxation of current tensions in the data (including the neutrino mass) in a physical manner. This novel parameter fits into a larger space of physical parameters beyond-$\Lambda$CDM that may serve this role, including negative spatial curvature, which may also be motivated by topological considerations and chaotic dynamics. Finally, we comment on additional phenomenological prospects for testing for this form of topology in the universe.</description>

      <title>Ray-tracing Fast Radio Bursts Through IllustrisTNG: Cosmological Dispersion Measures from Redshift 0 to 5.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dispersion measures (DMs) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) arise predominantly from free electrons in the large-scale structure of the Universe. The increasing number of FRB observations have started to empirically constrain the distribution of cosmic baryons, making it crucial to accurately forward model their propagation within cosmological simulations. In this work, we present a method for measuring FRB DMs in IllustrisTNG that continuously traces rays through the simulation while reconstructing all traversed line segments within the underlying Voronoi mesh. Leveraging this technique, we create over $20$ publicly available DM catalogs, including a full-sky DM map observed from a Milky Way-like environment. Our method addresses a problem in previous TNG-based studies, in which a sparse snapshot sampling in the path integral leads to a misestimation of the standard deviation and higher moments of the DM distribution $p(\rm{DM}|z)$ by over $50\%$. We show that our results are consistent with the most recent observational data from the DSA-110, ASKAP, and CHIME. We offer a functional form for $p(\rm{DM}| z)$ that provides very good fits across all redshifts from $0$ to $5.5$, showing that the previously proposed log-normal distribution is not well matched to the data. We find that using simulation box sizes smaller than $35\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc or resolutions with baryonic masses of less than $5\times10^{8}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ can distort the derived DM signal by more than $8\%$. Our findings provide new insights into how the cosmic web shapes FRB signals, and highlight the importance of accurate methodology when comparing cosmological simulations against observations.</description>

      <title>Putting all the X in one basket: Updated X-ray constraints on sub-GeV Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sub-GeV dark matter particles can annihilate or decay producing e^\pm pairs which upscatter the low-energy photon fields in the Galaxy and generate an X-ray emission (via the Inverse Compton effect). Using X-ray data from XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, NuSTAR and Suzaku, we derive new constraints on this class of dark matter (DM). For annihilating DM, they are significant for m_DM &gt; 100 MeV, and dominant if DM is p-wave annihilating. For decaying DM, they are the most stringent to date in the range m_DM ~400 MeV - 3 GeV$.</description>

      <title>Probing radiative electroweak symmetry breaking with colliders and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative symmetry breaking provides an appealing explanation for electroweak symmetry breaking and addresses the hierarchy problem. We present a comprehensive phenomenological study of this scenario, focusing on its key feature: the logarithmic-shaped potential. This potential gives rise to a relatively light scalar boson that mixes with the Higgs boson and leads to first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in the early Universe. Our detailed analysis includes providing exact and analytical solutions for the vacuum structure and scalar interactions, classifying four patterns of cosmic thermal history, and calculating the supercooled FOPT dynamics and GWs. By combining future collider and gravitational wave experiments, we can probe the conformal symmetry breaking scales up to $10^5-10^8$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Radio Signals from Radio-Band Gravitational Waves Converted from the Neutron Star Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can convert into electromagnetic waves in the presence of a magnetic field via the Gertsenshtein-Zeldovich (GZ) effect. The characteristics of the magnetic field substantially affect this conversion probability. This paper confirms that strong magnetic fields in neutron stars significantly enhance the conversion probability, facilitating detectable radio signatures of very high-frequency (VHF, $\left(10^6-10^{11}\mathrm{~Hz}\right)$) gravitational waves. We theoretically identify two distinct signatures using single-dish telescopes (FAST, TMRT, QTT, GBT) and interferometers (SKA1/2-MID): transient signals from burst-like gravitational wave sources and persistent signals from cosmological background gravitational wave sources. These signatures are mapped to graviton spectral lines derived from quantum field theory by incorporating spin-2 and mass constraints, resulting in smooth, featureless profiles that are critical for distinguishing gravitational wave signals from astrophysical foregrounds. FAST attains a characteristic strain bound of $h_c&lt;10^{-23}$, approaching $10^{-24}$ in the frequency range of $1-3\mathrm{~GHz}$ with a 6-hour observation period. This performance exceeds the $5 \sigma$ detection thresholds for GWs originating from primordial black holes (PBHs) and nears the limits set by Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Additionally, projections for SKA2-MID indicate even greater sensitivity. Detecting such gravitational waves would improve our comprehension of cosmological models, refine the parameter spaces for primordial black holes, and function as a test for quantum field theory. This approach addresses significant deficiencies in VHF GW research, improving detection sensitivity and facilitating the advancement of next-generation radio telescopes such as FASTA and SKA, which feature larger fields of view and enhanced gain.</description>

      <title>Determination of galaxy photometric redshifts using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable photometric redshift determination is one of the key aspects for wide-field photometric surveys. Determination of photometric redshift for galaxies, has been traditionally solved by use of machine-learning and artificial intelligence techniques trained on a calibration sample of galaxies, where both photometry and spectrometry are available. On this paper, we present a new algorithmic approach for determining photometric redshifts of galaxies using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs). The proposed implementation is able to determine both point-estimation and probability-density estimations for photometric redshifts. The methodology is tested with data from Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y1 data and compared with other existing algorithm such as a Mixture Density Network (MDN). Although results obtained show a superiority of MDN, CGAN quality-metrics are close to the MDN results, opening the door to the use of CGAN at photometric redshift estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity is identical to curved spacetime. It is manifested by the curvature of a Riemannian spacetime in general relativity but by torsion or non-metricity in teleparallel gravity models. In this paper, we apply these multiple options to the spacetime perturbation theory and seek the possibilities of representing the gravitation of the background and that of the perturbation in separate ways. We show that the perturbation around a Riemannian background can be described by torsion or non-metricity, so that we have teleparallel like actions for the perturbation.</description>
