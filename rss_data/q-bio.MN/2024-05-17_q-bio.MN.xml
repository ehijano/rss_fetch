      <title>Biomarker Selection for Adaptive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomarker selection and real-time monitoring of cell dynamics remains an active challenge in cell biology and biomanufacturing. Here, we develop scalable adaptations of classic approaches to sensor selection for biomarker identification on several transcriptomics and biological datasets that are otherwise cannot be studied from a controls perspective. To address challenges in system identification of biological systems and provide robust biomarkers, we propose Dynamic and Structure Guided Sensors Selection (DSS and SGSS), methods by which temporal models and structural experimental data can be used to supplement traditional approaches to sensor selection. These approaches leverage temporal models and experimental data to enhance traditional sensor selection techniques. Unlike conventional methods that assume well-known, fixed dynamics, DSS and SGSS adaptively select sensors that maximize observability while accounting for the time-varying nature of biological systems. Additionally, they incorporate structural information to identify robust sensors even in cases where system dynamics are poorly understood. We validate these two approaches by performing estimation on several high dimensional systems derived from temporal gene expression data from partial observations.</description>

      <title>Mapping Differential Protein-Protein Interaction Networks using Affinity Purification Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins congregate into complexes to perform fundamental cellular functions. Phenotypic outcomes, in health and disease, are often mechanistically driven by the remodeling of protein complexes by protein coding mutations or cellular signaling changes in response to molecular cues. Here, we present an affinity purification mass spectrometry (APMS) proteomics protocol to quantify and visualize global changes in protein protein interaction (PPI) networks between pairwise conditions. We describe steps for expressing affinity tagged bait proteins in mammalian cells, identifying purified protein complexes, quantifying differential PPIs, and visualizing differential PPI networks. Specifically, this protocol details steps for designing affinity tagged bait gene constructs, transfection, affinity purification, mass spectrometry sample preparation, data acquisition, database search, data quality control, PPI confidence scoring, cross run normalization, statistical data analysis, and differential PPI visualization. Our protocol discusses caveats and limitations with applicability across cell types and biological areas.</description>
