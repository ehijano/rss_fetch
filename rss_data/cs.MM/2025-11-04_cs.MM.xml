      <title>LongCat-Flash-Omni Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash-Omni, a state-of-the-art open-source omni-modal model with 560 billion parameters, excelling at real-time audio-visual interaction. By adopting a curriculum-inspired progressive training strategy that transitions from simpler to increasingly complex modality sequence modeling tasks, LongCat-Flash-Omni attains comprehensive multimodal capabilities while maintaining strong unimodal capability. Building upon LongCat-Flash, which adopts a high-performance Shortcut-connected Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with zero-computation experts, LongCat-Flash-Omni integrates efficient multimodal perception and speech reconstruction modules. Despite its immense size of 560B parameters (with 27B activated), LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves low-latency real-time audio-visual interaction. For training infrastructure, we developed a modality-decoupled parallelism scheme specifically designed to manage the data and model heterogeneity inherent in large-scale multimodal training. This innovative approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency by sustaining over 90% of the throughput achieved by text-only training. Extensive evaluations show that LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on omni-modal benchmarks among open-source models. Furthermore, it delivers highly competitive results across a wide range of modality-specific tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as audio understanding and generation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the model architecture design, training procedures, and data strategies, and open-source the model to foster future research and development in the community.</description>

      <title>Predicting Encoding Energy from Low-Pass Anchors for Green Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video streaming now represents the dominant share of Internet traffic, as ever-higher-resolution content is distributed across a growing range of heterogeneous devices to sustain user Quality of Experience (QoE). However, this trend raises significant concerns about energy efficiency and carbon emissions, requiring methods to provide a trade-off between energy and QoE. This paper proposes a lightweight energy prediction method that estimates the energy consumption of high-resolution video encodings using reference encodings generated at lower resolutions (so-called anchors), eliminating the need for exhaustive per-segment energy measurements, a process that is infeasible at scale. We automatically select encoding parameters, such as resolution and quantization parameter (QP), to achieve substantial energy savings while maintaining perceptual quality, as measured by the Video Multimethod Fusion Assessment (VMAF), within acceptable limits. We implement and evaluate our approach with the open-source VVenC encoder on 100 video sequences from the Inter4K dataset across multiple encoding settings. Results show that, for an average VMAF score reduction of only 1.68, which stays below the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) threshold, our method achieves 51.22% encoding energy savings and 53.54% decoding energy savings compared to a scenario with no quality degradation.</description>

      <title>Rhythm in the Air: Vision-based Real-Time Music Generation through Gestures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gesture recognition is an essential component of human-computer interaction (HCI), facilitating seamless interconnectivity between users and computer systems without physical touch. This paper introduces an innovative application of vision-based dynamic gesture recognition (VDGR) for real-time music composition through gestures. To implement this application, we generate a custom gesture dataset that encompasses over 15000 samples across 21 classes, incorporating 7 musical notes each manifesting at three distinct pitch levels. To effectively deal with the modest volume of training data and to accurately discern and prioritize complex gesture sequences for music creation, we develop a multi-layer attention-based gated recurrent unit (MLA-GRU) model, in which gated recurrent unit (GRU) is used to learn temporal patterns from the observed sequence and an attention layer is employed to focus on musically pertinent gesture segments. Our empirical studies demonstrate that MLA-GRU significantly surpasses the classical GRU model, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 96.83% compared to the baseline's 86.7%. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior efficiency and processing speed, which are crucial for interactive applications. Using our proposed system, we believe that people will interact with music in a new and exciting way. It not only advances HCI experiences but also highlights MLA-GRU's effectiveness in scenarios demanding swift and precise gesture recognition.</description>

      <title>EV-NVC: Efficient Variable bitrate Neural Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training neural video codec (NVC) with variable rate is a highly challenging task due to its complex training strategies and model structure. In this paper, we train an efficient variable bitrate neural video codec (EV-NVC) with the piecewise linear sampler (PLS) to improve the rate-distortion performance in high bitrate range, and the long-short-term feature fusion module (LSTFFM) to enhance the context modeling. Besides, we introduce mixed-precision training and discuss the different training strategies for each stage in detail to fully evaluate its effectiveness. Experimental results show that our approach reduces the BD-rate by 30.56% compared to HM-16.25 within low-delay mode.</description>

      <title>Med-Banana-50K: A Cross-modality Large-Scale Dataset for Text-guided Medical Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled remarkable medical image editing capabilities. However, the research community's progress remains constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets built specifically for medical image editing with strict anatomical and clinical constraints. We introduce Med-Banana-50K, a comprehensive 50K-image dataset for instruction-based medical image editing spanning three modalities (chest X-ray, brain MRI, fundus photography) and 23 disease types. Our dataset is constructed by leveraging Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image to generate bidirectional edits (lesion addition and removal) from real medical images. What distinguishes Med-Banana-50K from general-domain editing datasets is our systematic approach to medical quality control: we employ LLM-as-Judge with a medically grounded rubric (instruction compliance, structural plausibility, realism, and fidelity preservation) and history-aware iterative refinement up to five rounds. Beyond single-turn editing, Med-Banana-50K includes 37K failed attempts with full conversation logs for preference learning and alignment research. By providing this large-scale, medically validated, and fully documented resource, Med-Banana-50K establishes a foundation for training and evaluating the next generation of medical image editing models.Our dataset and code are publicly available at [https://github.com/richardChenzhihui/med-banana-50k].</description>

      <title>SEPS: Semantic-enhanced Patch Slimming Framework for fine-grained cross-modal alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained cross-modal alignment aims to establish precise local correspondences between vision and language, forming a cornerstone for visual question answering and related multimodal applications. Current approaches face challenges in addressing patch redundancy and ambiguity, which arise from the inherent information density disparities across modalities. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as promising solutions to bridge this gap through their robust semantic generation capabilities. However, the dense textual outputs from MLLMs may introduce conflicts with the original sparse captions. Furthermore, accurately quantifying semantic relevance between rich visual patches and concise textual descriptions remains a core challenge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Semantic-Enhanced Patch Slimming (SEPS) framework, which systematically addresses patch redundancy and ambiguity. Our approach employs a two-stage mechanism to integrate unified semantics from both dense and sparse texts, enabling the identification of salient visual patches. Additionally, it leverages relevance-aware selection with mean value computation to highlight crucial patch-word correspondences, thereby improving cross-modal similarity assessment. Comprehensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets validate that SEPS achieves superior performance, surpassing existing approaches by 23\%-86\% in rSum across diverse model architectures, with notable enhancements in text-to-image retrieval scenarios. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Sweet4tars/seps.git.</description>

      <title>How Far Are Surgeons from Surgical World Models? A Pilot Study on Zero-shot Surgical Video Generation with Expert Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models in video generation are demonstrating remarkable capabilities as potential world models for simulating the physical world. However, their application in high-stakes domains like surgery, which demand deep, specialized causal knowledge rather than general physical rules, remains a critical unexplored gap. To systematically address this challenge, we present SurgVeo, the first expert-curated benchmark for video generation model evaluation in surgery, and the Surgical Plausibility Pyramid (SPP), a novel, four-tiered framework tailored to assess model outputs from basic appearance to complex surgical strategy. On the basis of the SurgVeo benchmark, we task the advanced Veo-3 model with a zero-shot prediction task on surgical clips from laparoscopic and neurosurgical procedures. A panel of four board-certified surgeons evaluates the generated videos according to the SPP. Our results reveal a distinct "plausibility gap": while Veo-3 achieves exceptional Visual Perceptual Plausibility, it fails critically at higher levels of the SPP, including Instrument Operation Plausibility, Environment Feedback Plausibility, and Surgical Intent Plausibility. This work provides the first quantitative evidence of the chasm between visually convincing mimicry and causal understanding in surgical AI. Our findings from SurgVeo and the SPP establish a crucial foundation and roadmap for developing future models capable of navigating the complexities of specialized, real-world healthcare domains.</description>

      <title>Prevailing Research Areas for Music AI in the Era of Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel to rapid advancements in foundation model research, the past few years have witnessed a surge in music AI applications. As AI-generated and AI-augmented music become increasingly mainstream, many researchers in the music AI community may wonder: what research frontiers remain unexplored? This paper outlines several key areas within music AI research that present significant opportunities for further investigation. We begin by examining foundational representation models and highlight emerging efforts toward explainability and interpretability. We then discuss the evolution toward multimodal systems, provide an overview of the current landscape of music datasets and their limitations, and address the growing importance of model efficiency in both training and deployment. Next, we explore applied directions, focusing first on generative models. We review recent systems, their computational constraints, and persistent challenges related to evaluation and controllability. We then examine extensions of these generative approaches to multimodal settings and their integration into artists' workflows, including applications in music editing, captioning, production, transcription, source separation, performance, discovery, and education. Finally, we explore copyright implications of generative music and propose strategies to safeguard artist rights. While not exhaustive, this survey aims to illuminate promising research directions enabled by recent developments in music foundation models.</description>

      <title>A Low-Resolution Image is Worth 1x1 Words: Enabling Fine Image Super-Resolution with Transformers and TaylorShift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have recently advanced the image reconstruction quality of super-resolution (SR) models. Yet, their scalability remains limited by quadratic attention costs and coarse patch embeddings that weaken pixel-level fidelity. We propose TaylorIR, a plug-and-play framework that enforces 1x1 patch embeddings for true pixel-wise reasoning and replaces conventional self-attention with TaylorShift, a Taylor-series-based attention mechanism enabling full token interactions with near-linear complexity. Across multiple SR benchmarks, TaylorIR delivers state-of-the-art performance while reducing memory consumption by up to 60%, effectively bridging the gap between fine-grained detail restoration and efficient transformer scaling.</description>

      <title>EgoBlind: Towards Egocentric Visual Assistance for the Blind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08221v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present EgoBlind, the first egocentric VideoQA dataset collected from blind individuals to evaluate the assistive capabilities of contemporary multimodal large language models (MLLMs). EgoBlind comprises 1,392 first-person videos from the daily lives of blind and visually impaired individuals. It also features 5,311 questions directly posed or verified by the blind to reflect their in-situation needs for visual assistance. Each question has an average of 3 manually annotated reference answers to reduce subjectiveness. Using EgoBlind, we comprehensively evaluate 16 advanced MLLMs and find that all models struggle. The best performers achieve an accuracy near 60\%, which is far behind human performance of 87.4\%. To guide future advancements, we identify and summarize major limitations of existing MLLMs in egocentric visual assistance for the blind and explore heuristic solutions for improvement. With these efforts, we hope that EgoBlind will serve as a foundation for developing effective AI assistants to enhance the independence of the blind and visually impaired. Data and code are available at https://github.com/doc-doc/EgoBlind.</description>

      <title>SmartFreeEdit: Mask-Free Spatial-Aware Image Editing with Complex Instruction Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image editing have utilized large-scale multimodal models to enable intuitive, natural instruction-driven interactions. However, conventional methods still face significant challenges, particularly in spatial reasoning, precise region segmentation, and maintaining semantic consistency, especially in complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SmartFreeEdit, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a hypergraph-enhanced inpainting architecture, enabling precise, mask-free image editing guided exclusively by natural language instructions. The key innovations of SmartFreeEdit include:(1)the introduction of region aware tokens and a mask embedding paradigm that enhance the spatial understanding of complex scenes;(2) a reasoning segmentation pipeline designed to optimize the generation of editing masks based on natural language instructions;and (3) a hypergraph-augmented inpainting module that ensures the preservation of both structural integrity and semantic coherence during complex edits, overcoming the limitations of local-based image generation. Extensive experiments on the Reason-Edit benchmark demonstrate that SmartFreeEdit surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including segmentation accuracy, instruction adherence, and visual quality preservation, while addressing the issue of local information focus and improving global consistency in the edited image. Our project will be available at https://github.com/smileformylove/SmartFreeEdit.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Evaluation of STEM Education: Leveraging MLLMs in Project-Based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Project-Based Learning (PBL) involves a variety of highly correlated multimodal data, making it a vital educational approach within STEM disciplines. With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have begun exploring their potential to enhance tasks such as information retrieval, knowledge comprehension, and data generation in educational settings. However, existing benchmarks fall short in providing both a free-form output structure and a rigorous human expert validation process, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating real-world educational tasks. Additionally, few methods have developed automated pipelines to assist with the complex responsibilities of teachers leveraging MLLMs, largely due to model hallucination and instability, which lead to unreliable implementation. To address this gap, we introduce PBLBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate complex reasoning grounded in domain-specific knowledge and long-context understanding, thereby challenging models with tasks that closely resemble those handled by human experts. To establish reliable ground truth, we adopt the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), utilizing expert-driven pairwise comparisons to derive structured and weighted evaluation criteria. We assess the performance of 15 leading MLLMs/LLMs using PBLBench and demonstrate that even the most advanced models achieve only 59% rank accuracy, underscoring the significant challenges presented by this benchmark. We believe PBLBench will serve as a catalyst for the development of more capable AI agents, ultimately aiming to alleviate teacher workload and enhance educational productivity.</description>

To address this challenge, multimodal data synthesis offers a promising solution. Yet, ensuring that synthesized data adhere to spatial common sense is a non-trivial task. Our approach addresses this critical gap by providing a systematic framework for generating spatially coherent data. In this work, we introduce SKG2DATA, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial knowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation. SKG2DATA employs an automated pipeline for constructing Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) that effectively captures human-like spatial cognition, including directional and distance relationships. These structured representations then serve as precise guidance for our integrated synthesis pipeline, where a diffusion model generates spatially-consistent images while a MLLM produces corresponding textual descriptions. The automated construction of SKG enables scalable generation of diverse yet realistic spatial configurations, overcoming the limitations of manual data collection and annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge, including direction and distance, enhance the spatial perception and reasoning abilities of MLLMs markedly, albeit with a slight cost to their general capabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can advance the development of spatial intelligence. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/Knowledge2Data.</description>

      <title>Class Agnostic Instance-level Descriptor for Visual Instance Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16745</link>

Abstract: Despite the great success of the deep features in content-based image retrieval, the visual instance search remains challenging due to the lack of effective instance-level feature representation. Supervised or weakly supervised object detection methods are not the appropriate solutions due to their poor performance on the unknown object categories. In this paper, based on the feature set output from self-supervised ViT, the instance-level region discovery is modeled as detecting the compact feature subsets in a hierarchical fashion. The hierarchical decomposition results in a hierarchy of instance regions. On the one hand, this kind of hierarchical decomposition well addresses the problem of object embedding and occlusions, which are widely observed in real scenarios. On the other hand, the non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes on the hierarchy correspond to the instance regions in different granularities within an image. Therefore, features in uniform length are produced for these instance regions, which may cover across a dominant image region, an integral of multiple instances, or various individual instances. Such a collection of features allows us to unify the image retrieval, multi-instance search, and instance search into one framework. The empirical studies on three benchmarks show that such an instance-level descriptor remains effective on both the known and unknown object categories. Moreover, the superior performance is achieved on single-instance and multi-instance search, as well as image retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>Music Arena: Live Evaluation for Text-to-Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Music Arena, an open platform for scalable human preference evaluation of text-to-music (TTM) models. Soliciting human preferences via listening studies is the gold standard for evaluation in TTM, but these studies are expensive to conduct and difficult to compare, as study protocols may differ across systems. Moreover, human preferences might help researchers align their TTM systems or improve automatic evaluation metrics, but an open and renewable source of preferences does not currently exist. We aim to fill these gaps by offering *live* evaluation for TTM. In Music Arena, real-world users input text prompts of their choosing and compare outputs from two TTM systems, and their preferences are used to compile a leaderboard. While Music Arena follows recent evaluation trends in other AI domains, we also design it with key features tailored to music: an LLM-based routing system to navigate the heterogeneous type signatures of TTM systems, and the collection of *detailed* preferences including listening data and natural language feedback. We also propose a rolling data release policy with user privacy guarantees, providing a renewable source of preference data and increasing platform transparency. Through its standardized evaluation protocol, transparent data access policies, and music-specific features, Music Arena not only addresses key challenges in the TTM ecosystem but also demonstrates how live evaluation can be thoughtfully adapted to unique characteristics of specific AI domains.

      <title>Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS) instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data, thus limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models (VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial to MVS while squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion (SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our framework achieves state-of-the-art~(SOTA) in rate-task performance, with significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.4%), video object segmentation (29.8%), object detection (46.2%), and multiple object tracking (44.9%). We will release our code soon.</description>

      <title>Sound Clouds: Exploring ambient intelligence in public spaces to elicit deep human experience of awe, wonder, and beauty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the ambient intelligence (AmI) systems we encounter in our daily lives, including security monitoring and energy-saving systems, typically serve pragmatic purposes, we wonder how we can design and implement ambient artificial intelligence experiences in public spaces that elicit deep human feelings of awe, wonder, and beauty. As a manifestation, we introduce Sound Clouds, an immersive art installation that generates live music based on participants' interaction with several human-height spheres. Our installation serves as a provocation into future ambient intelligence that provokes, not limits, the future possibilities of AmI.</description>
