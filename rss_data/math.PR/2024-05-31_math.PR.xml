      <title>Decoupling and Multipoint moments for the Inverse of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the decoupling structure and multipoint moment of the inverse of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos. It is also the second part of preliminary work for extending the work in "Random conformal weldings" (by K. Astala, P. Jones, A. Kupiainen, E. Saksman) to the existence of Lehto welding for the inverse. In particular, we prove that the dilatation of the inverse homeomorphism on the positive real line is in $L^{1}([0,1]\times[0,2])$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative hydrodynamics for a generalized contact model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a quantitative version of the hydrodynamic limit for an interacting particle system inspired by integrate-and-fire neuron models. More precisely, we show that the $L^2$-speed of convergence of the empirical density of states in a generalized contact process defined over a $d$-dimensional torus of size $n$ is of the optimal order $\mathcal O(n^{d/2})$. In addition, we show that the typical fluctuations around the aforementioned hydrodynamic limit are Gaussian, and governed by a inhomogeneous stochastic linear equation.</description>

      <title>Malliavian differentiablity and smoothness of density for SDES with locally Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Malliavin differentiability for the solutions of a stochastic differential equation with drift of super-linear growth. Assuming we have a monotone drift with polynomial growth, we prove Malliavin differentiability of any order. As a consequence of this result, under the H\"ormander's hypothesis we prove that the density of the solution's law with respect to the Lebesgue measure is infinitely differentiable. To avoid non-integrability problems due to the unbounded drift, we follow an approach based on the concepts of Ray Absolute Continuity and Stochastic Gate\^aux Differentiability.</description>

      <title>The pivotal set of a Boolean function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the pivotal set of a Boolean function and we prove a fundamental inequality on its expected size, when the inputs are independent random coins of parameter~$p$. We give two complete proofs of this inequality. Along the way, we obtain the classical Margulis--Russo formula. We give a short proof of the classical Hoeffding inequality for i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables, and we use it to derive more complex deviations inequalities associated to the pivotal set. We follow finally Talagrand's footsteps and we discuss a beautiful inequality that he proved in the uniform case.</description>

      <title>Upper deviation probabilities for the range of a supercritical super-Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{X_t\}_{t\geq 0 }$ be a $d$-dimensional supercritical super-Brownian motion started from the origin with branching mechanism $\psi$. Denote by $R_t:=\inf\{r&gt;0:X_s(\{x\in \mathbb{R}^d:|x|\geq r\})=0,~\forall~0\leq s\leq t\}$ the radius of the minimal ball (centered at the origin) containing the range of $\{X_s\}_{s\geq 0 }$ up to time $t$. In \cite{Pinsky}, Pinsky proved that condition on non-extinction, $\lim_{t\to\infty}R_t/t=\sqrt{2\beta}$ in probability, where $\beta:=-\psi'(0)$. Afterwards, Engl\"{a}nder \cite{Englander04} studied the lower deviation probabilities of $R_t$. For the upper deviation probabilities, he \cite[Conjecture 8]{Englander04} conjectured that for $\rho&gt;\sqrt {2\beta}$,
  $$ \lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{1}{t}\log\mathbb{P}(R_t\geq \rho t)=-\left(\frac{\rho^2}{2}-\beta\right). $$ In this note, we confirmed this conjecture.</description>

      <title>From classical to modern central limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: De Moivre (1733), investigating the limit distribution of the binomial distribution, was the first to discover the existence of the normal distribution and the central limit theorem. In this review article, we briefly recall the history of classical central limit theorem and martingale central limit theorem, and introduce a new direction of central limit theorem, namely nonlinear central limit theorem and nonlinear normal distribution.</description>

      <title>(Non)-hyperuniformity of perturbed lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We ask whether a stationary lattice in dimension $d$ whose points are shifted by identically distributed but possibly dependent perturbations remains hyperuniform. When $d = 1$ or $2$, we show that it is the case when the perturbations have a finite $d$-moment, and that this condition is sharp. When $d \geq 3$, we construct arbitrarily small perturbations such that the resulting point process is not hyperuniform. As a side remark of independent interest, we exhibit hyperuniform processes with arbitrarily slow decay of their number variance.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we use a covariance function that arises from limit of fluctuations of the rescaled occupation time process of a branching particle system, to introduce a family of weighted long-range dependence Gaussian processes. In particular, we consider two subfamilies for which we show that the process is not a semimartingale, that the processes exhibit long-range dependence and have long-range memory of logarithmic order. Finally, we illustrate that this family of processes is useful for modeling real world data.</description>

Abstract: In this work we firstly answer to a question raised by Khoshnevisan in \cite[Open Problem 4]{khoshnevisan2007slices} by proving that almost surely there is no projection of big enough rank changing the Hausdorff dimension of the zeros of the Brownian sheet. Secondly, we prove that almost surely for every projection whose rank isn't matching the aforementioned condition, the projection of the zero set is the entirety of the projective space.\\ \textbf{Key words:} Brownian sheet, zeros set, Hausdorff dimension, orthogonal projection.</description>

      <title>Characterization of probability distributions on some locally compact Abelian groups containing an element of order 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known Heyde theorem characterizes the Gaussian distributions on the real line by the symmetry of the conditional distribution of one linear form of independent random variables given another. We generalize this theorem to groups of the form $\mathbb{R}\times F$, where $F$ is a finite Abelian group such that its 2-component is isomorphic to the additive group of the integers modulo $2$. In so doing, coefficients of the linear forms are arbitrary topological automorphisms of the group. Previously, a similar result was proved in the case when the group $F$ contains no elements of order 2. The presence of an element of order 2 in $F$ leads to the fact that a new class of probability distributions is characterized</description>

      <title>SLE and its partition function in multiply connected domains via the Gaussian Free Field and restriction measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One way to uniquely define Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) in multiply connected domains is to use the restriction property. This gives an implicit definition of a $\sigma$-finite measure on curves; yet it is in general not clear how to construct such measures nor whether the mass of these measures, called the partition function, is finite.
  We provide an explicit construction of the such conformal restriction SLEs in multiply connected domains when $\kappa = 4$ using the Gaussian Free Field (GFF). In particular, both when the target points of the curve are on the same or on distinct boundary components, we show that there is a mixture of laws of level lines of GFFs that satisfies the restriction property. This allows us to give an expression for the partition function of $\mathrm{sle}_4$ on multiply connected domains and shows that the partition function is finite, answering the question raised in [Lawler, J. Stat. Phys. 2009].
  In a second part, we provide a second construction of $\mathrm{sle}_\kappa$ in multiply-connected domains for the whole range $\kappa \in (8/3,4]$; specific, however, to the case of the two target points belonging to the same boundary components. This is inspired by [Werner, Wu, Electron. J. Probab. 2013] and consists of a mixture of laws on curves obtained by following $\mathrm{cle}_\kappa$ loops and restriction hulls attached to parts of the boundary of the domain. In this case as well, we obtain as a corollary the finiteness of the partition function for this type of $\mathrm{sle}_\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Diaconis--Freedman Conjecture on partially-exchangeable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Diaconis and Freedman (Ann. Probab. 1980) characterising the extreme points of the set of partially-exchangeable processes on a countable set. More concretely, we prove that the partially exchangeable sigma-algebra of any transient partially exchangeable process $X=(X_i)_{i\geq 0}$ (and hence any transient Markov chain) coincides up to null sets with the sigma-algebra generated by the initial state $X_0$ and the transition counts $( \#\{i\geq 0: X_i=x, X_{i+1}=y\} : x,y\in S)$. Our proof is based on an analysis of Gibbs measures for Eulerian paths on rooted digraphs, relying in particular on the connection to uniform spanning trees and Wilson's algorithm via the de Bruijn--Ehrenfest--Smith--Tutte (BEST) bijection, and yields an explicit method to sample from the conditional distribution of a transient Markov chain given its transition counts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dimer model on the Aztec diamond with Fock's weights, which is gauge equivalent to the model with any choice of positive weight function. We prove an explicit, compact formula for the inverse Kasteleyn matrix, thus extending numerous results in the case of periodic graphs. We also show an explicit product formula for the partition function; as a specific instance of the genus 0 case, we recover Stanley's formula. We then use our explicit formula for the inverse Kasteleyn matrix to recover, in a simple way, limit shape results; we also obtain new ones. In doing so, we extend the correspondence between the limit shape and the amoeba of the corresponding spectral curve of arXiv:2306.07482 to the case of non-generic weights.</description>

      <title>Kemeny's constant and the Lemoine point of a simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kemeny's constant is an invariant of discrete-time Markov chains, equal to the expected number of steps between two states sampled from the stationary distribution. It appears in applications as a concise characterization of the mixing properties of a Markov chain and has many alternative definitions. In this short article, we derive a new geometric expression for Kemeny's constant, which involves the distance between two points in a simplex associated to the Markov chain: the circumcenter and the Lemoine point. Our proof uses an expression due to Wang, Dubbeldam and Van Mieghem of Kemeny's constant in terms of effective resistances and Fiedler's interpretation of effective resistances as edge lengths of a simplex.</description>

We prove that \[\mathbb{P}\big( \sigma_{n}(M) \leq \varepsilon n^{-1/2} \big) = (1+o(1)) \varepsilon + e^{-\Omega(n)}\] for all $0 \leq \varepsilon \ll 1$. This resolves, up to a $1+o(1)$ factor, a seminal conjecture of Spielman and Teng.</description>

      <title>Fast Gaussian Distributed Pseudorandom Number Generation in Java via the Ziggurat Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on experiments with the ziggurat algorithm for generating Gaussian distributed random numbers. The study utilizes our open source Java implementation that was introduced originally for Java 11 at a time when the Java API only provided the much slower polar method. Our Java implementation of the ziggurat algorithm is a port of the GNU Scientific Library's C implementation. Java 17 introduced a significant overhaul of pseudorandom number generation, including several modern pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) as well as additional functionality, among which includes switching from the polar method to a modified ziggurat algorithm. In the experiments of this paper, we explore whether there is still a need for our implementation for Java 17+ applications. Our results show that Java 17's modified ziggurat is faster than our implementation for the PRNGs that support it. However, Java 17+ continues to use the polar method for the legacy PRNGs Random, SecureRandom, and ThreadLocalRandom. The linear congruential method of Java's Random class lacks the statistical properties required by Java's modified ziggurat implementation; and SecureRandom and ThreadLocalRandom unfortunately use the polar method as a side-effect of extending Random. Our implementation of the original ziggurat algorithm does not require the same statistical properties of the underlying PRNG as Java 17's optimized version, and can be used with any of these PRNGs, and is especially relevant where pre-Java 17 support is required.</description>

      <title>Convergence Bounds for Sequential Monte Carlo on Multimodal Distributions using Soft Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove bounds on the variance of a function $f$ under the empirical measure of the samples obtained by the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm, with time complexity depending on local rather than global Markov chain mixing dynamics. SMC is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, which starts by drawing $N$ particles from a known distribution, and then, through a sequence of distributions, re-weights and re-samples the particles, at each instance applying a Markov chain for smoothing. In principle, SMC tries to alleviate problems from multi-modality. However, most theoretical guarantees for SMC are obtained by assuming global mixing time bounds, which are only efficient in the uni-modal setting. We show that bounds can be obtained in the truly multi-modal setting, with mixing times that depend only on local MCMC dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mixed radix numeration bases: H\"orner's rule, Yang-Baxter equation and Furstenberg's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed radix bases in numeration is a very old notion but it is rarely studied on its own or in relation with concrete problems related to number theory. Starting from the natural question of the conversion of a basis to another for integers as well as polynomials, we use mixed radix bases to introduce two-dimensional arrays with suitable filling rules. These arrays provide algorithms of conversion which uses only a finite number of euclidean division to convert from one basis to another; it is interesting to note that these algorithms are generalizations of the well-known H\"orner's rule of quick evaluation of polynomials. The two-dimensional arrays with local transformations are reminiscent from statistical mechanics models: we show that changes between three numeration basis are related to the set-theoretical Yang-Baxter equation and this is, up to our knowledge, the first time that such a structure is described in number theory. As an illustration, we reinterpret well-known results around Furstenberg's conjecture in terms of Yang-Baxter transformations between mixed radix bases, hence opening the way to alternative approaches.</description>

      <title>MetaCURL: Non-stationary Concave Utility Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore online learning in episodic loop-free Markov decision processes on non-stationary environments (changing losses and probability transitions). Our focus is on the Concave Utility Reinforcement Learning problem (CURL), an extension of classical RL for handling convex performance criteria in state-action distributions induced by agent policies. While various machine learning problems can be written as CURL, its non-linearity invalidates traditional Bellman equations. Despite recent solutions to classical CURL, none address non-stationary MDPs. This paper introduces MetaCURL, the first CURL algorithm for non-stationary MDPs. It employs a meta-algorithm running multiple black-box algorithms instances over different intervals, aggregating outputs via a sleeping expert framework. The key hurdle is partial information due to MDP uncertainty. Under partial information on the probability transitions (uncertainty and non-stationarity coming only from external noise, independent of agent state-action pairs), we achieve optimal dynamic regret without prior knowledge of MDP changes. Unlike approaches for RL, MetaCURL handles full adversarial losses, not just stochastic ones. We believe our approach for managing non-stationarity with experts can be of interest to the RL community.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in Overparametrized Neural Networks: A Mean-Field View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Mean-Field (MF) view of the learning dynamics of overparametrized Artificial Neural Networks (NN) under data symmetric in law wrt the action of a general compact group $G$. We consider for this a class of generalized shallow NNs given by an ensemble of $N$ multi-layer units, jointly trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and possibly symmetry-leveraging (SL) techniques, such as Data Augmentation (DA), Feature Averaging (FA) or Equivariant Architectures (EA). We introduce the notions of weakly and strongly invariant laws (WI and SI) on the parameter space of each single unit, corresponding, respectively, to $G$-invariant distributions, and to distributions supported on parameters fixed by the group action (which encode EA). This allows us to define symmetric models compatible with taking $N\to\infty$ and give an interpretation of the asymptotic dynamics of DA, FA and EA in terms of Wasserstein Gradient Flows describing their MF limits. When activations respect the group action, we show that, for symmetric data, DA, FA and freely-trained models obey the exact same MF dynamic, which stays in the space of WI laws and minimizes therein the population risk. We also give a counterexample to the general attainability of an optimum over SI laws. Despite this, quite remarkably, we show that the set of SI laws is also preserved by the MF dynamics even when freely trained. This sharply contrasts the finite-$N$ setting, in which EAs are generally not preserved by unconstrained SGD. We illustrate the validity of our findings as $N$ gets larger in a teacher-student experimental setting, training a student NN to learn from a WI, SI or arbitrary teacher model through various SL schemes. We last deduce a data-driven heuristic to discover the largest subspace of parameters supporting SI distributions for a problem, that could be used for designing EA with minimal generalization error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-target linear shrinkage is an extension of the standard single-target linear shrinkage for covariance estimation. We combine several constant matrices - the targets - with the sample covariance matrix. We derive the oracle and a \textit{bona fide} multi-target linear shrinkage estimator with exact and empirical mean. In both settings, we proved its convergence towards the oracle under Kolmogorov asymptotics. Finally, we show empirically that it outperforms other standard estimators in various situations.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Zeroth- and First-order Stochastic Trust-Region Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model update (MU) and candidate evaluation (CE) are classical steps incorporated inside many stochastic trust-region (TR) algorithms. The sampling effort exerted within these steps, often decided with the aim of controlling model error, largely determines a stochastic TR algorithm's sample complexity. Given that MU and CE are amenable to variance reduction, we investigate the effect of incorporating common random numbers (CRN) within MU and CE on complexity. Using ASTRO and ASTRO-DF as prototype first-order and zeroth-order families of algorithms, we demonstrate that CRN's effectiveness leads to a range of complexities depending on sample-path regularity and the oracle order. For instance, we find that in first-order oracle settings with smooth sample paths, CRN's effect is pronounced -- ASTRO with CRN achieves $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ a.s. sample complexity compared to $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$ a.s. in the generic no-CRN setting. By contrast, CRN's effect is muted when the sample paths are not Lipschitz, with the sample complexity improving from $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$ a.s. to $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-5})$ and $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ a.s. in the zeroth- and first-order settings, respectively. Since our results imply that improvements in complexity are largely inherited from generic aspects of variance reduction, e.g., finite-differencing for zeroth-order settings and sample-path smoothness for first-order settings within MU, we anticipate similar trends in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Entropy annealing for policy mirror descent in continuous time and space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy regularization has been extensively used in policy optimization algorithms to regularize the optimization landscape and accelerate convergence; however, it comes at the cost of introducing an additional regularization bias. This work quantifies the impact of entropy regularization on the convergence of policy gradient methods for stochastic exit time control problems. We analyze a continuous-time policy mirror descent dynamics, which updates the policy based on the gradient of an entropy-regularized value function and adjusts the strength of entropy regularization as the algorithm progresses. We prove that with a fixed entropy level, the dynamics converges exponentially to the optimal solution of the regularized problem. We further show that when the entropy level decays at suitable polynomial rates, the annealed flow converges to the solution of the unregularized problem at a rate of $\mathcal O(1/S)$ for discrete action spaces and, under suitable conditions, at a rate of $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{S})$ for general action spaces, with $S$ being the gradient flow time. This paper explains how entropy regularization improves policy optimization, even with the true gradient, from the perspective of convergence rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ be a Steinhaus or a Rademacher random multiplicative function. For a wide class of multiplicative functions $f$ we prove that the sum $\sum_{n \le x}\alpha(n) f(n)$, normalised to have mean square $1$, has a limiting distribution. The limiting distribution we find is a Gaussian times the square-root of the total mass of a random measure associated with $f$.
  Our result applies to $d_z$, the $z$-th divisor function, as long as $z$ is strictly between $0$ and $\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Other examples of admissible $f$-s include any multiplicative indicator function with the property that $f(p)=1$ holds for a set of primes of density strictly between $0$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.10739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the version of Hairer's regularity structures based on a greedier index set than trees, as introduced by Otto, Sauer, Smith and Weber. More precisely, we construct and stochastically estimate the renormalized model avoiding the use of Feynman diagrams but still in a fully automated, i. e. inductive way. This is carried out for a class of quasi-linear parabolic PDEs driven by noise in the full singular but renormalizable range. We assume a spectral gap inequality on the (not necessarily Gaussian) noise ensemble. The resulting control on the variance of the model naturally complements its vanishing expectation arising from the BPHZ-choice of renormalization. We capture the gain in regularity on the level of the Malliavin derivative of the model by describing it as a modelled distribution. Symmetry is an important guiding principle and built-in on the level of the renormalization Ansatz. Our approach is analytic and top-down rather than combinatorial and bottom-up.</description>

      <title>Exact Exponents for Concentration and Isoperimetry in Product Polish Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.07596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive variational formulas for the asymptotic exponents (i.e., convergence rates) of the concentration and isoperimetric functions in the product Polish probability space under certain mild assumptions. These formulas are expressed in terms of relative entropies (which are from information theory) and optimal transport cost functionals (which are from optimal transport theory). Hence, our results verify an intimate connection among information theory, optimal transport, and concentration of measure or isoperimetric inequalities. In the concentration regime, the corresponding variational formula is in fact a dimension-free bound in the sense that this bound is valid for any dimension. A cardinality bound for the alphabet of the auxiliary random variable in the expression of the asymptotic isoperimetric exponent is provided, which makes the expression computable by a finite-dimensional program for the finite alphabet case. We lastly apply our results to obtain an isoperimetric inequality in the classic isoperimetric setting, which is asymptotically sharp under certain conditions. The proofs in this paper are based on information-theoretic and optimal transport techniques.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic dominance orders are commonly used in both the theory and practice of risk management and decision making under uncertainty. We provide a novel characterization of the $n$-th degree bounded stochastic dominance order, which compares the $n$-th lower partial moments of random variables within a bounded domain. This characterization establishes a connection between the risk tolerance of decision-makers and bounded stochastic dominance orders, thereby providing a decision-theoretic interpretation for these stochastic orders. As a by-product of our results, we provide applications for portfolio optimization with stochastic order constraints. We also offer non-trivial inequalities for $n$-convex functions and rankings over lotteries for decision-makers with a globally bounded Arrow-Pratt measure of risk aversion. Additionally, we present comparative statics results regarding savings decisions for decision-makers with globally bounded prudence measures.</description>

      <title>Full large deviation principles for the largest eigenvalue of sub-Gaussian Wigner matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish precise upper-tail asymptotics and large deviation principles for the rightmost eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of Wigner matrices with sub-Gaussian entries. In contrast to the case of heavier tails, where deviations of $\lambda_1$ are due to the appearance of a few large entries, and the sharp sub-Gaussian case that is governed by the collective deviation of entries in a delocalized rank-one pattern, we show that the general sub-Gaussian case is determined by a mixture of localized and delocalized effects.
  Our key result is a finite-$N$ approximation for the upper tail of $\lambda_1$ by an optimization problem involving \emph{restricted annealed free energies} for a spherical spin glass model. This new type of argument allows us to derive full large deviation principles when the log-Laplace transform of the entries' distribution $\mu$ has bounded second derivative, whereas previous results required much more restrictive assumptions, namely sharp sub-Gaussianity and symmetry, or only covered certain ranges of deviations.
  We show that the sharp sub-Gaussian condition characterizes measures $\mu$ for which the rate function coincides with that of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). When $\mu$ is not sharp sub-Gaussian, at a certain distance from the bulk of the spectrum there is a transition from the GOE rate function to a non-universal rate function depending on $\mu$, and this transition coincides with the onset of a localization phenomenon for the associated eigenvector.</description>

Abstract: We give a novel characterization of the centered model in regularity structures which persists for rough drivers even as a mollification fades away. We present our result for a class of quasilinear equations driven by noise, however we believe that the method is robust and applies to a much broader class of subcritical equations. Furthermore, we prove that a convergent sequence of noise ensembles, satisfying uniformly a spectral gap assumption, implies the corresponding convergence of the associated models. Combined with the characterization, this establishes a universality-type result.</description>

      <title>Weyl's law in Liouville quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can you hear the shape of Liouville quantum gravity? We obtain a Weyl law for the eigenvalues of Liouville Brownian motion: the $n$-th eigenvalue grows linearly with $n$, with the proportionality constant given by the Liouville area of the domain and a certain deterministic constant $c_\gamma$ depending on $\gamma \in (0, 2)$. The constant $c_\gamma$, initially a complicated function of Sheffield's quantum cone, can be evaluated explicitly and is strictly greater than the equivalent Riemannian constant.
  At the heart of the proof we obtain sharp asymptotics of independent interest for the small-time behaviour of the on-diagonal heat kernel. Interestingly, we show that the scaled heat kernel displays nontrivial pointwise fluctuations. Fortunately, at the level of the heat trace these pointwise fluctuations cancel each other, which leads to the result.
  We complement these results with a number of conjectures on the spectral geometry of Liouville quantum gravity, notably suggesting a connection with quantum chaos.</description>

Abstract: We study limit laws for simple random walks on supercritical long-range percolation clusters on the integer lattice. For the long range percolation model, the probability that two vertices are connected behaves asymptotically as a negative power of distance between them. We prove that the scaling limit of simple random walk on the infinite component converges to an isotropic alpha-stable Levy process. This complements the work of Crawford and Sly, who proved the corresponding result for alpha between 0 and 1. The convergence holds in both the quenched and annealed senses.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent development of mean-field systems with common noise, this paper establishes Ito's formula for flows of conditional probability measures under a common filtration associated with general semimartingales. This generalizes existing works on flows of conditional measures on Ito processes and flows of deterministic measure on general semimartingales. The key technical components involve constructing conditional independent copies and establishing the equivalence between stochastic integrals with respect to the conditional law of semimartingales and the conditional expectation of stochastic integrals with respect to copies of semimartingales. Ito's formula is then established for cylindrical functions through conditional independent copies, and extended to the general case through function approximations.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional SRBM with discontinuous state-dependent drift and variance and its stationary distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A semi-martingale reflecting Brownian motion is a popular process for diffusion approximations of queueing models including their networks. In this paper, we are concerned with the case that it lives on the nonnegative half-line but its variance and drift discontinuously change depending on its position. This reflecting diffusion process naturally arises from a state-dependent single server queue, studied by the author. Our main interest is in its stationary distribution, which is important for application. We define this reflecting diffusion process as the solution of a stochastic integral equation. Its existence is recently shown by Atar, Castiel and Reiman (2022,2023) under a more general condition than we have studied here, and its uniqueness is obtained also by them under one of the conditions of this paper. We here give elementary proofs for both of them. In this paper, we consider its stability, that is, the condition that the reflecting diffusion process has a stationary distribution, and derive its stationary distribution under the stability condition. Our basic tools are the generalized Ito formula for a convex function and local time. Proofs are rather elementary once it is understood how to use the Ito formula and local time.</description>

Abstract: We study the limiting spectral measure of large random Helson matrices and large random matrices of certain patterned structures.
  Given a real random variable $X \in L^{2+ \varepsilon}(\mathbb{P}) $ for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\mathrm{Var}(X) = 1$. For the Helson matrices generated by the independent copies of $X$, scaling the eigenvalues by $\sqrt{n}$, we prove the almost sure weak convergence of the spectral measure to the standard semi-circular law. Similar results are established for large random matrices with certain general patterned structures.</description>

      <title>Non-compact quantum spin chains as integrable stochastic particle processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.01048v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a family of models of particle and energy diffusion on a one-dimensional lattice, related to those studied previously in [Sasamoto-Wadati], [Barraquand-Corwin] and [Povolotsky] in the context of KPZ universality class. We show that they may be mapped onto an integrable $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ Heisenberg spin chain whose Hamiltonian density in the bulk has been already studied in the AdS/CFT and the integrable system literature. Using the quantum inverse scattering method, we study various new aspects, in particular we identify boundary terms, modeling reservoirs in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics models, for which the spin chain (and thus also the stochastic process) continues to be integrable. We also show how the construction of a "dual model" of probability theory is possible and useful. The fluctuating hydrodynamics of our stochastic model corresponds to the semiclassical evolution of a string that derives from correlation functions of local gauge invariant operators of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory (SYM), in imaginary-time. As any stochastic system, it has a supersymmetric completion that encodes for the thermal equilibrium theorems: we show that in this case it is equivalent to the $\mathfrak{sl}(2|1)$ superstring that has been derived directly from $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration in Ramsey graphs and a proof of the Erd\H{o}s-McKay conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An $n$-vertex graph is called $C$-Ramsey if it has no clique or independent set of size $C\log_2 n$ (i.e., if it has near-optimal Ramsey behavior). In this paper, we study edge-statistics in Ramsey graphs, in particular obtaining very precise control of the distribution of the number of edges in a random vertex subset of a $C$-Ramsey graph. This brings together two ongoing lines of research: the study of "random-like" properties of Ramsey graphs and the study of small-ball probabilities for low-degree polynomials of independent random variables.
  The proof proceeds via an "additive structure" dichotomy on the degree sequence, and involves a wide range of different tools from Fourier analysis, random matrix theory, the theory of Boolean functions, probabilistic combinatorics, and low-rank approximation. One of the consequences of our result is the resolution of an old conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and McKay, for which Erd\H{o}s offered one of his notorious monetary prizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of conditional expectations in free random variables and provide closed formulas for the conditional expectation of resolvents of arbitrary non-commutative polynomials in free random variables onto the subalgebra of an arbitray subset of the variables. More precisely, given a linearization of the resolvent we compute a linearization of its conditional expectation. The coefficients of the expressions obtained in this process involve certain Boolean cumulant functionals which can be computed by solving a system of equations. On the way towards the main result we introduce a non-commutative differential calculus which allows to evaluate conditional expectations and the said Boolean cumulant functionals. We conclude the paper with several known and new examples which illustrate the working of the developed machinery and two appendices. The first appendix contains a purely algebraic approach to Boolean cumulants and the second appendix provides a crash course on linearizations of rational series.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Equilibrium the Lucas Critique and Keynesian Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16214</link>

Abstract: In this paper, a mathematically rigorous solution overturns existing wisdom regarding New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium. I develop a formal concept of stochastic equilibrium. I prove uniqueness and necessity, when agents are patient, with general application. Existence depends on appropriately specified eigenvalue conditions. Otherwise, no solution of any kind exists. I construct the equilibrium with Calvo pricing. I provide novel comparative statics with the non-stochastic model of mathematical significance. I uncover a bifurcation between neighbouring stochastic systems and approximations taken from the Zero Inflation Non-Stochastic Steady State (ZINSS). The correct Phillips curve agrees with the zero limit from the trend inflation framework. It contains a large lagged inflation coefficient and a small response to expected inflation. Price dispersion can be first or second order depending how shocks are scaled. The response to the output gap is always muted and is zero at standard parameters. A neutrality result is presented to explain why and align Calvo with Taylor pricing. Present and lagged demand shocks enter the Phillips curve so there is no Divine Coincidence and the system is identified from structural shocks alone. The lagged inflation slope is increasing in the inflation response, embodying substantive policy trade-offs. The Taylor principle is reversed, inactive settings are necessary, pointing towards inertial policy. The observational equivalence idea of the Lucas critique is disproven. The bifurcation results from the breakdown of the constraints implied by lagged nominal rigidity, associated with cross-equation cancellation possible only at ZINSS. There is a dual relationship between restrictions on the econometrician and constraints on repricing firms. Thus, if the model is correct, goodness of fit will jump.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a spatial semidiscretization for a three-dimensional stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with multiplicative noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09834v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the convergence of a spatial semidiscretization of a three-dimensional stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with multiplicative noise. For non-smooth initial values, the regularity of the mild solution is investigated, and an error estimate is derived with the spatial $ L^2 $-norm. For smooth initial values, two error estimates with the general spatial $ L^q $-norms are established.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the stochastic Abelian-Higgs equations in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the global well-posedness of the stochastic Abelian-Higgs equations in two dimensions. The proof is based on a new covariant approach, which consists of two parts: First, we introduce covariant stochastic objects. The covariant stochastic objects and their multi-linear interactions are controlled using covariant heat kernel estimates. Second, we control nonlinear remainders using a covariant monotonicity formula, which is inspired by earlier work of Hamilton.</description>
