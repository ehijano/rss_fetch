      <title>Heavy repulsion of clusters in Bernoulli percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Bernoulli$(p)$ percolation on (non)unimodular quasi-transitive graphs and prove that, almost surely, for any two heavy clusters $C$ and $C'$, the set of vertices in $C$ within distance one of $C'$ is light, i.e. it has finite total weight. This is a significant step towards resolving a longstanding question posed by H\"aggstr\"om, Peres, and Schonmann, and a generalization of a theorem of Tim\'ar, who proved the same result in the unimodular setting. Our proof adapts Tim\'ar's approach but requires developing weighted analogues of several classical unimodular results. This presents nontrivial challenges, since in a nonunimodular graph a subtree with infinitely many ends may be hyperfinite or even light. To overcome this, we employ newly developed machinery from the theory of measure-class-preserving equivalence relations and graphs. In particular, we establish a weighted generalization of a theorem of Benjamini, Lyons, and Schramm on the existence of an invariant random subgraph with positive weighted Cheeger constant, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Navier-Stokes Equations with Fractional Dissipation and Associated Doubly Stochastic Yule Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric regions are identified in terms of the spatial dimension $d$ and the power $\gamma$ of the Laplacian that separate explosive from non-explosive regimes for the self-similar doubly stochastic Yule cascades (DSY) naturally associated with the deterministic fractional Navier-Stokes equations (FNSE) on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in the scaling-supercritical setting. Explosion and/or geometric properties of the DSY, are then used to establish non-uniqueness, local existence, and finite-time blow-up results for a scalar partial differential equation associated to the FNSE through a majorization principle at the level of stochastic solution processes. The solution processes themselves are constructed from the DSY and yield solutions to the FNSE upon taking expectations.
  In the special case $d=2$, a closed-form expression for the solution process of the FNSE is derived. This representation is employed to prove finite-time loss of integrability of the solution process for sufficiently large initial data. Notably, this lack of integrability does not necessarily imply blow-up of the FNSE solutions themselves. In fact, in the radially symmetric case, solutions can be continued beyond the integrability threshold by employing a modified notion of averaging.</description>

      <title>Fractional Skellam Random Fields on $\mathbb{R}^2_+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Skellam point process on $\mathbb{R}^M_+$, $M\ge1$. For $M=2$, it reduces to a Skellam random field on plane which is a two parameter L\'evy process with rectangular increment. A weak convergent result is obtained for it. Further, we consider three fractional variants of Skellam random field on positive quadrant of plane. Their point probabilities, associated governing equations, and other distributional properties are studied in detail. Later, we consider an integral of Skellam random field over rectangle and derive a scaled compound Poisson field characterization for it.</description>

      <title>Weak Existence and Uniqueness for Super-Brownian Motion with Irregular Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish weak existence and uniqueness for random field solutions of the one-dimensional SPDE \[ d_tX_t = \frac{1}{2}\Delta X_t +h(X_t)+ \sqrt{X_t}\dot{W}, \quad t\geq 0,\] where $\dot{W}$ is space-time white noise and $h$ is a bounded drift with $h(0)\geq 0$. The proof relies on an extension of the duality relation of the super-Brownian motion, which allows us to treat a broad class of admissible drifts, including functions that are non-Lipschitz or discontinuous at zero.</description>

      <title>On the Continuity of Enhancement Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bond percolation in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with an unbounded family of enhancements that enable additional bonds to act as open. A natural question is whether percolation occurs in this model if and only if percolation also occurs in the system with a finite subcollection of enhancements. We give an affirmative answer in dimension $d=2$ for symmetric families of connected enhancements, and in dimensions $d\ge 3$ we prove a partial result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a study of a formula representing submodular set function as a supremum of measures dominated by the set function, we present a corresponding formula for a Choquet integration with respect to the set function, on a measurable space which has a chain of measurable set generating the sigma-algebra. As an application we reproduce a basic formula in mathematical finance on law invariant coherent risk measures. We also study a recursion relation of set functions for which the representation formula characterizes the fixed point.</description>

      <title>The Horton-Strahler number of butterfly trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Horton-Strahler number (HS) is a measure of branching complexity of rooted trees, introduced in hydrology and later studied in parallel computing under the name register function. While its order of growth is well understood for classical random trees, fluctuation behavior has largely resisted analysis. In this work we investigate the HS in the setting of butterfly trees -- binary trees constructed from butterfly permutations, a rich class of separable permutations with origins in numerical linear algebra and parallel architectures. For the subclass of simple butterfly trees, we exploit their recursive gluing structure to model the HS as an additive functional of a finite-state Markov process. This framework yields sharp distributional results, including a law of large numbers and a Central Limit Theorem with explicit variance growth, providing what appears to be the first genuine Gaussian limit law for the HS in a nontrivial random tree model. Extending to biased constructions, we further establish functional limit theorems via analytic and probabilistic tools. For general butterfly trees, while exact analysis remains open, empirical sampling shows that the HS distribution is confined to a narrower support than in classical models, and appears to concentrate tightly near the upper bound $\lfloor \log_4 N\rfloor$.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Behavior of Subordinated Branching Processes with Prevailing Emigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals into the long-term behavior of subordinated critical branching processes with migration. We focus on scenarios where emigration is the dominant factor and introduce additional randomness in timing through a subordination mechanism, involving renewal processes. The key findings highlight how the initial population size and the interarrival mean time influence both asymptotic behavior of the non-extinction probability and corresponding Yaglom type limit theorems. We also study an alternating regenerative process, when the population cycles between zero and positive states. This research complements previous studies for processes when immigration prevails over emigration.</description>

      <title>A note on Tricomi-type partial differential equations with white noise initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of Tricomi-type partial differential equations previously investigated in [28]. Firstly, we generalize the representation formula for the solution obtained there by allowing the coefficient in front of the second-order partial derivative with respect to $x$ to be any non integer power of $t$. Then, we analyze the robustness of that solution by taking the initial data to be Gaussian white noise and we discover that the existence of a well-defined random field solution is lost upon the introduction of lower-order terms in the operator. This phenomenon shows that, even though the Tricomi-type operators with or without lower-order terms are the same from the point of view of the theory of hyperbolic operators with double characteristics, their corresponding random versions exhibit different well posedness properties. We also prove that for more regular initial data, specifically fractional Gaussian white noise with Hurst parameter $H\in (1/2,1)$, the well posedness of the Cauchy problem for the Tricomi-type operator with lower-order term is restored.</description>

      <title>A Poisson representation of the positive sojourn time of L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution of the positive sojourn time $$ A_t:= \int_0^t \mathbf 1\{ X_s&gt;0 \}ds $$ of an arbitrary L\'evy process $X:= (X_t)_{t\geq 0}$. For an exponential random variable $E^{(q)}$ of rate $q&gt;0$ independent of $X$ we show the representation in law \begin{align*}
  A_{E^{(q)}} =_d \sum_{T\in \Pi} T \end{align*} as the sum of points of a Poisson process $\Pi$ with intensity given explicitely in terms of the positivity $t\mapsto \mathbb P\{X_t&gt;0\}$. This representation raises some fundamental questions, not least because $\Pi$ turns out to be intimately connected to the celebrated Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. Moreover, we characterise $A_t$ by working out its double Laplace transform, and thus complement a recent result in which the distribution of $A_t$ was characterised via its higher moments. As a Corollary of the Poisson representation, in the special cases where $X$ is Brownian motion, a symmetric stable process, a L\'evy process with constant positivity, we obtain an extension and new derivation of classical (generalised) arcsine laws going back to L\'evy (1939), Kac (1951), and Getoor and Sharpe (1994), respectively. Even in these cases the Poisson representation is new.
  As an application, if $X$ is the $(1/2)$-stable subordinator with drift, we obtain both the Laplace transform of $A_t$ and the density of its distribution. This is the second example of a L\'evy process whose occupation time distribution is known explicitely but is not generalized arcsine, the first example being Brownian motion with drift that was studied earlier in the context of option prizing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of rough stochastic differential equations (arXiv:2106.10340) is applied to revisit classical problems in stochastic filtering. We provide rough counterparts to the Kallianpur-Striebel formula and the Zakai and Kushner-Stratonovich equations, seen to coincide with classical objects upon randomization. We follow Crisan-Pardoux (arXiv:2411.11125) in doing so in a correlated diffusion setting. Well-posedness of the (rough) filtering equation is seen to hold under dimension-independent regularity assumption, in contrast to the stochastic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide non-asymptotic error bounds in the path Wasserstein distance with quadratic integral cost between suitable functionals of the telegraph process and the corresponding functional of Brownian motion with explicit diffusivity constant. These results cover, in particular, the well-known example of the exponential integral functional of the geometric Brownian motion. The non-asymptotic error bounds tend to zero in the so-called Kac regime. Moreover, the error bounds remain valid when the flip rate for the telegraph process is small. We assess the sharpness of the error bounds through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness on $L^1$ solutions of multidimensional BSDEs with generators of stochastic one-sided Osgood type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By imposing an additional integrability condition on the first component of the solution, this paper establishes an existence and uniqueness result for $L^1$ solutions of multidimensional backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with a general terminal time when the generator $g$ satisfies a stochastic one-sided Osgood condition along with a general growth condition in the state variable $y$, and a stochastic Lipschitz condition in the state variable $z$, extending and strengthening Theorems 1 and 2 of Fan [J. Theor. Probab. 31(2018)]. Two general stochastic Gronwall-type and Bihari-type inequalities along with some innovative techniques dealing with stochastic coefficients and weaker integrability conditions play crucial roles in our proofs, and can be useful in further study on the adapted solution of BSDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the problem of sampling from log-concave distributions with (possibly) superlinear gradient growth under kinetic (underdamped) Langevin algorithms. Using a carefully tailored taming scheme, we propose two novel discretizations of the kinetic Langevin SDE, and we show that they are both contractive and satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality. Building on this, we establish a series of non-asymptotic bounds in $2$-Wasserstein distance between the law reached by each algorithm and the underlying target measure.</description>

      <title>Discrete weakly stable distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A random variable X is strictly stable if a sum of independent copies of X has the same distribution as X up to scaling, and is stable (or weakly stable) if the sum has the same distribution as X up to both scaling and shifting. Steutel and Van Harn studied 'discrete strict stability' for random variables taking values in the non-negative integers, replacing scaling by the thinning operation. We extend this to 'discrete (weak) stability', where shifting is replaced by the addition of an independent Poisson random variable. The discrete stable distributions are 'Poisson-delayed Sibuya' distributions, which include the Poisson and Hermite distributions. Very similar results have been proved independently by Townes (arXiv:2509.05497).</description>

      <title>Brownian motion on the Fubini extension space and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish a certain equivalence between a Brownian motion on a Fubini extension space and a collection of essentially pairwise independent Brownian motions on the marginal sample spaces. This equivalence allows us to state a Girsanov theorem that preserves pairwise independence and to formulate graphon stochastic differential equations as a single McKean-Vlasov type equation driven by a standard Brownian motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the scrambling of a Rubik's cube by a Markov chain and introduce a stopping time $T$ which is a quite natural candidate to be a strong uniform time. This may pave the way for estimating the number of moves required to scramble a cube. Unfortunately, we show that $T$ is not this is not strongly uniform.</description>

      <title>On the First Non-Universal Term in Random Polynomial Real Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \xi_k x^k$ be a Kac random polynomial, where the coefficients $\xi_k$ are i.i.d.\ copies of a given random variable $\xi$. Based on numerical experiments, it has been conjectured that if $\xi$ has mean zero, unit variance, and a finite $(2+\varepsilon_0)$-moment for some $\varepsilon_0&gt;0$, then
  \[
  \mathbb{E}[N_{\mathbb{R}}(P_n)] \;=\; \frac{2}{\pi} \log n + C_{\xi} + o_n(1),
  \] where $N_{\mathbb{R}}(P_n)$ denotes the number of real roots of $P_n$, and $C_{\xi}$ is an absolute constant depending only on $\xi$, which is nonuniversal. Prior to this work, the existence of $C_{\xi}$ had only been established by Do-Nguyen-Vu (2015, \emph{Proc.\ Lond.\ Math.\ Soc.}) under the additional assumption that $\xi$ either admits a $(1+p)$-integrable density or is uniformly distributed on $\{\pm 1, \pm 2, \dots, \pm N\}$. In this paper, using a different method, we remove these extra conditions on $\xi$, and extend the result to the setting where the $\xi_k$ are independent but not necessarily identically distributed. Moreover, this proof strategy provides an alternative description of the constant $C_{\xi}$, and this new perspective serves as the key ingredient in establishing that $C_{\xi}$ depends continuously on the distribution of $\xi$.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Extremal Bad Science Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the 'bad science matrix problem': among all matrices $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ whose rows have unit $\ell_2$-norm, determine the maximum of $\beta(A)=\frac{1}{2^n}\sum_{x\in\{\pm1\}^n}\|Ax\|_\infty$. Steinerberger [1] (arXiv:2402.03205) showed that the optimal asymptotic rate is $(1+o(1))\sqrt{2\log n}$, and that this rate is attained with high probability by matrices with i.i.d. $\pm1$ entries after normalization. More recent explicit constructions [2] (arXiv:2408.00933) achieve $\beta(A)\ge\sqrt{\log_2(n)+1}$, which lies within a constant factor of the asymptotic optimum. In this paper we bridge the gap between the probabilistic and explicit approaches. We give a geometric description of extremizers as (nearly) isoperimetrically extremal partitions of the $n$-dimensional hypercube induced by the rows of $A$. We obtain precise rates for heuristic constructions by recasting the maximization of $\beta(A)$ in the language of high-dimensional central-limit theorems as in Fang, Koike, Liu and Zhao [16] (arXiv:2305.17365). Using these connections, we present a family of explicit deterministic matrices $A_n$ that exist for all $n$ under the assumption of Hadamard's conjecture, and for infinitely many $n$ unconditionally, such that for all $n$ sufficiently large $\beta(A_n)\ge\bigl(1 - \frac{\log\log(2n)}{4\log(2n)}\bigr)\sqrt{2\log(2n)}.$</description>

Abstract: In [Jalowy, Kabluchko, Marynych, arXiv:2504.11593v1, 2025], the authors discuss a user-friendly approach to determine the limiting empirical zero distribution of a sequence of real-rooted polynomials, as the degree goes to $\infty$. In this note, we aim to apply it to a vast range of examples of polynomials providing a unifying source for limiting empirical zero distributions.
  We cover Touchard, Fubini, Eulerian, Narayana and little $q$-Laguerre polynomials as well as hypergeometric polynomials including the classical Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials. We construct polynomials whose empirical zero distributions converge to the free multiplicative normal and Poisson distributions. Furthermore, we study polynomials generated by some differential operators. As one inverse result, we derive coefficient asymptotics of the characteristic polynomial of random covariance matrices.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Verbose Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The persistence diagram is a central object in the study of persistent homology and has also been investigated in the context of random topology. The more recent notion of the verbose diagram (a.k.a. verbose barcode) is a refinement of the persistence diagram that is obtained by incorporating ephemeral persistence features as extra points along the diagonal. In this work, we initiate the study of random verbose diagrams. We establish a strong law of large numbers for verbose diagrams as a random point cloud grows in size -- that is, we prove the existence of a limiting verbose diagram, viewed as a measure on the half-plane on and above the diagonal. Also, we characterize its support and compute its total mass. Along the way, we extend the notion of the persistent Betti number, reveal the relation between this extended notion and the verbose diagram (which is an extension of the fundamental lemma of persistent homology), and establish results on the asymptotic behavior of the extended persistent Betti numbers.
  This work extends the main results of the work by Hiraoka, Shirai, and Trinh and its sequel by Shirai and Suzaki to the setting of verbose diagrams.</description>

      <title>An Incentive-Compatible Reward Sharing Mechanism for Mitigating Mirroring Attacks in Decentralized Data-Feed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized data-feed systems enable blockchain-based smart contracts to access off-chain information by aggregating values from multiple oracles. To improve accuracy, these systems typically use an aggregation function, such as majority voting, to consolidate the inputs they receive from oracles and make a decision. Depending on the final decision and the values reported by the oracles, the participating oracles are compensated through shared rewards. However, such incentive mechanisms are vulnerable to mirroring attacks, where a single user controls multiple oracles to bias the decision of the aggregation function and maximize rewards. This paper analyzes the impact of mirroring attacks on the reliability and dependability of majority voting-based data-feed systems. We demonstrate how existing incentive mechanisms can unintentionally encourage rational users to implement such attacks. To address this, we propose a new incentive mechanism that discourages Sybil behavior. We prove that the proposed mechanism leads to a Nash Equilibrium in which each user operates only one oracle. Finally, we discuss the practical implementation of the proposed incentive mechanism and provide numerical examples to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Mean first-passage time of a run-and-tumble particle with exponentially-distributed tumble duration in the presence of a drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a finite interval $[a,b]$ with two absorbing end points. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between three values $v,0,-v$ at exponential times, thus incorporating positive tumble times. Moreover, a constant drift is added to the run-and-tumble motion at all times. The combination of these two features constitutes the main novelty of our model. The densities of the first-passage time through $a$ (given the initial position and velocity states) satisfy certain forward Fokker--Planck equations. The Laplace transforms of these equations induce evolution equations for the exit probabilities and the mean first-passage times of the particle. We solve these equations explicitly for all possible initial states. We consider the limiting regimes of instantaneous tumble and/or the limit of large $b$ tend to infinity to confirm consistency with existing results in the literature. In particular, in the limit of a half-line (large $b$), the mean first-passage time conditioned on the exit through $a$ is an affine function of the initial position if the drift is positive, as in the case of instantaneous tumble.</description>

      <title>Balancing Extensions in Posets of Large Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit classic balancing problems for linear extensions of a partially ordered set $P$, proving results that go far beyond many of the best earlier results on this topic. For example, with $p(x\prec y)$ the probability that $x$ precedes $y$ in a uniform linear extension, $\delta_{xy} = \min\{p(x \prec y), p(y \prec x)\}$, and $\delta(P)=\max \delta_{xy}$, we show that $\delta(P)$ tends to $1/2$ as $n := |P| \to\infty$ if $P$ has width $\Omega(n)$ or $\omega(\log(n))$ minimal elements, and is at least $1/e-o(1)$ if $P$ has width $\omega(\sqrt{n})$ or height $o(n)$.
  Motivated by both consequences for balance problems and intrinsic interest, we also consider several old and new parameters associated with $P$. Here, in addition to balance, we study relations between the parameters and suggest various questions that are thought to be worthy of further investigation.</description>

Abstract: We consider the mean first passage time (MFPT) for a diffusive particle in a potential landscape with the extra condition that the particle is reset to its original position with some rate r. We study non-smooth and non-convex potentials and focus on the case where the restart rate depends on the space coordinate. There, we show that it is beneficial to restart at a lower rate once you are closer to your intended target.</description>

      <title>On the universal calibration of Pareto-type linear combination tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often of interest to test a global null hypothesis using multiple, possibly dependent, $p$-values by combining their strengths while controlling the Type I error. Recently, several heavy-tailed combinations tests, such as the harmonic mean test and the Cauchy combination test, have been proposed: they map $p$-values into heavy-tailed random variables before combining them in some fashion into a single test statistic. The resulting tests, which are calibrated under the assumption of independence of the $p$-values, have shown to be rather robust to dependence. The complete understanding of the calibration properties of the resulting combination tests of dependent and possibly tail-dependent $p$-values has remained an important open problem in the area. In this work, we show that the powerful framework of multivariate regular variation (MRV) offers a nearly complete solution to this problem.
  We first show that the precise asymptotic calibration properties of a large class of homogeneous combination tests can be expressed in terms of the angular measure -- a characteristic of the asymptotic tail-dependence under MRV. Consequently, we show that under MRV, the Pareto-type linear combination tests, which are equivalent to the harmonic mean test, are universally calibrated regardless of the tail-dependence structure of the underlying $p$-values. In contrast, the popular Cauchy combination test is shown to be universally honest but often conservative; the Tippet combination test, while being honest, is calibrated if and only if the underlying $p$-values are tail-independent.
  One of our major findings is that the Pareto-type linear combination tests are the only universally calibrated ones among the large family of possibly non-linear homogeneous heavy-tailed combination tests.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fluctuations for spin systems and point processes: near-optimal rates via quantitative Marcinkiewicz's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.08469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish asymptotically Gaussian fluctuations for functionals of a large class of spin models and strongly correlated random point fields, achieving near-optimal rates. For spin models, we demonstrate Gaussian asymptotics for the magnetization for a wide class of ferromagnetic spin systems on Euclidean lattices, in particular those with continuous spins. Specific applications include, in particular, the celebrated XY and Heisenberg models under ferromagnetic conditions, and more broadly, systems with very general rotationally invariant spins in arbitrary dimensions. We address both the setting of free boundary conditions and a large class of ferromagnetic boundary conditions, and our CLTs are endowed with near-optimal rate. Our approach leverages the classical Lee-Yang theory for the zeros of partition functions, and subsumes as a special case results of Lebowitz, Ruelle, Pittel and Speer on CLTs in discrete statistical mechanical models for which we obtain sharper convergence rates. In a different direction, we obtain CLTs for linear statistics of a wide class of point processes known as $\alpha$-determinantal point processes which interpolate between negatively and positively associated random point fields. We contribute a unified approach to CLTs in such models; significantly, our approach is able to analyse such processes in dimensions $\ge 3$, where structural alternatives such as connections to random matrix theory are not available. A key ingredient of our approach is a broad, quantitative extension of the classical Marcinkiewicz Theorem that holds under the limited condition that the characteristic function is non-vanishing only on a bounded disk. In spite of the general applicability of the results, our rates for the CLT match the classic Berry-Esseen bounds for independent sums up to a log factor.</description>

      <title>Optimal Weights in a Two-Tier Voting System with Mean-Field Voters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.08636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse two-tier voting systems with voters described by a multi-group mean-field model that allows for correlated voters both within groups as well as across group boundaries. In this model voters are influenced by voters within their group (constituency, member state, etc.) in a positive way. Across group boundaries positive or negative influence is considered. The objective is to determine the optimal weights each group receives in the council, the upper level of the voting system, to minimise the expected quadratic deviation of the council vote from a hypothetical referendum of the overall population in the large population limit. The mean-field model exhibits different behaviour depending on the intensity of interactions between voters. When interaction is weak, we obtain optimal weights given by the sum of a constant term and a term proportional to the square root of the group's population. When interaction is strong, the optimal weights are in general not uniquely determined. Indeed, when all groups are positively coupled, any assignation of weights is optimal. For two competing clusters of groups, the difference in total weights must be a specific number, but the assignation of weights within each cluster is arbitrary. We also obtain conditions for both interaction regimes under which it is impossible to reach the minimal democracy deficit as some of the weights may be negative.</description>

      <title>Compact Brownian surfaces II. Orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix an arbitrary compact orientable surface with a boundary and consider a uniform bipartite random quadrangulation of this surface with $n$ faces and boundary component lengths of order $\sqrt n$ or of lower order. Endow this quadrangulation with the usual graph metric renormalized by $n^{-1/4}$, mark it on each boundary component, and endow it with the counting measure on its vertex set renormalized by $n^{-1}$, as well as the counting measure on each boundary component renormalized by $n^{-1/2}$. We show that, as $n\to\infty$, this random marked measured metric space converges in distribution for the Gromov--Hausdorff--Prokhorov topology, toward a random limiting marked measured metric space called a Brownian surface.
  This extends known convergence results of uniform random planar quadrangulations with at most one boundary component toward the Brownian sphere and toward the Brownian disk, by considering the case of quadrangulations on general compact orientable surfaces. Our approach consists in cutting a Brownian surface into elementary pieces that are naturally related to the Brownian sphere and the Brownian disk and their noncompact analogs, the Brownian plane and the Brownian half-plane, and to prove convergence results for these elementary pieces, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Edge universality of sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04723v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal A$ be the adjacency matrix of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi directed graph $\mathscr G(N,p)$. We denote the eigenvalues of $\mathcal A$ by $\lambda_1^{\cal A},...,\lambda^{\cal A}_N$, and $|\lambda_1^{\cal A}|=\max_i|\lambda_i^{\cal A}|$. For $N^{-1+o(1)}\leq p\leq 1/2$, we show that \[ \max_{i=2,3,...,N} \bigg|\frac{\lambda_i^{\mathcal A}}{\sqrt{Np(1-p)}}\bigg| =1+O(N^{-1/2+o(1)}) \] with very high probability. In addition, we prove that near the unit circle, the local eigenvalue statistics of ${\mathcal A}/\sqrt{Np(1-p)}$ coincide with those of the real Ginibre ensemble. As a by-product, we also show that all non-trivial eigenvectors of $\mathcal A$ are completely delocalized.
  For Hermitian random matrices, it is known that the edge statistics are sensitive to the sparsity: in the very sparse regime, one needs to remove many noise random variables (which affect both the mean and the fluctuation) to recover the Tracy-Widom distribution. Our results imply that, compared to their analogues in the Hermitian case, the edge statistics of non-Hermitian sparse random matrices are more robust.</description>

Abstract: We present a reachability based approach to establish unique ergodicity of non-linear filter processes where state space of a hidden Markov model is a compact Polish metric space and the observation space is a Polish metric space. We also establish a weak convergence result on occupation measures under such a reachability condition. Our conditions, which are explicit, are complementary to those based on filter stability as demonstrated in examples.</description>

      <title>Absolute continuity, supports and idempotent splitting in categorical probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov categories have recently turned out to be a powerful high-level framework for probability and statistics. They accommodate purely categorical definitions of notions like conditional probability and almost sure equality, as well as proofs of fundamental results such as the Hewitt--Savage 0/1 Law, the de Finetti Theorem and the Ergodic Decomposition Theorem.
  In this work, we develop additional relevant notions from probability theory in the setting of Markov categories. This comprises improved versions of previously introduced definitions of absolute continuity and supports, as well as a detailed study of idempotents and idempotent splitting in Markov categories. Our main result on idempotent splitting is that every idempotent measurable Markov kernel between standard Borel spaces splits through another standard Borel space, and we derive this as an instance of a general categorical criterion for idempotent splitting in Markov categories.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Adapted Smoothed Empirical Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adapted Wasserstein distance controls the calibration errors of optimal values in various stochastic optimization problems, pricing and hedging problems, optimal stopping problems, etc. However, statistical aspects of the adapted Wasserstein distance are bottlenecked by the failure of empirical measures to converge under this distance. Kernel smoothing and adapted projection have been introduced to construct converging substitutes of empirical measures, known respectively as smoothed empirical measures and adapted empirical measures. However, both approaches have limitations. Specifically, smoothed empirical measures lack comprehensive convergence results, whereas adapted empirical measures in practical applications lead to fewer distinct samples compared to standard empirical measures.
  In this work, we address both of the aforementioned issues. First, we develop comprehensive convergence results of smoothed empirical measures. We then introduce a smoothed version for adapted empirical measures, which provide as many distinct samples as desired. We refer them as adapted smoothed empirical measures and establish their convergence in mean, deviation, and almost sure convergence. The convergence estimation incorporates two results: the empirical analysis of the smoothed adapted Wasserstein distance and its bandwidth effects. Both results are novel and their proof techniques could be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of high-frequency path functionals for diffusions with singular thresholds or boundaries, where the process exhibits either (i) skweness, oscillating coefficients, and stickiness, or (ii) sticky reflection. The functionals are constructed from a test function and a diverging normalizing sequence. We establish convergence to local time, generalizing existing results for these processes.
  Notably, our framework allows for any normalizing sequence diverging slower than the observation frequency and for thresholds that are jointly skew-oscillating-sticky (thresholds where stickiness, oscillations, and skewness occur). Combining our results with occupation time approximations, we develop consistent estimators for stickiness and skewness parameters at thresholds that exhibit any combination of these features (stickiness, oscillation, skewness, and reflection).</description>

      <title>The multivariate fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the notion of multivariate fractional Brownian Motion introduced in [F. Lavancier, A. Philippe, and D. Surgailis. Covariance function of vector self-similar processes. Statistics &amp; Probability Letters, 2009] we define a multivariate version of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This multivariate Gaussian process is stationary, ergodic and allows for different Hurst exponents on each component. We characterize its correlation matrix and its short and long time asymptotics. Besides the marginal parameters, the cross correlation between one-dimensional marginal components is ruled by two parameters. We consider the problem of their inference, proposing two types of estimator, constructed from discrete observations of the process. We establish their asymptotic theory, in one case in the long time asymptotic setting, in the other case in the infill and long time asymptotic setting. The limit behavior can be asymptotically Gaussian or non-Gaussian, depending on the values of the Hurst exponents of the marginal components. The technical core of the paper relies on the analysis of asymptotic properties of functionals of Gaussian processes, that we establish using Malliavin calculus and Stein's method. We provide numerical experiments that support our theoretical analysis and also suggest a conjecture on the application of one of these estimators to the multivariate fractional Brownian Motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the large deviation principle for a family of slow-fast systems perturbed by infinite-dimensional mixed fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in(\frac12,1)$. We adopt the weak convergence method which is based on the variational representation formula for infinite-dimensional mixed fractional Brownian motion. To obtain the weak convergence of the controlled systems, we apply the Khasminskii's averaging principle and the time discretization technique. In addition, we drop the boundedness assumption of the drift coefficients of the slow components and the diffusion coefficients of the fast components.Based on the proof of the large deviation principle, we also establish the moderate deviation principle for the slow-fast systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a class of line ensembles whose local structure is described by independent geometric random walk bridges, which have been conditioned to interlace with each other. The latter arise naturally in the context Schur processes, including their versions in a half-space and a finite interval with free or periodic boundary conditions. We show that under one-point tightness of the curves, these line ensembles are tight and any subsequential limit satisfies the Brownian Gibbs property. As an application of our tightness results, we show that sequences of spiked Schur processes, that were recently considered in arXiv:2408.08445, converge uniformly over compact sets to the Airy wanderer line ensembles.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of SPDEs with locally Lipschitz coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic partial differential equation, $\partial_t u = \tfrac12 \partial^2_x u + b(u) + \sigma(u) \dot{W},$ where $u=u(t\,,x)$ is defined for $(t\,,x)\in(0\,,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}$, and $\dot{W}$ denotes space-time white noise. We prove that this SPDE is well posed solely under the assumptions that the initial condition $u(0)$ is bounded and measurable, and $b$ and $\sigma$ are locally Lipschitz continuous functions and have at most linear growth. Our method is based on a truncation argument together with moment bounds and tail estimates of the truncated solution. The results naturally generalize to the case where $b$ and $\sigma$ are time dependent with uniform-in-time growth and oscillation properties. Additionally, our method can be extended to the stochastic wave equation.</description>

Abstract: We establish general quantitative conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive Wiener noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant probability measure for the associated exponentially ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the $e$-property of the semigroup. Furthermore, we provide quantitative upper bounds for the Wasserstein $\varepsilon$-mixing times. Examples on possibly unbounded domains include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15179v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A casino offers the following game. There are three cups each containing a die. You are being told that the dice in the cups are all the same, but possibly nonstandard. For a bet of \$1, the game master shakes all three cups and lets you choose one of them. You win \$2 if the die in your cup displays at least the average of the other two, and you lose otherwise. Is this game in your favor? If not, how should the casino design the dice to maximize their profit?
  This problem is a special case of the following more general question: given a measurable space $X$ and a bounded measurable function $f : X^n \to \R$, how large can the expectation of $f$ under probability measures of the form $\mu^{\otimes n}$ be? We develop a general method to answer this kind of question. As an example application that is harder than the casino problem, we show that the maximal probability of the event $X_1 + X_2 + X_3 &lt; 2 X_4$ for nonnegative iid random variables lies between $0.400695$ and $0.417$, where the upper bound is obtained by mixed integer linear programming. We conjecture the lower bound to be the exact value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1999, Benjamini, Lyons, Peres, and Schramm introduced a notion of weighted-amenability for transitive graphs that is equivalent to the amenability of its automorphism group. For unimodular graphs this notion coincides with classical graph-amenability and has been intensely studied. In the present work, we show that many classical unimodular results can be extended to the nonunimodular setting, which is further motivated by recent progress in the mcp (measure class preserving or quasi-pmp) setting of measured group theory. To this end, we prove new characterizations of weighted-amenability, in particular that it is equivalent to all finite unions of levels inducing amenable graphs. Hutchcroft conjectured that the latter property implies that $p_h&lt;p_u$, where $p_h$ is the critical probability for the regime where clusters of Bernoulli percolation are infinite total weight and $p_u$ is the uniqueness threshold. We prove a relaxed version of his conjecture \`a la Pak--Smirnova-Nagnibeda. Further characterizations are given in terms of the spectral radius and invariant spanning forests. One of the consequences is the continuity of the phase transition at $p_h$ for weighted-nonamenable graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06549v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Wigner minor process, i.e. the eigenvalues of an $N\times N$ Wigner matrix $H^{(N)}$ together with the eigenvalues of all its $n\times n$ minors, $H^{(n)}$, $n\le N$. The top eigenvalues of $H^{(N)}$ and those of its immediate minor $H^{(N-1)}$ are very strongly correlated, but this correlation becomes weaker for smaller minors $H^{(N-k)}$ as $k$ increases. For the GUE minor process the critical transition regime around $k\sim N^{2/3}$ was analyzed by Forrester and Nagao (J. Stat. Mech.: Theory and Experiment, 2011) providing an explicit formula for the nontrivial joint correlation function. We prove that this formula is universal, i.e. it holds for the Wigner minor process. Moreover, we give a complete analysis of the sub- and supercritical regimes both for eigenvalues and for the corresponding eigenvector overlaps, thus we prove the decorrelation transition in full generality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish variational principles for the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of a class of statistically self-affine sponges, including in particular fractal percolation sets obtained from Bara\'nski and Gatzouras-Lalley carpets and sponges. Our first step is to compute the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of non-degenerate inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures supported on the associated random limit sets. This is not a straightforward combination of the existing approaches for the deterministic inhomogeneous Bernoulli measures and the Mandelbrot measures on random Sierpi\'nski sponges; it reveals new structural features. The variational principles rely on a specific subclass of inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures, which are connected to localized digit frequencies in the underlying coding space. This connection makes it possible to construct effective coverings of the random limit set, leading to sharp upper bounds for its Hausdorff and packing dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega_1, \ldots, \Omega_m$ be probability spaces, let $\Omega=\Omega_1 \times \cdots \times \Omega_m$ be their product and let $A_1, \ldots, A_n \subset \Omega$ be events. Suppose that each event $A_i$ depends on $r_i$ coordinates of a point $x \in \Omega$, $x=\left(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m\right)$, and that for each event $A_i$ there are $\Delta_i$ of other events $A_j$ that depend on some of the coordinates that $A_i$ depends on. Let $\Delta=\max\{5,\ \Delta_i: i=1, \ldots, n\}$ and let $\mu_i=\min\{r_i,\ \Delta_i+1\}$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$. We prove that if $P(A_i) &lt; (3\Delta)^{-3\mu_i}$ for all $i$, then for any $0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1$, the probability $P\left( \bigcap_{i=1}^n \overline{A}_i\right)$ of the intersection of the complements of all $A_i$ can be computed within relative error $\epsilon$ in polynomial time from the probabilities $P\left(A_{i_1} \cap \ldots \cap A_{i_k}\right)$ of $k$-wise intersections of the events $A_i$ for $k = e^{O(\Delta)} \ln (n/\epsilon)$.</description>

      <title>The Directed Spanning Forest: coalescence versus dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $p\in[1,\infty]$, the $\ell^p$ directed spanning forest (DSF) of dimension $d\geq 2$ is an oriented random geometric graph whose vertex set is given by a homogeneous Poisson point process $\mathcal N$ on $\mathbb R^d$ and whose edges consist of all pairs $(x, y)\in\mathcal N^2$ such that $y$ is the closest point to $x$ in $\mathcal N$ for the $\ell^p$ distance among points with a strictly larger $e_d$ coordinate. First introduced by Baccelli and Bordenave in 2007 in the case $p=d=2$, this graph has a natural forest structure. In this work, we study the number of disjoint trees in the $\ell^p$ DSF for arbitrary dimensions $d\geq2$ and various values of $p\in [1,\infty]$. We prove that for $p\in\{1, 2,\infty\}$, the graph is almost surely a tree when $d=3$, and consists of infinitely many disjoint trees when $d\geq 4$. Additionally, we show that for all $p\in[1,\infty]$, the DSF in dimension $2$ is almost surely a tree and, under appropriate diffusive scaling, converges weakly to the Brownian web, generalizing the result previously known for p=2. Although these results were expected from a heuristic point of view, and the main strategies and tools were largely understood, extending them beyond the planar setting ($d=2$) and to the singular case $p=\infty$ presented a significant challenge. Notably, in the absence of planarity, which plays a crucial role in existing arguments, delicate and innovative techniques were required to manage the complex geometric dependencies of the model. We develop substantially new ideas to handle arbitrary dimension $d\geq2$ and various values of $p\in [1,\infty]$ within a unified framework. In particular, we introduce a novel stochastic domination argument that allows us to compare the fully dependent model with a simplified version in which the geometric correlations are suppressed.</description>

      <title>Extended UCB Policies for Multi-armed Bandit Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1768</link>
      <description>arXiv:1112.1768v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems are widely studied in fields of operations research, stochastic optimization, and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we consider the classical MAB model with heavy-tailed reward distributions and introduce the extended robust UCB policy, which is an extension of the results of Bubeck et al. [5] and Lattimore [22] that are further based on the pioneering idea of UCB policies [e.g. Auer et al. 3]. The previous UCB policies require some strict conditions on reward distributions, which can be difficult to guarantee in practical scenarios. Our extended robust UCB generalizes Lattimore's seminary work (for moments of orders $p=4$ and $q=2$) to arbitrarily chosen $p&gt;q&gt;1$ as long as the two moments have a known controlled relationship, while still achieving the optimal regret growth order $O(log T)$, thus providing a broadened application area of UCB policies for heavy-tailed reward distributions. Furthermore, we achieve a near-optimal regret order without any knowledge of the reward distributions as long as their $p$-th moments exist for some $p&gt;1$. Finally, we briefly present our earlier work on light-tailed reward distributions for a complete illustration of the amazing simplicity and power of UCB policies.</description>

      <title>Optimal investment with insider information using Skorokhod &amp; Russo-Vallois integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07471v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the maximization of the logarithmic utility for an insider with different anticipating techniques. Our aim is to compare the utilization of Russo-Vallois forward and Skorokhod integrals in this context. Theoretical analysis and illustrative numerical examples showcase that the Skorokhod insider outperforms the forward insider. This remarkable observation stands in contrast to the scenario involving risk-neutral traders. Furthermore, an ordinary trader could surpass both insiders if a significant negative fluctuation in the driving stochastic process leads to a sufficiently negative final value. These findings underline the intricate interplay between anticipating stochastic calculus and nonlinear utilities, which may yield non-intuitive results from the financial viewpoint.</description>

      <title>A martingale approach to noncommutative stochastic calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to noncommutative stochastic calculus that is, like the classical theory, based primarily on the martingale property. Using this approach, we introduce a general theory of stochastic integration and quadratic (co)variation for a certain class of noncommutative processes, analogous to semimartingales, that includes both the $q$-Brownian motions and classical matrix-valued Brownian motions. As applications, we obtain Burkholder--Davis--Gundy inequalities (with $p \geq 2$) for continuous-time noncommutative martingales and a noncommutative It\^{o}'s formula for "adapted $C^2$ maps," including trace $\ast$-polynomial maps and operator functions associated to the noncommutative $C^2$ scalar functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ introduced by Nikitopoulos, as well as the more general multivariate tracial noncommutative $C^2$ functions introduced by Jekel, Li, and Shlyakhtenko.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the quantitative estimates of propagation of chaos for the large interacting particle systems in terms of the relative entropy between the joint law of the particles and the tensorized law of the mean field PDE. We resolve this problem for the first time for the viscous vortex model that approximates 2D Navier-Stokes equation in the vorticity formulation on the whole space. We obtain as key tools the Li-Yau-type estimates and Hamilton-type heat kernel estimates for 2D Navier-Stokes in the whole space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt Stein's method to obtain Berry--Esseen type error bounds in the multivariate central limit theorem for non-stationary processes generated by time-dependent compositions of uniformly expanding dynamical systems. In a particular case of random dynamical systems with a strongly mixing base transformation, we derive an error estimate of order $O(N^{-1/2})$ in the quenched multivariate CLT, provided that the covariance matrix "grows linearly" with the number of summands $N$. The error in the normal approximation is estimated for the class of all convex sets.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative chaos measure for multiplicative functions: the $L^1$-regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10555v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ be a Steinhaus random multiplicative function. For a wide class of multiplicative functions $f$ we construct a multiplicative chaos measure arising from the Dirichlet series of $\alpha f$, in the whole $L^1$-regime. Our method does not rely on the thick point approach or Gaussian approximation, and uses a modified second moment method with the help of an approximate Girsanov theorem. We also employ the idea of weak convergence in $L^r$ to show that the limiting measure is independent of the choice of the approximation schemes, and this may be seen as a non-Gaussian analogue of Shamov's characterisation of multiplicative chaos.
  Our class of $f$-s consists of those for which the mean value of $|f(p)|^2$ lies in $(0,1)$. In particular, it includes the indicator of sums of two squares. As an application of our construction, we establish a generalised central limit theorem for the (normalised) sums of $\alpha f$, with random variance determined by the total mass of our measure.</description>

      <title>Accelerated first-passage dynamics in a non-Markovian feedback Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the first-passage dynamics of a non-Markovian stochastic process with time-averaged feedback, which we model as a one-dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process wherein the particle drift is modified by the empirical mean of its trajectory. This process maps onto a class of self-interacting diffusions. Using weak-noise large deviation theory, we calculate the leading order asymptotics of the time-dependent distribution of the particle position, derive the most probable paths that reach the specified position at a given time and quantify their likelihood via the action functional. We compute the feedback-modified Kramers rate and its inverse, which approximates the mean first-passage time, and show that the feedback accelerates dynamics by storing finite-time fluctuations, thereby lowering the effective energy barrier and shifting the optimal first-passage time from infinite to finite. Although we identify alternative mechanisms, such as slingshot and ballistic trajectories, we find that they remain sub-optimal and hence do not accelerate the dynamics. These results show how memory feedback reshapes rare event statistics, thereby offering a mechanism to potentially control first-passage dynamics.</description>

      <title>Markov dualities via the spectral decompositions of the two Markov generators in their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of Markov duality between two Markov processes that can live in two different configurations spaces $(x,{\tilde x})$ is revisited via the spectral decompositions of the two Markov generators in their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors. In this formulation, the two generators should have the same eigenvalues $(-E)$ that may be complex, while the duality function $\Omega(x,{\tilde x})$ can be considered as a mapping between the right and the left eigenvectors of the two models. We describe how this spectral perspective is useful to better understand two well-known dualities between processes defined in the same configuration space: the Time-Reversal duality corresponds to an exchange between the right and the left eigenvectors that involves the steady state, while in the Siegmund duality, the left eigenvectors correspond to integrals of the dual right eigenvectors. We then focus on the famous Moment-Duality between the Wright-Fisher diffusion on the interval $x \in [0,1] $ and the Kingman Markov jump process on the semi-infinite lattice $n \in {\mathbb N}$ in order to analyze the relations between their eigenvectors living in two different configuration spaces. Finally, we discuss how the spectral perspective can be used to construct new dualities and we give an example for the case of non-degenerate real eigenvalues, where one can always construct a dual Directed Jump process on the semi-infinite lattice $n \in {\mathbb N}$, whose transitions rates are the opposite-eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>How to simulate L\'evy flights in a steep potential: An explicit splitting numerical scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an effective explicit numerical scheme for simulating solutions of stochastic differential equations with confining superlinear drift terms, driven by multiplicative heavy-tailed L\'evy noise. The scheme is designed to prevent explosion and accurately capture all finite moments of the solutions.
  In the purely Gaussian case, it correctly reproduces moments of sub-Gaussian tails of the solutions.
  This method is particularly well-suited for approximating statistical moments and other probabilistic characteristics of L\'evy flights in steep potential landscapes.</description>

      <title>On the limiting distribution of sums of random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the limiting distribution of $\frac{{(\log \log x)}^{1/4}}{\sqrt{x}} \sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)$ where $\alpha$ is a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, answering a question of Harper. The distributional convergence is proved by applying the martingale central limit theorem to a suitably truncated sum. This truncation is inspired by work of Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu on subcritical holomorphic multiplicative chaos setting, but analysed with a different conditioning argument generalised from Harper's work on fractional moments to circumvent integrability issues at criticality.
  A significant part of the proof is devoted to the convergence in probability of the associated partial Euler product to a critical multiplicative chaos measure, independent of the mild shift away from the critical line. Our approach to the universality of critical non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos bypasses the barrier analysis with the help of a modified second moment method, and employs a novel argument based on coupling and homogenisation by change of measure, which could be of independent interest.</description>
