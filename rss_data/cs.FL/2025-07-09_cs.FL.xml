      <title>Stochastic Alignments: Matching an Observed Trace to Stochastic Process Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process mining leverages event data extracted from IT systems to generate insights into the business processes of organizations. Such insights benefit from explicitly considering the frequency of behavior in business processes, which is captured by stochastic process models. Given an observed trace and a stochastic process model, conventional alignment-based conformance checking techniques face a fundamental limitation: They prioritize matching the trace to a model path with minimal deviations, which may, however, lead to selecting an unlikely path. In this paper, we study the problem of matching an observed trace to a stochastic process model by identifying a likely model path with a low edit distance to the trace. We phrase this as an optimization problem and develop a heuristic-guided path-finding algorithm to solve it. Our open-source implementation demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and shows that it can provide new, useful diagnostic insights for analysts.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Power of Particle Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10286v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the computational power of particle methods, a well-established class of algorit hms with applications in scientific computing and computer simulation. The computational power of a compute model determines the class of problems it can solve. Automata theory allows describing the computational power of abstract machines (automata) and the problems they can solve. At the top of the Chomsky hierarchy of formal languages and grammars are Turing machines, which resemble the concept on which most modern computers are built. Although particle methods can be interpreted as automata based on their formal definition, their computational power has so far not been studied. We address this by analyzing Turing completeness of particle methods. In particular, we prove two sets of restrictions under which a particle method is still Turing powerful, and we show when it loses Turing powerfulness. This contributes to understanding the theoretical foundations of particle methods and provides insight into the powerfulness of computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Normal Forms for Elements of ${}^*$-Continuous Kleene Algebras Representing the Context-Free Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17295v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the tensor product $K \mathop{\otimes_{\cal R}} C_2'$ of any ${}^*$-continuous Kleene algebra $K$ with the polycyclic ${}^*$-continuous Kleene algebra $C_2'$ over two bracket pairs there is a copy of the fixed-point closure of $K$: the centralizer of $C_2'$ in $K \mathop{\otimes_{\cal R}} C_2'$. Using an automata-theoretic representation of elements of $K\mathop{\otimes_{\cal R}} C_2'$ \`a la Kleene, with the aid of normal form theorems that restrict the occurrences of brackets on paths through the automata, we develop a foundation for a calculus of context-free expressions without variable binders. We also give some results on the bra-ket ${}^*$-continuous Kleene algebra $C_2$, motivate the ``completeness equation'' that distinguishes $C_2$ from $C_2'$, and show that $C_2'$ already validates a relativized form of this equation.</description>

      <title>Can adversarial attacks by large language models be attributed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attributing outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) in adversarial settings-such as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns-presents significant challenges that are likely to grow in importance. We approach this attribution problem from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective, drawing on formal language theory (identification in the limit) and data-driven analysis of the expanding LLM ecosystem. By modeling an LLM's set of possible outputs as a formal language, we analyze whether finite samples of text can uniquely pinpoint the originating model. Our results show that, under mild assumptions of overlapping capabilities among models, certain classes of LLMs are fundamentally non-identifiable from their outputs alone. We delineate four regimes of theoretical identifiability: (1) an infinite class of deterministic (discrete) LLM languages is not identifiable (Gold's classical result from 1967); (2) an infinite class of probabilistic LLMs is also not identifiable (by extension of the deterministic case); (3) a finite class of deterministic LLMs is identifiable (consistent with Angluin's tell-tale criterion); and (4) even a finite class of probabilistic LLMs can be non-identifiable (we provide a new counterexample establishing this negative result). Complementing these theoretical insights, we quantify the explosion in the number of plausible model origins (hypothesis space) for a given output in recent years. Even under conservative assumptions-each open-source model fine-tuned on at most one new dataset-the count of distinct candidate models doubles approximately every 0.5 years, and allowing multi-dataset fine-tuning combinations yields doubling times as short as 0.28 years. This combinatorial growth, alongside the extraordinary computational cost of brute-force likelihood attribution across all models and potential users, renders exhaustive attribution infeasible in practice.</description>
