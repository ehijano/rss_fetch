      <title>RIGEL: Simulating dwarf galaxies at solar mass resolution with radiative transfer and feedback from individual massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the RIGEL model, a novel framework to self-consistently model the effects of stellar feedback in the multiphase ISM of dwarf galaxies with radiative transfer (RT) on a star-by-star basis. The RIGEL model integrates detailed implementations of feedback from individual massive stars into the RHD code, AREPO-RT. It forms individual massive stars from the resolved multiphase ISM by sampling the IMF and tracks their evolution individually. The lifetimes, photon production rates, mass-loss rates, and wind velocities of these stars are determined by their initial masses and metallicities based on a library that incorporates a variety of stellar models. The RT equations are solved in seven spectral bins accounting for the IR to HeII ionizing bands, using an M1 RT scheme. The thermochemistry model tracks the non-equilibrium H, He chemistry and the equilibrium abundance of CI, CII, OI, OII, and CO to capture the thermodynamics of all ISM phases. We evaluate the performance of the RIGEL model using $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ resolution simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies. We found that the SFR and ISRF show strong positive correlations to the metallicity of the galaxy. Photoionization and photoheating can reduce the SFR by an order of magnitude by removing the available cold-dense gas fuel for star formation. The ISRF also changes the thermal structure of the ISM. Radiative feedback occurs immediately after the birth of massive stars and rapidly disperses the molecular clouds within 1 Myr. As a consequence, radiative feedback reduces the age spread of star clusters to less than 2 Myr, prohibits the formation of massive star clusters, and shapes the cluster initial mass function to a steep power-law form with a slope of $\sim-2$. The mass-loading factor of the fiducial galaxy has a median of $\sim50$, while turning off radiative feedback reduces this factor by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A calibrated model for N-body dynamical friction acting on supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes are believed to be crucial in regulating star formation in massive galaxies, which makes it essential to faithfully represent the physics of these objects in cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. Limited spatial and mass resolution and the associated discreteness noise make following the dynamics of black holes especially challenging. In particular, dynamical friction, which is responsible for driving massive black holes towards the centres of galaxies, cannot be accurately modelled with softened $N$-body interactions. A number of subgrid models have been proposed to mimic dynamical friction or directly include its full effects in simulations. Each of these methods has its individual benefits and shortcomings, while all suffer from a common issue of being unable to represent black holes with masses below a few times the simulated dark matter particle mass. In this paper, we propose a correction for unresolved dynamical friction, which has been calibrated on simulations run with the code KETJU, in which gravitational interactions of black holes are not softened. We demonstrate that our correction is able to sink black holes with masses greater than the dark matter particle mass at the correct rate. We show that the impact of stochasticity is significant for low-mass black holes ($M_{\rm BH} \leq 5 M_{\rm DM}$) and propose a correction for stochastic heating. Combined, this approach is applicable to next generation cosmological hydrodynamics simulations that jointly track galaxy and black hole growth with realistic black hole orbits.</description>

      <title>Towards an observationally motivated AGN dusty torus model. I. Dust chemical composition from the modeling of Spitzer spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is one of most commonly used techniques to study the dust properties in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Works implementing this technique commonly use radiative transfer models that assume a variety of dust properties. Despite the key role of this aspect, limited effort has been put forward to explore the chemical composition, the role of different optical properties, and the grain size distribution of dust, all of which can have a substantial impact on the theoretical radiative transfer calculations. In this work, we explore the role of the dust chemical composition in the AGN dusty torus through SED fitting to \emph{Spitzer}/IRS spectra of a sample of 49 nearby AGN with silicate features in emission. We implement a mineralogy model including the popular astronomical silicates and a set of oxides and amorphous silicates with different grain sizes. We find that best fits use principally porous alumina, periclase, and olivine. In terms of mass fractions, $\sim99\%$ of the dust is composed of dust grains of size $\rm{0.1 \mu m}$, with a $&lt;1\%$ contribution from $\rm{3 \mu m}$ grains. Moreover, the astronomical silicates have a very low occurrence in the best fits, suggesting that they are not the most suited dust species to reproduce the silicate features in our sample.</description>

      <title>The ratio of [Eu/$\alpha$] differentiates accreted/in-situ Milky Way stars across metallicities, as indicated by both field stars and globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine stellar orbits with the abundances of the heavy, $r$-process element europium and the light, $\alpha$-element, silicon to separate in-situ and accreted populations in the Milky Way across all metallicities. At high orbital energy, the accretion-dominated halo shows elevated values of [Eu/Si], while at lower energies, where many of the stars were born in-situ, the levels of [Eu/Si] are lower. These systematically different levels of [Eu/Si] in the MW and the accreted halo imply that the scatter in [Eu/$\alpha$] within a single galaxy is smaller than previously thought. At the lowest metallicities, we find that both accreted and in-situ populations trend down in [Eu/Si], consistent with enrichment via neutron star mergers. Through compiling a large dataset of abundances for 46 globular clusters (GCs), we show that differences in [Eu/Si] extend to populations of in-situ/accreted GCs. We interpret this consistency as evidence that in $r$-process elements, GCs trace the star formation history of their hosts, motivating their use as sub-Gyr timers of galactic evolution. Furthermore, fitting the trends in [Eu/Si] using a simple galactic chemical evolution model, we find that differences in [Eu/Si] between accreted and in-situ MW field stars cannot be explained through star formation efficiency alone. Finally, we show that the use of [Eu/Si] as a chemical tag between GCs and their host galaxies extends beyond the Local Group, to the halo of M31 - potentially offering the opportunity to do Galactic Archaeology in an external galaxy.</description>

      <title>Discovery of $\sim$2200 new supernova remnants in 19 nearby star-forming galaxies with MUSE spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the largest extragalactic survey of supernova remnant (SNR) candidates in nearby star-forming galaxies using exquisite spectroscopic maps from MUSE. Supernova remnants exhibit distinctive emission-line ratios and kinematic signatures, which are apparent in optical spectroscopy. Using optical integral field spectra from the PHANGS-MUSE project, we identify SNRs in 19 nearby galaxies at ~ 100~pc scales. We use five different optical diagnostics: (1) line ratio maps of [SII]/H$\alpha$; (2) line ratio maps of [OI]/H$\alpha$; (3) velocity dispersion map of the gas; (4) and (5) two line ratio diagnostic diagrams from BPT diagrams to identify and distinguish SNRs from other nebulae. Given that our SNRs are seen in projection against HII regions and diffuse ionized gas, in our line ratio maps we use a novel technique to search for objects with [SII]/H$\alpha$ or [OI]/H$\alpha$ in excess of what is expected at fixed H$\alpha$ surface brightness within photoionized gas. In total, we identify 2,233 objects using at least one of our diagnostics, and define a subsample of 1,166 high-confidence SNRs that have been detected with at least two diagnostics. The line ratios of these SNRs agree well with the MAPPINGS shock models, and we validate our technique using the well-studied nearby galaxy M83, where all SNRs we found are also identified in literature catalogs and we recover 51% of the known SNRs. The remaining 1,067 objects in our sample are detected with only one diagnostic and we classify them as SNR candidates. We find that ~ 35% of all our objects overlap with the boundaries of HII regions from literature catalogs, highlighting the importance of using indicators beyond line intensity morphology to select SNRs. [OI]/H$\alpha$ line ratio is responsible for selecting the most objects (1,368; 61%), (abridged).</description>

      <title>Comparing bulge RR Lyrae stars with bulge giants -- Insight from 3D kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure and kinematics of the old component of the Galactic bulge are still a matter of debate. The bulk of the bulge as traced by red clump stars includes two main components, which are usually identified as the metal-rich and metal-poor components. They have different shapes, kinematics, mean metallicities, and alpha-element abundances. It is our current understanding that they are associated with a bar and a spheroid, respectively. On the other hand, RR Lyrae variables trace the oldest population of the bulge. While it would be natural to think that they follow the structure and kinematics of the metal-poor component, the data analysed in the literature show conflicting results. We aim to derive a rotation curve for bulge RR Lyrae stars in order to determine that the old component traced by these stars is distinct from the two main components observed in the Galactic bulge. This paper combines APOGEE-2S spectra with OGLE-IV light curves, near-IR photometry, and proper motions from the VISTA Variables in the V\'i a L\' actea survey for 4197 RR Lyrae stars. Six-dimensional phase-space coordinates were used to calculate orbits within an updated Galactic potential and to isolate the stars. The stars that stay confined within the bulge represent 57% of our sample. Our results show that bulge RR Lyrae variables rotate more slowly than metal-rich red clump stars and have a lower velocity dispersion. Their kinematics is compatible with them being the low-metallicity tail of the metal-poor component. We confirm that a rather large fraction of halo RR Lyrae stars pass by the bulge within their orbits, increasing the velocity dispersion. A proper orbital analysis is therefore critical to isolate bona fide bulge variables. Finally, bulge RR Lyrae seem to trace a spheroidal component, although the current data do now allow us to reach a firm conclusion about the spatial distribution.</description>

      <title>A temperature or FUV tracer? The HNC/HCN ratio in M83 on the GMC scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HNC/HCN ratio is observationally known as a thermometer in Galactic interstellar molecular clouds. A recent study has alternatively suggested that the HNC/HCN ratio is affected by the ultraviolet (UV) field, not by the temperature. We aim to study this ratio on the scale of giant molecular clouds in the barred spiral galaxy M83 towards the southwestern bar end and the central region from ALMA observations, and if possible, distinguish the above scenarios. We compare the high (40-50 pc) resolution HNC/HCN ratios with the star formation rate from the 3-mm continuum intensity and the molecular mass inferred from the HCN intensities. Our results show that the HNC/HCN ratios do not vary with the star formation rates, star formation efficiencies, or column densities in the bar-end region. In the central region, the HNC/HCN ratios become higher with higher star formation rates, which tend to cause higher temperatures. This result is not consistent with the previously proposed scenario in which the HNC/HCN ratio decreases with increasing temperature. Spectral shapes suggest that this trend may be due to optically thick HCN and optically thin HNC. In addition, we compare the large-scale ($\sim 200$ pc) correlation between the dust temperature from the FIR ratio and the HNC/HCN ratio for the southwestern bar-end region. The HNC/HCN ratio is lower when the dust temperatures are higher. We suggest from the above results that the HNC/HCN ratio depends on the UV radiation field that affects the interstellar medium on the $\sim100\,$pc scale where the column densities are low.</description>

      <title>The equation and solution of 4-point correlation function of galaxies in Gaussian approximation and its parity-odd part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting with the density field equation of a self-gravity fluid
  in a static Universe, using the Schwinger functional differentiation technique, we derive the field equation of the 4-point correlation function (4PCF) of galaxies in the Gaussian approximation, which contains hierarchically 2PCF and 3PCF. By use of the known solutions of 2PCF and 3PCF, the equation of 4PCF becomes an inhomogeneous, Helmholtz equation, and contains only two physical parameters: the mass $m$ of galaxy and the Jeans wavenumber $k_J$, like the equations of the 2PCF and 3PCF. We obtain the analytical solution of 4PCF that consists of four portions, $\eta= \eta^0_{odd} + \eta^0_{even} +\eta^{FP} +\eta^I$, and has a very rich structure. $\eta^0_{odd}$ and $\eta^0_{even}$ form the homogeneous solution and depend on boundary conditions. The parity-odd $\eta^0_{odd}$ is more interesting and qualitatively explains the observed parity-odd data of BOSS CMASS, the parity-even $\eta^0_{even}$ contains the disconnected 4PCF $\eta^{disc}$ (arising from a Gaussian random process), and both $\eta^0_{odd}$ and $\eta^0_{even}$ are prominent at large scales $r\gtrsim 10$Mpc, and exhibit radial oscillations determined by the Jeans wavenumber. $\eta^{FP}$ and $ \eta^I$ are parity-even, and form the inhomogeneous solution. $\eta^{FP}$ is the same as the Fry-Peebles ansatz for 4PCF, and dominates at small scales $r \lesssim 10$Mpc. $\eta^I$ is an integration of the inhomogeneous term, subdominant. We also compare the parity-even 4PCF with the observation data.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Galaxies at the Extremes: A Kinematic Analysis of the Virgo Cluster Dwarfs VCC 9 and VCC 1448 using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved Keck Cosmic Web Imager stellar spectroscopy of the Virgo cluster dwarf galaxies VCC 9 and VCC 1448. These galaxies have similar stellar masses and large half-light radii but very different globular cluster (GC) system richness ($\sim$25 vs. $\sim$99 GCs). Using the KCWI data, we spectroscopically confirm 10 GCs associated with VCC 1448 and one GC associated with VCC 9. We make two measurements of dynamical mass for VCC 1448 based on the stellar and GC velocities respectively. VCC 1448's mass measurements suggest that it resides in a halo in better agreement with the expectation of the stellar mass -- halo mass relationship than the expectation from its large GC counts. For VCC 9, the dynamical mass we measure agrees with the expected halo mass from both relationships. We compare VCC 1448 and VCC 9 to the GC-rich galaxy Dragonfly 44 ($\sim74$ GCs), which is similar in size but has $\sim 1$ dex less stellar mass than either Virgo galaxy. In dynamical mass -- GC number space, Dragonfly 44 and VCC 1448 exhibit richer GC systems given their dynamical mass than that of VCC 9 and other `normal' galaxies. We also place the galaxies in kinematics -- ellipticity space finding evidence of an anticorrelation between rotational support and the fraction of a galaxy's stellar mass in its GC system. i.e., VCC 9 is more rotationally supported than VCC 1448, which is more rotationally supported than Dragonfly 44. This trend may be expected if a galaxy's GC content depends on its natal gas properties at formation.</description>

      <title>A Catalogue and Analysis of Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy Spectroscopic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to help facilitate the future study of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) we compile a catalogue of their spectroscopic properties. Using it, we investigate some of the biases inherent in the current UDG sample that have been targeted for spectroscopy. In comparison to a larger sample of UDGs studied via their spectral energy distributions (SED), current spectroscopic targets are intrinsically brighter, have higher stellar mass, are larger, more globular cluster-rich, older, and have a wider spread in their metallicities. In particular, many spectroscopically studied UDGs have a significant fraction of their stellar mass contained within their globular cluster (GC) system. We also search for correlations between parameters in the catalogue. Of note is a correlation between alpha element abundance and metallicity as may be expected for a `failed galaxy' scenario. However, the expected correlations of metallicity with age are not found and it is unclear if this is evidence against a `failed galaxy' scenario or simply due to the low number statistics and the presence of outliers. Finally, we attempt to segment our catalogue into different classes using a machine learning K-means method. We find that the clustering is very weak and that it is currently not warranted to split the catalogue into multiple, distinct sub-populations. Our catalogue is available online and we aim to maintain it beyond the publication of this work.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the development and commissioning of a new Q-band receiver for the Nobeyama 45-m telescope, covering 30--50 GHz with a receiver noise temperature of about 15 K. We name it eQ (extended Q-band) receiver. The system noise temperatures for observations are measured to be $\sim$ 30 K at 33 GHz and $\sim$ 75 K at 45 GHz. The Half-Power-Beam-Width (HPBW) is around 38\arcsec at 43 GHz. To enhance the observation capability, we tested the smoothed bandpass calibration technique and demonstrated the observation time can be significantly reduced compared to the standard position switch technique. The wide-bandwidth capability of this receiver provides precise determination of rest frequencies for molecular transitions with an accuracy of a few kHz through simultaneous observations of multiple transitions. Particularly, we determined the rest frequency of SO ($J_N$ = $1_0$--$0_1$) to be 30.001542 GHz, along with the rest frequency of CCS ($J_N$ = $4_3$--$3_2$) being 45.379033 GHz, adopting CCS ($J_N$ = $3_2$--$2_1$) at 33.751370 GHz as a reference line. The SO profile shows a double peak shape at the Cyanopolyyne Peak (CP) position of the Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1). The SO peaks coincide well with the CCS sub-components located near the outer parts of the TMC-1 filament. We interpret that the gravitational infall of TMC-1 generates shocks which enhance the SO abundance. The TMC-1 map shows that carbon-chain molecules are more abundant in the southern part of the filament, whereas SO is more abundant in the northern part. The eQ's excellent sensitivity allowed us to detect faint CO ($J$ = 1--0) spectra from the high-redshift object at a redshift of 2.442. Our receiver is expected to open new avenues for high-sensitivity molecular line observations in the Q-band.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALMA's high-resolution images allow to resolve the filamentary structure of the ISM down to few thousand au at kpc distances. We aim to systematically quantify the impact of the interferometric response and the effects of the short-spacing information during the characterization of the ISM structure using ALMA observations. We create a series of continuum ALMA synthetic observations to test the recovery of the observational properties of dense cores and filaments (i.e. intensity peak, radial profile, and width) at different scales. We compare the results obtained with and without different data combination techniques using different ALMA arrays and SD telescopes in simulated data and real observations. Our analysis illustrates the severity of interferometric filtering effects. ALMA-12m alone observations show significant scale-dependent flux losses systematically corrupting (&gt;30%error) all the physical properties inferred in cores and filaments (i.e. column density, mass, and size) before the maximum recoverable scale of the interferometer. These effects are only partially mitigated by the addition of the ALMA ACA-7m array although degrading the telescope PSF. Our results demonstrate only the addition of the ALMA Total Power information allows to recover the true sky emission down to few times the ALMA beamsize with satisfactory accuracy (&lt;10% error). Additional tests demonstrate the emission recovery at all scales is further improved if the 7mTP data are replaced by maps obtained by a larger SD telescope (e.g., IRAM-30m), even if the latter are noisier than expected. These observational biases particularly affect partially resolved targets, becoming critical especially for studies in nearby regions such as Taurus or Orion. Our results demonstrate the need for the use of data combination techniques to accurately characterize the complex physical structure of the ISM in the ALMA era.</description>

      <title>Probing the broad line region geometry and size of the gravitationally lensed quasar Q2237+0305 with microlensing time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lensed quasars are powerful cosmic laboratories; they are used to simultaneously probe various astrophysical phenomena. Microlensing by stars within distant galaxies acts as strong gravitational lenses of multiply imaged quasars, and provides a unique and direct measurement of the lensed quasar internal structure. Microlensing of the continuum emitting region as well as the broad-line region (BLR) is well characterized by four observable indices, $\mu^{cont}$, $\mu^{BLR}$, $WCI$ (wing-core), and $RBI$ (red-blue), measured directly from the spectra. During the 2004-2007 monitoring period, image A of the quadruply lensed system Q2237+0305 underwent a strong microlensing amplification, while image D remained unaffected. We used 35 epochs of archival spectrophotometric data of Q2237+0305 obtained with the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory to develop an independent microlensing method for estimating the geometry and size of the BLR. We measured the index time series for the CIV line and the continuum emission at $1450\,\unicode{x212B}$. We built a library of the simulated microlensing index time series that reproduce the observed times series based on three representative BLR models: Keplerian disk (KD), polar wind (PW), and equatorial wind (EW). After sampling the model parameter space, we find that KD is the predominant model, while PW and EW are less likely. We infer that the system is viewed at an intermediate viewing angle $i\sim 35^\circ$, and we estimate the most likely CIV BLR half-light radius $r_\mathrm{1/2}=51\pm 23$ light days. Our results are in good agreement with previous findings in the literature and extend the validity of the index-based approach to a temporal domain.</description>

      <title>3D-DASH: The Evolution of Size, Shape, and Intrinsic Scatter in Populations of Young and Old Quiescent Galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the growth of the quiescent galaxy population between 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 by tracing the number density and structural evolution of a sample of 4518 old and 583 young quiescent galaxies with log($M_*$/$M_{\odot}$)&gt;10.4, selected from the COSMOS2020 catalog with complementary HST/F160W imaging from the 3D-DASH survey. Among the quiescent population at z$\sim$2, roughly 50% are recently quenched galaxies; these young quiescent galaxies become increasingly rare towards lower redshift, supporting the idea that the peak epoch of massive galaxy quenching occurred at z&gt;2. Our data show that while the effective half-light radii of quiescent galaxies generally increases with time, young quiescent galaxies are significantly smaller than their older counterparts at the same redshift. In this work we investigate the connection between this size difference and other structural properties, including axis ratios, color gradients, stellar mass, and the intrinsic scatter in effective radii. We demonstrate that the size difference is driven by the most massive sub-population (log($M_*$/$M_{\odot}$)&gt;11) and does not persist when restricting the sample to intermediate mass galaxies (10.4&lt;log($M_*$/$M_{\odot}$)&lt;11). Interestingly, the intrinsic scatter in physical size shows a strong co-evolution over the investigated time period and peaks around z$\sim$2 for both populations, only diverging at z &lt; 1. Taken together, and assuming we are not missing a significant population of lower surface brightness galaxies, while the formation and quenching mechanisms that dominate at higher redshifts yield compact remnants, multiple evolutionary pathways may explain the diverse morphologies of galaxies that quench at z&lt;1.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Low-Mass End of the Black Hole Mass Function and the Active Fraction of the Intermediate-mass Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the black hole mass function (BHMF) and the Eddington ratio distribution function (ERDF), focusing on the intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses down to $M_{\bullet}\sim10^4 M_\odot$. Based on the AGNs with a detected broad H$\alpha$ emission line, we construct a sample of 14,242 AGNs at redshift $z&lt;0.35$, including 243 IMBHs with $M_{\bullet}&lt;10^6 M_\odot$. By jointly modeling the BHMF and ERDF via the maximum posterior estimation, we find that the BHMF peaks at $\sim$$10^{6} M_\odot$ and exhibits a relatively constant value of $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}\,dex^{-1}}$ at the low-mass end. By comparing the derived BHMF of type 1 AGNs with the galaxy mass function based on the updated black hole mass - host galaxy stellar mass relation, we derive the active fraction. We also determine the active fraction for all AGNs using the upper and lower limit of the type 1 fraction. The active fraction decreases from 15%-40% for massive galaxies ($M_\star&gt;10^{10} M_\odot$) to lower than $\sim$2% for dwarf galaxies with $M_\star\sim10^8 M_\odot$. These results suggest that the black hole occupation fraction is expected to be $\sim$50% for low-mass galaxies ($M_\star\sim10^{8.5} M_\odot$-$10^9 M_\odot$) if the duty cycle is similar between intermediate mass and supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Size and kinematics of the CIV broad emission line region from microlensing-induced line profile distortions in two gravitationally lensed quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed the CIV line profile distortions due to microlensing in two quasars, J1339 and J1138. J1339 shows a strong, asymmetric line profile deformation, while J1138 shows a more modest, symmetric deformation. To probe the CIV broad line region (BLR), we compared the observed line profile deformations to simulated ones. The simulations are based on three simple BLR models, a Keplerian disk (KD), an equatorial wind (EW), and a polar wind (PW), of various sizes, inclinations, and emissivities. We find that the line profile deformations can be reproduced with the simple BLR models under consideration, with no need for more complex geometries or kinematics. The models with disk geometries (KD and EW) are preferred, while the PW model is definitely less likely. For J1339, we find the CIV BLR half-light radii to be $r_{1/2} =$ 5.1 $^{+4.6}_{-2.9}$ light-days and $r_{1/2} =$ 6.7 $^{+6.0}_{-3.8}$ light-days from spectra obtained in 2014 and 2017, respectively. They do agree within uncertainties. For J1138, the amplitude of microlensing is smaller and more dependent on the macro-magnification factor. From spectra obtained in 2005 (single epoch), we find $r_{1/2} =$ 4.9 $^{+4.9}_{-2.7}$ light-days and $r_{1/2}= $ 12 $^{+13}_{-8}$ light-days for two extreme values of the macro-magnification factor. Combining these new measurements with those previously obtained for the quasars Q2237$+$0305 and J1004$+$4112, we show that the BLR radii estimated from microlensing do follow the CIV radius--luminosity relation obtained from reverberation mapping, although the microlensing radii seem to be systematically smaller, which could indicate either a selection bias or a real offset (abridged).</description>

      <title>Active Galactic Nuclei and STaR fOrmation in Nearby Galaxies (AGNSTRONG). I. Sample and Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce our project, AGNSTRONG (Active Galactic Nuclei and STaR fOrmation in Nearby Galaxies). Our research goals encompass investigating the kinematic properties of ionized and molecular gas outflows, understanding the impact of AGN feedback, and exploring the coevolution dynamics between AGN strength activity and star formation activity. We aim to conduct a thorough analysis to determine whether there is an increase or suppression in SFRs among targets with and without powerful relativistic jets. Our sample consists of 35 nearby AGNs with and without powerful relativistic jet detections. Utilizing sub-millimeter (sub-mm) continuum observations at 450 {\mu}m and 850 {\mu}m from SCUBA-2 at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, we determine star-formation rates (SFRs) for our sources using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting models. Additionally, we employ high-quality, spatially resolved spectra from UV-optical to near-infrared bands obtained with the Double Spectrograph and Triple Spectrograph mounted on the 200-inch Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory to study their multiphase gas outflow properties. This paper presents an overview of our sample selection methodology, research strategy, and initial results of our project. We find that the SFRs determined without including the sub-mm data in the SED fitting are overestimated by approximately 0.08 dex compared to those estimated with the inclusion of sub-mm data. Additionally, we compare the estimated SFRs in our work with those traced by the 4000{\AA} break, as provided by the MPA-JHU catalog. We find that our determined SFRs are systematically higher than those traced by the 4000{\AA} break. Finally, we outline our future research plans.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent modelling of the Milky Way structure using live potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To advance our understanding of the evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy, numerical models of Milky Way (MW) type galaxies are widely used. However, most models only vaguely resemble the MW (e.g. in total mass), and often use imposed analytic potentials (which cannot evolve dynamically). This poses a problem in asserting their applicability for the interpretation of observations of our own Galaxy. The goal of this work is to identify a numerical model that is not only a MW-type galaxy, but one that can mimic some of the main observed structures of our Galaxy, using dynamically evolving potentials, so that it can be used as a base model to study the ISM cycle in a galaxy like our own. This paper introduces a suite of 15 MW-type galaxy models developed using the {\sc arepo} numerical code, that are compared to Galactic observations of $^{12}$CO and \ion{H}{I} emission via longitude-velocity plots, from where we extract and compare the skeletons of major galactic features and the terminal gas velocities. We found that our best-fitting model to the overall structure, also reproduces some of the more specific observed features of the MW, including a bar with a pattern speed of $30.0 \pm 0.2$ km\,s$^{-1}$\,kpc$^{-1}$, a bar half-length of $3.2 \pm 0.8$\,kpc. Our model shows large streaming motions around spiral arms, and strong radial motions well beyond the inner bar. This model highlights the complex motions of a dynamic MW-type galaxy and has the potential to offer valuable insight into how our Galaxy regulates the ISM and star formation.</description>

      <title>Repelling Planet pairs by Ping-pong Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kepler mission reveals a peculiar trough-peak feature in the orbital spacing of close-in planets near mean-motion resonances: a deficit and an excess that are a couple percent to the narrow, respectively wide, of the resonances. This feature has received two main classes of explanations, one involving eccentricity damping, the other scattering with small bodies. Here, we point out a few issues with the damping scenario, and study the scattering scenario in more detail. We elucidate why scattering small bodies tends to repel two planets. As the small bodies random-walk in energy and angular momentum space, they tend to absorb, fractionally, more energy than angular momentum. This, which we call "ping-pong repulsion", transports angular momentum from the inner to the outer planet and pushes the two planets apart. Such a process, even if ubiquitous, leaves identifiable marks only near first-order resonances: diverging pairs jump across the resonance quickly and produce the MMR asymmetry. To explain the observed positions of the trough-peaks, a total scattering mass of order a few percent of the planet masses is required. Moreover, if this mass is dominated by a handful of Mercury-sized bodies, one can also explain the planet eccentricities as inferred from transit-time-variations. Lastly, we suggest how these conditions may have naturally arisen during the late stages of planet formation.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XV: Influence of Magnetic Field Morphology in Dense Cores on Sizes of Protostellar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic field of a molecular cloud core may play a role in the formation of circumstellar disks in the core. We present magnetic field morphologies in protostellar cores of 16 targets in the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array large program "Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk)", which resolved their disks with 7 au resolutions. The 0.1-pc scale magnetic field morphologies were inferred from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) POL-2 observations. The mean orientations and angular dispersions of the magnetic fields in the dense cores are measured and compared with the radii of the 1.3 mm continuum disks and the dynamically determined protostellar masses from the eDisk program. We observe a significant correlation between the disk radii and the stellar masses. We do not find any statistically significant dependence of the disk radii on the projected misalignment angles between the rotational axes of the disks and the magnetic fields in the dense cores, nor on the angular dispersions of the magnetic fields within these cores. However, when considering the projection effect, we cannot rule out a positive correlation between disk radii and misalignment angles in three-dimensional space. Our results suggest that the morphologies of magnetic fields in dense cores do not play a dominant role in the disk formation process. Instead, the sizes of protostellar disks may be more strongly affected by the amount of mass that has been accreted onto star+disk systems, and possibly other parameters, for example, magnetic field strength, core rotation, and magnetic diffusivity.</description>

      <title>A closer look at the host-galaxy environment of high-velocity Type Ia supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggested that the ejecta velocity of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) is a promising indicator in distinguishing the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms. By classifying the SNe Ia based on their ejecta velocities, studies found SNe Ia with high Si II $\lambda$6355 velocities (HV SNe Ia; v&gt;12000 km/s) tend to be physically different from their normal-velocity counterparts (NV SNe Ia). In this work, we revisit the low-$z$ sample studied in previous work and closely look into the spatially resolved environment local to the site of SN explosion. Our results reveal a possible trend (at $2.4\sigma$ significance) that HV SNe Ia are likely associated with older stellar populations than NV SNe Ia. While the trend is inconclusive, the local host-galaxy sample studied in this work is likely skewed toward massive galaxies, limiting the parameter space that we would like to investigate from the original parent sample. Nevertheless, our results do not rule out the possibility that parameters other than the host-galaxy age (such as metallicity) could be the underlying factors driving the differences between HV and NV SNe Ia due to the limitation of our dataset.</description>

      <title>Characterizing NGC 6383: A study of pre-main sequence stars, mass segregation, and age using Gaia DR3 and 2MASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study employs Bayesian analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze the young open cluster NGC 6383 using data from Gaia DR3 and 2MASS. We identified 254 probable cluster members through HDBSCAN based on proper motions and determined the cluster's core and tidal radius. To perform this analysis, we utilized an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, the No-U-Turn Sampler, using the Bayesian library PyMC. Our results indicate a mean cluster age of $4 \pm 1$ Myr and a distance of $1.107 \pm 0.035$ kpc. The analysis reveals mass segregation, especially among binary stars, and suggests that NGC 6383 is not fully relaxed. We observed a well-defined main sequence and a population of pre-main sequence stars, with a star formation range from $\sim 1$ to $6$ Myr, indicating recent star formation activity.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Production Mechanism of High-Energy Neutrinos from NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of high-energy neutrino signals from the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 provides us with an opportunity to study nonthermal processes near the center of supermassive black holes. Using the IceCube and latest Fermi-LAT data, we present general multimessenger constraints on the energetics of cosmic rays and the size of neutrino emission regions. In the photohadronic scenario, the required cosmic-ray luminosity should be larger than about 1-10% of the Eddington luminosity and the emission radius should be 15 Schwarzschild radii in low-beta plasma and 3 Schwarzschild radii in high-beta plasma. The leptonic scenario overshoots the NuSTAR or Fermi-LAT data for any emission radii we consider, and the required gamma-ray luminosity is much larger than the Eddington luminosity. The beta decay scenario also violates not only the energetics requirement but also gamma-ray constraints especially when the Bethe-Heitler and photomeson production processes are consistently considered. Our results rule out the leptonic and beta decay scenarios in a nearly model-independent manner, and support hadronic mechanisms in magnetically-powered coronae if NGC 1068 is a source of high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Digging into the ultraviolet luminosity functions of galaxies at high redshifts: galaxies evolution, reionization, and cosmological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the successful performance of the James Webb Space Telescope, our understanding of the epoch of reionization of the Universe has been advanced. The ultraviolet luminosity functions (UV LFs) of galaxies span a wide range of redshift, not only revealing the connection between galaxies and dark matter (DM) halos but also providing the information during reionization. In this work, we develop a model connecting galaxy counts and apparent magnitude based on UV LFs, which incorporates redshift-dependent star formation efficiency (SFE) and corrections for dust attenuation. By synthesizing some observations across the redshift range $4\le z \le 10$ from various galaxy surveys, we discern the evolving SFE with increasing redshift and DM halo mass through model fitting. Subsequent analyses indicate that the Thomson scattering optical depth was $\tau_{\rm e} = 0.052^{+0.003}_{-0.002}$ and the epoch of reionization started (ended) at $z=20.58^{+6.25}_{-6.75}$ ($z=5.38^{+0.65}_{-0.70}$) which is insensitive to the choice of the truncated magnitude of the UV LFs. Incorporating additional dataset and some reasonable constraints, the amplitude of matter perturbation is found to be $\sigma_8=0.79\pm0.05$, which is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Future galaxy surveys and the dynamical simulations of galaxy evolution will break the degeneracy between SFE and cosmological parameters, improving the accuracy and the precision of the UV LF model further.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent models of AGN disks with radiation from embedded stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brightest steady sources of radiation in the universe, active galactic nuclei (AGN), are powered by gas accretion onto a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). The large sizes and accretion rates implicated in AGN accretion disks are expected to lead to gravitational instability and fragmentation, effectively cutting off mass inflow to the SMBH. Radiative feedback from disk-embedded stars has been invoked to yield marginally stable, steady-state solutions in the outer disks. Here, we examine the consequences of this star formation with a semi-analytical model in which stellar-mass black hole (sBH) remnants in the disk provide an additional source of stabilizing radiative feedback. Assuming star formation seeds the embedded sBH population, we model the time-evolving feedback from both stars and the growing population of accreting sBHs. We find that in the outer disk, the luminosity of the sBHs quickly dominates that of their parent stars. However, because sBHs consume less gas than stars to stabilize the disk, the presence of the sBHs enhances the mass flux to the inner disk. As a result, star formation persists over the lifetime of the AGN, damped in the outer disk, but amplified in a narrow ring in the inner disk. Heating from the embedded sBHs significantly modifies the disk's temperature profile and hardens its spectral energy distribution, and direct emission from the sBHs adds a new hard X ray component, resembling a Compton reflection "hump".</description>

      <title>On the bright-end of the UV luminosity functions of galaxies at $z \sim 0.6-1.2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the Ultra-Violet (UV) luminosity function (LF) of star-forming galaxies in the redshift range $z = 0.6 - 1.2$, in the rest-frame far-UV ($1500$ \r{A}) wavelength. For this work, we are in particular interested in the bright end of the UV LF in this redshift range. Data from the XMM-Newton Optical Monitor (XMM-OM), near-ultraviolet ($2410-3565$ \r{A}) observations over 1.5 sq. deg of the COSMOS field are employed for this purpose. We compile a source-list of $879$ sources with $UVW1_\mathrm{AB}$ in the range $\sim 21-24$ mags from the wide-area UVW1 image of the COSMOS field in the two bins $0.6 \leq z \leq 0.8$ and $0.8 \leq z \leq 1.2$. The $M_{1500}$ for these sources lies in the interval $[-19.10,-22.50]$. We use the maximum likelihood to fit a Schechter function model to the un-binned data to estimate the parameters (faint-end slope, characteristic magnitude, and normalisation) of the Schechter function. We find the shape of the LF to be consistent with the Schechter model, and the parameters are in fair agreement with other studies conducted using direct measurements of the $1500$\r{A} flux. We see a brightening of the characteristic magnitude as we move from lower ($0.7$) to higher ($1.0$) redshift. The measures for luminosity density are within the error margins of past studies. We examine the brightest sources in our sample for the AGN contribution. These sources are characterised by their spectral energy distributions, integrated infrared luminosities, and morphologies. We also explore their overlap with the brightest IR galaxies in a similar redshift range.</description>

Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound systems consisting of dark matter, hot baryonic gas and stars. They play an important role in observational cosmology and galaxy evolution studies. We develop a deep learning model for segmentation of Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal on ACT+Planck intensity maps and construct a pipeline for microwave cluster detection in the ACT footprint. The proposed model allows us to identify previously unknown galaxy clusters, i.e. it is capable of detecting SZ sources below the detection threshold adopted in the published galaxy clusters catalogues (such as ACT DR5 and PSZ2). In this paper, we use the derived SZ signal map to considerably improve a cluster purity in the extended catalogue of Sunyaev-Zeldovich objects from Planck data (SZcat) in the ACT footprint. From SZcat, we create a new microwave galaxy cluster catalogue (ComPACT), which includes 2,962 SZ objects with cluster purity conservatively estimated as $\gtrsim74-84$\%. We categorise objects in the catalogue into 3 categories, based on their cluster reliability. Within the ComPACT catalogue, there are $\gtrsim{}977$ new clusters with respect to the ACT DR5 and PSZ2 catalogues.</description>

      <title>Photometric Objects Around Cosmic Webs (PAC). VI. High Satellite Fraction of Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Photometric objects Around Cosmic webs (PAC) approach developed in Xu et al. (2022b) has the advantage of making full use of spectroscopic and deeper photometric surveys. With the merits of PAC, the excess surface density $\bar{n}_2w_{{\rm{p}}}$ of neighboring galaxies can be measured down to stellar mass $10^{10.80}\,M_{\odot}$ around quasars at redshift $0.8&lt;z_{\rm{s}}&lt;1.0$, with the data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys. We find that $\bar{n}_2w_{{\rm{p}}}$ generally increases quite steeply with the decrease of the separation. Using subhalo abundance matching method, we can accurately model the $\bar{n}_2w_{{\rm{p}}}$ both on small and large scales. We show that the steep increase of the $\bar{n}_2w_{{\rm{p}}}$ towards the quasars requires that a large fraction $f_{\mathrm{sate}}=0.29_{-0.06}^{+0.05}$ of quasars should be satellites in massive halos, and find that this fraction measurement is insensitive to the assumptions of our modeling. This high satellite fraction indicates that the subhalos have nearly the same probability to host quasars as the halos for the same (infall) halo mass, and the large scale environment has negligible effect on the quasar activity. We show that even with this high satellite fraction, each massive halo on average does not host more than one satellite quasar due to the sparsity of quasars.</description>

      <title>Distribution and Properties of Molecular Gas Toward the Monoceros OB1 Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive CO study toward the Monoceros OB1 (Mon OB1) region based on the MWISP survey at an angular resolution of about $50''$. The high-sensitivity data, together with the high dynamic range, shows that molecular gas in the $\rm 8^{\circ}\times4^{\circ}$ region displays complicated hierarchical structures and various morphology (e.g., filamentary, cavity-like, shell-like, and other irregular structures). Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ data, a total of 263 $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ structures are identified in the whole region, and 88% of raw data flux is recovered. The dense gas with relatively high column density from the integrated CO emission is mainly concentrated in the region where multiple $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures are overlapped. Combining the results of 32 large $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ structures with distances from Gaia DR3, we estimate an average distance of $\rm 729^{+45}_{-45}~pc$ for the GMC complex. The total mass of the GMC Complex traced by $\mathrm{^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$, and $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ are $1.1\times10^5~M_\odot$, $4.3\times10^4~M_\odot$, and $8.4\times10^3~M_\odot$, respectively. The dense gas fraction shows a clear difference between Mon OB1 GMC East (12.4%) and Mon OB1 GMC West (3.3%). Our results show that the dense gas environment is closely linked to the nearby star-forming regions. On the other hand, star-forming activities have a great influence on the physical properties of the surrounding molecular gas (e.g., greater velocity dispersion, higher temperatures, and more complex velocity structures, etc.). We also discuss the distribution/kinematics of molecular gas associated with nearby star-forming activities.</description>

      <title>Star-by-star dynamical evolution of the physical pair of the Collinder 135 and UBC 7 open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous paper using Gaia DR2 data, we demonstrated that the two closely situated open clusters Collinder 135 and UBC 7 might have formed together about 50 Myr ago. In this work, we performed star-by-star dynamical modelling of the evolution of the open clusters Collinder 135 and UBC 7 from their supposed initial state to their present-day state, reproducing observational distributions of members. Modelling of the Collinder 135 and UBC 7 dynamical evolution was done using the high-order parallel N-body code \phi-GPU with up-to-date stellar evolution. Membership and characteristics of the clusters were acquired based on Gaia DR3 data. The comparison of the present-day radial cumulative star count obtained from the N-body simulations with the current observational data gave us full consistency of the model with observational data, especially in the central 8 pc, where 80% of the stars reside. The proper motion velocity components obtained from the N-body simulations of the stars are also quite consistent with the observed distributions and error bars. These results show that our numerical modelling is able to reproduce the open clusters' current complex 6D observed phase-space distributions with a high level of confidence. Thus, the model demonstrates that the hypothesis of a common origin of Collinder 135 and UBC 7 complies with present-day observational data.</description>

      <title>Chemical inventory of the envelope of the Class I protostar L1551 IRS 5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Episodic accretion in protostars leads to luminosity outbursts that end up heating their surroundings. This rise in temperature pushes the snow lines back, enabling the desorption of chemical species from dust grain surfaces, which may significantly alter the chemical history of the accreting envelope. However, a limited number of extensive chemical surveys of eruptive young stars have been performed thus far. In the present study, we carry out a large spectral survey of the binary Class I protostar L1551 IRS 5, known to be a FUor-like object, in the 3mm and 2mm bands with the IRAM-30m telescope. As a result, we detected more than 400 molecular lines. The source displays a great chemical richness with the detection of 75 species, including isotopologues. Among these species, there are 13 hydrocarbons, 25 N-bearing species, 30 O-bearing species, 15 S-bearing species, 12 deuterated molecules, and a total of 10 complex organic molecules (l-C4H2, CH3CCH, CH2DCCH, CH3CHO, CH3CN, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, CH3OH, CH2DOH, and HC5N). With the help of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE models, we determined the column densities of most molecules as well as excitation and kinetic temperatures. While most of those molecules trace the cold envelope (&lt; 20 K), the OCS and CH3OH emission arise from the warm (&gt; 100 K) innermost (&lt; 2'' ) regions. We compared the chemical inventory of L1551 IRS 5 and its column density ratios, including isotopic ratios, with other protostellar sources. A broad chemical diversity is seen among Class I objects. More observations with both single-dish telescopes and interferometers are needed to characterize the diversity in a larger sample of protostars, while more astrochemical models would help explain this diversity, in addition to the impact of luminosity outbursts on the chemistry of protostellar envelopes.</description>

      <title>Interior solution of azimuthally symmetric case of Laplace equation in orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curvilinear coordinate systems distinct from the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system are particularly valuable in the field calculations as they facilitate the expression of boundary conditions of differential equations in a reasonably simple way when the coordinate surfaces fit the physical boundaries of the problem. The recently finalized orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal (SOS) coordinate system can be particularly useful for a physical processes description inside or in the vicinity of the bodies with the geometry of an oblate spheroid. Such shape is aproximating well objects investigated within astrophysics. The solution of the azimuthally symmetric case of the Laplace equation was found for the interior space in the orthogonal SOS coordinates. In the frame of the derivation of the harmonic functions, the Laplace equation was separated by a special separation procedure. A generalized Legendre equation was introduced as the equation for the angular part of the separated Laplace equation. The harmonic functions were determined as relations involving generalized Legendre functions of the first and of the second kind. Several lower-degree functions are reported. Recursion formula facilitating determination of the higher-degree harmonic functions was found. The general solution of the azimuthally symmetric Laplace equation for the interior space in the SOS coordinates is reported.</description>

      <title>On the formation of a $33\,M_{\odot}$ black hole in a low-metallicity binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $33\,M_\odot$ black hole (BH) was recently discovered in an 11.6-year binary only 590 pc from the Sun. The system, Gaia BH3, contains a $0.8\,M_\odot$ low-metallicity giant ($\rm [M/H]=-2.2$) that is a member of the ED-2 stellar stream. This paper investigates whether the system could have formed via isolated binary evolution. I construct evolutionary models for metal-poor massive stars with initial masses ranging from $35-55\,M_{\odot}$, which reach maximum radii of $1150-1800\,R_{\odot}$ as red supergiants. I then explore what combinations of initial orbit, mass loss, and natal kick can produce the period and eccentricity of Gaia BH3. Initial orbits wide enough to accommodate the BH progenitor as a red supergiant can match the observed period and eccentricity, but only if the BH formed with a significant natal kick ($v_{\rm kick}\gtrsim 20\, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$). These models are disfavored because such a kick would have ejected the binary from the ED-2 progenitor cluster. I conclude that Gaia BH3 likely formed through dynamical interactions, unless the BH progenitor did not expand to become a red supergiant. Only about 1 in 10,000 stars in the solar neighborhood have metallicities as low as Gaia BH3. This suggests that BH companions are dramatically over-represented at low-metallicity, though caveats related to small number statistics apply. The fact that the luminous star in Gaia BH3 has been a giant -- greatly boosting its detectability -- only for $\sim$1% of the time since the system's formation implies that additional massive BHs remain to be discovered with only moderately fainter companions. Both isolated and dynamically-formed BH binaries with orbits similar to Gaia BH3 are likely to be discovered in Gaia DR4.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a toroidal magnetic field in the core of 3C 84</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spatial scales of relativistic radio jets, probed by relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic jet launching simulations (RMHDs) and by most very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations differ by an order of magnitude. Bridging the gap between these RMHD simulations and VLBI observations requires selecting nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN), the parsec-scale region of which can be resolved. 3C 84 is a nearby bright AGN fulfilling the necessary requirements: it is launching a powerful, relativistic jet powered by a central supermassive black hole, while also being very bright. Using 22 GHz global VLBI measurements of 3C 84 we aim to study its sub-parsec region in both total intensity and linear polarisation, to explore the properties of this jet, with a linear resolution of $\sim0.1$ parsec. We test different simulation setups by altering the bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ of the jet, as well as the magnetic field configuration (toroidal, poloidal, helical). We confirm the persistence of a limb brightened structure, which reaches deep into the sub-parsec region. The corresponding electric vector position angles (EVPAs) follow the bulk jet flow inside but tend to be orthogonal to it near the edges. Our state-of-the-art RMHD simulations show that this geometry is consistent with a spine-sheath model, associated with a mildly relativistic flow and a toroidal magnetic field configuration.</description>
