      <title>Pinching-Antenna Assisted Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel pinching-antenna-system (PASS) assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), where multiple pinching antennas (PAs) are strategically activiated on a waveguide to facilitate information transmission to multiple information receivers (IRs) and power transfer to multiple energy receivers (ERs) simultaneously. Leveraging the single-waveguide architecture, non-orthogonal multiple access is employed to enable the superposed transmission of information signals, eliminating the need for dedicated energy carriers by concurrently serving both the IRs and the ERs. In this letter, an optimization problem is first formulated with an objective is to maximize the sum power received at the ERs via joint optimizing the IRs power allocation and the PAs positioning. Given the challenging non-convex nature of the formulated optimization problem, it is decoupled into two sub-problems which are solved alternatively. Specifically, the power allocation subproblem is recast a convex optimization problem, and hence can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, we propose a high-precision element-wise algorithm and a low-complexity linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the position optimization sub-problem. The numerical results demonstrate that PAs assisted SWIPT can achieve a remarkable performance gain compared to conventional system.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity CNN-Based Classification of Electroneurographic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peripheral nerve interfaces (PNIs) facilitate neural recording and stimulation for treating nerve injuries, but real-time classification of electroneurographic (ENG) signals remains challenging due to constraints on complexity and latency, particularly in implantable devices. This study introduces MobilESCAPE-Net, a lightweight architecture that reduces computational cost while maintaining and slightly improving classification performance. Compared to the state-of-the-art ESCAPE-Net, MobilESCAPE-Net achieves comparable accuracy and F1-score with significantly lower complexity, reducing trainable parameters by 99.9\% and floating point operations per second by 92.47\%, enabling faster inference and real-time processing. Its efficiency makes it well-suited for low-complexity ENG signal classification in resource-constrained environments such as implantable devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A chaotic modulation scheme is an efficient wideband communication method. It utilizes the deterministic chaos to generate pseudo-random carriers. Chaotic bifurcation parameter modulation is one of the well-known and widely-used techniques. This paper presents the machine learning based demodulation approach for the bifurcation parameter keying. It presents the structure of a convolutional neural network as well as performance metrics values for signals generated with the chaotic logistic map. The paper provides an assessment of the overall accuracy for binary signals. It reports the accuracy value of 0.88 for the bifurcation parameter deviation of 1.34% in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise at the normalized signal-to-noise ratio value of 20 dB for balanced dataset.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transformer-based deep learning approach is presented that enables the diagnosis of fault cases in optical fiber amplifiers using condition-based monitoring time series data. The model, Inverse Triple-Aspect Self-Attention Transformer (ITST), uses an encoder-decoder architecture, utilizing three feature extraction paths in the encoder, feature-engineered data for the decoder and a self-attention mechanism. The results show that ITST outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of classification accuracy, which enables predictive maintenance for optical fiber amplifiers, reducing network downtimes and maintenance costs.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Channel Estimation in OTFS Systems with Fractional Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation exploits the sparsity of Delay-Doppler domain channels, making it highly effective in high-mobility scenarios. Its accurate channel estimation supports integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The letter introduces a low-complexity technique for estimating delay and Doppler shifts under fractional effects, while addressing inter-path interference. The method employs a sequential estimation process combined with interference elimination based on energy leakage, ensuring accurate channel estimation. Furthermore, the estimated channel parameters can signifcantly improve ISAC system performance by enhancing sensing capabilities. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this approach in achieving accurate channel estimation and facilitating sensing tasks for ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>DeltaDPD: Exploiting Dynamic Temporal Sparsity in Recurrent Neural Networks for Energy-Efficient Wideband Digital Predistortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Predistortion (DPD) is a popular technique to enhance signal quality in wideband RF power amplifiers (PAs). With increasing bandwidth and data rates, DPD faces significant energy consumption challenges during deployment, contrasting with its efficiency goals. State-of-the-art DPD models rely on recurrent neural networks (RNN), whose computational complexity hinders system efficiency. This paper introduces DeltaDPD, exploring the dynamic temporal sparsity of input signals and neuronal hidden states in RNNs for energy-efficient DPD, reducing arithmetic operations and memory accesses while preserving satisfactory linearization performance. Applying a TM3.1a 200MHz-BW 256-QAM OFDM signal to a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty RF PA, DeltaDPD achieves -50.03 dBc in Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR), -37.22 dB in Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) and -38.52 dBc in Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) with 52% temporal sparsity, leading to a 1.8X reduction in estimated inference power. The DeltaDPD code will be released after formal publication at https://www.opendpd.com.</description>

      <title>SpectrumFM: A Foundation Model for Intelligent Spectrum Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent spectrum management is crucial for improving spectrum efficiency and achieving secure utilization of spectrum resources. However, existing intelligent spectrum management methods, typically based on small-scale models, suffer from notable limitations in recognition accuracy, convergence speed, and generalization, particularly in the complex and dynamic spectrum environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, establishing a new paradigm for spectrum management. SpectrumFM features an innovative encoder architecture that synergistically exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and enable robust representation learning. The model is pre-trained via two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, which leverage large-scale in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data to achieve comprehensive and transferable spectrum representations. Furthermore, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy is proposed to enable SpectrumFM to adapt to various downstream spectrum management tasks, including automatic modulation classification (AMC), wireless technology classification (WTC), spectrum sensing (SS), and anomaly detection (AD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpectrumFM achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, adaptability, few-shot learning efficiency, and convergence speed, consistently outperforming conventional methods across multiple benchmarks. Specifically, SpectrumFM improves AMC accuracy by up to 12.1% and WTC accuracy by 9.3%, achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 in SS at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and enhances AD performance by over 10%.</description>

      <title>From Biometrics to Environmental Control: AI-Enhanced Digital Twins for Personalized Health Interventions in Healing Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic nature of human health and comfort calls for adaptive systems that respond to individual physiological needs in real time. This paper presents an AI-enhanced digital twin framework that integrates biometric signals, specifically electrocardiogram (ECG) data, with environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and ventilation. Leveraging IoT-enabled sensors and biometric monitoring devices, the system continuously acquires, synchronises, and preprocesses multimodal data streams to construct a responsive virtual replica of the physical environment. To validate this framework, a detailed case study is conducted using the MIT-BIH noise stress test dataset. ECG signals are filtered and segmented using dynamic sliding windows, followed by extracting heart rate variability (HRV) features such as SDNN, BPM, QTc, and LF/HF ratio. Relative deviation metrics are computed against clean baselines to quantify stress responses. A random forest classifier is trained to predict stress levels across five categories, and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is used to interpret model behaviour and identify key contributing features. These predictions are mapped to a structured set of environmental interventions using a Five Level Stress Intervention Mapping, which activates multi-scale responses across personal, room, building, and landscape levels. This integration of physiological insight, explainable AI, and adaptive control establishes a new paradigm for health-responsive built environments. It lays the foundation for the future development of intelligent, personalised healing spaces.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Spatial Wireless Channel Modeling with Radio Radiance Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is a key enabler for 6G systems, offering ultra-wide bandwidth and unprecedented data rates. However, THz signal propagation differs significantly from lower-frequency bands due to severe free space path loss, minimal diffraction and specular reflection, and prominent scattering, making conventional channel modeling and pilot-based estimation approaches inefficient. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of applying radio radiance field (RRF) framework to the THz band. This method reconstructs a continuous RRF using visual-based geometry and sparse THz RF measurements, enabling efficient spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI) modeling without dense sampling. We first build a fine simulated THz scenario, then we reconstruct the RRF and evaluate the performance in terms of both reconstruction quality and effectiveness in THz communication, showing that the reconstructed RRF captures key propagation paths with sparse training samples. Our findings demonstrate that RRF modeling remains effective in the THz regime and provides a promising direction for scalable, low-cost spatial channel reconstruction in future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>FEMSN: Frequency-Enhanced Multiscale Network for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery under strong noise environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rolling bearings are critical components of rotating machinery, and their proper functioning is essential for industrial production. Most existing condition monitoring methods focus on extracting discriminative features from time-domain signals to assess bearing health status. However, under complex operating conditions, periodic impulsive characteristics related to fault information are often obscured by noise interference. Consequently, existing approaches struggle to learn distinctive fault-related features in such scenarios. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel CNN-based model named FEMSN. Specifically, a Fourier Adaptive Denoising Encoder Layer (FADEL) is introduced as an input denoising layer to enhance key features while filtering out irrelevant information. Subsequently, a Multiscale Time-Frequency Fusion (MSTFF) module is employed to extract fused time-frequency features, further improving the model robustness and nonlinear representation capability. Additionally, a distillation layer is incorporated to expand the receptive field. Based on these advancements, a novel deep lightweight CNN model, termed the Frequency-Enhanced Multiscale Network (FEMSN), is developed. The effectiveness of FEMSN and FADEL in machine health monitoring and stability assessment is validated through two case studies.</description>

      <title>ALFEE: Adaptive Large Foundation Model for EEG Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While foundation models excel in text, image, and video domains, the critical biological signals, particularly electroencephalography(EEG), remain underexplored. EEG benefits neurological research with its high temporal resolution, operational practicality, and safety profile. However, low signal-to-noise ratio, inter-subject variability, and cross-paradigm differences hinder the generalization of current models. Existing methods often employ simplified strategies, such as a single loss function or a channel-temporal joint representation module, and suffer from a domain gap between pretraining and evaluation tasks that compromises efficiency and adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose the Adaptive Large Foundation model for EEG signal representation(ALFEE) framework, a novel hybrid transformer architecture with two learning stages for robust EEG representation learning. ALFEE employs a hybrid attention that separates channel-wise feature aggregation from temporal dynamics modeling, enabling robust EEG representation with variable channel configurations. A channel encoder adaptively compresses variable channel information, a temporal encoder captures task-guided evolution, and a hybrid decoder reconstructs signals in both temporal and frequency domains. During pretraining, ALFEE optimizes task prediction, channel and temporal mask reconstruction, and temporal forecasting to enhance multi-scale and multi-channel representation. During fine-tuning, a full-model adaptation with a task-specific token dictionary and a cross-attention layer boosts performance across multiple tasks. After 25,000 hours of pretraining, extensive experimental results on six downstream EEG tasks demonstrate the superior performance of ALFEE over existing models. Our ALFEE framework establishes a scalable foundation for biological signal analysis with implementation at https://github.com/xw1216/ALFEE.</description>

      <title>Q-Heart: ECG Question Answering via Knowledge-Informed Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) offers critical cardiovascular insights, such as identifying arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia, but enabling automated systems to answer complex clinical questions directly from ECG signals (ECG-QA) remains a significant challenge. Current approaches often lack robust multimodal reasoning capabilities or rely on generic architectures ill-suited for the nuances of physiological signals. We introduce Q-Heart, a novel multimodal framework designed to bridge this gap. Q-Heart leverages a powerful, adapted ECG encoder and integrates its representations with textual information via a specialized ECG-aware transformer-based mapping layer. Furthermore, Q-Heart leverages dynamic prompting and retrieval of relevant historical clinical reports to guide tuning the language model toward knowledge-aware ECG reasoning. Extensive evaluations on the benchmark ECG-QA dataset show Q-Heart achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by a 4% improvement in exact match accuracy. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining domain-specific architectural adaptations with knowledge-augmented LLM instruction tuning for complex physiological ECG analysis, paving the way for more capable and potentially interpretable clinical patient care systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a novel Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) that features a low-profile structure, wide operating bandwidth, and continuous phase control. By incorporating a middle patch layer without introducing an additional air gap, the proposed design maintains a thin form factor, while achieving a smooth 310{\deg} phase shift over 10\% bandwidth at 6.1 GHz with excellent reflection. A fabricated 10*10 RIS array exhibits stable performance, enabling precise beam control across a 600 MHz bandwidth. These results highlight the potential of the proposed low-profile, wideband RIS with continuous phase tuning for next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Focusing Metasurfaces of (Un)equal Power Allocations for Wireless Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focusing metasurfaces (MTSs) tailored for different power allocations in wireless power transfer (WPT) system are proposed in this letter. The designed metasurface unit cells ensure that the phase shift can cover over a 2{\pi} span with high transmittance. Based on near-field focusing theory, an adapted formula is employed to guide the phase distribution for compensating incident waves. Three MTSs, each with dimensions of 190*190 mm and comprising 19*19 unit cells, are constructed to achieve dual-polarized two foci with 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 power allocations, yielding maximum focusing efficiencies of 71.6%, 65.2%, and 57.5%, respectively. The first two MTSs are fabricated and tested, demonstrating minimal -3 dB depth of focus (DOF). Results are aligned with theoretical predictions. These designs aim to facilitate power transfer to different systems based on their specific requirements in an internet of things (IoT) environment.</description>

      <title>An Improved Approach to Estimate the Internal Resistance of a Battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of resistance estimation in electronic systems including battery management systems (BMS) and battery chargers. In typical applications, the battery resistance is obtained through an approximate method computed as the ratio of the voltage difference to the applied current excitation pulse or vice versa for admittance. When estimating the battery resistance, this approach ignores the change in the open circuit voltage (OCV) as a result of the excitation signal. In this paper, we formally demonstrate and quantify the effect of the OCV drop on the errors in internal resistance estimation. Then, we propose a novel method to accurately estimate the internal resistance by accounting for the change in OCV caused by the applied current excitation signal. The proposed approach is based on a novel observation model that allows one to estimate the effect of OCV without requiring any additional information, such as the state of charge (SOC), parameters of the OCV-SOC curve, and the battery capacity. As such, the proposed approach is independent of the battery chemistry, size, age, and the ambient temperature. A performance analysis of the proposed approach using the battery simulator shows significant performance gain in the range of 30% to more than 250% in percentage estimation error. Then, the proposed approach is applied for resistance estimation during the hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) of cylindrical Li-ion battery cells. Results from tested batteries show that the proposed approach reduced the overestimated internal resistance of the batteries by up to 20 m{\Omega}.</description>

      <title>Monopulse Parameter Estimation based on MIMO-STCA Radar in the Presence of Multiple Mainlobe Jammings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The monopulse technique is characterized by its high accuracy in angle estimation and simplicity in engineering implementation. However, in the complex electromagnetic environment, the presence of the mainlobe jamming (MLJ) greatly degrades the accuracy of angle estimation. Conventional methods of jamming suppression often lead to significant deviations in monopulse ratio while suppressing MLJ. Additionally, the monopulse technique based on traditional radar cannot jointly estimate the target's range. In this paper, the four-channel adaptive beamforming (ABF) algorithm is proposed, which adds a delta-delta channel based on conventional sum-difference-difference three-channel to suppress a single MLJ. Moreover, considering the suppression of multiple MLJs and sidelobe jammings (SLJs), the row-column ABF algorithm is proposed. This algorithm utilizes more spatial degrees of freedom (DOFs) to suppress multiple jammings by the row-column adaptive beamforming at the subarray level. The key ideal of both algorithms is to suppress MLJ with null along one spatial direction while keeping the sum and difference beampatterns undistorted along another spatial direction. Therefore, the monopulse ratio remains undistorted while suppressing the MLJ, ensuring the accuracy of monopulse parameter estimation. Furthermore, by utilizing the additional degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the range domain provided by the multiple-input multiple-output space-time coding array (MIMO-STCA) radar, joint angle-range estimation can be achieved through the monopulse technique. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methods in suppressing multiple MLJs and enhancing the accuracy of monopulse parameter estimation, as verified by the low root mean square error (RMSE) in the parameter estimation results.</description>

      <title>Event-based Neural Spike Detection Using Spiking Neural Networks for Neuromorphic iBMI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) are evolving to record from thousands of neurons wirelessly but face challenges in data bandwidth, power consumption, and implant size. We propose a novel Spiking Neural Network Spike Detector (SNN-SPD) that processes event-based neural data generated via delta modulation and pulse count modulation, converting signals into sparse events. By leveraging the temporal dynamics and inherent sparsity of spiking neural networks, our method improves spike detection performance while maintaining low computational overhead suitable for implantable devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SNN-SPD achieves an accuracy of 95.72% at high noise levels (standard deviation 0.2), which is about 2% higher than the existing Artificial Neural Network Spike Detector (ANN-SPD). Moreover, SNN-SPD requires only 0.41% of the computation and about 26.62% of the weight parameters compared to ANN-SPD, with zero multiplications. This approach balances efficiency and performance, enabling effective data compression and power savings for next-generation iBMIs.</description>

      <title>A Short Overview of Multi-Modal Wi-Fi Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a significant technology in wireless sensing and Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), offering benefits such as low cost, high penetration, and enhanced privacy. Currently, it is widely utilized in various applications, including action recognition, human localization, and crowd counting. However, Wi-Fi sensing also faces challenges, such as low robustness and difficulties in data collection. Recently, there has been an increasing focus on multi-modal Wi-Fi sensing, where other modalities can act as teachers, providing ground truth or robust features for Wi-Fi sensing models to learn from, or can be directly fused with Wi-Fi for enhanced sensing capabilities. Although these methods have demonstrated promising results and substantial value in practical applications, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys reviewing them. To address this gap, this paper reviews the multi-modal Wi-Fi sensing literature \textbf{from the past 24 months} and highlights the current limitations, challenges and future directions in this field.</description>

      <title>Cross-Link Interference Mitigation With Over-the-Air Pilot Forwarding for Dynamic TDD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic time-division duplex (D-TDD) aided mobile communication systems bear the potential to achieve significantly higher spectral efficiency than traditional static TDD based systems. However, strong cross-link interference (CLI) may be caused by different transmission directions between adjacent cells in D-TDD systems, thus degrading the performance. Most existing CLI mitigation schemes require sharing certain information among base stations (BSs) via backhaul links. This strategy is usually expensive and suffers high latency. Alternatively, we propose a pilot information sharing scheme based on over-the-air forwarding of the downlink pilot of the interfering BS to the interfered BS via a wireless terminal, along with a dedicated CLI channel estimation method. Simulation results demonstrate that thanks to the proposed pilot information sharing scheme the classic interference rejection combining (IRC) receiver achieves a signal detection performance highly comparable to that of the IRC detector with perfect pilot information, necessitating no information sharing among BSs via backhaul links. Furthermore, the proposed CLI channel estimation scheme reduces the impact of errors introduced by pilot forwarding, thereby improving the performance of both CLI channel estimation and signal detection.</description>

      <title>Collection: Datasets from AFAR Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive real-world and Digital Twin (DT) dataset collected as part of the Find A Rover (AFAR) Challenge, organized by the NSF Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform for Advanced Wireless (AERPAW) testbed and hosted at the Lake Wheeler Field in Raleigh, North Carolina. The AFAR Challenge was a competition involving five finalist university teams, focused on promoting innovation in UAV-assisted radio frequency (RF) source localization. Participating teams were tasked with designing UAV flight trajectories and localization algorithms to detect the position of a hidden unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), also referred to as a rover, emitting wireless probe signals generated by GNU Radio. The competition was structured to evaluate solutions in a DT environment first, followed by deployment and testing in AERPAW's outdoor wireless testbed. For each team, the UGV was placed at three different positions, resulting in a total of 30 datasets, 15 collected in a DT simulation environment and 15 in a physical outdoor testbed. Each dataset contains time-synchronized measurements of received signal strength (RSS), received signal quality (RSQ), GPS coordinates, UAV velocity, and UAV orientation (roll, pitch, and yaw). Data is organized into structured folders by team, environment (DT and real-world), and UGV location. The dataset supports research in UAV-assisted RF source localization, air-to-ground (A2G) wireless propagation modeling, trajectory optimization, signal prediction, autonomous navigation, and DT validation. With approximately 300k time-synchronized samples collected from real-world experiments, the dataset provides a substantial foundation for training and evaluating deep learning (DL) models. Overall, the AFAR dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing robust, real-world solutions in UAV-enabled wireless communications and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO: A Deep Generative Model Guided by Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the near-field (NF) channel estimation (CE) for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. Considering the pronounced NF effects in XL-MIMO communications, we first establish a joint angle-distance (AD) domain-based spherical-wavefront physical channel model that captures the inherent sparsity of XL-MIMO channels. Leveraging the channel's sparsity in the joint AD domain, the CE is approached as a task of reconstructing sparse signals. Anchored in this framework, we first propose a compressed sensing algorithm to acquire a preliminary channel estimate. Harnessing the powerful implicit prior learning capability of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), we further propose a GenAI-based approach to refine the estimated channel. Specifically, we introduce the preliminary estimated channel as side information, and derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the log-marginal distribution of the target NF channel conditioned on the preliminary estimated channel, which serves as the optimization objective for the proposed generative diffusion model (GDM). Additionally, we introduce a more generalized version of the GDM, the non-Markovian GDM (NM-GDM), to accelerate the sampling process, achieving an approximately tenfold enhancement in sampling efficiency. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is capable of offering substantial performance gain in CE compared to existing benchmark schemes within NF XL-MIMO systems. Furthermore, our approach exhibits enhanced generalization capabilities in both the NF or far-field (FF) regions.</description>

      <title>A Unified Deterministic Channel Model for Multi-Type RIS with Reflective, Transmissive, and Polarization Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technologies have been considered as a promising enabler for 6G, enabling advantageous control of electromagnetic (EM) propagation. RIS can be categorized into multiple types based on their reflective/transmissive modes and polarization control capabilities, all of which are expected to be widely deployed in practical environments. A reliable RIS channel model is essential for the design and development of RIS communication systems. While deterministic modeling approaches such as ray-tracing (RT) offer significant benefits, a unified model that accommodates all RIS types is still lacking. This paper addresses this gap by developing a high-precision deterministic channel model based on RT, supporting multiple RIS types: reflective, transmissive, hybrid, and three polarization operation modes. To achieve this, a unified EM response model for the aforementioned RIS types is developed. The reflection and transmission coefficients of RIS elements are derived using a tensor-based equivalent impedance approach, followed by calculating the scattered fields of the RIS to establish an EM response model. The performance of different RIS types is compared through simulations in typical scenarios. During this process, passive and lossless constraints on the reflection and transmission coefficients are incorporated to ensure fairness in the performance evaluation. Simulation results validate the framework's accuracy in characterizing the RIS channel, and specific cases tailored for dual-polarization independent control and polarization rotating RISs are highlighted as insights for their future deployment. This work can be helpful for the evaluation and optimization of RIS-enabled wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Sparse Arrays Enable Near-Field Constant-Distance Focusing with Reduced Focal Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In near-field beam focusing for finite-sized arrays, focal shift is a non-negligible issue. The actual focal point often appears closer to the array than the predefined focal distance, significantly degrading the focusing performance of finite aperture arrays. Moreover, when the focus point is scanned across different locations, the degradation becomes even more pronounced, leading not only to positional deviation but also to substantial energy loss. To address this issue, we revisit the problem from the perspective of communication degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that a properly designed sparse array with optimized element spacing can effectively mitigate focal shift while enabling stable control of the focusing height during beam scanning. Simulation results based on dipole antennas with different polarizations and patch antennas validate our findings. Notably, with optimized inter-element distances, the energy distribution across focal points becomes nearly uniform, and highly accurate focusing positions are achieved.</description>

      <title>Swarm Antenna Arrays: From Deterministic to Stochastic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swarm antenna arrays, composed of spatially distributed antennas mounted on unmanned agents, offer unprecedented flexibility and adaptability for wireless sensing and communication. However, their reconfigurable architecture, susceptibility to collisions, and inherently stochastic nature present significant challenges to realizing collaborative gain. It remains unclear how spatial coordination, positional perturbations, and large-scale topological configurations affect coherent signal aggregation and overall system performance. This paper investigates the feasibility of achieving coherent beamforming in such systems from both deterministic and stochastic perspectives. First, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework that characterizes the necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of grating lobes in multiple linear configurations. Notably, we show that for dual linear arrays, the classical half-wavelength spacing constraint can be safely relaxed without introducing spatial aliasing. This result challenges traditional array design principles and enables more flexible, collision-aware topologies. Second, we present a theoretical analysis, supported by empirical validation, demonstrating that coherent gain can be approximately preserved under realistic positional perturbations. Our results reveal that spatial perturbations introduce measurable degradation in the main lobe, an effect that cannot be mitigated merely by increasing the number of antennas. Instead, the primary benefit of scaling lies in reducing the variance of perturbation-induced fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Computational Imaging-Based ISAC Method with Large Pixel Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key points in designing an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using computational imaging is the division size of imaging pixels. If the size is too small, it leads to a high number of pixels that need processing. On the contrary, it usually causes large processing errors since each pixel is no longer uniformly coherent. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to address such a problem in environment sensing in millimeter-wave wireless cellular networks, which effectively cancels the severe errors caused by large pixel division as in conventional computational imaging algorithms. To this end, a novel computational imaging model in an integral form is introduced, which leverages the continuous characteristics of object surfaces in the environment and takes into account the different phases associated with the different parts of the pixel. The proposed algorithm extends computational imaging to large wireless communication scenarios for the first time. The performance of the proposed method is then analyzed, and extensive numerical results verify its effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication enables simultaneous communication and sensing tasks, including precise radio positioning and mapping, essential for future 6G networks. Current methods typically model environmental landmarks as isolated incidence points or small reflection areas, lacking detailed attributes essential for advanced environmental interpretation. This paper addresses these limitations by developing an end-to-end cooperative uplink framework involving multiple base stations and users. Our method uniquely estimates extended landmark objects and incorporates obstruction-based outlier removal to mitigate multi-bounce signal effects. Validation using realistic ray-tracing data demonstrates substantial improvements in the richness of the estimated environmental map.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Non-Coherent Jamming Techniques for Frequency Selective Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the design of non-coherent jamming strategies capable of ensuring spectral compatibility with friendly radio frequency (RF) emitters. The goal is achieved via a cognitive approach, which, after recognizing the presence of friendly RF systems within the bandwidth of interest (perception), synthesizes a jamming waveform (action) with spectral notches, that allows to interfere exclusively with opposite emissions. Two methods are proposed for the synthesis of the jamming signal. The former leverages optimization techniques for quadratically constrained quadratic problems (QCQP) where each constraint embeds the interference level tolerable by a specific friendly RF system. The latter is a very computationally efficient approach based on simple projections, allowing a control over the spectral notch positions and widths. At the analysis stage, the performance of the devised jamming techniques is firstly numerically analyzed in terms of spectral occupancy and autocorrelation characteristics. The impact of the quantization process involved in the digital-to-analog conversion (DAC) of the jamming waveforms is also examined, with a particular focus on the spectral shaping impairments resulting from reduced DAC resolution. Finally, waveform transmission and reception is experimentally assessed with software defined radio (SDR) devices.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Scalability of Binary and Ternary CNN Workloads on RRAM-based Compute-in-Memory Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing computational demand of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) necessitates energy-efficient acceleration strategies. Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architectures based on Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) offer a promising solution by reducing data movement and enabling low-power in-situ computations. However, their efficiency is limited by the high cost of peripheral circuits, particularly Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Large crossbars and low ADC resolutions are often used to mitigate this, potentially compromising accuracy. This work introduces novel simulation methods to model the impact of resistive wire parasitics and limited ADC resolution on RRAM crossbars. Our parasitics model employs a vectorised algorithm to compute crossbar output currents with errors below 0.15% compared to SPICE. Additionally, we propose a variable step-size ADC and a calibration methodology that significantly reduces ADC resolution requirements. These accuracy models are integrated with a statistics-based energy model. Using our framework, we conduct a comparative analysis of binary and ternary CNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that the ternary CNNs exhibit greater resilience to wire parasitics and lower ADC resolution but suffer a 40% reduction in energy efficiency. These findings provide valuable insights for optimising RRAM-based CIM accelerators for energy-efficient deep learning.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Beamforming for LEO Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-beam interference poses a significant challenge in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications due to dense satellite constellations. To address this issue, we introduce spacetime beamforming, a novel paradigm that leverages the spacetime channel vector, uniquely determined by the angle of arrival (AoA) and relative Doppler shift, to optimize beamforming between a moving satellite transmitter and a ground station user. We propose two space-time beamforming techniques: spacetime zero-forcing (ST-ZF) and space-time signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (ST-SLNR) maximization. In a partially connected interference channel, ST-ZF achieves a 3dB SNR gain over the conventional interference avoidance method using maximum ratio transmission beamforming. Moreover, in general interference networks, ST-SLNR beamforming significantly enhances sum spectral efficiency compared to conventional interference management approaches. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of space-time beamforming in improving spectral efficiency and interference mitigation for next-generation LEO satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Topological Signal Processing for Water Distribution Network Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water management is one of the most critical aspects of our society, together with population increase and climate change. Water scarcity requires a better characterization and monitoring of Water Distribution Networks (WDNs). This paper presents a novel framework for monitoring Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) by integrating physics-informed modeling of the nonlinear interactions between pressure and flow data with Topological Signal Processing (TSP) techniques. We represent pressure and flow data as signals defined over a second-order cell complex, enabling accurate estimation of water pressures and flows throughout the entire network from sparse sensor measurements. By formalizing hydraulic conservation laws through the TSP framework, we provide a comprehensive representation of nodal pressures and edge flows that incorporate higher-order interactions captured through the formalism of cell complexes. This provides a principled way to decompose the water flows in WDNs in three orthogonal signal components (irrotational, solenoidal and harmonic). The spectral representations of these components inherently reflect the conservation laws governing the water pressures and flows. Sparse representation in the spectral domain enable topology-based sampling and reconstruction of nodal pressures and water flows from sparse measurements. Our results demonstrate that employing cell complex-based signal representations enhances the accuracy of edge signal reconstruction, due to proper modeling of both conservative and non-conservative flows along the polygonal cells.</description>

      <title>Wireless Link Scheduling with State-Augmented Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal link scheduling in large-scale wireless ad hoc networks. We specifically aim for the maximum long-term average performance, subject to a minimum transmission requirement for each link to ensure fairness. With a graph structure utilized to represent the conflicts of links, we formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the scheduling policy, which is parameterized with a graph neural network (GNN). To address the challenge of long-term performance, we use the state-augmentation technique. In particular, by augmenting the Lagrangian dual variables as dynamic inputs to the scheduling policy, the GNN can be trained to gradually adapt the scheduling decisions to achieve the minimum transmission requirements. We verify the efficacy of our proposed policy through numerical simulations and compare its performance with several baselines in various network settings.</description>

      <title>Approximate MLE of High-Dimensional STAP Covariance Matrices with Banded &amp; Spiked Structure -- A Convex Relaxation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the clutter-plus-noise covariance matrix in high-dimensional STAP is challenging in the presence of Internal Clutter Motion (ICM) and a high noise floor. The problem becomes more difficult in low-sample regimes, where the Sample Covariance Matrix (SCM) becomes ill-conditioned. To capture the ICM and high noise floor, we model the covariance matrix using a ``Banded+Spiked'' structure. Since the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for this model is non-convex, we propose a convex relaxation which is formulated as a Frobenius norm minimization with non-smooth convex constraints enforcing banded sparsity. This relaxation serves as a provable upper bound for the non-convex likelihood maximization and extends to cases where the covariance matrix dimension exceeds the number of samples. We derive a variational inequality-based bound to assess its quality. We introduce a novel algorithm to jointly estimate the banded clutter covariance and noise power. Additionally, we establish conditions ensuring the estimated covariance matrix remains positive definite and the bandsize is accurately recovered. Numerical results using the high-fidelity RFView radar simulation environment demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a higher Signal-to-Clutter-plus-Noise Ratio (SCNR) than state-of-the-art methods, including TABASCO, Spiked Covariance Stein Shrinkage, and Diagonal Loading, particularly when the covariance matrix dimension exceeds the number of samples.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase in utilization of smart home technologies has introduced new paradigms to ensure the security and privacy of inhabitants. In this study, we propose a novel approach to detect and localize physical intrusions in indoor environments. The proposed method leverages signals from access points (APs) and an anchor node (AN) to achieve accurate intrusion detection and localization. We evaluate its performance through simulations under different intruder scenarios. The proposed method achieved a high accuracy of 92% for both intrusion detection and localization. Our simulations demonstrated a low false positive rate of less than 5% and a false negative rate of around 3%, highlighting the reliability of our approach in identifying security threats while minimizing unnecessary alerts. This performance underscores the effectiveness of integrating Wi-Fi sensing with advanced signal processing techniques for enhanced smart home security.</description>

      <title>SmartUT: Receive Beamforming for Spectral Coexistence of NGSO Satellite Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate downlink co-frequency interference (CFI) mitigation in non-geostationary satellites orbits (NGSOs) co-existing systems. Traditional mitigation techniques, such as Zero-forcing (ZF), produce a null towards the direction of arrivals (DOAs) of the interfering signals, but they suffer from high computational complexity due to matrix inversions and required knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, adaptive beamformers, such as sample matrix inversion (SMI)-based minimum variance, provide poor performance when the available snapshots are limited. We propose a Mamba-based beamformer (MambaBF) that leverages an unsupervised deep learning (DL) approach and can be deployed on the user terminal (UT) antenna array, for assisting downlink beamforming and CFI mitigation using only a limited number of available array snapshots as input, and without CSI knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate that MambaBF consistently outperforms conventional beamforming techniques in mitigating interference and maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), particularly under challenging conditions characterized by low SINR, limited snapshots, and imperfect CSI.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Wideband XL-MIMO: A Constrained Deep Unrolling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multipleoutput (XL-MIMO) enables the formation of narrow beams, effectively mitigating path loss in high-frequency communications. This capability makes the integration of wideband high-frequency communications with XL-MIMO a key enabler for future 6G networks. Realizing the full potential of such wideband XL-MIMO systems critically depends on acquiring accurate channel state information. However, this acquisition is significantly challenged by inherent wideband XLMIMO channel characteristics, including near-field propagation effects, beam split, and spatial non-stationarity. We formulate the channel estimation as a maximum a posteriori problem and propose an unrolled proximal gradient descent network. The network integrates learnable step sizes and replaces the proximal operator with a neural network to implicitly learn channel prior knowledge without requiring explicit regularization terms. To enhance the convergence behavior, we incorporated a monotonic descent constraint on the layer-wise estimation error during training. This constrained learning problem is addressed using a primal-dual training approach. Theoretical analysis is provided to characterize the duality gap and convergence behavior of the proposed method. Furthermore, simulation results are presented to validate its effectiveness, demonstrating gains in estimation accuracy over both traditional and deep learning-based methods.</description>

      <title>When Near Becomes Far: From Rayleigh to Optimal Near-Field and Far-Field Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition toward 6G is pushing wireless communication into a regime where the classical plane-wave assumption no longer holds. Millimeter-wave and sub-THz frequencies shrink wavelengths to millimeters, while meter-scale arrays featuring hundreds of antenna elements dramatically enlarge the aperture. Together, these trends collapse the classical Rayleigh far-field boundary from kilometers to mere single-digit meters. Consequently, most practical 6G indoor, vehicular, and industrial deployments will inherently operate within the radiating near-field, where reliance on the plane-wave approximation leads to severe array-gain losses, degraded localization accuracy, and excessive pilot overhead. This paper re-examines the fundamental question: Where does the far-field truly begin? Rather than adopting purely geometric definitions, we introduce an application-oriented approach based on user-defined error budgets and a rigorous Fresnel-zone analysis that fully accounts for both amplitude and phase curvature. We propose three practical mismatch metrics: worst-case element mismatch, worst-case normalized mean square error, and spectral efficiency loss. For each metric, we derive a provably optimal transition distance--the minimal range beyond which mismatch permanently remains below a given tolerance--and provide closed-form solutions. Extensive numerical evaluations across diverse frequencies and antenna-array dimensions show that our proposed thresholds can exceed the Rayleigh distance by more than an order of magnitude. By transforming the near-field from a design nuisance into a precise, quantifiable tool, our results provide a clear roadmap for enabling reliable and resource-efficient near-field communications and sensing in emerging 6G systems.</description>

      <title>OpenSky Report 2025: Improving Crowdsourced Flight Trajectories with ADS-C Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The OpenSky Network has been collecting and providing crowdsourced air traffic surveillance data since 2013. The network has primarily focused on Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Broadcast (ADS-B) data, which provides high-frequency position updates over terrestrial areas. However, the ADS-B signals are limited over oceans and remote regions, where ground-based receivers are scarce. To address these coverage gaps, the OpenSky Network has begun incorporating data from the Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Contract (ADS-C) system, which uses satellite communication to track aircraft positions over oceanic regions and remote areas. In this paper, we analyze a dataset of over 720,000 ADS-C messages collected in 2024 from around 2,600 unique aircraft via the Alphasat satellite, covering Europe, Africa, and parts of the Atlantic Ocean. We present our approach to combining ADS-B and ADS-C data to construct detailed long-haul flight paths, particularly for transatlantic and African routes. Our findings demonstrate that this integration significantly improves trajectory reconstruction accuracy, allowing for better fuel consumption and emissions estimates. We illustrate how combined data captures flight patterns across previously underrepresented regions across Africa. Despite coverage limitations, this work marks an important advancement in providing open access to global flight trajectory data, enabling new research opportunities in air traffic management, environmental impact assessment, and aviation safety.</description>

      <title>Edge-Optimized Deep Learning &amp; Pattern Recognition Techniques for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring of Energy Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing global energy demand and the urgent need for sustainability call for innovative ways to boost energy efficiency. While advanced energy-saving systems exist, they often fall short without user engagement. Providing feedback on energy consumption behavior is key to promoting sustainable practices. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a promising solution by disaggregating total household energy usage, recorded by a central smart meter, into appliance-level data. This empowers users to optimize consumption. Advances in AI, IoT, and smart meter adoption have further enhanced NILM's potential.
  Despite this promise, real-world NILM deployment faces major challenges. First, existing datasets mainly represent regions like the USA and UK, leaving places like the Mediterranean underrepresented. This limits understanding of regional consumption patterns, such as heavy use of air conditioners and electric water heaters. Second, deep learning models used in NILM require high computational power, often relying on cloud services. This increases costs, raises privacy concerns, and limits scalability, especially for households with poor connectivity. This thesis tackles these issues with key contributions. It presents an interoperable data collection framework and introduces the Plegma Dataset, focused on underrepresented Mediterranean energy patterns. It also explores advanced deep neural networks and model compression techniques for efficient edge deployment. By bridging theoretical advances with practical needs, this work aims to make NILM scalable, efficient, and adaptable for global energy sustainability.</description>

      <title>Prompting Large Language Models for Training-Free Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate aggregate household electricity consumption into individual appliance usage, enabling more effective energy management. While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we introduce the first prompt-based NILM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with in-context learning. We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features, timestamps and contextual information, as well as representative time-series examples, using the REDD dataset. With optimized prompts, LLMs achieve competitive state detection accuracy, reaching an average F1-score of 0.676 on unseen households, and demonstrate robust generalization without the need for fine-tuning. LLMs also enhance interpretability by providing clear, human-readable explanations for their predictions. Our results show that LLMs can reduce data requirements, improve adaptability, and provide transparent energy disaggregation in NILM applications.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Data Description for LoRaWAN Path Loss Measurements in an Indoor Office Setting: Effects of Environmental Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive dataset of LoRaWAN technology path loss measurements collected in an indoor office environment, focusing on quantifying the effects of environmental factors on signal propagation. Utilizing a network of six strategically placed LoRaWAN end devices (EDs) and a single indoor gateway (GW) at the University of Siegen, City of Siegen, Germany, we systematically measured signal strength indicators such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) under various environmental conditions, including temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) concentration, barometric pressure, and particulate matter levels (PM$_{2.5}$). Our empirical analysis confirms that transient phenomena such as reflections, scattering, interference, occupancy patterns (induced by environmental parameter variations), and furniture rearrangements can alter signal attenuation by as much as 10.58 dB, highlighting the dynamic nature of indoor propagation. As an example of how this dataset can be utilized, we tested and evaluated a refined Log-Distance Path Loss and Shadowing Model that integrates both structural obstructions (Multiple Walls) and Environmental Parameters (LDPLSM-MW-EP). Compared to a baseline model that considers only Multiple Walls (LDPLSM-MW), the enhanced approach reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) from 10.58 dB to 8.04 dB and increased the coefficient of determination (R$^2$) from 0.6917 to 0.8222. By capturing the extra effects of environmental conditions and occupancy dynamics, this improved model provides valuable insights for optimizing power usage and prolonging device battery life, enhancing network reliability in indoor Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, among other applications. This dataset offers a solid foundation for future research and development in indoor wireless communication.</description>

Abstract: Distribution feeder and load model reduction methods are essential for maintaining a good tradeoff between accurate representation of grid behavior and reduced computational complexity in power system studies. An effective algorithm to obtain a reduced order representation of the practical feeders using utility topological and loading data has been presented in this paper. Simulations conducted in this work show that the reduced feeder and load model of a utility feeder, obtained using the proposed method, can accurately capture contactor and motor stalling behaviors for critical events such as fault induced delayed voltage recovery.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Contract Theory for Edge AIGC Services in Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced AI-Generated Content (AIGC) technologies have injected new impetus into teleoperation, further enhancing its security and efficiency. Edge AIGC networks have been introduced to meet the stringent low-latency requirements of teleoperation. However, the inherent uncertainty of AIGC service quality and the need to incentivize AIGC service providers (ASPs) make the design of a robust incentive mechanism essential. This design is particularly challenging due to both uncertainty and information asymmetry, as teleoperators have limited knowledge of the remaining resource capacities of ASPs. To this end, we propose a distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based contract theory to design robust reward schemes for AIGC task offloading. Notably, our work extends the contract theory by integrating DRO, addressing the fundamental challenge of contract design under uncertainty. In this paper, contract theory is employed to model the information asymmetry, while DRO is utilized to capture the uncertainty in AIGC service quality. Given the inherent complexity of the original DRO-based contract theory problem, we reformulate it into an equivalent, tractable bi-level optimization problem. To efficiently solve this problem, we develop a Block Coordinate Descent (BCD)-based algorithm to derive robust reward schemes. Simulation results on our unity-based teleoperation platform demonstrate that the proposed method improves teleoperator utility by 2.7\% to 10.74\% under varying degrees of AIGC service quality shifts and increases ASP utility by 60.02\% compared to the SOTA method, i.e., Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based contract theory. The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/Zijun0819/DRO-Contract-Theory.</description>

      <title>Beyond Identity: A Generalizable Approach for Deepfake Audio Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfake audio presents a growing threat to digital security, due to its potential for social engineering, fraud, and identity misuse. However, existing detection models suffer from poor generalization across datasets, due to implicit identity leakage, where models inadvertently learn speaker-specific features instead of manipulation artifacts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly analyze and address identity leakage in the audio deepfake detection domain. This work proposes an identity-independent audio deepfake detection framework that mitigates identity leakage by encouraging the model to focus on forgery-specific artifacts instead of overfitting to speaker traits. Our approach leverages Artifact Detection Modules (ADMs) to isolate synthetic artifacts in both time and frequency domains, enhancing cross-dataset generalization. We introduce novel dynamic artifact generation techniques, including frequency domain swaps, time domain manipulations, and background noise augmentation, to enforce learning of dataset-invariant features. Extensive experiments conducted on ASVspoof2019, ADD 2022, FoR, and In-The-Wild datasets demonstrate that the proposed ADM-enhanced models achieve F1 scores of 0.230 (ADD 2022), 0.604 (FoR), and 0.813 (In-The-Wild), consistently outperforming the baseline. Dynamic Frequency Swap proves to be the most effective strategy across diverse conditions. These findings emphasize the value of artifact-based learning in mitigating implicit identity leakage for more generalizable audio deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>Rate-Matching Deep Polar Codes via Polar Coded Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep polar codes are pre-transformed polar codes that employ a multi-layered polar kernel transformation strategy to enhance code performance in short blocklength regimes. However, like conventional polar codes, their block length is constrained to powers of two, as the final transformation layer uses a conventional polar kernel matrix. This paper introduces a novel rate-matching technique for deep polar codes using code extension, particularly effective when the desired code length slightly exceeds a power of two. The key idea is to exploit the layered structure of deep polar codes by concatenating polar codewords generated at each transformation layer. Based on this structure, we also develop an efficient decoding algorithm leveraging soft-output successive cancellation list decoding and provide comprehensive error probability analysis supporting our code design algorithms. Additionally, we propose a computationally efficient greedy algorithm for multi-layer configurations. Extensive simulations confirm that our approach delivers substantial coding gains over conventional rate-matching methods, especially in medium to high code-rate regimes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fault Detection in WSN Based on PCA-Optimized Deep Neural Network Slicing Trained with GOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is crucial for reliable data transmission and network longevity. Traditional fault detection methods often struggle with optimizing deep neural networks (DNNs) for efficient performance, especially in handling high-dimensional data and capturing nonlinear relationships. Additionally, these methods typically suffer from slow convergence and difficulty in finding optimal network architectures using gradient-based optimization. This study proposes a novel hybrid method combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a DNN optimized by the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) to address these limitations. Our approach begins by computing eigenvalues from the original 12-dimensional dataset and sorting them in descending order. The cumulative sum of these values is calculated, retaining principal components until 99.5% variance is achieved, effectively reducing dimensionality to 4 features while preserving critical information. This compressed representation trains a six-layer DNN where GOA optimizes the network architecture, overcoming backpropagation's limitations in discovering nonlinear relationships. This hybrid PCA-GOA-DNN framework compresses the data and trains a six-layer DNN that is optimized by GOA, enhancing both training efficiency and fault detection accuracy. The dataset used in this study is a real-world WSNs dataset developed by the University of North Carolina, which was used to evaluate the proposed method's performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach achieves a remarkable 99.72% classification accuracy, with exceptional precision and recall, outperforming conventional methods. The method is computationally efficient, making it suitable for large-scale WSN deployments, and represents a significant advancement in fault detection for resource-constrained WSNs.</description>

      <title>Robust Movable-Antenna Position Optimization with Imperfect CSI for MISO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a promising solution for reconfiguring wireless channel conditions through local antenna movement within confined regions. Unlike previous works assuming perfect channel state information (CSI), this letter addresses the robust MA position optimization problem under imperfect CSI conditions for a multiple-input single-output (MISO) MA system. Specifically, we consider two types of CSI errors: norm-bounded and randomly distributed errors, aiming to maximize the worst-case and non-outage received signal power, respectively. For norm-bounded CSI errors, we derive the worst-case received signal power in closed-form. For randomly distributed CSI errors, due to the intractability of the probabilistic constraints, we apply the Bernstein-type inequality to obtain a closed-form lower bound for the non-outage received signal power. Based on these results, we show the optimality of the maximum-ratio transmission for imperfect CSI in both scenarios and employ a graph-based algorithm to obtain the optimal MA positions. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme can even outperform other benchmark schemes implemented under perfect CSI conditions.</description>

      <title>OPTIKS: Optimized Gradient Properties Through Timing in K-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A customizable method (OPTIKS) for designing fast trajectory-constrained gradient waveforms with optimized time domain properties was developed. Given a specified multidimensional k-space trajectory, the method optimizes traversal speed (and therefore timing) with position along the trajectory. OPTIKS facilitates optimization of objectives dependent on the time domain gradient waveform and the arc-length domain k-space speed. OPTIKS is applied to design waveforms which limit peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), minimize mechanical resonance excitation, and reduce acoustic noise. A variety of trajectory examples are presented including spirals, circular echo-planar-imaging, and rosettes. Design performance is evaluated based on duration, standardized PNS models, field measurements, gradient coil back-EMF measurements, and calibrated acoustic measurements. We show reductions in back-EMF of up to 94% and field oscillations up to 91.1%, acoustic noise decreases of up to 9.22 dB, and with efficient use of PNS models speed increases of up to 11.4%. The design method implementation is made available as an open source Python package through GitHub.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Optimization of Wave-Controlled Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A promising type of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) employs tunable control of its varactors using biasing transmission lines below the RIS reflecting elements. Biasing standing waves (BSWs) are excited by a time-periodic signal and sampled at each RIS element to create a desired biasing voltage and control the reflection coefficients of the elements. A simple rectifier can be used to sample the voltages and capture the peaks of the BSWs over time. Like other types of RIS, attempting to model and accurately configure a wave-controlled RIS is extremely challenging due to factors such as device non-linearities, frequency dependence, element coupling, etc., and thus significant differences will arise between the actual and assumed performance. An alternative approach to solving this problem is data-driven: Using training data obtained by sampling the reflected radiation pattern of the RIS for a set of BSWs, a neural network (NN) is designed to create an input-output map between the BSW amplitudes and the resulting sampled radiation pattern. This is the approach discussed in this paper. In the proposed approach, the NN is optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the error between the predicted and measured radiation patterns. The BSW amplitudes are then designed via Simulated Annealing (SA) to optimize a signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio measure by iteratively forward-propagating the BSW amplitudes through the NN and using its output as feedback to determine convergence. The resulting optimal solutions are stored in a lookup table to be used both as settings to instantly configure the RIS and as a basis for determining more complex radiation patterns.</description>

      <title>ALPCAH: Subspace Learning for Sample-wise Heteroscedastic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data dimensionality reduction. However, some applications involve heterogeneous data that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This paper develops a subspace learning method, named ALPCAH, that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of the subspace basis associated with the low-rank structure of the data. Our method makes no distributional assumptions of the low-rank component and does not assume that the noise variances are known. Further, this method uses a soft rank constraint that does not require subspace dimension to be known. Additionally, this paper develops a matrix factorized version of ALPCAH, named LR-ALPCAH, that is much faster and more memory efficient at the cost of requiring subspace dimension to be known or estimated. Simulations and real data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data heteroscedasticity compared to existing algorithms.

      <title>High Performance Signal Design for ACO-OFDM Systems using Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes a design of low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), low symbol error rate (SER), and high data rate signal for asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) systems. The proposed design leverages a variational autoencoder (VAE) incorporating gradual loss learning to jointly optimize the geometry and probability of the constellation's symbols. This not only enhances mutual information (MI) but also effectively reduces the PAPR while maintaining a low SER for reliable transmission. We evaluate the performance of the proposed VAE-based design by comparing the MI, SER, and PAPR against existing techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a considerably lower PAPR while maintaining superior SER and MI performance for a wide range of SNRs.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for NOMA-Assisted Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pinching-antenna architecture has emerged as a promising solution for reconfiguring wireless propagation environments and enhancing system performance. While prior research has primarily focused on sum-rate maximization or transmit power minimization of pinching-antenna systems, the critical aspect of energy efficiency (EE) has received limited attention. Given the increasing importance of EE in future wireless communication networks, this work investigates EE optimization in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted multi-user pinching-antenna uplink system. The problem entails the joint optimization of the users' transmit power and the pinching-antenna position. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex due to tightly coupled variables. To tackle this, we employ an alternating optimization framework to decompose the original problem into two subproblems: one focusing on power allocation and the other on antenna positioning. A low-complexity optimal solution is derived for the power allocation subproblem, while the pinching-antenna positioning subproblem is addressed using a particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain a high-quality near-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms both conventional-antenna configurations and orthogonal multiple access-based pinching-antenna systems in terms of EE.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS) Aided Over-the-air Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) enables fast data aggregation for edge intelligence applications. However the performance of AirComp can be severely degraded by channel misalignments. Pinching antenna systems (PASS) have recently emerged as a promising solution for physically reshaping favorable wireless channels to reduce misalignments and thus AirComp errors, via low-cost, fully passive, and highly reconfigurable antenna deployment. Motivated by these benefits, we propose a novel PASS-aided AirComp system that introduces new design degrees of freedom through flexible pinching antenna (PA) placement. To improve performance, we consider a mean squared error (MSE) minimization problem by jointly optimizing the PA position, transmit power, and decoding vector. To solve this highly non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization based framework with Gauss-Seidel based PA position updates. Simulation results show that our proposed joint PA position and communication design significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes in AirComp accuracy.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Localization in OFDM Systems with Carrier Frequency Offset and Phase Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12534v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication systems have been extensively studied for providing high-precision location services. However, most studies have overlooked the impact of carrier frequency offset (CFO) and phase noise (PN) resulting from hardware impairments on localization. This paper presents a novel, alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm to jointly estimate the CFO, PN, and user equipment (UE) position in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, where, provided the UE position, closed-form expressions for the CFO and PN are derived per iteration, significantly reducing the complexity and enhancing the stability of the algorithm. Another important aspect is a new RIS phase shift optimization algorithm developed to minimize the analytical lower bound of localization accuracy, hence benefiting localization. The semidefinite relaxation method and Schur complement are utilized to convexify this challenging non-convex optimization problem to a semidefinite program. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, with the localization accuracy enhanced by two orders of magnitude. The localization accuracy of the proposed algorithm is close to the analytical lower bound, with a root mean square error of lower than $\rm 10^{-2} \: m$.</description>

      <title>Sparse Regression Codes for Non-coherent SIMO channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by hyper-reliable low-latency communication in 6G, we consider error control coding for short block lengths in multi-antenna fading channels. In general, the channel fading coefficients are unknown at both the transmitter and receiver, which is referred to as non-coherent channels. Conventionally, pilot symbols are transmitted to facilitate channel estimation, causing power and bandwidth overhead. Our paper considers sparse regression codes (SPARCs) for non-coherent flat-fading channels without using pilots. We develop a novel greedy decoder for SPARC using maximum likelihood principles, referred to as maximum likelihood matching pursuit (MLMP). MLMP works based on successive combining principles as opposed to conventional greedy algorithms, which are based on successive cancellation. We also obtain the noiseless perfect recovery condition for our successive combining algorithm. In addition, we develop an approximate message passing (AMP) SPARC decoder for the non-coherent flat fading model. Using simulation studies, we show that the MLMP decoder for SPARC outperforms AMP and other greedy decoders. Also, SPARC with MLMP decoder outperforms polar codes employing pilot-based channel estimation and polar codes with non-coherent decoders.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with MIMO VLC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper centers around a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) system, where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) benefits from a light emitting diode (LED) array to serve photo-diode (PD)-equipped users for illumination and communication simultaneously. Concerning the battery limitation of the UAV and considerable energy consumption of the LED array, a hybrid dimming control scheme is devised at the UAV that effectively controls the number of glared LEDs and thereby mitigates the overall energy consumption. To assess the performance of this system, a radio resource allocation problem is accordingly formulated for jointly optimizing the motion trajectory, transmit beamforming and LED selection at the UAV, assuming that channel state information (CSI) is partially available. By reformulating the optimization problem in Markov decision process (MDP) form, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC) mechanism that captures the dynamics of the problem and optimizes its parameters. Additionally, regarding the high mobility of the UAV and thus remarkable rearrangement of the system, we enhance the trained SAC model by integrating a meta-learning strategy that enables more adaptation to system variations. By defining energy efficiency as a trade-off between the data rate and power consumption, simulations verify that upgrading a single-LED UAV by an array of 10 LEDs, exhibits 47% and 34% improvements in data rate and energy efficiency, albeit at the expense of 8% more power consumption.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Beyond Diagonal RIS via Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the channel estimation problem for beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) from a tensor decomposition perspective. We first show that the received pilot signals can be arranged as a three-way tensor, allowing us to recast the cascaded channel estimation problem as a block Tucker decomposition problem that yields decoupled estimates for the involved channel matrices while offering a substantial performance gain over the conventional (matrix-based) least squares (LS) estimation method. More specifically, we develop two solutions to solve the problem. The first one is a closed-form solution that extracts the channel estimates via a block Tucker Kronecker factorization (BTKF), which boils down to solving a set of parallel rank-one matrix approximation problems. Exploiting such a low-rank property yields a noise rejection gain compared to the standard LS estimation scheme while allowing the two involved channels to be estimated separately. The second solution is based on a block Tucker alternating least squares (BTALS) algorithm that directly estimates the involved channel matrices using an iterative estimation procedure. We discuss the uniqueness and identifiability issues and their implications for training design. We also propose a tensor-based design of the BD-RIS training tensor for each algorithm that ensures unique decoupled channel estimates under trivial scaling ambiguities. Our numerical results shed light on the tradeoffs offered by BTKF and BTALS methods. Specifically, while the first enjoys fast and parallel extraction of the channel estimates in closed form, the second has a more flexible training design, allowing for a significantly reduced training overhead compared to the state-of-the-art LS method.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Downlink Transmit Precoding for Mitigating the Impact of Delayed CSI in Satellite Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites with terrestrial communication networks holds the promise of seamless global connectivity. The efficiency of this connection, however, depends on the availability of reliable channel state information (CSI). Due to the large space-ground propagation delays, the estimated CSI is outdated. In this paper we consider the downlink of a satellite operating as a base station in support of multiple mobile users. The estimated outdated CSI is used at the satellite side to design a transmit precoding (TPC) matrix for the downlink. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to optimize the TPC matrices, with the goal of maximizing the achievable data rate. We utilize the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to handle the continuous action space, and we employ state augmentation techniques to deal with the delayed observations and rewards. We show that the DRL agent is capable of exploiting the time-domain correlations of the channels for constructing accurate TPC matrices. This is because the proposed method is capable of compensating for the effects of delayed CSI in different frequency bands. Furthermore, we study the effect of handovers in the system, and show that the DRL agent is capable of promptly adapting to the environment when a handover occurs.</description>

      <title>Automotive Speed Estimation: Sensor Types and Error Characteristics from OBD-II to ADAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern on-road navigation systems heavily depend on integrating speed measurements with inertial navigation systems (INS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Telemetry-based applications typically source speed data from the On-Board Diagnostic II (OBD-II) system. However, the method of deriving speed, as well as the types of sensors used to measure wheel speed, differs across vehicles. These differences result in varying error characteristics that must be accounted for in navigation and autonomy applications. This paper addresses this gap by examining the diverse speed-sensing technologies employed in standard automotive systems and alternative techniques used in advanced systems designed for higher levels of autonomy, such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Autonomous Driving (AD), or surveying applications. We propose a method to identify the type of speed sensor in a vehicle and present strategies for accurately modeling its error characteristics. To validate our approach, we collected and analyzed data from three long real road trajectories conducted in urban environments in Toronto and Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The results underscore the critical role of integrating multiple sensor modalities to achieve more accurate speed estimation, thus improving automotive navigation state estimation, particularly in GNSS-denied environments.</description>

      <title>RadioLLM: Introducing Large Language Model into Cognitive Radio via Hybrid Prompt and Token Reprogrammings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing scarcity of spectrum resources and rapid proliferation of wireless devices make efficient radio network management critical. While deep learning-enhanced Cognitive Radio Technology (CRT) provides promising solutions for tasks such as radio signal classification (RSC), denoising, and spectrum allocation, existing DL-based CRT frameworks are typically task-specific and lack scalability in diverse real-world applications. This limitation naturally leads to the exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs), whose exceptional cross-domain generalization capabilities offer new potential for advancing CRT. To bridge this gap, we propose RadioLLM, a novel framework that integrates Hybrid Prompt and Token Reprogramming (HPTR) for combining radio signal features with expert knowledge, and a Frequency-Attuned Fusion (FAF) module for enhanced high-frequency feature modeling. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that RadioLLM achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines in the majority of testing scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The lunar Gateway is a complex system-of-systems (SoS) requiring secure, resilient integration of all its systems. This paper develops controls for its early systems to secure command and data handling (C&amp;DH) and evaluates their effectiveness through a case study on collision impact propagation originating from Canadarm3.

      <description>arXiv:2502.17914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by the pursuit of gigabit-per-second data speeds for future 6G mobile networks, in addition to the support of sensing and artificial intelligence applications, the industry is expanding beyond crowded sub-6 GHz bands with innovative new spectrum allocations. In this paper, we chart a compelling vision for 6G within the frequency range 3 (FR3) spectrum, i.e. $7.125$-$24.25$ $\GHz$, by delving into its key enablers and addressing the multifaceted challenges that lie ahead for these new frequency bands. Here we highlight the physical properties of this \textcolor{black}{never-before} used spectrum by reviewing recent channel measurements for outdoor and indoor environments, including path loss, delay and angular spreads, and material penetration loss, all which offer insights that underpin future 5G/6G wireless communication designs. Building on the fundamental knowledge of the channel properties, we explore FR3 spectrum agility strategies that balance coverage and capacity (e.g. data rate) tradeoffs, while also examining coexistence with incumbent systems, such as satellites, radio astronomy, and earth exploration. Moreover, we discuss the potential of massive multiple-input multiple-output, compact and digital architectures, and evaluate the potential of multiband sensing for FR3 integrated sensing and communications. Finally, we outline 6G standardization features that are likely to emerge from 3GPP radio frame innovations and open radio access network developments.</description>

      <title>Discrete Codebook Design for Self-interference Suppression in mmWave ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents discrete codebook synthesis methods for self-interference (SI) suppression in a mmWave device, designed to support FD ISAC. We formulate a SINR maximization problem that optimizes the RX and TX codewords, aimed at suppressing the near-field SI signal while maintaining the beamforming gain in the far-field sensing directions. The formulation considers the practical constraints of discrete RX and TX codebooks with quantized phase settings, as well as a TX beamforming gain requirement in the specified communication direction. Under an alternating optimization framework, the RX and TX codewords are iteratively optimized, with one fixed while the other is optimized. When the TX codeword is fixed, we show that the RX codeword optimization problem can be formulated as an integer quadratic fractional programming (IQFP) problem. Using Dinkelbach's algorithm, we transform the problem into a sequence of subproblems in which the numerator and the denominator of the objective function are decoupled. These subproblems, subject to discrete constraints, are then efficiently solved by the spherical search (SS) method. This overall approach is referred to as FP-SS. When the RX codeword is fixed, the TX codeword optimization problem can similarly be formulated as an IQFP problem, whereas an additional TX beamforming constraint for communication needs to be considered. The problem is solved through Dinkelbach's transformation followed by the constrained spherical search (CSS), and we refer to this approach as FP-CSS. Finally, we integrate the FP-SS and FP-CSS methods into a joint RX-TX codebook design approach. Simulations show that, the proposed FP-SS and FP-CSS achieve the same SI suppression performance as the corresponding exhaustive search method, but with much lower complexity. Furthermore, the alternating optimization framework achieved even better SI suppression performance.</description>

      <title>The stability of generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups aims to recover a set of matrices, representing an unknown signal, from their associated Gram matrices, leveraging prior structural knowledge about the signal. This framework generalizes the classical phase retrieval problem, which reconstructs a signal from the magnitudes of its Fourier transform, to a richer setting involving non-abelian compact groups. In this broader context, the unknown phases in Fourier space are replaced by unknown orthogonal matrices that arise from the action of a compact group on a finite-dimensional vector space. This problem is primarily motivated by advances in electron microscopy to determining the 3D structure of biological macromolecules from highly noisy observations. To capture realistic assumptions from machine learning and signal processing, we model the signal as belonging to one of several broad structural families: a generic linear subspace, a sparse representation in a generic basis, the output of a generic ReLU neural network, or a generic low-dimensional manifold. Our main result shows that, under mild conditions, the generalized phase retrieval problem not only admits a unique solution (up to inherent group symmetries), but also satisfies a bi-Lipschitz property. This implies robustness to both noise and model mismatch, an essential requirement for practical use, especially when measurements are severely corrupted by noise. These findings provide theoretical support for a wide class of scientific problems under modern structural assumptions, and they offer strong foundations for developing robust algorithms in high-noise regimes.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic detection of GNSS spoofing using opportunistic information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are integrated into many devices. However, civilian GNSS signals are usually not cryptographically protected. This makes attacks that forge signals relatively easy. Considering modern devices often have network connections and onboard sensors, the proposed here Probabilistic Detection of GNSS Spoofing (PDS) scheme is based on such opportunistic information. PDS has at its core two parts. First, a regression problem with motion model constraints, which equalizes the noise of all locations considering the motion model of the device. Second, a Gaussian process, that analyzes statistical properties of location data to construct uncertainty. Then, a likelihood function, that fuses the two parts, as a basis for a Neyman-Pearson lemma (NPL)-based detection strategy. Our experimental evaluation shows a performance gain over the state-of-the-art, in terms of attack detection effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Contaminated Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection with Spatio-Temporal Graph Conditional Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12563v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often excel in academic datasets, yet their real-world performance is restricted due to the controlled experimental conditions involving clean training data. Addressing the challenge of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the training data is contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase. TSAD-C encompasses three core modules: a Decontaminator to rectify anomalies (aka noise) present during training, a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that is considered as a surrogate of the pure normal data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies from all types. Our extensive experiments conducted on four reliable and diverse datasets conclusively demonstrate that TSAD-C surpasses existing methodologies, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.</description>

Abstract: Near-space information networks (NSINs) composed of high-altitude platforms (HAPs) and high- and low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a new regime for providing quick, robust, and cost-efficient sensing and communication services. Precipitated by innovations and breakthroughs in manufacturing, materials, communications, electronics, and control techniques, NSINs have been envisioned as an essential component of the emerging sixth-generation of mobile communication systems. This article reveals some critical issues needing to be tackled in NSINs through conducting experiments and discusses the latest advances in NSINs in the research areas of channel modeling, networking, and transmission from a forward-looking, comparative, and technical evolutionary perspective. In this article, we highlight the characteristics of NSINs and present the promising use cases of NSINs. The impact of airborne platforms' unstable movements on the phase delays of onboard antenna arrays with diverse structures is mathematically analyzed. The recent advances in HAP channel modeling are elaborated on, along with the significant differences between HAP and UAV channel modeling. A comprehensive review of the networking techniques of NSINs in network deployment, handoff management, and network management aspects is provided. Besides, the promising techniques and communication protocols of the physical (PHY) layer, medium access control (MAC) layer, network layer, and transport layer of NSINs for achieving efficient transmission over NSINs are reviewed, and we have conducted experiments with practical NSINs to verify the performance of some techniques. Finally, we outline some open issues and promising directions for NSINs deserved for future study and discuss the corresponding challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-linear activation functions are crucial in Convolutional Neural Networks. However, until now they have not been well described in the frequency domain. In this work, we study the spectral behavior of ReLU, a popular activation function. We use the ReLU's Taylor expansion to derive its frequency domain behavior. We demonstrate that ReLU introduces higher frequency oscillations in the signal and a constant DC component. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of this DC component, where we demonstrate that it helps the model extract meaningful features related to the input frequency content. We accompany our theoretical derivations with experiments and real-world examples. First, we numerically validate our frequency response model. Then we observe ReLU's spectral behavior on two example models and a real-world one. Finally, we experimentally investigate the role of the DC component introduced by ReLU in the CNN's representations. Our results indicate that the DC helps to converge to a weight configuration that is close to the initial random weights.</description>

      <title>Finite-Alphabet-Aware Trajectory and Precoder Optimization for UAV Relaying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become key enablers in relay-assisted wireless communications thanks to their flexibility and line-of-sight channel advantage. However, most existing trajectory optimization frameworks assume ideal Gaussian inputs, overlooking the fact that practical wireless systems rely on structured, finite-alphabet constellations. This mismatch can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes misleading, design choices. In this paper, we challenge that convention by introducing a finite-alphabet-aware framework for joint trajectory and precoder optimization in UAV-assisted relay systems. We formulate a non-convex design problem that directly accounts for discrete signal structures and propose an efficient solution based on alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal that strategies optimized under Gaussian assumptions can waste energy and degrade throughput in real deployments. In contrast, our approach adapts both the UAV's trajectory and transmission strategy to the underlying modulation format, delivering consistent performance gains under practical system constraints. This work takes a key step toward aligning UAV communication design with the realities of modern wireless systems: discrete signals, power limits, and intelligent mobility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable uplink connectivity remains a persistent challenge for IoT devices, particularly those at the cell edge, due to their limited transmit power and single-antenna configurations. This paper introduces a novel framework aimed at connecting the unconnectable, leveraging real-time feedback from access points (APs) to enhance uplink coverage without increasing the energy consumption of IoT devices. At the core of this approach are feedback channel codes, which enable IoT devices to dynamically adapt their transmission strategies based on AP decoding feedback, thereby reducing the critical uplink SNR required for successful communication. Analytical models are developed to quantify the coverage probability and the number of connectable APs, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's performance. Numerical results validate the proposed method, demonstrating substantial improvements in coverage range and connectivity, particularly for devices at the cell edge, with up to a 51% boost in connectable APs. Our approach offers a robust and energy-efficient solution to overcoming uplink coverage limitations, enabling IoT networks to connect devices in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13268v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pinching Antennas (PAs) represent a revolutionary flexible antenna technology that leverages dielectric waveguides and electromagnetic coupling to mitigate large-scale path loss. This letter is the first to explore channel estimation for Pinching-Antenna SyStems (PASS), addressing their uniquely ill-conditioned and underdetermined channel characteristics. In particular, two efficient deep learning-based channel estimators are proposed. 1) PAMoE: This estimator incorporates dynamic padding, feature embedding, fusion, and mixture of experts (MoE) modules, which effectively leverage the positional information of PAs and exploit expert diversity. 2) PAformer: This Transformer-style estimator employs the self-attention mechanism to predict channel coefficients in a per-antenna manner, which offers more flexibility to adaptively deal with dynamic numbers of PAs in practical deployment. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed deep learning-based channel estimators outperform conventional methods and exhibit excellent zero-shot learning capabilities, and 2) PAMoE delivers higher channel estimation accuracy via MoE specialization, while PAformer natively handles an arbitrary number of PAs, trading self-attention complexity for superior scalability.</description>

      <title>LightSNN: Lightweight Architecture Search for Sparse and Accurate Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly regarded for their energy efficiency, inherent activation sparsity, and suitability for real-time processing in edge devices. However, most current SNN methods adopt architectures resembling traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), leading to suboptimal performance when applied to SNNs. While SNNs excel in energy efficiency, they have been associated with lower accuracy levels than traditional ANNs when utilizing conventional architectures. In response, in this work we present LightSNN, a rapid and efficient Neural Network Architecture Search (NAS) technique specifically tailored for SNNs that autonomously leverages the most suitable architecture, striking a good balance between accuracy and efficiency by enforcing sparsity. Based on the spiking NAS network (SNASNet) framework, a cell-based search space including backward connections is utilized to build our training-free pruning-based NAS mechanism. Our technique assesses diverse spike activation patterns across different data samples using a sparsity-aware Hamming distance fitness evaluation. Thorough experiments are conducted on both static (CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and neuromorphic datasets (DVS128-Gesture). Our LightSNN model achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, improves performance on DVS128Gesture by 4.49\%, and significantly reduces search time most notably offering a $98\times$ speedup over SNASNet and running 30\% faster than the best existing method on DVS128Gesture.

      <title>Particle Gibbs without the Gibbs bit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exact parameter and trajectory inference in state-space models is typically achieved by one of two methods: particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) or particle Gibbs (PGibbs). PMMH is a pseudo-marginal algorithm which jointly proposes a new trajectory and parameter, and accepts or rejects both at once. PGibbs instead alternates between sampling from the trajectory, using an algorithm known as conditional sequential Monte Carlo (CSMC) and the parameter in a Hastings-within-Gibbs fashion. While particle independent Metropolis Hastings (PIMH), the parameter-free version of PMMH, is known to be statistically worse than CSMC, PGibbs can induce a slow mixing if the parameter and the state trajectory are very correlated. This has made PMMH the method of choice for many practitioners, despite theory and experiments favouring CSMC over PIMH for the parameter-free problem. In this article, we describe a formulation of PGibbs which bypasses the Gibbs step, essentially marginalizing over the trajectory distribution in a fashion similar to PMMH. This is achieved by considering the implementation of a CSMC algortihm for the state-space model integrated over the joint distribution of the current parameter and the parameter proposal. We illustrate the benefits of method on a simple example known to be challenging for PMMH.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-Assisted MU-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a disruptive technology, offering unprecedented degrees of freedom (DoF) for wireless communication systems. However, optimizing fluid antenna (FA) positions entails significant computational costs, especially when the number of FAs is large. To address this challenge, we introduce a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) architecture to FAS, which partitions the FA array into clusters and enables parallel processing. Based on the DBP architecture, we formulate a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem through joint beamforming and FA position design for FA-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. To solve the WSR maximization problem, we propose a novel decentralized block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based algorithm that leverages matrix fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) methods. The proposed decentralized algorithm achieves low computational, communication, and storage costs, thus unleashing the potential of the DBP architecture. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm under the DBP architecture reduces computational time by over 70% compared to centralized architectures with negligible WSR performance loss.</description>
