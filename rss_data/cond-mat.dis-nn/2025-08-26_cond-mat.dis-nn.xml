      <title>Species coexistence in the reinforcement learning paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central goal in ecology is to understand how biodiversity is maintained. Previous theoretical works have employed the rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game as a toy model, demonstrating that population mobility is crucial in determining the species' coexistence. One key prediction is that biodiversity is jeopardized and eventually lost when mobility exceeds a certain value--a conclusion at odds with empirical observations of highly mobile species coexisting in nature. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework and study a spatial RPS model, where individual mobility is adaptively regulated via a Q-learning algorithm rather than held fixed. Our results show that all three species can coexist stably, with extinction probabilities remaining low across a broad range of baseline migration rates. Mechanistic analysis reveals that individuals develop two behavioral tendencies: survival priority (escaping from predators) and predation priority (remaining near prey). While species coexistence emerges from the balance of the two tendencies, their imbalance jeopardizes biodiversity. Notably, there is a symmetry-breaking of action preference in a particular state that is responsible for the divergent species densities. Furthermore, when Q-learning species interact with fixed-mobility counterparts, those with adaptive mobility exhibit a significant evolutionary advantage. Our study suggests that reinforcement learning may offer a promising new perspective for uncovering the mechanisms of biodiversity and informing conservation strategies.</description>

      <title>Limits of message passing for node classification: How class-bottlenecks restrict signal-to-noise ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) are powerful models for node classification but suffer from performance limitations under heterophily (low same-class connectivity) and structural bottlenecks in the graph. We provide a unifying statistical framework exposing the relationship between heterophily and bottlenecks through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MPNN representations. The SNR decomposes model performance into feature-dependent parameters and feature-independent sensitivities. We prove that the sensitivity to class-wise signals is bounded by higher-order homophily -- a generalisation of classical homophily to multi-hop neighbourhoods -- and show that low higher-order homophily manifests locally as the interaction between structural bottlenecks and class labels (class-bottlenecks). Through analysis of graph ensembles, we provide a further quantitative decomposition of bottlenecking into underreaching (lack of depth implying signals cannot arrive) and oversquashing (lack of breadth implying signals arriving on fewer paths) with closed-form expressions. We prove that optimal graph structures for maximising higher-order homophily are disjoint unions of single-class and two-class-bipartite clusters. This yields BRIDGE, a graph ensemble-based rewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification accuracy across all homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on real-world benchmarks, by eliminating the ``mid-homophily pitfall'' where MPNNs typically struggle, surpassing current standard rewiring techniques from the literature. Our framework, whose code we make available for public use, provides both diagnostic tools for assessing MPNN performance, and simple yet effective methods for enhancing performance through principled graph modification.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of anomalous temperature dependence of resistivity in V-Al alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ is a representative example of highly resistive metallic alloys exhibiting a crossover to a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), known as the Mooij correlation. Despite numerous proposals to explain this anomalous behavior,none have provided a satisfactory quantitative explanation thus far. In this work, we calculate the electrical conductivity using an ab initio methodology that combines the Kubo-Greenwood formalism with the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The temperature dependence of the conductivity is obtained within a CPA-based model of thermal atomic vibrations. Using this approach, we observe the crossover to the negative TCR behavior in V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$, with the temperature coefficient following the Mooij correlation, which matches experimental observations in the intermediate-to-high temperature range.Analysis of the results allows us to clearly identify a non-Boltzmann contribution responsible for this behavior and describe it as a function of temperature and composition.</description>

      <title>Observation of hysteresis in an isolated quantum system of disordered Heisenberg spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find energy-dependent hysteresis in an isolated Heisenberg quantum spin system, similar to thermomagnetic hysteresis in canonical spin glasses in contact with a thermal reservoir. Analogous to zero-field cooling and field cooling in conventional magnetic materials, an annealing protocol is devised to control the energy in an isolated system. Depending on the strength of disorder, the susceptibilities at zero field bifurcate at a specific energy, which signals the presence of different magnetic regimes. This behavior is apparent both in a numerical simulation by exact diagonalization of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with twelve particles, as well as in an experiment with thousands of Rydberg atoms representing dipolar interacting quantum spins. The annealing protocols open a new path to explore the energy-dependent phase structure of spin systems at low energies. Our observation of a nonthermal metastable regime might indicate the existence of a phase transition to a novel state of isolated quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Problem hardness of diluted Ising models: Population Annealing versus Simulated Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Population annealing is a variant of the simulated annealing algorithm that improves the quality of the thermalization process in systems with rough free-energy landscapes by introducing a resampling process. We consider the diluted Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising model using population annealing to study its efficiency in finding solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. From this study, we find an easy-hard-easy transition in the model hardness as the problem instances become more diluted, and associate this behaviour to the clusterization and connectivity of the underlying Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. We calculate the efficiency of obtaining minimum energy configurations and find that population annealing outperforms simulated annealing for the cases close to this hardness peak while reaching similar efficiencies in the easy limits. Finally, it is known that population annealing can be used to define an adaptive inverse temperature annealing schedule. We compare this adaptive method to a linear schedule and find that the adaptive method achieves improved efficiencies while being robust against final temperature miscalibrations.</description>

      <title>Machine learning the local electronic density of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic density of states (DOS) plays a crucial role in determining and understanding materials properties. We investigate the machine learnability of additive atomic contributions to electronic DOS, focusing on atom-projected DOS rather than structural DOS. This approach for structure-property mapping is both scalable and transferable, and achieves high prediction accuracy for pure and compound silicon and carbon structures of various sizes and configurations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of this model to complex Sn-S-Se compound structures. Utilizing locally trained DOS is shown to significantly enhance the accuracy of predicting material properties, including band energy, Fermi energy, heat capacity, and magnetic susceptibility. Our findings indicate that directly learning atomic DOS, rather than structural DOS, improves the efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability of machine learning in structure-property mapping. This streamlined approach reduces computational complexity, paving the way for examination of electronic structures in materials without the need for computationally expensive ab initio calculations</description>

      <title>How do Probabilistic Graphical Models and Graph Neural Networks Look at Network Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility, the rate at which the relaxation time grows with decreasing temperature, is central to unravelling the glass transition. Fragility is often associated with dynamic heterogeneity, implying that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using: Lennard Jones (LJ) and Weeks Chandler Andersen (WCA) systems, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q,p) system, where fragility is varied by changing the potential softness. We define a structural order parameter based on a mean field caging potential and analyse energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic free energy barrier slope correlates with fragility, the microscopic free energy barrier does not show a consistent trend. Instead, it exhibits a strong correlation with a structure dynamics correlation measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble simulations. Interestingly, the two systems showing the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8,5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, large non Gaussian parameters, yet low four point susceptibilities, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation length and mobility contrast. Both systems lie in the enthalpy dominated regime and are close to the spinodal, pointing to mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. Our results reveal that structure dynamics correlation is more closely linked to the contrast in individual particle mobility than to the spatial extent of dynamic correlations that typically scale with fragility.</description>
