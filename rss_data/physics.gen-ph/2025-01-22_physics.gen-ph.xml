      <title>Induced spin velocity of the Earth and its influence to the seasonal variation of the Earth's angular velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the induced spin velocity in case of the Earth. Spin velocity is induced from the conversion of a constrained spatial rotation into a spatial displacement. Its effects on Earth as a celestial body are consequences of its properties and they are examined in detail. The induced spin velocity has influence to the semiannual variation of the length of day. The annual and semiannual variation of the length of day are considered separately. The measured value in case of the semiannual variation of the length of the day is 5.44% more than the predicted, while the measured value in case of the annual variation of the length of the day is 5.36% less than the predicted.</description>

      <title>What Exactly is Antimatter (Gravitationally Speaking)? A Second Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:2401.10954 I investigated the consequences of regarding the mass-energy of the fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) and the Intermediate Vector Bosons (e.g., photon) as matter, and the fundamental antifermions (antiquarks and antileptons) as antimatter within the context of an antigravity universe, one where matter and antimatter repel gravitationally. Here I consider an alternative scenario in which the Intermediate Vector Bosons, which are neither particle nor antiparticle, are gravitationally attracted to both fundamental fermions and antifermions. This leads to a prediction for the free-fall acceleration of antihydrogen of $a_{\bar{H}}=(0.78^{+0.11}_{-0.08})g$ as well as quite different expectations for the free-fall accelerations of the $\mu^+$ and positronium from those derived in the previous article. The cosmology which results from the premise presented here is little different from the standard cosmology (i.e., the $\Lambda$CDM model). One significant deviation is that there would be an increased accelerated expansion in the early moments after the Big Bang due to the gravitational repulsion between the fundamental fermions and antifermions.</description>

      <title>Matter in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new linear mapping of the linear vector space (LVS) of the octonions is suggested as an approach to the co-ordinatization of space-time. This approach resolves some perplexing issues concerning the validity of certain pre-metric notions of orthogonality and mirror symmetry. It makes explicit the tangent space extension of four-dimensional space-time that was alluded to earlier by the author [3] and shows that the null space component of the extended space can be related to ideas that were set out many years ago by H J S Smith.</description>

      <title>Physical uniqueness of the definitions of the Cartesian photon position operator leading to electric and magnetic strings eigenstates of the photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12125v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper provides three main definitions of the Cartesian photon position operator based on: boost generator, the transversality condition and the helicity operator. In each case, the correctness of the definition and Hermitianness of the operator in the domain of physical states are proven. All considered definitions lead to the same form of the Cartesian position operator in the domain of physical states. Radial photon position operators were also defined, but they turned out to be non-equivalent. Nevertheless, the most useful two radial operators turned out to be twin counterparts in the sense of the transformation to the helical representation, which is an alternative positional representation. The components of the photon position operator do not commute, but in analogy to the problem of eigenangular momentum, its eigenstates do exist.
  The eigenstates of the two components of the position operator (including the radial component) are called photon strings. Photon strings on a straight line and on a circle have been studied. The usual, previously known photon string states were named electric strings, but new magnetic strings were also introduced. Exact helical photon strings on a straight line, as well as hybrid helical photon strings on a circle, were also considered. On the other hand, infinitely short photon magnetic strings turned out to be flat photon vortices on planes with a normalization formula looks like as point-localized particles.</description>

      <title>How the perturbed vacuum might be completely decoupled from all physical states, allowing for a well-defined Hamiltonian formulation of QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out a Dirac sea reinterpretation of a discretized version of the Hamiltonian of quantum electrodynamics (QED), and analyze the perturbed vacuum in the continuum limit. We argue that if certain operators can be shown to be the self-adjoint, the perturbed vacuum will have solutions that converge nicely in this limit to states of the infinitesimal subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by momentum eigenstates whose momenta sum to 0. This convergence allows us to analyze what effect the perturbed vacuum has on the physical states of the system. We then show that the interaction and the interference between the perturbed vacuum and the physical states actually vanish in the continuum limit, due to the fact that the states of the perturbed vacuum only live in this vanishingly small part of the momentum space. We furthermore show that this allows us to remove the terms that perturb the vacuum from the Hamiltonian, without changing the dynamics of the physical states, thus yielding us a well-defined Hamiltonian for the full theory of QED.</description>
