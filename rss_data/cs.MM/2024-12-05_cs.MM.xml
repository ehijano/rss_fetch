      <title>Who Brings the Frisbee: Probing Hidden Hallucination Factors in Large Vision-Language Model via Causality Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large vision-language models (LVLM) have significantly enhanced their ability to comprehend visual inputs alongside natural language. However, a major challenge in their real-world application is hallucination, where LVLMs generate non-existent visual elements, eroding user trust. The underlying mechanism driving this multimodal hallucination is poorly understood. Minimal research has illuminated whether contexts such as sky, tree, or grass field involve the LVLM in hallucinating a frisbee. We hypothesize that hidden factors, such as objects, contexts, and semantic foreground-background structures, induce hallucination. This study proposes a novel causal approach: a hallucination probing system to identify these hidden factors. By analyzing the causality between images, text prompts, and network saliency, we systematically explore interventions to block these factors. Our experimental findings show that a straightforward technique based on our analysis can significantly reduce hallucinations. Additionally, our analyses indicate the potential to edit network internals to minimize hallucinated outputs.</description>

      <title>SPICE: Smart Projection Interface for Cooking Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tangible User Interfaces (TUI) for human--computer interaction (HCI) provide the user with physical representations of digital information with the aim to overcome the limitations of screen-based interfaces. Although many compelling demonstrations of TUIs exist in the literature, there is a lack of research on TUIs intended for daily two-handed tasks and processes, such as cooking. In response to this gap, we propose SPICE (Smart Projection Interface for Cooking Enhancement). SPICE investigates TUIs in a kitchen setting, aiming to transform the recipe following experience from simply text-based to tangibly interactive. SPICE includes a tracking system, an agent-based software, and vision large language models to create and interpret a kitchen environment where recipe information is projected directly onto the cooking surface. We conducted a comparative usability study of SPICE and text-based recipe following with 30 participants, assessing the task difficulty, total duration, and efficiency, as well as user confidence and taste perception. The results indicate that SPICE allowed participants to perform the recipe with less stops and in shorter time while also improving self-reported efficiency, confidence, and taste. Despite this, participants self-reported no change in overall difficulty, which is a direction for future research. Overall, the SPICE project demonstrates the potential of using TUIs to improve everyday activities, paving the way for future research in HCI and new computing interfaces.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient Reference-Free Evaluation of Audio Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To establish the trustworthiness of systems that automatically generate text captions for audio, images and video, existing reference-free metrics rely on large pretrained models which are impractical to accommodate in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose some metrics to elicit the model's confidence in its own generation. To assess how well these metrics replace correctness measures that leverage reference captions, we test their calibration with correctness measures. We discuss why some of these confidence metrics align better with certain correctness measures. Further, we provide insight into why temperature scaling of confidence metrics is effective. Our main contribution is a suite of well-calibrated lightweight confidence metrics for reference-free evaluation of captions in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Relational Learning for Multimodal Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relational learning is an essential task in the domain of knowledge representation, particularly in knowledge graph completion (KGC). While relational learning in traditional single-modal settings has been extensively studied, exploring it within a multimodal KGC context presents distinct challenges and opportunities. One of the major challenges is inference on newly discovered relations without any associated training data. This zero-shot relational learning scenario poses unique requirements for multimodal KGC, i.e., utilizing multimodality to facilitate relational learning.However, existing works fail to support the leverage of multimodal information and leave the problem unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, consisting of three components, i.e., multimodal learner, structure consolidator, and relation embedding generator, to integrate diverse multimodal information and knowledge graph structures to facilitate the zero-shot relational learning. Evaluation results on three multimodal knowledge graphs demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Once-for-All: Controllable Generative Image Compression with Dynamic Granularity Adaption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although recent generative image compression methods have demonstrated impressive potential in optimizing the rate-distortion-perception trade-off, they still face the critical challenge of flexible rate adaption to diverse compression necessities and scenarios. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a Controllable Generative Image Compression framework, termed Control-GIC, the first capable of fine-grained bitrate adaption across a broad spectrum while ensuring high-fidelity and generality compression. Control-GIC is grounded in a VQGAN framework that encodes an image as a sequence of variable-length codes (i.e. VQ-indices), which can be losslessly compressed and exhibits a direct positive correlation with the bitrates. Drawing inspiration from the classical coding principle, we correlate the information density of local image patches with their granular representations. Hence, we can flexibly determine a proper allocation of granularity for the patches to achieve dynamic adjustment for VQ-indices, resulting in desirable compression rates. We further develop a probabilistic conditional decoder capable of retrieving historic encoded multi-granularity representations according to transmitted codes, and then reconstruct hierarchical granular features in the formalization of conditional probability, enabling more informative aggregation to improve reconstruction realism. Our experiments show that Control-GIC allows highly flexible and controllable bitrate adaption where the results demonstrate its superior performance over recent state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>FLOAT: Generative Motion Latent Flow Matching for Audio-driven Talking Portrait</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. We shift the generative modeling from the pixel-based latent space to a learned motion latent space, enabling efficient design of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with a simple yet effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</description>
