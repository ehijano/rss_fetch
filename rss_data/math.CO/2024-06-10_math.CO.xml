      <title>On the enumeration of series-parallel matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the work of Ferroni and Larson, Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and Z-polynomials of complete graphs have combinatorial interpretations in terms of quasi series-parallel matroids. We provide explicit formulas for the number of series-parallel matroids and the number of simple series-parallel matroids of a given rank and cardinality, extending results of Ferroni-Larson and Gao-Proudfoot-Yang-Zhang.</description>

      <title>The automorphism groups of small affine rank 3 graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rank 3 graph is an orbital graph of a rank 3 permutation group of even order. Despite the classification of rank 3 graphs being complete, see, e.g., Chapter 11 of the recent monograph 'Strongly regular graphs' by Brouwer and Van Maldeghem, the full automorphism groups of these graphs (equivalently, the 2-closures of rank 3 groups) have not been explicitly described, though a lot of information on this subject is available. In the present note, we address this problem for the affine rank 3 graphs. We find the automorphism groups for finitely many relatively small graphs and show that modulo known results, this provides the full description of the automorphism groups of the affine rank 3 graphs, thus reducing the general problem to the case when the socle of the automorphism group is nonabelian simple.</description>

      <title>Partial semigroup partial dynamical systems and Partial Central Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H. Furstenberg defined Central sets in $\mathbb{N}$ by using the notions of topological dynamics, later Bergelson and Hindman characterized central sets in $\mathbb{N}$ and also in arbitrary semigroup in terms of algebra of Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of that set. We state the new notion of large sets in a partial semigroup setting and characterize the algebraic structure of the sets by using the algebra of Stone-\v{C}ech compactification. By using these notions, we introduce the \emph{Partial Semigroup Partial Dynamical System(PSPDS)} and show that topological dynamical characterization of central sets in a partial semigroup is equivalent to the usual algebraic characterization.</description>

      <title>Monotonic Decompositions of Submodular Set Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submodular set functions are undoubtedly among the most important building blocks of combinatorial optimization. Somewhat surprisingly, continuous counterparts of such functions have also appeared in an analytic line of research where they found applications in the theory of finitely additive measures, nonlinear integrals, and electric capacities. Recently, a number of connections between these two branches have been established, and the aim of this paper is to generalize further results on submodular set functions on finite sets to the analytic setting.
  We first extend the notion of duality of matroids to submodular set functions, and characterize the uniquely determined decomposition of a submodular set function into the sum of a nonnegaive charge and an increasing submodular set function in which the charge is maximal. Then, we describe basic properties of infinite-alternating set functions, a subclass of submodular set functions that serves as an analytic counterpart of coverage functions. By relaxing the monotonicity assumption in the definition, we introduce a new class of submodular functions with distinguished structural properties that includes, among others, weighted cut functions of graphs. We prove that, unlike general submodular set functions over an infinite domain, any infinite-alternating set function can be written as the sum of an increasing and a decreasing submodular function or as the difference of two increasing submodular functions, thus giving extension of results on monotonic decompositions in the finite case. Finally, motivated by its connections to graph parameters such as the maximum size of a cut and the maximum size of a fractional triangle packing, we study the structure of such decompositions for weighted cut functions of undirected graphs.</description>

      <title>Differential equations satisfied by generating functions of 5-, 6-, and 7-regular labelled graphs: a reduction-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a classic result of Gessel, the exponential generating functions for $k$-regular graphs are D-finite. Using Gr\"obner bases in Weyl algebras, we compute the linear differential equations satisfied by the generating function for 5-, 6-, and 7- regular graphs. The method is sufficiently robust to consider variants such as graphs with multiple edges, loops, and graphs whose degrees are limited to fixed sets of values.</description>

      <title>A star-comb lemma for infinite digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star-comb lemma is a fundamental tool in infinite graph theory, which states that for any infinite set $U$ of vertices in a connected graph $G$ there exists either a subdivided infinite star in $G$ with all leaves in $U$, or an infinite comb in $G$ with all teeth in $U$.
  In this paper, we elaborate a pendant of the star-comb lemma for directed graphs. More precisely, we prove that for any infinite set $U$ of vertices in a strongly connected directed graph $D$, there exists a strongly connected substructure of $D$ attached to infinitely many vertices of $U$ that is either shaped by a star or shaped by a comb, or is a chain of triangles.</description>

      <title>A variable version of the quasi-kernel conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasi-kernel of a digraph $D$ is an independent set $Q$ such that every vertex can reach $Q$ in at most two steps. A 48-year conjecture made by Erd\H{o}s and Sz\'ekely, denoted the \textit{small QK conjecture}, says that every sink-free digraph contains a quasi-kernel of size at most $n/2$.
  Recently, Spiro posed the \textit{large QK conjecture}, that every sink-free digraph contains a quasi-kernel~$Q$ such that $|N^-[Q]|\geq n/2$, and showed that it follows from the small QK conjecture.
  In this paper, we establish that the large QK conjecture implies the small QK conjecture with a weaker constant. We also show that the large QK conjecture is equivalent to a sharp version of it, answering affirmatively a question of Spiro. We formulate variable versions of these conjectures, which are still open in general.
  Not many digraphs are known to have quasi-kernels of size $(1-\alpha)n$ or less. We show this for digraphs with bounded dichromatic number, by proving that every sink-free digraph contains a quasi-kernel of size at most $\frac{kn}{k+1}$, where $k$ is the dichromatic number of $D$.</description>

      <title>An introduction to the deduction number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deduction game is a variation of the game of cops and robber on graphs in which searchers must capture an invisible evader in at most one move. Searchers know each others' initial locations, but can only communicate if they are on the same vertex. Thus, searchers must deduce other searchers' movement and move accordingly. We introduce the deduction number and study it for various classes of graphs. We provide upper bounds for the deduction number of the Cartesian product of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Strong Nine Dragon Tree Conjecture is true if we replace $d$ with $d + \frac{k}{2} \cdot (\big\lceil{\frac{d}{k+1}} \big\rceil - 1) \big\lceil{\frac{d}{k+1}} \big\rceil$. More precisely:
let $G$ be a graph and let $d$ and $k$ be positive integers. If $\gamma(G) \leq k + \frac{d}{d + k + 1}$, then there is a partition into $k + 1$ forests, where in one forest every connected component has at most $d + \frac{k}{2} \cdot (\big\lceil{\frac{d}{k+1}} \big\rceil - 1) \big\lceil{\frac{d}{k+1}} \big\rceil$ edges.</description>

      <title>On orientations with forbidden out-degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a $d$-regular graph and let $F\subseteq\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, d\}$ be a list of forbidden out-degrees. Akbari, Dalirrooyfard, Ehsani, Ozeki, and Sherkati conjectured that if $|F|&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}d$, then $G$ should admit an $F$-avoiding orientation, i.e., an orientation where no out-degrees are in the forbidden list $F$. The conjecture is known for $d\leq 4$ due to work of Ma and Lu, and here we extend this to $d\leq 6$. The conjecture has also been studied in a generalized version, where $d, F$ are changed from constant values to functions $d(v), F(v)$ that vary over all $v\in V(G)$. We provide support for this generalized version by verifying it for some new cases, including when $G$ is 2-degenerate and when every $F(v)$ has some specific structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sequence $d_1\le\cdots\le d_n$ is graphical if it is the degree sequence of a graph. Balister, the second author, Groenland, Johnston and Scott showed that there are asymptotically $C4^n/n^{3/4}$ such sequences. However, the constant $C$ involves a probability that is only approximated. Using random walks and limit theory for infinitely divisible probability distributions, we describe $C$ in terms of Walkup's formula for the number of rooted, unlabelled and cyclically distinct plane trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the $CWR$ invariant, a new invariant for alternating links, which builds upon and generalizes the $WRP$ invariant. The $CWR$ invariant is an array of two-variable polynomials that provides a stronger invariant compared to the $WRP$ invariant. We compare the strength of our invariant with the classical HOMFLYPT, Kauffman $3$-variable, and Kauffman $2$-variable polynomials on specific knot examples. Additionally, we derive general recursive "skein" relations, and also specific formulas for the initial components of the $CWR$ invariant ($CWR_2$ and $CWR_3$) using weighted adjacency matrices of modified Tait graphs.</description>

We also show a construction of a planar subcubic graph of girth 11 that is not $2$-distance $4$-colorable.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzian octahedron recurrence (dSKP equation) I: explicit solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an explicit expression for the solutions of the discrete Schwarzian octahedron recurrence, also known as the discrete Schwarzian KP equation (dSKP), as the ratio of two partition functions. Each one counts weighted oriented dimer configurations of an associated bipartite graph, and is equal to the determinant of a Kasteleyn matrix. This is in the spirit of Speyer's result on the dKP equation, or octahedron recurrence [Spe07]. One consequence is that dSKP has zero algebraic entropy, meaning that the growth of the degrees of the polynomials involved is only polynomial. There are cancellations in the partition function, and we prove an alternative, cancellation free explicit expression involving complementary trees and forests. Using all of the above, we show several instances of the Devron property for dSKP, i.e., that certain singularities in initial data repeat after a finite number of steps. This has many applications for discrete geometric systems and is the subject of the companion paper [AdTM22]. We also prove limit shape results analogous to the arctic circle of the Aztec diamond. Finally, we discuss the combinatorics of all the other octahedral equations in the classification of Adler, Bobenko and Suris [ABS12].</description>

      <title>Tropical Logistic Regression Model on Space of Phylogenetic Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classification of gene trees is an important task both in the analysis of multi-locus phylogenetic data, and assessment of the convergence of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses used in Bayesian phylogenetic tree reconstruction. The logistic regression model is one of the most popular classification models in statistical learning, thanks to its computational speed and interpretability. However, it is not appropriate to directly apply the standard logistic regression model to a set of phylogenetic trees, as the space of phylogenetic trees is non-Euclidean and thus contradicts the standard assumptions on covariates. It is well-known in tropical geometry and phylogenetics that the space of phylogenetic trees is a tropical linear space in terms of the max-plus algebra. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an analogue approach of the logistic regression model in the setting of tropical geometry. Our proposed method outperforms classical logistic regression in terms of Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) in numerical examples, including with data generated by the multi-species coalescent model. Theoretical properties such as statistical consistency have been proved and generalization error rates have been derived. Finally, our classification algorithm is proposed as an MCMC convergence criterion for Mr Bayes. Unlike the convergence metric used by MrBayes which is only dependent on tree topologies, our method is sensitive to branch lengths and therefore provides a more robust metric for convergence. In a test case, it is illustrated that the tropical logistic regression can differentiate between two independently run MCMC chains, even when the standard metric cannot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give new characterizations for the class of uniformly dense matroids and study applications of these characterizations to graphic and real representable matroids. We show that a matroid is uniformly dense if and only if its base polytope contains a point with constant coordinates. As a main application, we derive new spectral, structural and classification results for uniformly dense graphs. In particular, we show that connected regular uniformly dense graphs are $1$-tough and thus contain a (near-)perfect matching. As a second application, we show that uniform density can be recognized in polynomial time for real representable matroids, which includes graphs. Finally, we show that strictly uniformly dense real represented matroids can be represented by projection matrices with a constant diagonal and that they are parametrized by a subvariety of the Grassmannian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the query complexity on slices of Boolean functions. Among other results we show that there exists a Boolean function for which we need to query all but 7 input bits to compute its value, even if we know beforehand that the number of 0's and 1's in the input are the same, i.e., when our input is from the middle slice. This answers a question of Byramji. Our proof is non-constructive, but we also propose a concrete candidate function that might have the above property. Our results are related to certain natural discrepancy type questions that, somewhat surprisingly, have not been studied before.</description>

      <title>Note on Min-k-Planar Drawings of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The k-planar graphs, which are (usually with small values of k such as 1, 2, 3) subject to recent intense research, admit a drawing in which edges are allowed to cross, but each one edge is allowed to carry at most k crossings. In recently introduced [Binucci et al., GD 2023] min-k-planar drawings of graphs, edges may possibly carry more than k crossings, but in any two crossing edges, at least one of the two must have at most k crossings. In both concepts, one may consider general drawings or a popular restricted concept of drawings called simple. In a simple drawing, every two edges are allowed to cross at most once, and any two edges which share a vertex are forbidden to cross. While, regarding the former concept, it is for k&lt;=3 known (but perhaps not widely known) that every general k-planar graph admits a simple k-planar drawing and this ceases to be true for any k&gt;=4, the difference between general and simple drawings in the latter concept is more striking. We prove that there exist graphs with a min-2-planar drawing, or with a min-3-planar drawing avoiding crossings of adjacent edges, which have no simple min-k-planar drawings for arbitrarily large fixed k.</description>

      <title>A Grammar of Dumont and a Theorem of Diaconis-Evans-Graham</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We came across an unexpected connection between a remarkable grammar of Dumont for the joint distribution of $(\exc, \fix)$ over $S_n$ and a beautiful theorem of Diaconis-Evans-Graham on successions and fixed points of permutations. With the grammar in hand, we demonstrate the advantage of the grammatical calculus in deriving the generating functions, where the constant property plays a substantial role. On the grounds of left successions of a permutation, we present a grammatical treatment of the joint distribution investigated by Roselle. Moreover, we obtain a left succession analogue of the Diaconis-Evans-Graham theorem, exemplifying the idea of a grammar assisted bijection. The grammatical labelings give rise to an equidistribution of $(\jump, \des)$ and $(\exc, \drop)$ restricted to the set of left successions and the set of fixed points, where $\jump$ is defined to be the number of ascents minus the number of left successions.</description>

      <title>Parallel Summation in P-Recursive Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose investigating a summation analog of the paradigm for parallel integration. We make some first steps towards an indefinite summation method applicable to summands that rationally depend on the summation index and a P-recursive sequence and its shifts. There is a distinction between so-called normal and so-called special polynomials. Under the assumption that the corresponding difference field has no unnatural constants, we are able to predict the normal polynomials appearing in the denominator of a potential closed form. We can also handle the numerator. Our method is incomplete so far as we cannot predict the special polynomials appearing in the denominator. However, we do have some structural results about special polynomials for the setting under consideration.</description>

      <title>Induced matching vs edge open packing: trees and product graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the maximum size of an induced subgraph of $G$ each component of which is a star is called the edge open packing number, $\rho_{e}^{o}(G)$, of $G$. Similarly, the maximum size of an induced subgraph of $G$ each component of which is the star $K_{1,1}$ is the induced matching number, $\nu_I(G)$, of $G$. While the inequality $\rho_e^o(G)\geq \nu_{I}(G)$ clearly holds for all graphs $G$, we provide a structural characterization of those trees that attain the equality. We prove that the induced matching number of the lexicographic product $G\circ H$ of arbitrary two graphs $G$ and $H$ equals $\alpha(G)\nu_I(H)$. By similar techniques, we prove sharp lower and upper bounds on the edge open packing number of the lexicographic product of graphs, which in particular lead to NP-hardness results in triangular graphs for both invariants studied in this paper. For the direct product $G\times H$ of two graphs we provide lower bounds on $\nu_I(G\times H)$ and $\rho_{e}^{o}(G\times H)$, both of which are widely sharp. We also present sharp lower bounds for both invariants in the Cartesian and the strong product of two graphs. Finally, we consider the edge open packing number in hypercubes establishing the exact values of $\rho_e^o(Q_n)$ when $n$ is a power of $2$, and present a closed formula for the induced matching number of the rooted product of arbitrary two graphs over an arbitrary root vertex.</description>

      <title>Fans and polytopes in tilting theory I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15213v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite dimensional algebra $A$ over a field $k$, the 2-term silting complexes of $A$ gives a simplicial complex $\Delta(A)$ called the $g$-simplicial complex. We give tilting theoretic interpretations of the $h$-vectors and Dehn-Sommerville equations of $\Delta(A)$. Using $g$-vectors of 2-term silting complexes, $\Delta(A)$ gives a nonsingular fan $\Sigma(A)$ in the real Grothendieck group $K_0(\mathsf{proj} A)_{\mathbb{R}}$ called the $g$-fan. We give several basic properties of $\Sigma(A)$ including sign-coherence, sign decomposition, idempotent reductions, Jasso reductions, pairwise positivity and a connection with Newton polytopes of $A$-modules. Moreover, $\Sigma(A)$ gives a (possibly infinite and non-convex) polytope $P(A)$ in $K_0(\mathsf{proj} A)_{\mathbb{R}}$ called the $g$-polytope of $A$. We call $A$ $g$-convex if $P(A)$ is convex. In this case, we show that it is a reflexive polytope, and that the dual polytope is given by the 2-term simple minded collections of $A$. There are precisely 7 convex $g$-polyogons up to isomorphism. We give a classification of algebras whose $g$-polytopes are smooth Fano.
  We study $g$-fans and $g$-polytopes of two important classes of algebras. We show that the $g$-fan of a classical or generalized preprojective algebra is given by the Coxeter fan. It is $g$-convex if and only if it is of type $A$ or $B$, and in this case, its $g$-polytope is the dual polytope of the short root polytope. Moreover we classify Brauer graph algebras which are $g$-convex, and describe their $g$-polytopes as the root polytopes of type $A$ or $C$.</description>

      <title>The externally definable Ramsey property and fixed points on type spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the externally definable Ramsey property, a weakening of the Ramsey property for ultrahomogeneous structures, where the only colourings considered are those that are externally definable: that is, definable with parameters in an elementary extension. We show a number of basic results analogous to the classical Ramsey theory, and show that, for an ultrahomogeneous structure M, the externally definable Ramsey property is equivalent to the dynamical statement that, for each natural number n, every subflow of the space of n-types with parameters in M has a fixed point. We discuss a range of examples, including results regarding the lexicographic product of structures.</description>

      <title>Optimization with pattern-avoiding input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutation pattern-avoidance is a central concept of both enumerative and extremal combinatorics. In this paper we study the effect of permutation pattern-avoidance on the complexity of optimization problems.
  In the context of the dynamic optimality conjecture (Sleator, Tarjan, STOC 1983), Chalermsook, Goswami, Kozma, Mehlhorn, and Saranurak (FOCS 2015) conjectured that the amortized search cost of an optimal binary search tree (BST) is constant whenever the search sequence is pattern-avoiding. The best known bound to date is $2^{\alpha{(n)}(1+o(1))}$ recently obtained by Chalermsook, Pettie, and Yingchareonthawornchai (SODA 2024); here $n$ is the BST size and $\alpha(\cdot)$ the inverse-Ackermann function. In this paper we resolve the conjecture, showing a tight $O(1)$ bound. This indicates a barrier to dynamic optimality: any candidate online BST (e.g., splay trees or greedy trees) must match this optimum, but current analysis techniques only give superconstant bounds.
  More broadly, we argue that the easiness of pattern-avoiding input is a general phenomenon, not limited to BSTs or even to data structures. To illustrate this, we show that when the input avoids an arbitrary, fixed, a priori unknown pattern, one can efficiently compute a $k$-server solution of $n$ requests from a unit interval, with total cost $n^{O(1/\log k)}$, in contrast to the worst-case $\Theta(n/k)$ bound; and a traveling salesman tour of $n$ points from a unit box, of length $O(\log{n})$, in contrast to the worst-case $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ bound; similar results hold for the euclidean minimum spanning tree, Steiner tree, and nearest-neighbor graphs.
  We show both results to be tight. Our techniques build on the Marcus-Tardos proof of the Stanley-Wilf conjecture, and on the recently emerging concept of twin-width.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Depth in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A characterization of the representability of neural networks is relevant to comprehend their success in artificial intelligence. This study investigate two topics on ReLU neural network expressivity and their connection with a conjecture related to the minimum depth required for representing any continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) function. The topics are the minimal depth representation of the sum and max operations, as well as the exploration of polytope neural networks. For the sum operation, we establish a sufficient condition on the minimal depth of the operands to find the minimal depth of the operation. In contrast, regarding the max operation, a comprehensive set of examples is presented, demonstrating that no sufficient conditions, depending solely on the depth of the operands, would imply a minimal depth for the operation. The study also examine the minimal depth relationship between convex CPWL functions. On polytope neural networks, we investigate basic depth properties from Minkowski sums, convex hulls, number of vertices, faces, affine transformations, and indecomposable polytopes. More significant findings include depth characterization of polygons; identification of polytopes with an increasing number of vertices, exhibiting small depth and others with arbitrary large depth; and most notably, the minimal depth of simplices, which is strictly related to the minimal depth conjecture in ReLU networks.</description>
