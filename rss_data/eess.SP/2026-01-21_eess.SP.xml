      <title>Inter-Cell Interference Rejection Based on Ultrawideband Walsh-Domain Wireless Autoencoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel technique for rejecting partial-in-band inter-cell interference (ICI) in ultrawideband communication systems. We present the design of an end-to-end wireless autoencoder architecture that jointly optimizes the transmitter and receiver encoding/decoding in the Walsh domain to mitigate interference from coexisting narrower-band 5G base stations. By exploiting the orthogonality and self-inverse properties of Walsh functions, the system distributes and learns to encode bit-words across parallel Walsh branches. Through analytical modeling and simulation, we characterize how 5G CPOFDM interference maps into the Walsh domain and identify optimal ratios of transmission frequencies and sampling rate where the end-to-end autoencoder achieves the highest rejection. Experimental results show that the proposed autoencoder achieves up to 12 dB of ICI rejection while maintaining a low block error rate (BLER) for the same baseline channel noise, i.e., baseline Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) without the interference.</description>

      <title>Sparsity Realization in User-Side Multilayer RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User-side reconfigurable intelligent surface (US-RIS)-aided communication has recently emerged as a promising solution to overcome the high hardware cost and physical size limitations of large-scale user side antenna arrays. This letter proposes, for the first time, a framework that realizes sparsity in multilayer US-RIS using two strategies, namely element-wise sparsity and geometric sparsity. The element-wise approach distributes a limited number of active elements irregularly across multiple layers, thereby exploiting additional spatial degrees of freedom and boosting the achievable rate. For further performance enhancement, a novel foldable RIS architecture leveraging geometric sparsity is proposed, achieving additional gains by optimizing the folding topology of its multilayer structure. Simulation results show that the proposed sparse architectures provide consistently higher achievable rates than existing designs.</description>

      <title>LarS-Net: A Large-Scale Framework for Network-Level Spectrum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the demand of wireless communication continues to rise, the radio spectrum (a finite resource) requires increasingly efficient utilization. This trend is driving the evolution from static, stand-alone spectrum allocation toward spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum sharing. A critical element of this transition is spectrum sensing, which facilitates informed decision-making in shared environments. Previous studies on spectrum sensing and cognitive radio have been largely limited to individual sensors or small sensor groups. In this work, a large-scale spectrum sensing network (LarS-Net) is designed in a cost-effective manner. Spectrum sensors are either co-located with base stations (BSs) to share the tower, backhaul, and power infrastructure, or integrated directly into BSs as a new feature leveraging active BS antenna systems. As an example incumbent system, fixed service microwave link operating in the lower-7 GHz band is investigated. This band is a primary candidate for 6G, being considered by the WRC-23, ITU, and FCC. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we determine the minimum subset of BSs equipped with sensing capability to guarantee a target incumbent detection probability. The simulations account for various sensor antenna configurations, propagation channel models, and duty cycles for both incumbent transmissions and sensing operations. Building on this framework, we introduce three network-level sensing performance metrics: Emission Detection Probability (EDP), Temporal Detection Probability (TDP), and Temporal Mis-detection Probability (TMP), which jointly capture spatial coverage, temporal detectability, and multi-node diversity effects. Using these metrics, we analyze the impact of LarS-Net inter-site distance, noise uncertainty, and sensing duty-cycle on large-scale sensing performance.</description>

      <title>MIMO Array Calibration in Non-stationary Channels with Residual Surfaces and Slepian Spherical Harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental mechanism driving MIMO beamforming is the relative phases of signals departing the transmit array and arriving at the receive array. If a propagation channel affects all transmitted signals equally, the relative phases are a function of the directions of departure and arrival, as well as the transmit and receive hardware. In a non-stationary channel, the amplitudes and phases of arriving signals may vary significantly over time, making it infeasible to directly measure the influence of hardware. In this paper, we present a calibration method for achieving indirect measurement and compensation of hardware influences in non-stationary channels. Our method characterizes the patterns of array elements relative to a reference element and estimates these relative patterns, termed residual surfaces, using a Slepian spherical harmonic basis. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our calibration method achieves beamforming gains that closely match theoretical optimums. Our results also show a reduction in the error in estimating the target direction, lower side lobes, and improve null-steering capabilities.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Spectrum Occupancy Prediction Using Real-World Spectrum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrum occupancy prediction is a critical enabler for real-time and proactive dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS), as it can provide short-term channel availability information to support more efficient spectrum access decisions in wireless communication systems. Instead of relying on open-source datasets or simulated data, commonly used in the literature, this paper investigates short-horizon spectrum occupancy prediction using mid-band, 24X7 real-world spectrum measurement data collected in the United States. We construct a multi-band channel occupancy dataset through analyzing 61 days of empirical data and formulate a next-minute channel occupancy prediction task across all frequency channels. This study focuses on AI-driven prediction methods, including Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, and compares their performance against a conventional Markov chain-based statistical baseline. Numerical results show that learning-based methods outperform the statistical baseline on dynamic channels, particularly under fixed false-alarm constraints. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-driven spectrum occupancy prediction, indicating that lightweight learning models can effectively support future deployment-oriented DSS systems.</description>

      <title>Automated Spectrum Sensing and Analysis Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrum sensing and analysis is crucial for a variety of reasons, including regulatory compliance, interference detection and mitigation, and spectrum resource planning and optimization. Effective, real-time spectrum analysis remains a challenge, stemming from the need to analyse an increasingly complex and dynamic environment with limited resources. The vast amount of data generated from sensing the spectrum at multiple sites requires sophisticated data analysis and processing techniques, which can be technically demanding and expensive. This paper presents a novel, holistic framework developed and deployed at multiple locations across the USA for spectrum analysis and describes the different parts of the end-to-end pipeline. The details of each of the modules of the pipeline, data collection and pre-processing at remote locations, transfer to a centralized location, post-processing analysis, visualization, and long-term storage, are reported. The motivation behind this work is to develop a robust spectrum analysis framework that can help gain greater insights into the spectrum usage across the country and augment additional use cases such as dynamic spectrum sharing.</description>

      <title>Necessity of Cooperative Transmissions for Wireless MapReduce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents an improved upper bound (achievability result) on the optimal tradeoff between Normalized Delivery Time (NDT) and computation load for distributed computing MapReduce systems in certain ranges of the parameters. The upper bound is based on interference alignment combined with zero-forcing. The paper further provides a lower bound (converse) on the optimal NDT-computation tradeoff that can be achieved when IVAs are partitioned into sub-IVAs, and these sub-IVAs are then transmitted (in an arbitrary form) by a single node, without cooperation among nodes. For appropriate linear functions (e.g., XORs), such non-cooperative schemes can achieve some of the best NDT-computation tradeoff points so far obtained in the literature. However, as our lower bound shows, any non-cooperative scheme achieves a worse NDT-computation tradeoff than our new proposed scheme for certain parameters, thus proving the necessity of cooperative schemes like zero-forcing to attain the optimal NDT-computation tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Delay-Doppler-Domain Channel Estimation and Reduced-Complexity Detection of Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling Aided OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conceive a novel channel estimation and data detection scheme for OTFS-modulated faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) transmission over doubly selective fading channels, aiming for enhancing the spectral efficiency and Doppler resilience. The delay-Doppler (DD) domain's input-output relationship of OTFS-FTN signaling is derived by employing a root-raised cosine (RRC) shaping filter. More specifically, we design our DD-domain channel estimator for FTN-based pilot transmission, where the pilot symbol interval is lower than that defined by the classic Nyquist criterion. Moreover, we propose a reduced-complexity linear minimum mean square error equalizer, supporting noise whitening, where the FTN-induced inter-symbol interference (ISI) matrix is approximated by a sparse one. Our performance results demonstrate that the proposed OTFS-FTN scheme is capable of enhancing the achievable information rate, while attaining a comparable BER performance to both that of its Nyquist-based OTFS counterpart and to other FTN transmission schemes, which employ the same RRC shaping filter.</description>

      <title>Accelerated MR Elastography Using Learned Neural Network Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To develop a deep-learning method for achieving fast high-resolution MR elastography from highly undersampled data without the need of high-quality training dataset. We first framed the deep neural network representation as a nonlinear extension of the linear subspace model, then used it to represent and reconstruct MRE image repetitions from undersampled k-space data. The network weights were learned using a multi-level k-space consistent loss in a self-supervised manner. To further enhance reconstruction quality, phase-contrast specific magnitude and phase priors were incorporated, including the similarity of anatomical structures and smoothness of wave-induced harmonic displacement. Experiments were conducted using both 3D gradient-echo spiral and multi-slice spin-echo spiral MRE datasets. Compared to the conventional linear subspace-based approaches, the nonlinear network representation method was able to produce superior image reconstruction with suppressed noise and artifacts from a single in-plane spiral arm per MRE repetition (e.g., total R=10), yielding comparable stiffness estimation to the fully sampled data. This work demonstrated the feasibility of using deep network representations to model and reconstruct MRE images from highly-undersampled data, a nonlinear extension of the subspace-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Beyond Target-Level: ISAC-Enabled Event-Level Sensing for Behavioral Intention Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) holds great promise for enabling event-level sensing, such as behavioral intention prediction (BIP) in autonomous driving, particularly under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) or adverse weather conditions where conventional sensors degrade. However, as a key instance of event-level sensing, ISAC-based BIP remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose an ISAC-enabled BIP framework and validate its feasibility and effectiveness through extensive simulations. Our framework achieves robust performance in safety-critical scenarios, improving the F1-score by 11.4% over sensor-based baselines in adverse weather, thereby demonstrating ISAC's potential for intelligent event-level sensing.</description>

      <title>Radar-Based Fall Detection for Assisted Living: A Digital-Twin Representation Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining data on high-impact falls from older adults is ethically difficult, yet these rare events cause many fall-related health problems. As a result, most radar-based fall detectors are trained on staged falls from young volunteers, and representation choices are rarely tested against the radar signals from dangerous falls. This paper uses a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar digital twin as a single simulated room testbed to study how representation choice affects fall/non-fall discrimination. From the same simulated range-Doppler sequence, Doppler-time spectrograms, three-channel per-receiver spectrogram stacks, and time-pooled range-Doppler maps (RDMs) are derived and fed to an identical compact CNN under matched training on a balanced fall/non-fall dataset. In this twin, temporal spectrograms reach 98-99% test accuracy with similar precision and recall for both classes, while static RDMs reach 89.4% and show more variable training despite using the same backbone. A qualitative comparison between synthetic and measured fall spectrograms suggests that the twin captures gross Doppler-time structure, but amplitude histograms reveal differences in the distributions of amplitude values consistent with receiver processing not modeled in the twin. Because the twin omits noise and hardware impairments and is only qualitatively compared to a single measured example, these results provide representation-level guidance under controlled synthetic conditions rather than ready-to-use clinical performance in real settings.</description>

      <title>Robust distributed extended Kalman filter based on adaptive multi-kernel mixture maximum correntropy for non-Gaussian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the most advanced variants in the correntropy family, the multi-kernel correntropy criterion demonstrates superior accuracy in handling non-Gaussian noise, particularly with multimodal distributions. However, current approaches suffer from key limitations-namely, reliance on a single type of sensitive Gaussian kernel and the manual selection of free parameters. To address these issues and further boost robustness, this paper introduces the concept of multi-kernel mixture correntropy (MKMC), along with its key properties. MKMC employs a flexible kernel function composed of a mixture of two Students t-Cauchy functions with adjustable (non-zero) means. Building on this criterion within multi-sensor networks, we propose a robust distributed extended Kalman filter-AMKMMC-RDEKF based on adaptive multi-kernel mixture maximum correntropy. To reduce communication overhead, a consensus averaging strategy is incorporated. Furthermore, an adaptive mechanism is introduced to mitigate the impact of manually tuned free parameters. At the same time, the computational complexity and convergence ability of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through challenging scenarios involving power system and land vehicle state estimation.</description>

      <title>Extended Weighted ABG: A Robust Non-Linear ABG-Based Approach for Optimal Combination of ABG Path-Loss Propagation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust non-linear generalized path-loss propagation model, the Extended Weighted ABG (EWABG), which efficiently allows generating a path-loss propagation model by combining several available path-loss datasets (from measurements campaigns) and other previously proposed state-of-the-art 5G path-loss propagation models. The EWABG model works by integrating individual path-loss models into one single model in the least-squares sense, allowing to extend knowledge from frequencies and distances covered by path-loss datasets or path-loss propagation models. The proposed EWABG model is the first non-linear extension of the common ABG-based approach, which surpasses the non-uniformity problem between the low and high 5G frequencies (as most measurements campaigns have taken place in low frequencies). The EWABG also addresses the problem of removing outlier measurements, a step not included in previous propagation path-loss models. In this case, we have compared the most recent techniques for avoiding outliers, and we have adopted the Theil-Sen method, due to its strong robustness demonstrated in the experiments carried out. In addition, the proposed model specifically considers non-linear attenuation by atmospheric gases, in order to improve its estimations. The good performance of the proposed EWABG model has been tested and compared against recent 5G propagation path-loss models including the ABG and WABG models. The exhaustive experimentation carried out includes the 5G non-line-of-sight environment in different 5G scenarios, UMiSC, UMiOS and UMa. The proposed EWABG obtains the best accuracy, specially in noisy environments with outliers, reporting negligible increment error rates (with respect to the non-outliers situation), lower than 1%, compared to the ABG and WABG.</description>

      <title>Boiling flow estimation for aero-optic phase screen generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aero-optic effects due to turbulence can reduce the effectiveness of transmitting light waves to a distant target. Methods to compensate for turbulence typically rely on realistic turbulence data, which can be generated by i) experiment, ii) high-fidelity CFD, iii) low-fidelity CFD, and iv) autoregressive methods. However, each of these methods has significant drawbacks, including monetary and/or computational expense, limited quantity, inaccurate statistics, and overall complexity. In contrast, the boiling flow algorithm is a simple, computationally efficient model that can generate atmospheric phase screen data with only a handful of parameters. However, boiling flow has not been widely used in aero-optic applications, at least in part because some of these parameters, such as r0, are not clearly defined for aero-optic data. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to use the boiling flow algorithm to generate arbitrary length synthetic data to match the statistics of measured aero-optic data. Importantly, we modify the standard boiling flow method to generate anisotropic phase screens. While this model does not fully capture all statistics, it can be used to generate data that matches the temporal power spectrum or the anisotropic 2D structure function, with the ability to trade fidelity to one for fidelity to the other.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity RSS-based Underwater Localization with Unknown Transmit Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have received significant attention due to their various applications, with underwater target localization playing a vital role in enhancing network performance. Given the challenges and high costs associated with UWSN deployments, Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based localization offers a viable solution due to its minimal hardware requirements and cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we assign distance-based weights to RSS measurements, providing higher reliability to closer anchor nodes. Using the weighted RSS measurements and generalized trust region subproblem (GTRS), we propose the GTRS-based localization technique with Unknown Transmit Power (GUTP), which can be solved by a simple bisection method. Unlike conventional localization methods that require prior knowledge of the target node's transmit power, GUTP jointly estimates both the location and transmit power of the target node, broadening its practical use. Additionally, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for RSS-based underwater localization with known and unknown transmit power, respectively. Extensive simulations demonstrate that GUTP achieves enhanced accuracy and significantly lower computational complexity in estimating the target node's location and transmit power compared to existing semidefinite programming (SDP)-based techniques.</description>

      <title>Overcoming BS Down-Tilt for Air-Ground ISAC Coverage: Antenna Design, Beamforming and User Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication holds great promise for low-altitude economy applications. However, conventional downtilted base stations primarily provide sectorized forward lobes for ground services, failing to sense air targets due to backward blind zones. In this paper, a novel antenna structure is proposed to enable air-ground beam steering, facilitating simultaneous full-space sensing and communication (S&amp;C). Specifically, instead of inserting a reflector behind the antenna array for backlobe mitigation, an omni-steering plate is introduced to collaborate with the active array for omnidirectional beamforming. Building on this hardware innovation, sum S&amp;C mutual information (MI) is maximized, jointly optimizing user scheduling, passive coefficients of the omni-steering plate, and beamforming of the active array. The problem is decomposed into two subproblems: one for optimizing passive coefficients via Riemannian gradient on the manifold, and the other for optimizing user scheduling and active array beamforming. Exploiting relationships among S&amp;C MI, data decoding MMSE, and parameter estimation MMSE, the original subproblem is equivalently transformed into a sum weighted MMSE problem, rigorously established via the Lagrangian and first-order optimality conditions. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baselines in sum-MI and MSE, while providing 360 sensing coverage. Beampattern analysis further demonstrates effective user scheduling and accurate target alignment.</description>

      <title>RIS-Enhanced Information-Decoupled Symbiotic Radio Over Broadcasting Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enhanced decoupled symbiotic radio (SR) system in which a primary transmitter delivers common data to multiple primary receivers (PRs), while a RIS-based backscatter device sends secondary data to a backscatter receiver (BRx). Unlike conventional SR, the BRx performs energy detection and never decodes the primary signal, thereby removing ambiguity and preventing exposure of the primary payload to unintended receivers. In this paper, we formulate the problem as the minimization of the transmit power subject to a common broadcast rate constraint across all PRs and a bit error rate (BER) constraint at the BRx. The problem is nonconvex due to the unit-modulus RIS constraint and coupled quadratic forms. Leveraging a rate-balanced reformulation and a monotonic BER ratio characterization, we develop a low-complexity penalty-based block coordinate descent algorithm with closed-form updates. Numerical results show fast convergence of the proposed algorithm and reduced power consumption of the considered RIS-enhanced information-decoupled SR system over conventional SR baselines.</description>

      <title>Temporal Data and Short-Time Averages Improve Multiphase Mass Flow Metering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable flow measurements are essential in many industries, but current instruments often fail to accurately estimate multiphase flows, which are frequently encountered in real-world operations. Combining machine learning (ML) algorithms with accurate single-phase flowmeters has therefore received extensive research attention in recent years. The Coriolis mass flowmeter is a widely used single-phase meter that provides direct mass flow measurements, which ML models can be trained to correct, thereby reducing measurement errors in multiphase conditions. This paper demonstrates that preserving temporal information significantly improves model performance in such scenarios. We compare a multilayer perceptron, a windowed multilayer perceptron, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) on three-phase air-water-oil flow data from 342 experiments. Whereas prior work typically compresses each experiment into a single averaged sample, we instead compute short-time averages from within each experiment and train models that preserve temporal information at several downsampling intervals. The CNN performed best at 0.25 Hz with approximately 95 % of relative errors below 13 %, a normalized root mean squared error of 0.03, and a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 4.3 %, clearly outperforming the best single-averaged model and demonstrating that short-time averaging within individual experiments is preferable. Results are consistent across multiple data splits and random seeds, demonstrating robustness.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Noise Correlation on MMSE Channel Estimation in One-Bit Quantized Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the impact of spatially correlated additive noise on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels from one-bit quantized observations. Although additive noise can be correlated in practical scenarios, e.g., due to jamming, clutter, or other external disturbances, the effect of such correlation on the MMSE channel estimator in this setting remains unexplored in prior work. Against this backdrop, we derive a novel analytical expression for the general MIMO MMSE channel estimator, which is inherently nonlinear in one-bit observations, and accommodates arbitrary channel and noise correlation structures. To further characterize the impact of noise correlation, we subsequently specialize the general MMSE expression to certain tractable multi antenna configurations in which both the channel and the noise assume single-parameter constant correlation structures. Our analyses reveal nontrivial, noise-correlation-induced scenarios in which the estimator remains linear despite non-zero channel and noise correlation parameters. Moreover, the results indicate that, at low-to-medium signal-to-noise ratio, noise correlation improves the MMSE performance when channels are uncorrelated, but degrades performance when channels are strongly correlated.</description>

      <title>Automated Angular Received-Power Characterization of Embedded mmWave Transmitters Using Geometry-Calibrated Spatial Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an automated measurement methodology for angular received-power characterization of embedded millimeter-wave transmitters using geometry-calibrated spatial sampling. Characterization of integrated mmWave transmitters remains challenging due to limited angular coverage and alignment variability in conventional probe-station techniques, as well as the impracticality of anechoic-chamber testing for platform-mounted active modules. To address these challenges, we introduce RAPTAR, an autonomous measurement system for angular received-power acquisition under realistic installation constraints. A collaborative robot executes geometry-calibrated, collision-aware hemispherical trajectories while carrying a calibrated receive probe, enabling controlled and repeatable spatial positioning around a fixed device under test. A spectrum-analyzer-based receiver chain acquires amplitude-only received power as a function of angle and distance following quasi-static pose stabilization. The proposed framework enables repeatable angular received-power mapping and power-domain comparison against idealized free-space references derived from full-wave simulation. Experimental results for a 60-GHz radar module demonstrate a mean absolute received-power error below 2 dB relative to simulation-derived references and a 36.5 % reduction in error compared to manual probe-station measurements, attributed primarily to reduced alignment variability and consistent spatial sampling. The proposed method eliminates the need for coherent field measurements and near-field transformations, enabling practical power-domain characterization of embedded mmWave modules. It is well suited for angular validation in real-world platforms where conventional anechoic measurements are impractical.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wave Multi-Radar Tracking System Enabled by a Modified GRIN Luneburg Lens for Real-Time Healthcare Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-beam radar sensing systems are emerging as powerful tools for non-contact motion tracking and vital-sign monitoring in healthcare environments. This paper presents the design and experimental validation of a synchronized millimeter-wave multi-radar tracking system enhanced by a modified spherical gradient-index (GRIN) Luneburg lens. Five commercial FMCW radar modules operating in the 58--63 GHz band are arranged in a semi-circular configuration around the lens, whose tailored refractive-index profile accommodates bistatic radar modules with co-located transmit (TX) and receive (RX) antennas. The resulting architecture generates multiple fixed high-gain beams with improved angular resolution and minimal mutual interference. Each radar operates independently but is temporally synchronized through a centralized Python-based acquisition framework to enable parallel data collection and low-latency motion tracking. A 10-cm-diameter 3D-printed prototype demonstrates a measured gain enhancement of approximately 12 dB for each module, corresponding to a substantial improvement in detection range. Full-wave simulations and measurements confirm effective non-contact, privacy-preserving short-range human-motion detection across five 28-degree sectors, providing 140-degree total angular coverage. Fall-detection experiments further validate reliable wide-angle performance and continuous spatial tracking. The proposed system offers a compact, low-cost, and scalable platform for millimeter-wave sensing in ambient healthcare and smart-environment applications.</description>

      <title>Two-Layer Reinforcement Learning-Assisted Joint Beamforming and Trajectory Optimization for Multi-UAV Downlink Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are pivotal for future 6G non-terrestrial networks, yet their high mobility creates a complex coupled optimization problem for beamforming and trajectory design. Existing numerical methods suffer from prohibitive latency, while standard deep learning often ignores dynamic interference topology, limiting scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hierarchically decoupled framework synergizing graph neural networks (GNNs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, on the short timescale, we develop a topology-aware GNN beamformer by incorporating GraphNorm. By modeling the dynamic UAV-user association as a time-varying heterogeneous graph, this method explicitly extracts interference patterns to achieve sub-millisecond inference. On the long timescale, trajectory planning is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and solved via the multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm under the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm, facilitating cooperative behaviors. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art optimization heuristics and deep learning baselines in terms of system sum rate, convergence speed, and generalization capability.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Prediction in Textile Manufacturing: Enhancing Accuracy and Data Efficiency With Ensemble Deep Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional textile factories consume substantial energy, making energy-efficient production optimization crucial for sustainability and cost reduction. Meanwhile, deep neural networks (DNNs), which are effective for factory output prediction and operational optimization, require extensive historical data, posing challenges due to high sensor deployment and data collection costs. To address this, we propose Ensemble Deep Transfer Learning (EDTL), a novel framework that enhances prediction accuracy and data efficiency by integrating transfer learning with an ensemble strategy and a feature alignment layer. EDTL pretrains DNN models on data-rich production lines (source domain) and adapts them to data-limited lines (target domain), reducing dependency on large datasets. Experiments on real-world textile factory datasets show that EDTL improves prediction accuracy by 5.66% and enhances model robustness by 3.96% compared to conventional DNNs, particularly in data-limited scenarios (20%-40% data availability). This research contributes to energy-efficient textile manufacturing by enabling accurate predictions with fewer data requirements, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for smart production systems.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Cell Association in Nonuniform Renewable Energy-Powered Cellular Networks: Analysis and Optimization of Carbon Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing global push for carbon reduction highlights the importance of integrating renewable energy into the supply chain of cellular networks. However, due to the stochastic nature of renewable energy generation and the uneven load distribution across base stations, the utilization rate of renewable energy remains low. To address these challenges, this paper investigates the trade-off between carbon emissions and downlink throughput in cellular networks, offering insights into optimizing both network performance and sustainability. The renewable energy state of base station batteries and the number of occupied channels are modeled as a quasi-birth-death process. We construct models for the probability of channel blocking, average successful transmission probability for users, downlink throughput, carbon emissions, and carbon efficiency based on stochastic geometry. Based on these analyses, an energy-based cell association scheme is proposed to optimize the carbon efficiency of cellular networks. The results show that, compared to the closest cell association scheme, the energy-based cell association scheme is capable of reducing the carbon emissions of the network by 13.0% and improving the carbon efficiency by 11.3%.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming and Time Allocation for Time-Division Cell-Free Near-Field ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a time-division near-field integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework for cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), where sensing and downlink communication are separated in time. During the sensing phase, user locations are estimated and used to construct location-aware channels, which are then exploited in the subsequent communication phase. By explicitly modeling the coupling between sensing-induced localization errors and channel-estimation errors, we capture the tradeoff between sensing accuracy and communication throughput. Based on this model, we jointly optimize the time-allocation ratio, sensing covariance matrix, and robust downlink beamforming under imperfect channel state information (CSI). The resulting non-convex problem is addressed via a semidefinite programming (SDP)-based reformulation within an alternating-optimization framework. To further reduce computational complexity, we also propose two low-complexity suboptimal designs: an error-ignorant scheme and a maximum ratio transmission (MRT)-based scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves localization accuracy over far-field and monostatic setups, thereby reducing channel estimation errors and ultimately enhancing the achievable rate. Moreover, the error-ignorant scheme performs well under stringent sensing requirements, whereas the MRT-based scheme remains robust over a wide range of sensing requirements by adapting the time-allocation ratio, albeit with some beamforming loss.</description>

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has demonstrated great potential in enhancing wireless communication performance. In this paper, we investigate an MA-enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system with spatial modulation (SM), which improves communication performance by utilizing flexible MA placement while reducing the cost of RF chains. To this end, we propose a joint transceiver design framework aimed at minimizing the bit error rate (BER) based on the maximum minimum distance (MMD) criterion. To address the intractable problem, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves rapid convergence performance and significantly outperforms the existing benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Semantic Communication with Adaptive Source-Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a new paradigm to facilitate the performance of integrated sensing and communication systems in 6G. However, most of the existing works mainly focus on sensing data compression to reduce the subsequent communication overheads, without considering the integrated transmission framework for both the SemCom and sensing tasks. This paper proposes an adaptive source-channel coding and beamforming design framework for integrated sensing and SemCom systems by jointly optimizing the coding rate for SemCom task and the transmit beamforming for both the SemCom and sensing tasks. Specifically, an end-to-end semantic distortion function is approximated by deriving an upper bound composing of source and channel coding induced components, and then a hybrid Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (HCRB) is also derived for target position under imperfect time synchronization. To facilitate the joint optimization, a distortion minimization problem is formulated by considering the HCRB threshold, channel uses, and power budget. Subsequently, an alternative optimization algorithm composed of successive convex approximation and fractional programming is proposed to address this problem by decoupling it into two subproblems for coding rate and beamforming designs, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the conventional deep joint source-channel coding -water filling-zero forcing benchmark.</description>

      <title>Angular Sensing by Highly Reconfigurable Pixel Antennas with Joint Radiating Aperture and Feeding Ports Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular sensing capability is realized using highly reconfigurable pixel antenna (HRPA) with joint radiating aperture and feeding ports reconfiguration. Pixel antennas represent a general class of reconfigurable antenna designs in which the radiating surface, regardless of its shape or size, is divided into sub-wavelength elements called pixels. Each pixel is connected to its neighboring elements through radio frequency switches. By controlling pixel connections, the pixel antenna topology can be flexibly adjusted so that the resulting radiation pattern can be reconfigured. However, conventional pixel antennas have only a single, fixed-position feeding port, which is not efficient for angular sensing. Therefore, in this work, we further extend the reconfigurability of pixel antennas by introducing the HRPA, which enables both geometry control of the pixel antenna and switching of its feeding ports. The model of the proposed HRPA, including both circuit and radiation parameters, is derived. A codebook is then defined, consisting of pixel connection states and feeding port positions for each sensing area. Based on this codebook, an efficient optimization approach is developed to minimize the Cram\acute{\mathrm{\mathbf{e}}}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and obtain the optimal HRPA geometries for angular sensing within a given area. Numerical results show that the HRPA reduces the angle estimation error by more than 50% across the full three-dimensional sphere when compared with a conventional uniform planar array of the same size. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlights the potential of HRPA for integrated sensing and communication systems.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Relay (FAR)-assisted Communication with Hybrid Relaying Scheme Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a fluid antenna relay (FAR)-assisted communication system with hybrid relaying scheme selection. By leveraging statistical channel state information (CSI) and distribution characteristics of fluid antenna system (FAS), we approximate the outage probability (OP) with different relaying schemes utilizing a Gaussian copula-based method. Each relay node follows the OP-minimized principle to choose the forwarding schemes. To reduce self-interference and avoid multi-user interference, half-duplex relays and frequency division multiple access schemes are considered, respectively. On this basis, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem to mitigate the rate loss introduced by the half-duplex mode. To solve this problem, we first transform the original nonconvex problem into a power control optimization problem by obtaining the closed form of bandwidth allocation and substituting it into the original problem. Then, we solve the power control optimization problem with a low complexity method. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm to improve the sum rate of the system.</description>

      <title>Monostatic ISAC Without Full Buffers: Revisiting Spatial Trade-Offs Under Bursty Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the spatial trade-offs arising from the design of the transmit beamformer in a monostatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) base station (BS) under bursty traffic, a crucial aspect necessitated by the integration of communication and sensing functionalities in next-generation wireless systems. In this setting, the BS does not always have data available for transmission. This study compares different ISAC policies and reveals the presence of multiple effects influencing ISAC performance: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) boosting of data-aided strategies compared to pilot-based ones, saturation of the probability of detection in data-aided strategies due to the non-full-buffer assumption, and, finally, directional masking of sensing targets due to the relative position between target and user. Simulation results demonstrate varying impact of these effects on ISAC trade-offs under different operating conditions, thus guiding the design of efficient ISAC transmission strategies.</description>

      <title>6G OFDM Communications with High Mobility Transceivers and Scatterers via Angle-Domain Processing and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-mobility communications, which are crucial for next-generation wireless systems, cause the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform to suffer from strong intercarrier interference (ICI) due to the Doppler effect. In this work, we propose a novel receiver architecture for OFDM that leverages the angular domain to separate multipaths. A block-type pilot is sent to estimate direction-of-arrivals (DoAs), propagation delays, and channel gains of the multipaths. Subsequently, a decision-directed (DD) approach is employed to estimate and iteratively refine the Dopplers. Two different approaches are investigated to provide initial Doppler estimates: an error vector magnitude (EVM)-based method and a deep learning (DL)-based method. Simulation results reveal that the DL-based approach allows for constant bit error rate (BER) performance up to the maximum 6G speed of 1000 km/h.</description>

      <title>Physics-Aware RIS Codebook Compilation for Near-Field Beam Focusing under Mutual Coupling and Specular Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks are envisioned to achieve reliable, low-latency connectivity within environments characterized by strong multipath and severe channel variability. Programmable wireless environments (PWEs) address this challenge by enabling deterministic control of electromagnetic (EM) propagation through software-defined reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). However, effectively configuring RISs in real time remains a major bottleneck, particularly under near-field conditions where mutual coupling and specular reflections alter the intended response. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces MATCH, a physics-based codebook compilation algorithm that explicitly accounts for the EM coupling among RIS unit cells and the reflective interactions with surrounding structures, ensuring that the resulting codebooks remain consistent with the physical characteristics of the environment. Finally, MATCH is evaluated under a full-wave simulation framework incorporating mutual coupling and secondary reflections, demonstrating its ability to concentrate scattered energy within the focal region, confirming that physics-consistent, codebook-based optimization constitutes an effective approach for practical and efficient RIS configuration.</description>

      <title>When Is Distributed Nonlinear Aggregation Private? Optimality and Information-Theoretical Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear aggregation is central to modern distributed systems, yet its privacy behavior is far less understood than that of linear aggregation. Unlike linear aggregation where mature mechanisms can often suppress information leakage, nonlinear operators impose inherent structural limits on what privacy guarantees are theoretically achievable when the aggregate must be computed exactly. This paper develops a unified information-theoretic framework to characterize privacy leakage in distributed nonlinear aggregation under a joint adversary that combines passive (honest-but-curious) corruption and eavesdropping over communication channels.
  We cover two broad classes of nonlinear aggregates: order-based operators (maximum/minimum and top-$K$) and robust aggregation (median/quantiles and trimmed mean). We first derive fundamental lower bounds on leakage that hold without sacrificing accuracy, thereby identifying the minimum unavoidable information revealed by the computation and the transcript. We then propose simple yet effective privacy-preserving distributed algorithms, and show that with appropriate randomized initialization and parameter choices, our proposed approaches can attach the derived optimal bounds for the considered operators. Extensive experiments validate the tightness of the bounds and demonstrate that network topology and key algorithmic parameters (including the stepsize) govern the observed leakage in line with the theoretical analysis, yielding actionable guidelines for privacy-preserving nonlinear aggregation.</description>

      <title>OTFS-IDMA: An Unsourced Multiple Access Scheme for Doubly-Dispersive Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an unsourced multiple access (UMAC) scheme tailored to high-mobility wireless channels. The proposed construction is based on orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation and sparse interleaver division multiple access (IDMA) in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. The receiver runs a compressive-sensing joint activity-detection and channel estimation process followed by a single-user decoder which harnesses multipath diversity via the maximal-ratio combining (MRC) principle. Numerical results show the potential of DD-based uncoordinated schemes in the presence of double selectivity, while remarking the design tradeoffs and remaining challenges introduced by the proposed design.</description>

      <title>Seeing Radio: From Zero RF Priors to Explainable Modulation Recognition with Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of vision language models (VLMs) paves a new path for radio frequency (RF) perception. Rather than designing task-specific neural receivers, we ask if VLMs can learn to recognize modulations when RF waveforms are expressed as images. In this work, we find that they can. In specific, in this paper, we introduce a practical pipeline for converting complex IQ streams into visually interpretable inputs, hence, enabling general-purpose VLMs to classify modulation schemes without changing their underlying design. Building on this, we construct an RF visual question answering (VQA) benchmark framework that covers 57 classes across major families of analog/digital modulations with three complementary image modes, namely, (i) short \emph{time-series} IQ segments represented as real/imaginary traces, (ii) magnitude-only \emph{spectrograms}, and (iii) \emph{joint} representations that pair spectrograms with a synchronized time-series waveforms. We design uniform zero-shot and few-shot prompts for both class-level and family-level evaluations. Our finetuned VLMs with these images achieve competitive accuracy of $90\%$ compared to $10\%$ of the base models. Furthermore, the fine-tuned VLMs show robust performance under noise and demonstrate high generalization performance to unseen modulation types, without relying on RF-domain priors or specialized architectures. The obtained results show that combining RF-to-image conversion with promptable VLMs provides a scalable and practical foundation for RF-aware AI systems in future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Cooperative Beamforming for BDRIS-Assisted Cell-Free MIMO OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a wideband cell-free multi-stream multi-user Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system is considered operating within a smart wireless environment enabled by multiple Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (BDRISs). A novel decentralized active and passive beamforming framework, robust to imperfect channel state availability and with minimal cooperation among the system's multiple Base Stations (BSs) for deciding the final configurations of the shared BDRISs, is proposed, which aims to substantially reduce the overhead inherent in centralized solutions necessitating a central processing unit of high computational power. By considering a Dynamic Group-Connected (DGC) BDRIS architecture with frequency-selective responses per unit element, we formulate the system's sum-rate maximization problem with respect to the tunable capacitances and permutation matrices of the BDRISs as well as the precoding matrices of the BSs, which is solved via successive concave approximation and alternating projections as well as consensus-based updates for the BDRISs' design. Through extensive simulation results, it is showcased that the proposed robust decentralized cooperative approach with diverse BDRIS architectures outperforms non-cooperation benchmarks. It is also demonstrated that the considered DGC BDRIS architecture is able to provide sum-rate performance gains sufficiently close to the more complex fully-connected BDRIS structure.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Sparse Vector Transmission for Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse vector transmission (SVT) is a promising candidate technology for achieving ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). In this paper, a hierarchical SVT scheme is proposed for multi-user URLLC scenarios. The hierarchical SVT scheme partitions the transmitted bits into common and private parts. The common information is conveyed by the indices of non-zero sections in a sparse vector, while each user's private information is embedded into non-zero blocks with specific block lengths. At the receiver, the common bits are first recovered from the detected non-zero sections, followed by user-specific private bits decoding based on the corresponding non-zero block indices. Simulation results show the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art SVT schemes in terms of block error rate.</description>

      <title>Co-Channel Interference Mitigation Using Deep Learning for Drone-Based Large-Scale Antenna Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enable efficient in-situ radiation characterization of large-aperture antennas directly in their deployment environments. In such measurements, a continuous-wave (CW) probe tone is commonly transmitted to characterize the antenna response. However, active co-channel emissions from neighboring antennas often introduce severe in-band interference, where classical FFT-based estimators fail to accurately estimate the CW tone amplitude when the signal-to-interference ratios (SIR) falls below -10 dB. This paper proposes a lightweight deep convolutional neural network (DC-CNN) that estimates the amplitude of the CW tone. The model is trained and evaluated on real 5~GHz measurement bursts spanning an effective SIR range of --33.3 dB to +46.7 dB. Despite its compact size (&lt;20k parameters), the proposed DC-CNN achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7% over the full range, with &lt;1 dB error for SIR &gt;= -30 dB. This robustness and efficiency make DC-CNN suitable for deployment on embedded UAV platforms for interference-resilient antenna pattern characterization.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication in Underwater IoT Networks for Meaning-Driven Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) is revolutionizing marine sensing and environmental monitoring, as well as subaquatic exploration, which are enabled by interconnected and intelligent subsystems. Nevertheless, underwater communication is constrained by narrow bandwidth, high latency, and strict energy constraints, which are the source of efficiency problems in traditional data-centric networks. To tackle these problematic issues, this work provides a survey of recent advances in Semantic Communication (SC) for IoUT, a novel communication paradigm that seeks to harness not raw symbol information but rather its meaning and/or contextual significance. In this paper, we investigate the emerging advanced AI-powered frameworks, including large language models (LLMs), diffusion-based generative encoders, and federated learning (FL), that bridge semantic compression with context-aware prioritization and robust information reconstruction over noisy underwater channels. Hybrid acoustic-optical-RF architectures and edge-intelligent semantic encoders are also considered enablers of sustainable, adaptive operations. Examples in underwater archaeology, marine ecology, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) coordination are provided as a relief to illustrate the merits of meaning-driven connectivity. The paper concludes with some recommendations, including semantic representations standardization, cross-domain interpolation, and privacy-support schemes. These issues must be addressed in the future before trustworthy SC-enabled IoUT systems can be developed for underwater communication.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Self-Healing UAV Swarms for Robust 6G Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen an increased interest in the use of Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), especially the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide cost-effective global connectivity in next-generation wireless networks. We introduce a resilient, adaptive, self-healing network design (RASHND) to optimize signal quality under dynamic interference and adversarial conditions. RASHND leverages inter-node communication and an intelligent algorithm selection process, incorporating combining techniques like distributed-Maximal Ratio Combining (d-MRC), distributed-Linear Minimum Mean Squared Error Estimation(d-LMMSE), and Selection Combining (SC). These algorithms are selected to improve performance by adapting to changing network conditions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed RASHND solutions, a software-defined radio (SDR)-based hardware testbed afforded initial testing and evaluations. Additionally, we present results from UAV tests conducted on the AERPAW testbed to validate our solutions in real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that RASHND significantly enhances the reliability and interference resilience of UAV networks, making them well-suited for critical communications.</description>

      <title>Joint Subarray Selection, User Scheduling, and Pilot Assignment for XL-MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extra-large scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) is a key technology for meeting sixth-generation (6G) requirements for high-rate connectivity and uniform quality of service (QoS); however, its deployment is challenged by the prohibitive complexity of resource management based on instantaneous channel state information (CSI). To address this intractability, this work derives novel closed-form deterministic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expressions for both centralized and distributed uplink operations. Valid for Rician fading channels with minimum mean square error (MMSE) receive combining and MMSE channel estimation, these expressions depend exclusively on long-term channel statistics, providing a tractable alternative to computationally expensive instantaneous CSI-driven optimization. Building on these results, we develop statistical-CSI-based algorithms for joint subarray selection, users scheduling, and pilot assignment, leveraging the derived SINR approximations to maximize the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) among scheduled users while preserving computational tractability. The proposed framework exploits the spatial sparsity of user equipment (UE) visibility regions (VRs) to enable more aggressive pilot reuse than is possible in conventional massive MIMO. Numerical results validate the high accuracy of the derived SINR approximations and demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly enhance fairness and throughput in crowded scenarios.</description>

      <title>Near-field Physical Layer Security: Robust Beamforming under Location Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study robust beamforming design for near-field physical-layer-security (PLS) systems, where a base station (BS) equipped with an extremely large-scale array (XL-array) serves multiple near-field legitimate users (Bobs) in the presence of multiple near-field eavesdroppers (Eves). Unlike existing works that mostly assume perfect channel state information (CSI) or location information of Eves, we consider a more practical and challenging scenario, where the locations of Bobs are perfectly known, while only imperfect location information of Eves is available at the BS. We first formulate a robust optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of Bobs while guaranteeing a worst-case limit on the eavesdropping rate under location uncertainty. By transforming Cartesian position errors into the polar domain, we reveal an important near-field angular-error amplification effect: for the same location error, the closer the Eve, the larger the angle error, severely degrading the performance of conventional robust beamforming methods based on imperfect channel state information. To address this issue, we first establish the conditions for which the first-order Taylor approximation of the near-field channel steering vector under location uncertainty is largely accurate. Then, we propose a two-stage robust beamforming method, which first partitions the uncertainty region into multiple fan-shaped sub-regions, followed by the second stage to formulate and solve a refined linear-matrix-inequality (LMI)-based robust beamforming optimization problem. In addition, the proposed method is further extended to scenarios with multiple Bobs and multiple Eves. Finally, numerical results validate that the proposed method achieves a superior trade-off between rate performance and secrecy robustness, hence significantly outperforming existing benchmarks under Eve location uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Instant Preliminary Cardiac Analysis from Smartphone Auscultation: A Real-World Canine Heart Sound Dataset and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a real-world canine heart sound dataset and evaluates SoNUS version 3.2.x, a machine learning algorithm for preliminary cardiac analysis using smartphone microphone recordings. More than one hundred recordings were collected from dogs across four continents, with thirty eight recordings annotated by board certified veterinary cardiologists for quantitative evaluation. SoNUS version 3.2.x employs a multi-stage fallback architecture with quality-aware filtering to ensure reliable output under variable recording conditions. The primary sixty second model achieved mean and median heart rate accuracies of ninety one point six three percent and ninety four point nine five percent, while a fast model optimized for thirty to forty second recordings achieved mean and median accuracies of eighty eight point eight six percent and ninety two point nine eight percent. These results demonstrate the feasibility of extracting clinically relevant cardiac information from opportunistic smartphone recordings, supporting scalable preliminary assessment and telehealth applications in veterinary cardiology.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Enabled Signal Detection for MIMO-OTFS-Based 6G and Future Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation stands out as a promising waveform for sixth generation (6G) and beyond wireless communication systems, offering superior performance over conventional methods, particularly in high-mobility scenarios and dispersive channel conditions. Recent research has demonstrated that the reduced computational complexity of deep learning (DL)-based signal detection (SD) methods constitutes a compelling alternative to conventional techniques. In this study, low-complexity DL-based SD methods are proposed for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OTFS system and examined under Nakagami-$m$ channel conditions. The symbols obtained from the receiver antennas are combined using maximum ratio combining (MRC) and detected with the help of a DL-based detector implemented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and residual network (ResNet). Complexity analysis reveals that the MLP architecture offers significantly lower computational complexity compared to CNN, ResNet, and classical methods such as maximum likelihood detection (MLD). Furthermore, numerical analyses have shown that the proposed DL-based detectors, despite their low complexity, achieve comparable bit error rate (BER) performance to that of a high-performance MLD under various system conditions.</description>

      <title>TSN-IoT: A Two-Stage NOMA-Enabled Framework for Prioritized Traffic Handling in Dense IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing applications of the Internet of Things (IoT), a major challenge is to ensure continuous connectivity while providing prioritized access. In dense IoT scenarios, synchronization may be disrupted either by the movement of nodes away from base stations or by the unavailability of reliable Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, which can be affected by physical obstructions, multipath fading, or environmental interference, such as such as walls, buildings, moving objects, or electromagnetic noise from surrounding devices. In such contexts, distributed synchronization through Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) offers a promising solution, as it enables simultaneous transmission to multiple users with different power levels, supporting efficient synchronization while minimizing the signaling overhead. Moreover, NOMA also plays a vital role for dynamic priority management in dense and heterogeneous IoT environments. In this article, we proposed a Two-Stage NOMA-Enabled Framework "TSN-IoT" that integrates the mechanisms of conventional Precision Time Protocol (PTP) based synchronization, distributed synchronization and data transmission. The framework is designed as a four-tier architecture that facilitates prioritized data delivery from sensor nodes to the central base station. We demonstrated the performance of "TSN-IoT" through a healthcare use case, where intermittent connectivity and varying data priority levels present key challenges for reliable communication. Synchronization speed and end-to-end delay were evaluated through a series of simulations implemented in Python. Results show that, compared to priority-based Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), TSN-IoT achieves significantly better performance by offering improved synchronization opportunities and enabling parallel transmissions over the same sub-carrier.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation in MIMO Systems Using Flow Matching Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems require efficient and accurate channel estimation with low pilot overhead to unlock their full potential for high spectral and energy efficiency. While deep generative models have emerged as a powerful foundation for the channel estimation task, the existing approaches using diffusion-based and score-based models suffer from high computational runtime due to their stochastic and many-step iterative sampling. In this paper, we introduce a flow matching-based channel estimator to overcome this limitation. The proposed channel estimator is based on a deep neural network trained to learn the velocity field of wireless channels, which we then integrate into a plug-and-play proximal gradient descent (PnP-PGD) framework. Simulation results reveal that our formulated approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative model-based estimators, achieves up to 49 times faster inference at test time, and reduces up to 20 times peak graphics processing unit (GPU) memory usage. Our code and models are publicly available to support reproducible research.</description>

      <title>Riemannian optimization on the manifold of unitary and symmetric matrices with application to BD-RIS-assisted systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we rigorously characterize for the first time the manifold of unitary and symmetric matrices, deriving its tangent space and its geodesics. The resulting parameterization of the geodesics (through a real and symmetric matrix) allows us to derive a new Riemannian manifold optimization (MO) algorithm whose most remarkable feature is that it does not need to set any adaptation parameter. We apply the proposed MO algorithm to maximize the achievable rate in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system assisted by a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), illustrating the method's performance through simulations. The MO algorithm achieves a significant reduction in computational cost compared to previous alternatives based on Takagi decomposition, while retaining global convergence to a stationary point of the cost function.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Resource Allocation in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider power allocation and antenna activation of cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems. We first derive closed-form expressions for the system spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) as functions of the power allocation coefficients and the number of active antennas at the access points (APs). Then, we aim to enhance the EE through jointly optimizing antenna activation and power control. This task leads to a non-convex and mixed-integer design problem with high-dimensional design variables. To address this, we propose a novel DRL-based framework, in which the agent learns to map large-scale fading coefficients to AP activation ratio, antenna coefficient, and power coefficient. These coefficients are then employed to determine the number of active antennas per AP and the power factors assigned to users based on closed-form expressions. By optimizing these parameters instead of directly controlling antenna selection and power allocation, the proposed method transforms the intractable optimization into a low-dimensional learning task. Our extensive simulations demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed scheme. Specifically, in a CFmMIMO system with 40 APs and 20 users, it achieves a 50% EE improvement and 3350 times run time reduction compared to the conventional sequential convex approximation method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Calibration of the endpoint-corrected Hilbert Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, low-latency estimates of the instantaneous phase of oscillations are essential for closed-loop sensing and actuation, including (but not limited to) phase-locked neurostimulation and other real-time applications. The endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT) reduces boundary artefacts of the Hilbert transform by applying a causal narrow-band filter to the analytic spectrum. This improves the phase estimate at the most recent sample. Despite its widespread empirical use, the systematic endpoint distortions of ecHT have lacked a principled, closed-form analysis. In this study, we derive the ecHT endpoint operator analytically and demonstrate that its output can be decomposed into a desired positive-frequency term (a deterministic complex gain that induces a calibratable amplitude/phase bias) and a residual leakage term setting an irreducible variance floor. This yields (i) an explicit characterisation and bounds for endpoint phase/amplitude error, (ii) a mean-squared-error-optimal scalar calibration (c-ecHT), and (iii) practical design rules relating window length, bandwidth/order, and centre-frequency mismatch to residual bias via an endpoint group delay. The resulting calibrated ecHT achieves near-zero mean phase error and remains computationally compatible with real-time pipelines. Code and analyses are provided at https://github.com/eosmers/cecHT.</description>

      <title>Achieving Full Multipath Diversity by Random Constellation Rotation: a Theoretical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diversity is an essential concept associated with communication reliability in multipath channels since it determines the slope of bit error rate performance in the medium to high signal-to-noise ratio regions. However, most of the existing analytical frameworks were developed for specific modulation schemes while the efficient validation of full multipath diversity for general modulation schemes remains an open problem. To fill this research gap, we propose to utilize random constellation rotation to ease the conditions for full-diversity modulation designs. For linearly precoded cyclic-prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, we prove that maximum multipath diversity can be attained as long as the spread matrix does not have zero entries, which is a sufficient but easily satisfied condition. Furthermore, we derive the sufficient and necessary condition for general modulation schemes, whose verification can be divided into validation tasks for each column of the modulation matrix. Based on the proposed conditions, maximum diversity order can be attained with the probability of 1 by enabling a randomly generated rotation pattern for both time and doubly dispersive channels. The theoretical analysis in this paper also demonstrates that the diversity evaluation can be concentrated on the pairwise error probability when the number of error symbols is one, which reduces the complexity of diversity-driven design and performance analysis for novel modulation schemes significantly in both time and doubly dispersive channels. Finally, numerical results for various modulation schemes confirm that the theoretical analysis holds in both time and doubly dispersive channels. Furthermore, when employing practical detectors, the random constellation rotation technique consistently enhance the transmission reliability for both coded and uncoded systems.</description>

      <title>Background Subtraction with Drift Correction for Bistatic Radar Reflectivity Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental research on bistatic radar reflectivity is highly relevant, e.g., to the upcoming mobile communication standard 6G, which includes integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). We introduce a model for correcting instrumentation drift during bistatic radar measurements in anechoic chambers. Usually, background subtraction is applied with the goal to yield the target reflection signal as best as possible while coherently subtracting all signals which were present in both the foreground and background measurement. However, even slight incoherences between the foreground and background measurement process deteriorate the result. We analyze these effects in real measurements in the frequency range 2-18 GHz, taken with the Bistatic Radar (BIRA) measurement facility at TU Ilmenau. Applying our proposed drift correction model, we demonstrate up to 40 dB improvement for the removal of direct line-of-sight antenna crosstalk over the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Bit-Efficient Quantisation for Two-Channel Modulo-Sampling Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-channel modulo analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) enable high-dynamic-range signal sensing at the Nyquist rate per channel, but existing designs quantise both channel outputs independently, incurring redundant bitrate costs. This paper proposes a bit-efficient quantisation scheme that exploits the integer-valued structure of inter-channel differences, transmitting one quantised channel output together with a compact difference index. We prove that this approach requires only 1-2 bits per signal sample overhead relative to conventional ADCs, despite operating with a much smaller per-channel dynamic range. Simulations confirm the theoretical error bounds and bitrate analysis, while hardware experiments demonstrate substantial bitrate savings compared with existing modulo sampling schemes, while maintaining comparable reconstruction accuracy. These results highlight a practical path towards high-resolution, bandwidth-efficient modulo ADCs for bitrate-constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Burst Aware Forecasting of User Traffic Demand in LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, Beam Hopping (BH) technology enables the efficient utilization of limited radio resources by adapting to varying user demands and link conditions. Effective BH planning requires prior knowledge of upcoming traffic at the time of scheduling, making forecasting an important sub-task. Forecasting becomes particularly critical under heavy load conditions where an unexpected demand burst combined with link degradation may cause buffer overflows and packet loss. To address this challenge, we propose a burst aware forecasting solution. This challenge may arise in a wide range of wireless networks; therefore, the proposed solution is broadly applicable to settings characterized by bursty traffic patterns where accurate demand forecasting is essential. Our approach introduces three key enhancements to a transformer architecture: (i) a distance from the last burst embedding to capture burst proximity, (ii) two additional linear layers in the decoder to forecast both upcoming bursts and their relative impact, and (iii) use of an asymmetric cost function during model training to better capture burst dynamics. Empirical evaluations in an Earth-fixed cell under high-traffic demand scenario demonstrate that the proposed model reduces prediction error by up to 94% at a one-step horizon and maintains the ability to accurately capture bursts even near the end of longer prediction horizons following Mean Square Error (MSE) metric.</description>

      <title>Robust Localization in OFDM-Based Massive MIMO through Phase Offset Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate localization in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)-based massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems depends critically on phase coherence across subcarriers and antennas. However, practical systems suffer from frequency-dependent and (spatial) antenna-dependent phase offsets, degrading localization accuracy. This paper analytically studies the impact of phase incoherence on localization performance under a static User Equipment (UE) and Line-of-Sight (LoS) scenario. We use two complementary tools. First, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) to quantify the theoretical limits under phase offsets. Then, we develop a Spatial Ambiguity Function (SAF)-based model to characterize ambiguity patterns. Simulation results reveal that spatial phase offsets severely degrade localization performance, while frequency phase offsets have a minor effect in the considered system configuration. To address this, we propose a robust Channel State Information (CSI) calibration framework and validate it using real-world measurements from a practical massive MIMO testbed. The experimental results confirm that the proposed calibration framework significantly improves the localization Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) from 5 m to 1.2 cm, aligning well with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, made difficult by the data's high dimensionality.We propose a parameter-parsimonious framework based on a low-rank Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) of the entire latent HSI $\mathbf{\mathcal{X}} \in \mathbb{R}^{P\times Q \times N}$.This approach recasts the problem from recovering a large-scale image with $PQN$ variables to estimating the CPD factors with $(P+Q+N)R$ variables.This model also enables a structure-aware, anisotropic Total Variation (TV) regularization applied only to the spatial factors, preserving the smooth spectral signatures.An efficient algorithm based on the Proximal Alternating Linearized Minimization (PALM) framework is developed to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem.Experiments confirm the model's efficiency, showing a numerous parameter reduction of over two orders of magnitude and a compelling trade-off between model compactness and reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Self-Supervised Detection of Fundamental Frequency and Accurate Probability of Voicing in Monophonic Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable fundamental frequency (F 0) and voicing estimation is essential for neural synthesis, yet many pitch extractors depend on large labeled corpora and degrade under realistic recording artifacts. We propose a lightweight, fully self-supervised framework for joint F 0 estimation and voicing inference, designed for rapid single-instrument training from limited audio. Using transposition-equivariant learning on CQT features, we introduce an EM-style iterative reweighting scheme that uses Shift Cross-Entropy (SCE) consistency as a reliability signal to suppress uninformative noisy/unvoiced frames. The resulting weights provide confidence scores that enable pseudo-labeling for a separate lightweight voicing classifier without manual annotations. Trained on MedleyDB and evaluated on MDB-stem-synth ground truth, our method achieves competitive cross-corpus performance (RPA 95.84, RCA 96.24) and demonstrates cross-instrument generalization.</description>

      <title>Indoor Occupancy Classification using a Compact Hybrid Quantum-Classical Model Enabled by a Physics-Informed Radar Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor occupancy classification enables privacy-preserving monitoring in settings such as remote elder care, where presence information helps triage alarms without cameras or wearables. Radar suits this role by sensing motion through occlusions and in darkness. Modern deep-learning pipelines are the standard for interpreting radar returns effectively; however, they are often parameter-heavy and sensitive at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), motivating compact alternatives like Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs). A two-qubit HQNN is benchmarked against convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using a physics-informed 60GHz digital twin and real radar measurements under matched training protocols. In clean conditions, the HQNN achieves high accuracy (99.7% synthetic; 97.0% real) with up to 170x fewer parameters (0.066M). Its parameter efficiency is shown to be structural, as an ablation of the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) causes sharp performance drops on real data (to 68.5% and 31.5% for the control heads). A domain-dependent sensitivity emerges under additive-noise evaluation, where the HQNN begins recovery earlier in synthetic data while CNNs recover more steeply and peak higher on real measurements. In label-fraction ablations, CNNs prove more sample-efficient on real Range-Doppler Maps (RDMs), with the performance gap being most pronounced (at 50% labels, BA 0.89-0.99 vs. HQNN 0.75). On synthetic data, this gap narrows significantly, largely vanishing by the 50% label mark. Overall, the HQNN's value lies in parameter efficiency and a compact inductive bias that shapes its distinct sensitivity profile; this work establishes a rigorous baseline for hybrid quantum models in privacy-preserving radar occupancy sensing.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Learning Strategies for Estimation Error Minimization with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address real-time sampling and estimation of autoregressive Markovian sources in dynamic yet structurally similar multi-hop wireless networks. Each node caches samples from others and communicates over wireless collision channels, aiming to minimize time-average estimation error via decentralized policies. Due to the high dimensionality of action spaces and complexity of network topologies, deriving optimal policies analytically is intractable. To address this, we propose a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for policy optimization. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed policies are transferable, allowing a policy trained on one graph to be effectively applied to structurally similar graphs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) the trained policies are transferable to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of agents; (iii) the graphical training procedure withstands non-stationarity, even when using independent learning techniques; and (iv) recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity.</description>

      <title>Active Inference-Driven World Modeling for Adaptive UAV Swarm Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an Active Inference-based framework for autonomous trajectory design in UAV swarms. The method integrates probabilistic reasoning and self-learning to enable distributed mission allocation, route ordering, and motion planning. Expert trajectories generated using a Genetic Algorithm with Repulsion Forces (GA-RF) are employed to train a hierarchical World Model capturing swarm behavior across mission, route, and motion levels. During online operation, UAVs infer actions by minimizing divergence between current beliefs and model-predicted states, enabling adaptive responses to dynamic environments. Simulation results show faster convergence, higher stability, and safer navigation than Q-Learning, demonstrating the scalability and cognitive grounding of the proposed framework for intelligent UAV swarm control.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware Energy Optimization via Cell Switching in Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for mobile data services in dense urban areas has intensified the need for energy-efficient radio access networks (RANs) in future 6G systems. In this context, one promising strategy is cell switching (CS), which dynamically deactivates underutilized small base stations (SBSs) to reduce power consumption. However, while previous research explored CS primarily based on traffic load, ensuring user quality of service (QoS) under realistic channel conditions remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-driven CS framework that jointly minimizes network power consumption and guarantees user QoS by enforcing a minimum received power threshold as part of offloading decisions. In contrast to prior load-based or learning-based approaches, our method explicitly integrates channel-aware information into the CS process, thus ensuring reliable service quality for offloaded users. Furthermore, flexibility of the proposed framework enables operators to adapt system behavior between energy-saving and QoS-preserving modes by tuning a single design parameter. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves up to 30% power savings as compared to baseline methods while fully maintaining QoS under diverse network conditions. Scalability and robustness of the proposed method in realistic heterogeneous networks (HetNets) further highlight its potential as a practical solution for sustainable 6G deployments.</description>

      <title>An AMP-Based Asymptotic Analysis For Nonlinear One-Bit Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the asymptotic analysis of a class of nonlinear one-bit precoding schemes under Rayleigh fading channels. The considered scheme employs a convex-relaxation-then-quantization (CRQ) approach to the well-known minimum mean square error (MMSE) model, which includes the classical one-bit precoder SQUID as a special case. To analyze its asymptotic behavior, we develop a novel analytical framework based on approximate message passing (AMP). We show that, the statistical properties of the considered scheme can be asymptotically characterized by a scalar ``signal plus Gaussian noise'' model. Based on this, we further derive a closed-form expression for the symbol error probability (SEP) in the large-system limit, which quantitatively characterizes the impact of both system and model parameters on SEP performance. Simulation results validate our analysis and also demonstrate that performance gains over SQUID can be achieved by appropriately tuning the parameters involved in the considered model.</description>

      <title>RetinexGuI: Retinex-Guided Iterative Illumination Estimation Method for Low Light Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in low-light image enhancement (LLIE) due to its importance for critical downstream tasks. Current Retinex-based methods and learning-based approaches have shown significant LLIE performance. However, computational complexity and dependencies on large training datasets often limit their applicability in real-time applications. We introduce RetinexGuI, a novel and effective Retinex-guided LLIE framework to overcome these limitations. The proposed method first separates the input image into illumination and reflection layers, and iteratively refines the illumination while keeping the reflectance component unchanged. With its simplified formulation and computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, our RetinexGuI demonstrates impressive enhancement performance across three public datasets, indicating strong potential for large-scale applications. Furthermore, it opens promising directions for theoretical analysis and integration with deep learning approaches. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/etuspars/RetinexGuI once the paper is accepted.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Transformer Decoder for Automotive Radar Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Transformer-based architecture for 3D radar object detection that uses a novel Transformer Decoder as the prediction head to directly regress 3D bounding boxes and class scores from radar feature representations. To bridge multi-scale radar features and the decoder, we propose Pyramid Token Fusion (PTF), a lightweight module that converts a feature pyramid into a unified, scale-aware token sequence. By formulating detection as a set prediction problem with learnable object queries and positional encodings, our design models long-range spatial-temporal correlations and cross-feature interactions. This approach eliminates dense proposal generation and heuristic post-processing such as extensive non-maximum suppression (NMS) tuning. We evaluate the proposed framework on the RADDet, where it achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art radar-only baselines.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Free Confidence Ellipsoids for Ridge Regression with PAC Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linearly parametrized models are widely used in control and signal processing, with the least-squares (LS) estimate being the archetypical solution. When the input is insufficiently exciting, the LS problem may be unsolvable or numerically unstable. This issue can be resolved through regularization, typically with ridge regression. Although regularized estimators reduce the variance error, it remains important to quantify their estimation uncertainty. A possible approach for linear regression is to construct confidence ellipsoids with the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) ellipsoidal outer approximation (EOA) algorithm. The SPS EOA builds non-asymptotic confidence ellipsoids under the assumption that the noises are independent and symmetric about zero. This paper introduces an extension of the SPS EOA algorithm to ridge regression, and derives probably approximately correct (PAC) upper bounds for the resulting region sizes. Compared with previous analyses, our result explicitly show how the regularization parameter affects the region sizes, and provide tighter bounds under weaker excitation assumptions. Finally, the practical effect of regularization is also demonstrated via simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>S$^2$Voice: Style-Aware Autoregressive Modeling with Enhanced Conditioning for Singing Style Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present S$^2$Voice, the winning system of the Singing Voice Conversion Challenge (SVCC) 2025 for both the in-domain and zero-shot singing style conversion tracks. Built on the strong two-stage Vevo baseline, S$^2$Voice advances style control and robustness through several contributions. First, we integrate style embeddings into the autoregressive large language model (AR LLM) via a FiLM-style layer-norm conditioning and a style-aware cross-attention for enhanced fine-grained style modeling. Second, we introduce a global speaker embedding into the flow-matching transformer to improve timbre similarity. Third, we curate a large, high-quality singing corpus via an automated pipeline for web harvesting, vocal separation, and transcript refinement. Finally, we employ a multi-stage training strategy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). Subjective listening tests confirm our system's superior performance: leading in style similarity and singer similarity for Task 1, and across naturalness, style similarity, and singer similarity for Task 2. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our contributions in enhancing style fidelity, timbre preservation, and generalization. Audio samples are available~\footnote{https://honee-w.github.io/SVC-Challenge-Demo/}.</description>

      <title>Correction of Pooling Matrix Mis-specifications in Compressed Sensing Based Group Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compressed sensing, which involves the reconstruction of sparse signals from an under-determined linear system, has been recently used to solve problems in group testing. In a public health context, group testing aims to determine the health status values of p subjects from n&lt;&lt;p pooled tests, where a pool is defined as a mixture of small, equal-volume portions of the samples of a subset of subjects. This approach saves on the number of tests administered in pandemics or other resource-constrained scenarios. In practical group testing in time-constrained situations, a technician can inadvertently make a small number of errors during pool preparation, which leads to errors in the pooling matrix, which we term `model mismatch errors' (MMEs). This poses difficulties while determining health status values of the participating subjects from the results on n&lt;&lt;p pooled tests. In this paper, we present an algorithm to correct the MMEs in the pooled tests directly from the pooled results and the available (inaccurate) pooling matrix. Our approach then reconstructs the signal vector from the corrected pooling matrix, in order to determine the health status of the subjects. We further provide theoretical guarantees for the correction of the MMEs and the reconstruction error from the corrected pooling matrix. We also provide several supporting numerical results.</description>

      <title>A Predictive and Preventive Digital Twin Framework for Indoor Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wi-Fi networks increasingly suffer from performance degradation caused by contention-based channel access, dense deployments, and largely self-managed operation among mutually interfering access points (APs). In this paper, we propose a Digital Twin (DT) framework that captures the essential spatial and temporal characteristics of wireless channels and traffic patterns, enabling the prediction of likely future network scenarios while respecting physical constraints. Leveraging this predictive capability, we introduce two analytically derived performance upper bounds-one based on Shannon capacity and the other on latency behavior under CSMA-CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)-that can be evaluated efficiently without time-consuming network simulations. By applying importance sampling to DT-generated scenarios, potentially risky network conditions can be identified within large stochastic scenario spaces. These same performance bounds are then used to proactively guide a gradient-based search for improved network configurations, with the objective of avoiding imminent performance degradation rather than pursuing globally optimal but fragile solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can successfully predict time-dependent network congestion and mitigate it in advance, highlighting its potential for predictive and preventive Wi-Fi network management.</description>

      <title>Co-Initialization of Control Filter and Secondary Path via Meta-Learning for Active Noise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active noise control (ANC) must adapt quickly when the acoustic environment changes, yet early performance is largely dictated by initialization. We address this with a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) co-initialization that jointly sets the control filter and the secondary-path model for FxLMS-based ANC while keeping the runtime algorithm unchanged. The initializer is pre-trained on a small set of measured paths using short two-phase inner loops that mimic identification followed by residual-noise reduction, and is applied by simply setting the learned initial coefficients. In an online secondary path modeling FxLMS testbed, it yields lower early-stage error, shorter time-to-target, reduced auxiliary-noise energy, and faster recovery after path changes than a baseline without re-initialization. The method provides a simple fast start for feedforward ANC under environment changes, requiring a small set of paths to pre-train.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aortic valve opening (AO) events are crucial for detecting frequency and rhythm disorders, especially in real-world settings where seismocardiography (SCG) signals collected via consumer smartphones are subject to noise, motion artifacts, and variability caused by device heterogeneity. In this work, we present a robust deep-learning framework for SCG segmentation and rhythm analysis using accelerometer recordings obtained with consumer smartphones. We develop an enhanced U-Net v3 architecture that integrates multi-scale convolutions, residual connections, and attention gates, enabling reliable segmentation of noisy SCG signals. A dedicated post-processing pipeline converts probability masks into precise AO timestamps, whereas a novel adaptive 3D-to-1D projection method ensures robustness to arbitrary smartphone orientation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistently high accuracy and robustness across various device types and unsupervised data-collection conditions. Our approach enables practical, low-cost, and automated cardiac-rhythm monitoring using everyday mobile devices, paving the way for scalable, field-deployable cardiovascular assessment and future multimodal diagnostic systems.</description>

      <title>Storage-Rate Trade-off in A-XPIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the storage problem in an asymmetric $X$-secure private information retrieval (A-XPIR) setting. The A-XPIR setting considers the $X$-secure PIR problem (XPIR) when a given arbitrary set of servers is communicating. We focus on the trade-off region between the average storage at the servers and the average download cost. In the case of $N=4$ servers and two non-overlapping sets of communicating servers with $K=2$ messages, we characterize the achievable region and show that the three main inequalities compared to the no-security case collapse to two inequalities in the asymmetric security case. In the general case, we derive bounds that need to be satisfied for the general achievable region for an arbitrary number of servers and messages. In addition, we provide the storage and retrieval scheme for the case of $N=4$ servers with $K=2$ messages and two non-overlapping sets of communicating servers, such that the messages are not replicated (in the sense of a coded version of each symbol) and at the same time achieve the optimal achievable rate for the case of replication. Finally, we derive the exact capacity for the case of asymmetric security and asymmetric collusion for $N=4$ servers, with the communication links $\{1,2\}$ and $\{3,4\}$, which splits the servers into two groups, i.e., $g=2$, and with the collusion links $\{1,3\}$, $\{2,4\}$, as $C=\frac{1}{3}$. More generally, we derive a capacity result for a certain family of asymmetric collusion and asymmetric security cases.</description>

      <title>Transferable Graphical MARL for Real-Time Estimation in Dynamic Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03227v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study real-time sampling and estimation of autoregressive Markovian sources in decentralized and dynamic multi-hop networks that share similar structures. Nodes cache neighboring samples and communicate over wireless collision channels. The objective is to minimize the time-average estimation error and/or the age of information under decentralized policies, which we address by developing a unified graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. A key feature of the framework is its transferability, enabled by the fact that the number of trainable parameters is independent of the number of agents, allowing a learned policy to be directly deployed on dynamic yet structurally similar graphs without re-training. Building on this design, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees on the transferability of the resulting policies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on dynamic graphs; (ii) the trained policies transfer well to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of nodes; and (iii) incorporating recurrence is crucial, enhancing resilience to non-stationarity in both independent learning and centralized training with decentralized execution.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a multi-low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite system that simultaneously provides positioning and communication services to terrestrial user terminals. To address the challenges of accurately acquiring channel state information in LEO satellite systems, we propose a novel two-timescale positioning-aided channel estimation framework, exploiting the distinct variation rates of position-related parameters and channel gains inherent in LEO satellite channels. Using the misspecified Cram\'er-Rao bound (MCRB) theory, we systematically analyze positioning performance under practical imperfections, such as inter-satellite clock bias and carrier frequency offset. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate how position information derived from downlink positioning can enhance uplink channel estimation accuracy, even in the presence of positioning errors, through an MCRB-based analysis. To address the limited link budgets and communication rates of single-satellite communication, we develop a multi-LEO cooperative beamforming strategy for downlink transmission that leverages cluster-wise satellite cooperation while maintaining reduced complexity. Theoretical analyses and numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in facilitating high-precision downlink positioning under practical imperfections, facilitating uplink channel estimation, and enabling efficient downlink communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, the main bottlenecks of location- and orientation-assisted beam alignment using deep neural networks (DNNs) are large training overhead and significant performance degradation. This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-based beam selection approach that reduces the training overhead and improves the alignment accuracy, by capitalizing on the strong expressive ability and few trainable parameters of GNN. The channels of beams are correlated according to the beam direction. Therefore, we establish a graph according to the angular correlation between beams and use GNN to capture the channel correlation between adjacent beams, which helps accelerate the learning process and enhance the beam alignment performance. Compared to existing DNN-based algorithms, the proposed method requires only 20\% of the dataset size to achieve equivalent accuracy and improves the Top-1 accuracy by 10\% when using the same dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) has gained significant attention due to its high-speed data transmission and throughput. Optical wireless channels are often assumed to be flat, but we evaluate frequency selective channels to consider high data rate optical wireless or very dispersive environments. To address this for optical scenarios, this paper presents a robust channel estimation framework with low-complexity to mitigate frequency-selective effects, then to improve system reliability and performance. This channel estimation framework contains a neural network that can estimate general optical wireless channels without prior channel information about the environment. Based on this estimate and the corresponding delay spread, one of several candidate offline-trained neural networks will be activated to predict this channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method has improved and robust normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional estimation methods while maintaining computational efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of neural network solutions in enhancing the performance of OWC systems under indoor channel conditions.</description>

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) enables efficient spectrum utilization and reduces hardware costs for beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G networks, facilitating intelligent applications that require both high-performance communication and precise sensing capabilities. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the evolution of ISAC over the years. We examine the expansion of the spectrum across RF and optical ISAC, highlighting the role of advanced technologies, along with key challenges and synergies. We further discuss the advancements in network architecture from single-cell to multi-cell systems, emphasizing the integration of collaborative sensing and interference mitigation strategies. Moreover, we analyze the progress from single-modal to multi-modal sensing, with a focus on the integration of edge intelligence to enable real-time data processing, reduce latency, and enhance decision-making. Finally, we extensively review standardization efforts by 3GPP, IEEE, and ITU, examining the transition of ISAC-related technologies and their implications for the deployment of 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Signal Detection with Unknown Bandwidths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signal detection in environments with unknown signal bandwidth and time intervals is a fundamental problem in adversarial and spectrum-sharing scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of detecting signals occupying unknown degrees of freedom from non-coherent power measurements, where the signal is constrained to an interval in one dimension or a hyper-cube in multiple dimensions. A GLRT is derived, resulting in a straightforward metric involving normalized average signal energy for each candidate signal set. We present bounds on false alarm and missed detection probabilities, demonstrating their dependence on SNR and signal set sizes. To overcome the inherent computational complexity of exhaustive searches, we propose a computationally efficient binary search method, reducing the complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) for one-dimensional cases. Simulations indicate that the method maintains performance near exhaustive searches and achieves asymptotic consistency, with interval-of-overlap converging to one under constant SNR as measurement size increases. The simulation studies also demonstrate superior performance and reduced complexity compared to contemporary neural network-based approaches, specifically outperforming custom-trained U-Net models in spectrum detection tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of nonlinear systems is a frequent task in digital signal processing. Such nonlinear systems may be grouped into many sub-classes, whereby numerous nonlinear real-world systems can be approximated as bilinear (BL) models. Therefore, various optimum and adaptive BL filters have been introduced in recent years. Moreover, in many applications, such as communications and radar, complex-valued (CV) BL systems in combination with CV signals may occur. Hence, in this work, we investigate the extension of real-valued (RV) BL filters to CV BL filters. First, we derive CV BL filters by applying two or four RV BL filters, and compare them with respect to their computational complexity and performance. Second, we introduce novel fully CV BL filters, such as the CV BL Wiener filter (C-BWF), the CV BL least squares (C-BLS) filter, the CV BL least mean squares (C-BLMS) filter, the CV BL normalized least mean squares (C-BNLMS) filter, and the CV BL recursive least squares (C-BRLS) filter. Finally, these filters are applied to identify CV multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems and CV Hammerstein models.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Unrolling-based Denoising of Multimodal Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a denoising method for multimodal graph signals by an alternating minimization scheme that sequentially solves signal restoration and graph learning problems. Many complex-structured data, i.e., those on sensor networks, can capture multiple modalities at each measurement point, referred to as modalities. They are also assumed to have an underlying structure or correlations in modality as well as space. Such multimodal data are regarded as graph signals on a twofold graph and they are often corrupted by noise. Furthermore, their spatial/modality relationships are not always given a priori: We need to estimate twofold graphs during a denoising algorithm. In this paper, we consider a signal denoising method on twofold graphs, where graphs are learned simultaneously. Specifically, the graph learning subproblems are solved using the primal-dual splitting (PDS) algorithm, while the signal update has a closed-form solution. Parameters in this iterative algorithm are learned from training data by unrolling the iteration with deep algorithm unrolling. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing model- and deep learning-based graph signal denoising methods.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Aided Online FDD Precoding via Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Sensing: A Vertical Federated Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a heterogeneous multi-vehicle, multi-modal sensing (H-MVMM) aided online precoding problem. The proposed H-MVMM scheme utilizes a vertical federated learning (VFL) framework to minimize pilot sequence length and optimize the sum rate. This offers a promising solution for reducing latency in frequency division duplexing systems. To achieve this, three preprocessing modules are designed to transform raw sensory data into informative representations relevant to precoding. The approach effectively addresses local data heterogeneity arising from diverse on-board sensor configurations through a well-structured VFL training procedure. Additionally, a label-free online model updating strategy is introduced, enabling the H-MVMM scheme to adapt its weights flexibly. This strategy features a pseudo downlink channel state information label simulator (PCSI-Simulator), which is trained using a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach alongside an online loss function. Numerical results show that the proposed method can closely approximate the performance of traditional optimization techniques with perfect channel state information, achieving a significant 90.6\% reduction in pilot sequence length.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Enabled Extremely Large-Scale Antenna Systems: Transceiver Architecture, Physical Modeling, and Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) have emerged as a pivotal technology for addressing the unprecedented performance demands of next-generation wireless communication systems. To enhance their practicality, we propose metasurface-enabled extremely large-scale antenna (MELA) systems -- novel transceiver architectures that employ reconfigurable transmissive metasurfaces to facilitate efficient over-the-air RF-to-antenna coupling and phase control. This architecture eliminates the need for bulky switch matrices and costly phase-shifter networks typically required in conventional solutions. Physically grounded models are developed to characterize electromagnetic field propagation through individual transmissive unit cells, capturing the fundamental physics of wave transformation and transmission. Additionally, distance-dependent approximate models are introduced, exhibiting structural properties conducive to efficient parameter estimation and signal processing. Based on the channel model, a two stage channel estimation framework is proposed for the scenarios comprising users in the hybrid near- and far-fields. In the first stage, a dictionary-driven beamspace filtering technique enables rapid angular-domain scanning. In the refinement stage, the rotational symmetry of subarrays is exploited to design super-resolution estimators that jointly recover angular and range parameters. An analytical expression for the half-power beamwidth of MELA is derived, revealing its near-optimal spatial resolution relative to conventional ELAA architectures. Numerical experiments further validate the high-resolution of the proposed channel estimation algorithm and the fidelity of the electromagnetic model, positioning the MELA architecture as a highly competitive and forward-looking solution for practical ELAA deployment.</description>

      <title>An Analytical and Experimental Study of Distributed Uplink Beamforming in the Presence of Carrier Frequency Offsets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing distributed multi-user beamforming (D-MUBF) in time division duplex (TDD)-based multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems faces significant challenges. One of the most fundamental challenges is achieving accurate over-the-air (OTA) timing and frequency synchronization among distributed access points (APs), particularly due to residual frequency offsets caused by local oscillator (LO) drifts. Despite decades of research on synchronization for MU-MIMO, there are only a few experimental studies that evaluate D-MUBF techniques under imperfect frequency synchronization among distributed antennas. This paper presents an analytical and experimental assessment of D-MUBF methods in the presence of frequency synchronization errors. We provide closed-form expressions for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as a function of channel characteristics and statistical properties of carrier frequency offset (CFO) among AP antennas. In addition, through experimental evaluations conducted with the RENEW massive MIMO testbed, we collected comprehensive datasets across various experimental scenarios. These datasets comprise uplink pilot samples for channel and CFO estimation, in addition to uplink multi-user data intended for analyzing D-MUBF techniques. By examining these datasets, we assess the performance of D-MUBF in the presence of CFO and compare the analytical predictions with empirical measurements. Furthermore, we make the datasets publicly available and provide insights on utilizing them for future research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Sequential Spectral Clustering of Data Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of non-parametric clustering of data sequences, where each data sequence comprises independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples generated from an unknown distribution. The true clusters are the clusters obtained using the Spectral clustering algorithm (SPEC) on the pairwise distance between the true distributions corresponding to the data sequences. Since the true distributions are unknown, the objective is to estimate the clusters by observing the minimum number of samples from the data sequences, given a specified error probability. To solve this problem, we propose the Sequential Spectral clustering algorithm (SEQ-SPEC), and show that it stops in finite time almost surely and is exponentially consistent. We also propose a computationally more efficient algorithm called the Incremental Approximate Sequential Spectral clustering algorithm (IA-SEQ-SPEC). Through simulations, we show that both SEQ-SPEC and IA-SEQ-SPEC perform better than the fixed sample size SPEC, the Sequential $K$-Medoids clustering algorithm (SEQ-KMED), and the Sequential Single Linkage clustering algorithm (SEQ-SLINK). In addition, we propose memory-efficient versions, SEQ-SPEC-B and IA-SEQ-SPEC-B. Unlike other related sequential clustering algorithms, which require storing all past samples, these algorithms require storing only the most recent $B$ samples. Both the computationally efficient and memory-efficient versions of SEQ-SPEC perform comparably to SEQ-SPEC in simulations.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the Range Ambiguity Function in Near-field Sensing Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the range ambiguity function of near-field systems where bandwidth and near-field beamfocusing jointly determine the resolution. First, the general matched filter ambiguity function is derived and the near-field array factors of different antenna array geometries are introduced. Next, the near-field ambiguity function is approximated as a product of the range-dependent near-field array factor and the ambiguity function due to the utilized waveform and bandwidth. An approximation criterion based on the aperture-bandwidth product is formulated, and its accuracy is examined. Finally, the improvements to the ambiguity function offered by the near-field beamfocusing, as compared to the far-field case, are presented. The performance gains are evaluated in terms of resolution improvement offered by beamfocusing, peak-to-sidelobe and integrated-sidelobe level improvement for a few popular array geometries. The gains offered by the near-field regime are shown to be range-dependent and substantial only in close proximity to the array.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive MIMO is a cornerstone of next-generation wireless communication, offering significant gains in capacity, reliability, and energy efficiency. However, to meet emerging demands such as high-frequency operation, wide bandwidths, co-existence, integrated sensing, and resilience to dynamic interference, future systems must exhibit both scalability and spectral agility. These requirements place increasing pressure on the underlying processing hardware to be both efficient and reconfigurable. This paper proposes a custom-designed spatial array architecture that serves as a reconfigurable, general-purpose core optimized for a class of wireless kernels that commonly arise in diverse communications and sensing tasks. The proposed spatial array is evaluated against specialized cores for each kernel using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). Both the reconfigurable and specialized designs are synthesized in a 32 nm process to assess latency, throughput, area, and power in realistic processes. The results identify conditions under which general-purpose systolic architectures can approach the efficiency of specialized cores, thereby paving the way toward more scalable and agile systems.</description>

      <title>Clustering-Based User Selection in Federated Learning: Metadata Exploitation for 3GPP Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw user data, but conventional simulations often rely on unrealistic data partitioning and current user selection methods ignore data correlation among users. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a metadatadriven FL framework. We first introduce a novel data partition model based on a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), capturing both heterogeneity in data quantity and natural overlap among user datasets. Building on this model, we develop a clustering-based user selection strategy that leverages metadata, such as user location, to reduce data correlation and enhance label diversity across training rounds. Extensive experiments on FMNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the proposed framework improves model performance, stability, and convergence in non-IID scenarios, while maintaining comparable performance under IID settings. Furthermore, the method shows pronounced advantages when the number of selected users per round is small. These findings highlight the framework's potential for enhancing FL performance in realistic deployments and guiding future standardization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the radar detection of low observable targets with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Instead of using a multistatic radar network as counter-stealth strategy with its synchronization, costs, phase coherence, and energy consumption issues, we exploit a RIS to form a joint monostatic and bistatic configuration that can intercept the energy backscattered by the target along irrelevant directions different from the line-of-sight of the radar. Then, this energy is redirected towards the radar that capitalizes all the backscattered energy to detect the low observable target. To this end, five different detection architectures are devised that jointly process monostatic and bistatic echoes and exhibit the constant false alarm rate property at least with respect to the clutter power. To support the practical implementation, we also provide a guideline for the design of a RIS that satisfies the operating requirements of the considered application. The performance analysis is carried out in comparison with conventional detectors and shows that the proposed strategy leads to effective solutions to the detection of low observable targets.</description>

      <title>Dual-Domain Fusion for Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Labeled time-series data is often expensive and difficult to obtain, making it challenging to train accurate machine learning models for real-world applications such as anomaly detection or fault diagnosis. The scarcity of labeled samples limits model generalization and leaves valuable unlabeled data underutilized. We propose Dual-Domain Fusion (DDF), a new model-agnostic semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework applicable to any time-series signal. DDF performs dual-domain training by combining the one-dimensional time-domain signals with their two-dimensional time-frequency representations and fusing them to maximize learning performance. Its tri-model architecture consists of time-domain, time-frequency, and fusion components, enabling the model to exploit complementary information across domains during training. To support practical deployment, DDF maintains the same inference cost as standard time-domain models by discarding the time-frequency and fusion branches at test time. Experimental results on two public fault diagnosis datasets demonstrate substantial accuracy improvements of 8-46% over widely used SSL methods FixMatch, MixMatch, Mean Teacher, Adversarial Training, and Self-training. These results show that DDF provides an effective and generalizable strategy for semi-supervised time-series classification.</description>

      <title>ADMM-Based Training for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained momentum due to their high potential in time-series processing combined with minimal energy consumption. However, they still lack a dedicated and efficient training algorithm. The popular backpropagation with surrogate gradients, adapted from stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-derived algorithms, has several drawbacks when used as an optimizer for SNNs. Specifically, the approximation introduced by the use of surrogate gradients leads to numerical imprecision, poor tracking of SNN firing times at training time, and, in turn, poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel SNN training method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our ADMM-based training aims to solve the problem of the SNN step function's non-differentiability by taking an entirely new approach with respect to gradient backpropagation. For the first time, we formulate the SNN training problem as an ADMM-based iterative optimization, derive closed-form updates, and empirically show the optimizer's convergence, its great potential, and discuss future and promising research directions to improve the method to different layer types and deeper architectures.</description>

      <title>ALPCAHUS: Subspace Clustering for Heteroscedastic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data dimensionality reduction. Various methods have been proposed to extend PCA to the union of subspace (UoS) setting for clustering data that comes from multiple subspaces like K-Subspaces (KSS). However, some applications involve heterogeneous data that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This paper develops a heteroscedastic-based subspace clustering method, named ALPCAHUS, that can estimate the sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of the subspace bases associated with the low-rank structure of the data. This clustering algorithm builds on K-Subspaces (KSS) principles by extending the recently proposed heteroscedastic PCA method, named LR-ALPCAH, for clusters with heteroscedastic noise in the UoS setting. Simulations and real-data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data heteroscedasticity compared to existing clustering algorithms.

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Receivers for Multi-Band Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harnessing multi-level electron transitions, Rydberg Atomic REceivers (RAREs) can detect wireless signals across a wide range of frequency bands, from Megahertz to Terahertz. This capability enables multi-band wireless communications and sensing (CommunSense). Existing research on multi-band RAREs primarily focuses on experimental demonstrations, lacking a tractable model to mathematically characterize their mechanisms. This issue leaves the multi-band RARE as a black box and poses challenges in its practical applications. To fill in this gap, this paper investigates the underlying mechanism of multiband RAREs and explores their optimal performance. For the first time, an analytical transfer function with a closed-form expression for multi-band RAREs is derived by solving the quantum response of Rydberg atoms. It shows that a multiband RARE simultaneously serves as a multi-band atomic mixer for down-converting multi-band signals and a multi-band atomic amplifier that reflects its sensitivity to each band. Further analysis of the atomic amplifier unveils that the intrinsic gain at each frequency band can be decoupled into a global gain term and a Rabi attention term. The former determines the overall sensitivity of a RARE to all frequency bands of wireless signals. The latter influences the allocation of the overall sensitivity to each frequency band, representing a unique attention mechanism of multi-band RAREs. The optimal design of the global gain is provided to maximize the overall sensitivity of multi-band RAREs. Subsequently, the optimal Rabi attentions are also derived to maximize the practical multi-band CommunSense performance. An experiment platform is built to validate the effectiveness of the derived transfer function, and numerical results confirm the superiority of multi-band RAREs.</description>

      <title>High-Capacity and Low-PAPR BICM-OFDM Systems Using Non-Equiprobable and Non-Uniform Constellation Shaping With Clipping and Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address a design of high-capacity and low-peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems based on bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) utilizing non-equiprobable and non-uniform (NENU) constellations as well as clipping and filtering (CAF). The proposed constellations are generated using a truncated Gaussian distribution and the merging of constellation points, where the former creates a non-uniform constellation (NUC), and the latter adjusts the number of signal points for further improving the total bit-wise mutual information (BMI). Unlike other exhaustive search-based approaches, the proposed constellations are uniquely determined by only two parameters associated with NUC and cardinality. Due to this property of limited degrees of freedom, the complexity required for the numerical optimization process can be significantly low. We focus on the constellation design based on one dimension, i.e., pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), which facilitates the reduction of demapping complexity for the BICM receiver. The use of CAF at the transmitter can efficiently reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals; however, it introduces clipping noise that may degrade error rate performance, making the application of clipping noise cancellation (CNC) at the receiver essential. Therefore, we optimize the NENU constellations in the presence of CAF and CNC. Simulation results demonstrate that the combination of constellation shaping with CAF and CNC enables BICM-OFDM systems to simultaneously achieve low PAPR and high spectral efficiency over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) as well as frequency-selective fading channels. Furthermore, comparative studies confirm that the proposed system significantly outperforms the single-carrier counterpart (i.e., DFT-precoded BICM-OFDM) in terms of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance over fading channels.</description>

      <title>How Does Instrumental Music Help SingFake Detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although many models exist to detect singing voice deepfakes (SingFake), how these models operate, particularly with instrumental accompaniment, is unclear. We investigate how instrumental music affects SingFake detection from two perspectives. To investigate the behavioral effect, we test different backbones, unpaired instrumental tracks, and frequency subbands. To analyze the representational effect, we probe how fine-tuning alters encoders' speech and music capabilities. Our results show that instrumental accompaniment acts mainly as data augmentation rather than providing intrinsic cues (e.g., rhythm or harmony). Furthermore, fine-tuning increases reliance on shallow speaker features while reducing sensitivity to content, paralinguistic, and semantic information. These insights clarify how models exploit vocal versus instrumental cues and can inform the design of more interpretable and robust SingFake detection systems.</description>

      <title>Resting-State EEG Network Profiles Associated with Creative Engagement and Creative Self-Efficacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creativity is a core cognitive capacity underlying innovation and adaptive problem solving, yet how it is represented in the brain's intrinsic functional architecture is not fully understood. While resting-state fMRI studies have identified large-scale network correlates associated with differences in creativity, EEG provides the temporal resolution for examining oscillatory dynamics contributing to intrinsic network organization. We examined whether resting-state EEG connectivity patterns are associated with individual differences across multiple creativity-related measures. Thirty healthy young adults completed a multidimensional creativity battery comprising the Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA), the Divergent Association Task (DAT), the Matchstick Arithmetic Puzzles Task (MAPT) and a Self-rating (SR) of creative ability. Graph-theoretical analyses of alpha-band functional connectivity revealed two participant groups, each with distinct patterns of neural activity: Cluster 1 showed reduced global connectivity with relatively preserved left frontal connectivity and greater network modularity; Cluster 0 exhibited stronger overall connectivity strength, reduced modularity and higher local clustering. Notably, Cluster 1 reported higher self-rated creative ability and more frequent engagement in real-world creative activities. These findings suggest that resting-state EEG connectivity patterns are associated with variation in creative self-efficacy and creative engagement, highlighting characteristic patterns of alpha-band network organization observed at rest.</description>

      <title>Numerical Spectrum Linking: Identification of Governing PDE via Koopman-Chebyshev Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A numerical framework is proposed for identifying partial differential equations (PDEs) governing dynamical systems directly from their observation data using Chebyshev polynomial approximation. In contrast to data-driven approaches such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which approximate the Koopman operator without a clear connection to differential operators, the proposed method constructs finite-dimensional Koopman matrices by projecting the dynamics onto a Chebyshev basis, thereby capturing both differential and nonlinear terms. This establishes a numerical link between the Koopman and differential operators. Numerical experiments on benchmark dynamical systems confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the approach, underscoring its potential for interpretable operator learning. The framework also lays a foundation for future integration with symbolic regression, enabling the construction of explicit mathematical models directly from data.</description>

      <title>Blockage-Aware Multi-RIS WSR Maximization via Per-RIS Indexed Synchronization Sequences and Closed-Form Riemannian Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user MIMO systems are highly vulnerable to blockage, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have been proposed as a remedy. However, RIS links may themselves be blocked, while most prior works assume ideal RIS availability. We propose an end-to-end blockage-aware multi-RIS weighted sum-rate (WSR) optimization framework. The BS transmits short per-RIS indexed synchronization signals, enabling each user to identify blocked panels through a simple energy detection test. Based on the detected feasible sets, we jointly optimize the BS precoder and RIS phases via a Closed-form Riemannian Phase Alignment (CRPA) algorithm. CRPA provides unit-modulus-preserving closed-form updates, requiring no projection or line search, and ensures monotone ascent. Simulations validate reliable blockage detection and notable WSR and convergence gains over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Covering in Hamming and Grassmann Spaces: New Bounds and Reed--Solomon-Based Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study covering problems in Hamming and Grassmann spaces through a unified coding-theoretic and information-theoretic framework. Viewing covering as a form of quantization in general metric spaces, we introduce the notion of the average covering radius as a natural measure of average distortion, complementing the classical worst-case covering radius. By leveraging tools from one-shot rate-distortion theory, we derive explicit non-asymptotic random-coding bounds on the average covering radius in both spaces, which serve as fundamental performance benchmarks.
  On the construction side, we develop efficient puncturing-based covering algorithms for generalized Reed--Solomon (GRS) codes in the Hamming space and extend them to a new family of subspace codes, termed character-Reed--Solomon (CRS) codes, for Grassmannian quantization under the chordal distance. Our results reveal that, despite poor worst-case covering guarantees, these structured codes exhibit strong average covering performance. In particular, numerical results in the Hamming space demonstrate that RS-based constructions often outperform random codebooks in terms of average covering radius. In the one-dimensional Grassmann space, we numerically show that CRS codes over prime fields asymptotically achieve average covering radii within a constant factor of the random-coding bound in the high-rate regime. Together, these results provide new insights into the role of algebraic structure in covering problems and high-dimensional quantization.</description>

      <title>Efficient Channel Autoencoders for Wideband Communications leveraging Walsh-Hadamard interleaving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates how end-to-end (E2E) channel autoencoders (AEs) can achieve energy-efficient wideband communications by leveraging Walsh-Hadamard (WH) interleaved converters. WH interleaving enables high sampling rate analog-digital conversion with reduced power consumption using an analog WH transformation. We demonstrate that E2E-trained neural coded modulation can transparently adapt to the WH-transceiver hardware without requiring algorithmic redesign. Focusing on the short block length regime, we train WH-domain AEs and benchmark them against standard neural and conventional baselines, including 5G Polar codes. We quantify the system-level energy tradeoffs among baseband compute, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analog converter power. Our analysis shows that the proposed WH-AE system can approach conventional Polar code SNR performance within 0.14dB while consuming comparable or lower system power. Compared to the best neural baseline, WH-AE achieves, on average, 29% higher energy efficiency (in bit/J) for the same reliability. These findings establish WH-domain learning as a viable path to energy-efficient, high-throughput wideband communications by explicitly balancing compute complexity, SNR, and analog power consumption.</description>
