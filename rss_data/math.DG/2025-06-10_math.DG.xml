      <title>Scattering theory on Riemann surfaces I: Schiffer operators, cohomology, and index theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a compact Riemann surface $\mathscr{R}$ with a complex of non-intersecting Jordan curves, whose complement is a pair of Riemann surfaces with boundary, each of which may be possibly disconnected. We investigate conformally invariant integral operators of Schiffer, which act on $L^{2}$ anti-holomorphic one-forms on one of these surfaces with boundary and produce holomorphic one-forms on the disjoint union. These operators arise in potential theory, boundary value problems, approximation theory, and conformal field theory, and are closely related to a kind of Cauchy operator. We develop an extensive calculus for the Schiffer and Cauchy operators, including a number of adjoint identities for the Schiffer operators. In the case that the Jordan curves are quasicircles, we derive a Plemelj-Sokhotski jump formula for Dirichlet-bounded functions. We generalize a theorem of Napalkov and Yulmukhametov, which shows that a certain Schiffer operator is an isomorphism for quasicircles. Finally, we characterize the kernels and images, and derive index theorems for the Schiffer operators, which will in turn connect conformal invariants to topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory on Riemann surfaces II: The scattering matrix and generalized period mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a scattering theory for harmonic one-forms on Riemann surfaces, obtained from boundary value problems involving systems of curves and the jump problem. We obtain an explicit expression for the scattering matrix in terms of integral operators which we call Schiffer operators, and show that the matrix is unitary. We also obtain a general association of positive polarizing Lagrangian spaces to bordered Riemann surfaces, which unifies the classical polarizations for compact surfaces of algebraic geometry with the infinite-dimensional period map of the universal Teichm\"uller space.</description>

      <title>Stereographic Projections on Some Quadric Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an adaptation of the classical stereographic projection, originally formulated for the sphere, now considering the context of the ellipsoid and the elliptic paraboloid. We begin by constructing the stereographic projections for both quadric surfaces separately, analyzing the geometric particularities of each surface and the challenges arising from their variable curvatures and, in the case of the paraboloid, its non-compactness. In the final part of the work, we establish results concerning the eccentricities, curvatures, arc length, and areas of the ellipses formed by the intersection of the quadrics with horizontal sections and their corresponding projections onto the plane-xy.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Rigidity Using Colding's Monotonicity Formulas for Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{Colding}, Colding proved monotonicity formulas for the Green function on manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Inspired by the sharp estimates relating the pinching of monotone quantities to the splitting function in \cite{cjn}, in this paper we investigate quantitative control obtained from pinching of Colding's monotone functionals. From the Green functions with poles at $(k+1)$-many independent points, $k$-splitting functions are constructed with regularity quantitatively controlled by the pinching. Moreover, the pinching at these independent points controls the distance to the nearest cone of the form $\mathbb{R}^k \times C(X)$.</description>

      <title>Notes on the Invariance of Tautness Under Lie Sphere Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An embedding $\phi:V \rightarrow S^n$ of a compact, connected manifold $V$ into the unit sphere $S^n \subset {\bf R}^{n+1}$ is said to be taut, if every nondegenerate spherical distance function $d_p$, $p \in S^n$, is a perfect Morse function on $V$, i.e., it has the minimum number of critical points on $V$ required by the Morse inequalities. In these notes, we give an exposition of the proof of the invariance of tautness under Lie sphere transformations due to \'{A}lvarez Paiva. First we extend the definition of tautness of submanifolds of $S^n$ to the concept of Lie-tautness of Legendre submanifolds of the contact manifold $\Lambda^{2n-1}$ of projective lines on the Lie quadric $Q^{n+1}$. This definition has the property that if $\phi:V \rightarrow S^n$ is an embedding of a compact, connected manifold $V$, then $\phi(V)$ is a taut submanifold in $S^n$ if and only if the Legendre lift $\lambda$ of $\phi$ is Lie-taut. Furthermore, Lie-tautness is invariant under the action of Lie sphere transformations on Legendre submanifolds. As a consequence, we get that if $\phi:V \rightarrow S^n$ and $\psi:V \rightarrow S^n$ are two embeddings of a compact, connected manifold $V$ into $S^n$, such that their corresponding Legendre lifts are related by a Lie sphere transformation, then $\phi$ is a taut embedding if and only if $\psi$ is a taut embedding. Thus, in that sense, tautness is invariant under Lie sphere transformations. The key idea is to formulate tautness in terms of real-valued functions on $S^n$ whose level sets form a parabolic pencil of unoriented spheres in $S^n$, and then show that this is equivalent to the usual formulation of tautness in terms of spherical distance functions, whose level sets in $S^n$ form a pencil of unoriented concentric spheres.</description>

      <title>$\ast$-$\eta$-Ricci solitons on weak Kenmotsu $f$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent interest among geometers in $f$-structures of K. Yano is due to the study of topology and dynamics of contact foliations and generalized A. Weinstein conjectures. Weak metric $f$-structures, introduced by the author and R. Wolak as a generalization of Hermitian structure, as well as $f$-structure allow for a fresh perspective on the classical theory. An important case of such manifolds, which is locally a twisted product, is a weak $\beta f$-Kenmotsu manifold defined as a generalization of K. Kenmotsu's concept. In this paper, the concept of the $\ast$-Ricci tensor of S. Tashibana is adapted to weak metric $f$-manifolds, the interaction of $\ast$-$\eta$-Ricci soliton with the weak $\beta f$-Kenmotsu structure is studied and new characteristics of $\eta$-Einstein metrics are obtained.</description>

      <title>Finslerian lightconvex boundaries: applications to causal simplicity and the space of cone geodesics $\mathcal{N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our outcome is structured in the following sequence: (1) a general result for indefinite Finslerian manifolds with boundary $(M,L)$ showing the equivalence between local and infinitesimal (time, light or space) convexities for the boundary $\partial M$, (2) for any cone structure $(M,\mathcal{C})$ which is globally hyperbolic with timelike boundary, the equivalence among: (a) the boundary $\partial M$ is lightconvex, (b) the interior $\mathring{M}$ is causally simple and (c) the space of the cone (null) geodesics $\mathcal{N}$ of $(\mathring{M},\mathcal{C})$ is Hausdorff, (3) in this case, the manifold structure of $\mathcal{N}$ is obtained explicitly in terms of elements in $\partial M$ and a smooth Cauchy hypersurface $S$, (4) the known results and examples about Hausdorfness of $\mathcal{N}$ are revisited and extended, leading to the notion of {\em causally simple spacetime with $T_2$-lightspace} as a step in the causal ladder below global hyperbolicity.
  The results are significant for relativistic (Lorentz) spacetimes and the writing allows one either to be introduced in Finslerian technicalities or to skip them. In particular, asymptotically AdS spacetimes become examples where the $C^{1,1}$ conformal extensions at infinity yield totally lightgeodesic boundaries, and all the results above apply.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow in the kernel learning problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a sequel to our paper `On the kernel learning problem'. We identify a canonical choice of Riemannian gradient flow, to find the stationary points in the kernel learning problem. In the presence of Gaussian noise variables, this flow enjoys the remarkable property of having a continuous family of Lyapunov functionals, and the interpretation is the automatic reduction of noise.
  PS. We include an extensive discussion in the postcript explaining the comparison with the 2-layer neural networks. Readers looking for additional motivations are encouraged to read the postscript immediately following the introduction.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Normal Form Power Series for Infinite-Dimensional Lie Pseudo-Group Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of normal form power series for suitably nonsingular analytic submanifolds under a broad class of infinite-dimensional Lie pseudo-group actions. Our theorem is illustrated by a number of examples, and includes, as a particular case, Chern and Moser's celebrated convergence theorem for normal forms of real hypersurfaces. The construction of normal forms relies on the equivariant moving frame method, while the convergence proof is based on the realization that the normal form can be recovered as part of the solution to an initial value problem for an involutive system of differential equations, whose analyticity is guaranteed by the Cartan-K\"ahler Theorem.</description>

      <title>On the connectedness of the singular set of holomorphic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a codimension 1 singular holomorphic foliation on $\mathbb{P}^3$ and let $Z$ be the union of the 1-dimensional connected components of its singular set; Dominique Cerveau asked in 2013 whether $Z$ is necessarily connected. We prove that if a $k$-dimensional holomorphic foliation on a projective manifold whose determinant bundle of the normal sheaf is ample has a singular set $Z$ of dimension $k-1$, then $Z$ is connected. This can be regarded as providing an obstruction for the integrability of singular holomorphic distributions in the spirit of Bott's work.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Fefferman spaces over almost CR manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a one-parameter family of Lorentzian conformal structures on the canonical circle bundle of a partially integrable contact almost Cauchy-Riemann manifold. This builds on previous work by Leitner, who generalised Fefferman's construction associated to a CR manifold to the non-involutive case. We provide characterisations of these conformal structures and show that they admit distinguished pure spinor fields. We introduce exact 'perturbations' of such Fefferman spaces by a semi-basic one-form, which can be suitably interpreted as a tuple of weighted tensors on the almost CR manifold. The resulting perturbed conformal space is an instance of a so-called nearly Robinson manifold introduced recently by Fino, Leistner and the present author. We investigate the existence of metrics in these conformal classes which satisfy appropriate subsystems of the Einstein equations. These metrics are defined only off cross-sections of Fefferman's circle bundle, and are conveniently expressed in terms of almost Lorentzian densities, which include Gover's almost Einstein scales as a special case. In particular, in dimensions greater than four, almost Einstein scales always arise from so-called CR-Einstein structures, almost CR analogues of Einstein metrics. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a perturbed Fefferman space to be conformally flat on the zero set of an almost Einstein scale. We construct an explicit example of a CR-Einstein structure on a strictly almost CR five-manifold based on a strictly almost Kaehler-Einstein four-manifold due to Nurowski and Przanowski.</description>

Abstract: We explore three versions of the Laplacian coflow of $G_2$-structures on circle fibrations over Calabi--Yau 3-folds, interpreting their dimensional reductions to the K\"ahler geometry of the base. Precisely, we reduce Ans\"atze for the Laplacian coflow, modified or not by de Turck's trick, both on trivial products $CY^3\times S^1$ and on contact Calabi--Yau 7-manifolds, obtaining in each case a natural modification of the K\"ahler--Ricci flow.</description>

      <title>Adjusted Connections I: Differential Cocycles for Principal Groupoid Bundles with Connection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new perspective on principal bundles with connection as morphisms from the tangent bundle of the underlying manifold to a classifying dg-Lie groupoid. This groupoid can be identified with a lift of the inner homomorphisms groupoid arising in \v{S}evera's differentiation procedure of Lie quasi-groupoids. Our new perspective readily extends to principal groupoid bundles, but requires an adjustment, an additional datum familiar from higher gauge theory. We show that for Lie groupoids, the additional adjustment data amounts to a Cartan connection. The resulting adjusted connections naturally provide a global formulation of the kinematical data of curved Yang-Mills-Higgs theories as described by Kotov-Strobl (arXiv:1510.07654) and Fischer (arXiv:2104.02175).</description>

      <title>Rotation angles of a rotating disc -- A toy model exhibiting the geometric phase --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a simple kinematic model, which is a rotating disc on the edge of another fixed disc without slipping, and study the rotation angle of the rotating disc. The rotation angle consists of two parts, the dynamical phase $\Delta_d$ and the geometric phase $\Delta_g$. The former is a dynamical rotation of the disc itself, and the geometric motion of the disc characterizes the latter. In fact, $\Delta_g$ is regarded as the geometric phase appearing in several important contexts in physics. The clue to finding the explicit form of $\Delta_g$ is the Baumkuchen lemma, which we called. Due to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, in the case that the rotating disc comes back to the initial position, $\Delta_g$ is interpreted as the signed area of a two-sphere enclosed by the trajectory of the Gauss vector, which is a unit normal vector on the moving disc. We also comment on typical models sharing the common underlying structure, which include Foucault's pendulum, Dirac's monopole potentials, and Berry phase. Hence, our model is a very simple but distinguished one in the sense that it embodies the essential concepts in differential geometry and theoretical physics such as the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the geometric phase, and the fiber bundles.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Deformation of Geometry through Function C(v): Scalar Deformation Flow and the Geometric Classification of 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the scalar deformation function C(v), which captures how local geometric structures respond to motion at velocity v. This function exhibits smooth analytic behavior and defines a critical velocity vc beyond which the geometry compresses. Extending C(v) into a flow C(v, tau), we construct a scalar analogue of Ricci flow that governs the evolution of geometric configurations toward symmetric, stable states without singularities. The flow is derived from a variational energy functional and satisfies global existence and convergence properties. We show that this scalar evolution provides a pathway for topological classification of three-manifolds through conformal smoothing and energy minimization, offering a curvature-free geometric mechanism rooted in analytic deformation. The resulting framework combines techniques from differential geometry and dynamical systems and may serve as a minimal geometric model for structure formation in relativistic contexts.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial p-th Calabi flow for finite and infinite ideal circle patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of the combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flow for both finite and infinite ideal circle patterns. In the finite case, we establish a sharp criterion: the combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flow with $p&gt;1$ converges if and only if a constant curvature metric exists in the underlying geometric background. In the infinite setting, we prove the long-time existence of solutions to the combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flow for $p \geq 2$, representing a significant advance in the theory of curvature flows on infinite structures.</description>
