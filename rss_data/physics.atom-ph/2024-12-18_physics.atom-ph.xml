      <title>Laser-Induced Quenching of the Th-229 Nuclear Clock Isomer in Calcium Fluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 10-minute radiative lifetime of the first excited $^{229}$Th$^{4+}$ nuclear state in ionic crystals provides narrow spectroscopic linewidths, enabling the realization of a solid-state nuclear clock. Due to the 4+ noble gas configuration, electronic readout or state initialization schemes known from atomic clocks are inaccessible. This elongates the interrogation cycle, which will deteriorate the clock performance. To address this limitation we demonstrate laser-induced quenching (LIQ) as a method of depumping the $^{229}$Th isomer population in CaF$_2$. We provide experimental evidence for LIQ at different wavelengths (148 - 420 nm) and temperatures (100 - 350 K), achieving a threefold reduction in the isomer lifetime with 20 mW of laser power.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional imaging of electromagnetic fields via light sheet fluorescence imaging with Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12568v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to image electromagnetic fields holds key scientific and industrial applications, including electromagnetic compatibility, diagnostics of high-frequency devices, and experimental scientific work involving field interactions. Generally electric and magnetic field measurements require conductive elements which significantly distort the field. However, electromagnetic fields can be measured without altering the field via the shift they induce on Rydberg states of alkali atoms in atomic vapor, which are highly sensitive to electric fields. Previous field measurements using Rydberg atoms utilized electromagnetically induced transparency to read out the shift on the states induced by the fields, but did not provide spatial resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that electromagnetically induced transparency can be spatially resolved by imaging the fluorescence of the atoms. We demonstrate that this can be used to image $\sim$ V/cm scale electric fields in the DC-GHz range and $\sim$ mT scale static magnetic fields, with minimal distortion to the fields. We also demonstrate the ability to image $\sim$ 5 mV/cm scale fields for resonant microwave radiation and measure standing waves generated by the partial reflection of the vapor cell walls in this regime. With additional processing techniques like lock-in detection, we predict that our sensitivities could reach down to nV/cm levels. We perform this field imaging with a spatial resolution of 160 $\mu$m, limited by our imaging system, and estimate the fundamental resolution limitation to be 5 $\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Coherent enhancement of collection of light from linear ion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient detection of light from trapped ions in free space is paramount for most of their applications. We propose a scheme to enhance the photon collection from linear ion strings. It employs the constructive interference of light scattered from ions along the axial direction in linear Paul traps. The coherent enhancement of photon collection is numerically optimized for a range of feasible spatial angles and realistic ion positions in a single harmonic Coulomb potential. Despite the large mutual distance of scatterers on the order of many wavelengths of scattered light, presented experimental tests confirm the feasibility of enhancements by a factor of $3.05 \pm 0.09$ with a crystal of nine $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions. Further significant improvements using different ion species, which allow for suppression of the sensitivity to the residual thermal motion, are predicted. The proposed collection geometry is intrinsic to diverse linear ion trap designs and the methodology can be directly applied to an observation of scattering from ion crystals prepared in collective electronic excitations.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast high-fidelity state readout of single neutral atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability to measure the state of a quantum system is vital to a practical quantum network, for applications including distributed quantum computing and long-distance quantum communication. As a thriving platform for quantum information technology, single neutral atoms suffer from low achievable photon scattering rate and shallow trapping potential, which limits the fidelity and speed of state readout process. Here, by coupling an single neutral atom with a high-finesse fiber-based Fabry-P\'erot microcavity (FFPC) in Purcell regime, we realize strong enhancement of the atomic photoemission rate, which enables ultrafast and high-fidelity discrimination of bright and dark hyperfine states of the atom. The readout fidelity can reach 99.1(2)% within 200 ns and 99.985(8)% within 9 $\mu$s. Furthermore, we demonstrate that state preparation via optical pumping can be efficiently accelerated by real-time decision protocol based on ultrafast state readout. This work paves the way to the implementation of quantum networking protocols with high communication rate and high fidelity.</description>

      <title>Regimes of Steady-State Turbulence in a Quantum Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to model the development of turbulence in a quantum fluid confined by a cuboid box potential, and forced by shaking along one axis. We observe the development of isotropic turbulence from anisotropic forcing for a broad range of forcing amplitudes, and characterise the states through their Fourier spectra, vortex distributions, and spatial correlations. For weak forcing the steady-state wave-action spectrum exhibits a $k^{-3.5}$ scaling over wavenumber $k$; further decomposition uncovers the same power law in both compressible kinetic energy and quantum pressure, while the bulk superfluid remains phase coherent and free from extended vortices. As the forcing energy exceeds the chemical potential, extended vortices develop in the bulk, disrupting the $k^{-3.5}$ scaling. The spectrum then transitions to a $k^{-7/3}$ regime for compressible kinetic energy only, associated with dense vortex turbulence, and phase coherence limited to the healing length. The strong forcing regime is consistent with an inverse cascade of compressible energy driven by small-scale vortex annihilation.</description>

      <title>Spatial averaging for light reflection and transmission through cold atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically and computationally investigate the role that the spatial spread of atoms plays in the transmission and reflection of weak light from atom arrays. In particular, we investigate whether coherent wave functions for the atoms' positions leads to different results from a thermal distribution with the same spatial spread. We find that the coherence is not relevant when the light is weak and the electronic states evolve on time scales shorter than the oscillation period of the atoms in their traps. Full numerical calculations and derivations using the sudden approximation show that reflection and transmission agree with the simple averaging over atom positions for these conditions. For parameters outside these restrictions, the simple spatial averaging may lead to inaccurate results.</description>

      <title>Atoms in Dense Plasmas: Models, Applications, and Current Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling plasmas in terms of atoms or ions is theoretically appealing for several reasons. When it is relevant, the notion of atom or ion in a plasma provides us with an interpretation scheme of the plasma's microscopic structure. From the standpoint of quantitative estimation of plasma properties, atomic models of plasma allow extending many theoretical tools of atomic physics to plasmas. This notably includes the statistical approaches to the detailed accounting for excited states, or the collisional-radiative modeling of non-equilibrium plasmas, which is based on the notion of atomic processes.
  This habilitation thesis is mostly focused on the studies to which the author has contributed in the field of atomic modeling of dense, non-ideal plasmas. The studies to which the author contributed in the field of collisional-radiative modeling of non-LTE plasmas are also addressed, and the prospect of bridging with dense-plasma models is sketched.</description>
