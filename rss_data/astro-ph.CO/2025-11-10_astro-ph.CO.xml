      <title>Combining CMB datasets with consistent foreground modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a joint cosmological analysis combining data from the Planck satellite, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope, constructing a unified likelihood that reproduces the measured temperature and polarisation power spectra by jointly modelling the cosmic microwave background (CMB) signal, galactic and extragalactic foregrounds, and instrumental systematics across all datasets. This approach reduces reliance on external priors and improves the robustness of parameter estimation. Within this joint analysis, $\Lambda$CDM parameters exhibit remarkable stability with respect to variations in foreground modelling. Extended cosmological parameters are more sensitive to these assumptions, with uncertainties increasing by up to 35%. Despite this, the combined constraints show no significant deviation from $\Lambda$CDM expectations, and several previously reported tensions -- such as the preference for non-zero curvature or the excess of lensing amplitude A_L -- are significantly reduced or resolved. In contrast, the determination of foreground parameters more severely depends on the assumptions made about the underlying models. Overall, this work demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of a fully joint analysis of current CMB experiments, and emphasizes the importance of consistent and accurate foreground modelling for the scientific goals of next-generation, high-sensitivity CMB surveys.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Structure Probes of the Post-Inflationary Axiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmology of axions in the post-inflationary scenario, where random initial conditions and the ensuing string-domain-wall network generate an isocurvature power spectrum. Axions radiated from strings behave as warm, wave-like dark matter: when they constitute the full dark matter abundance, free streaming sets the strongest bounds on their mass. For subdominant fractions, despite being warm, they still lead to an overall enhancement of structure growth in the dominant component, seeded by the axion white-noise fluctuations. We search for this effect using the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies at $z=4$-$10$, probing $k\simeq0.5$-$10\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Combining the UVLF analysis with Lyman-$\alpha$ and CMB data yields the leading cosmological limits on post-inflationary axion dark matter, sensitive to tiny fractions for $m_a\lesssim10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}$. As a byproduct, we obtain new constraints on generic white-noise power spectra from the UVLF. These results apply broadly to scenarios that generate similar isocurvature perturbations, linking early-universe field dynamics to high-redshift structure formation.</description>

      <title>Dents in the Mirror: A Novel Probe of Dark Matter Substructure in Galaxy Clusters from the Astrometric Asymmetry of Lensed Arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometric perturbations of lensed arcs behind galaxy clusters have been recently suggested as promising probes of small-scale ($\lesssim10^9 M_{\odot}$) dark matter substructure. Populations of cold dark matter (CDM) subhalos, predicted in hierarchical structure formation theory, can break the symmetry of arcs near the critical curve, leading to positional shifts in the observed images. We present a novel statistical method to constrain the average subhalo mass fraction ($f_{\rm sub}$) in clusters that takes advantage of this induced positional asymmetry. Focusing on CDM, we extend a recent semi-analytic model of subhalo tidal evolution to accurately simulate realistic subhalos within a cluster-scale host. We simulate the asymmetry of lensed arcs from these subhalo populations using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Using mock data, we demonstrate that our method can reliably recover the simulated $f_{\rm sub}$ to within 68\% CI in 73\% of cases, regardless of the lens model, astrometric precision, and image morphology. We show that the constraining power of our method is optimized for larger samples of well observed arcs, ideal for recent JWST observations of cluster lenses. As a preliminary test, we apply our method to the MACSJ0416 Warhol arc and AS1063 System 1. For Warhol we constrain the upper limit on $\log f_{\rm sub} &lt; -3.40^{+1.06}_{-0.97}$, while for AS1063 System 1 we constrain $\log f_{\rm sub} = -2.36^{+0.56}_{-0.89}$ (both at 68\% CI), consistent with CDM predictions. We elaborate on our method's limitations and its future potential to place stringent constraints on dark matter properties in cluster environments.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Analysis of kSZ Maps to Predict CMB Optical Depth $\tau$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, which results from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons scattering off moving electrons, offer a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The kSZ signal contains key information about the timing, duration, and spatial structure of the EoR. A precise measurement of the CMB optical depth $\tau$, a key parameter that characterizes the universe's integrated electron density, would significantly constrain models of early structure formation. However, the weak kSZ signal is difficult to extract from CMB observations due to significant contamination from astrophysical foregrounds. We present a machine learning approach to extract $\tau$ from simulated kSZ maps. We train advanced machine learning models, including swin transformers, on high-resolution seminumeric simulations of the kSZ signal. To robustly quantify prediction uncertainties of $\tau$, we employ the Laplace Approximation (LA). This approach provides an efficient and principled Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution over the model's weights, allowing for reliable error estimation. We investigate and compare two distinct application modes: a post-hoc LA applied to a pre-trained model, and an online LA where model weights and hyperparameters are optimized jointly by maximizing the marginal likelihood. This approach provides a framework for robustly constraining $\tau$ and its associated uncertainty, which can enhance the analysis of upcoming CMB surveys like the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>How Low Can You Go: Constraining the Effects of Catalog Incompleteness on Dark Siren Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) serve as standard sirens by directly encoding the luminosity distance to their source. When the host galaxy redshift is known, for example, through observation of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart, GW detections can provide an independent measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0$. However, even in the absence of an EM counterpart, inferring $H_0$ is possible through the dark siren method. In this approach, every galaxy in the GW localization volume is considered a potential host that contributes to a measurement of $H_0$, with redshift information supplied by galaxy catalogs. Using mock galaxy catalogs, we explore the effect of catalog incompleteness on dark siren measurements of $H_0$. We find that in the case of well-localized GW events, if GW hosts are found in all galaxies with host halo masses $M_h &gt; 2 \times10^{11} M_{\odot}h^{-1}$, catalogs only need to be complete down to the 1% brightest magnitude $M_i &lt; -22.43$ to draw an unbiased, informative posterior on H0. We demonstrate that this is a direct result of the clustering of fainter galaxies around brighter and more massive galaxies. For a mock galaxy catalog without clustering, or for GW localization volumes that are too large, using only the brightest galaxies results in a biased $H_0$ posterior. These results are important for informing future dark siren analyses with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA as well as next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Sym-EFT: Accelerating Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure with Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an emulator suite for the one- and two-loop cold dark matter power spectrum from the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS). Specifically, we emulate separately the various contributions to the one- and two-loop parts of the power spectrum, leaving out the possible counterterms which can be added as multiplicative prefactors. By leaving the time-dependence of the counterterms unspecified at the emulation stage, our technique has the advantage of being extremely versatile in fitting any type of counterterm parametrisation to data, or to simulations, without having to change the emulator. We construct our emulators using the method of symbolic regression which results in functions that can be used directly in computer code, while achieving errors of better than $0.5\%$ within the $k$-range of validity of EFT and maintaining ultra-fast computational evaluation of less than $\sim5\times10^{-4}s$ on a single core.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The papers included in this Focus Point collection are devoted to the studies on the cosmological tensions and challenges stimulated by the latest observational data. The first results of the LARES-2 laser ranging satellite on the high precision testing of the frame-dragging effect predicted by General Relativity are presented. The data on the S-stars monitoring in the Galactic center obtained by GRAVITY collaboration were analysed within the Physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach. The results enabled to probe the role of the cosmological constant, of the dark matter, the star cluster in the core of the Galaxy obtaining an upper limit for the star density. The topics include the conversion of high-frequency relic gravitational waves into photons in cosmological magnetic field, cosmological gravitational waves stochastic background generation through the spontaneous breaking of a global baryon number symmetry, observational predictions of the Starobinsky inflation model and other studies.</description>

      <title>Reviving Quadratic Inflation: Minimal Deformation for CMB Compatibility and Reheating Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the quadratic inflationary potential by introducing a minimal higher-order correction obtained through a simple field redefinition, leading to the potential V(chi) = (1/2) m^2 * (chi - (gamma/14) * chi^7)^2.
  While the uncorrected quadratic model predicts n_s approximately 0.967 and r approximately 0.13, in strong tension with CMB data, the corrected potential yields n_s approximately 0.965 and r approximately 0.036, fully consistent with Planck 2018 constraints.
  Beyond inflationary observables, the deformation also impacts the reheating phase. In the quadratic case, reheating corresponds to a matter-like regime with w_reh = 0, whereas the corrected potential gives w_reh approximately -0.011, a slightly softer equation of state. This modification raises the reheating temperature by a factor of about 3.4 (for N_reh = 10), or equivalently extends the reheating duration at fixed temperature.
  Our results demonstrate that even a minimal higher-order correction is sufficient to reconcile the quadratic model with observations while providing a more consistent post-inflationary history, highlighting the relevance of controlled deformations of simple inflationary scenarios.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Galaxy Stochasticity and the Noise-Field Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the stochastic, or noise, contributions to the galaxy density field within the effective field theory (EFT) of large-scale structure. Starting from the general, all-order expression of the EFT partition function, we elucidate how the stochastic contributions can be described by local nonlinear couplings of a single Gaussian noise field. We introduce an alternative formulation of the partition function in terms of such a noise field, and derive the corresponding field-level likelihood for biased tracers. This noise-field formulation can capture the complete set of stochastic contributions to the galaxy density at the field level in a normalized, positive-definite probability density which is suitable for numerical sampling. We illustrate this by presenting the first results of EFT-based field-level inference with non-Gaussian and density-dependent stochasticity on dark matter halos using LEFTfield.</description>

      <title>Dark Secrets of Baryons: Illuminating Dark Matter-Baryon Interactions with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered numerous bright galaxies at high redshifts ($z\approx$ 10 -- 14). Many astrophysical models and beyond the Standard Model physics scenarios have been proposed to explain these observations. We investigate, for the first time, the implications of dark matter (DM) scattering with baryons (protons and electrons) in light of the JWST UV luminosity function (UVLF) observations. These interactions suppress structure formation on galactic scales, which may have an observable effect on the UVLF measurements at high redshifts. Using a recent galaxy formation model designed to explain high-redshift observations, we obtain strong upper limits on DM-baryon scattering cross-sections and explore new regions of the parameter space. For DM-proton scattering with cross-section $\propto v^{-2}$ velocity dependence, we obtain the strongest limit for DM masses of $\sim$ 1 -- 500 MeV. For other cases that we study (DM-proton scattering cross-section $\propto v^{0},\,v^{-4}$, and DM-electron scattering cross-section $\propto v^{0},\,v^{-2},\,v^{-4}$), our limits are competitive with those obtained from other cosmological observables. Our study highlights the potential of JWST observations as a novel and powerful probe of non-gravitational interactions of DM.</description>

      <title>Fast and Flexible Neutrino Decoupling Part I: The Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological determinations of the number of relativistic neutrino species, $N^{ }_{\rm eff}$, are becoming increasingly accurate, and further improvements are expected both from CMB and BBN data. Given this context, we update the evaluation of $N^{ }_{\rm eff}$ and the current entropy density via the momentum-averaged approach. This allows for a numerically fast description of neutrino decoupling, easily portable to an array of new physics scenarios. We revisit all aspects of this approach, including collision terms with full electron mass dependence, finite temperature QED corrections to the equation of state, neutrino oscillations, and the modelling of neutrino ensembles with effective chemical potentials. For integrated observables, our results differ by less than $0.04\%$ from the solution of the momentum-dependent evolution equation. We outline how to extend the approach to BSM settings, and will highlight its power in Part II. To facilitate the practical implementation, we release a Mathematica and Python code within nudec_BSM_v2, easily linkable to BBN codes.</description>

      <title>Synthetic JWST galaxy images in the TNG50 simulation - I. Model validation and comparison to observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the TNG50 cosmological simulation and three-dimensional radiative transfer post-processing to generate dust-aware synthetic observations of galaxies at $ 3 \leq z \leq 6 $ and $ \log_{10}(M_\ast/\mathrm{M}_\odot) \geq 8.5 $, tailored to match the depth and resolution of current deep JWST surveys (NGDEEP and JADES). We analyse the performance of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting on the simulated sample, focusing on the recovery of photometric redshift and stellar mass. At $ z \leq 5 $, we find that 90 per cent of redshifts are recovered within $ \pm0.2 $, but performance declines at $ z = 6 $. Stellar masses are generally well-recovered within a factor of 2, but are systematically underestimated regardless of redshift, a trend that is more pronounced at the high-mass end $ ( \log_{10}(M_\ast/\mathrm{M}_\odot) \geq 10 ) $. In addition, we study the observer-frame colours of galaxies in this redshift range as well as the SED-inferred $UVJ$ diagram. We find that TNG50 galaxies broadly follow the tendencies marked by observations, but tend to be slightly redder at lower masses and bluer at higher masses, regardless of redshift. Finally, using a colour-based definition of quiescence, we determine the fraction of quiescent galaxies as a function of stellar mass at $ 3 \leq z \leq 6 $, which we find to be broadly consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Blind Strong Gravitational Lensing Inversion: Joint Inference of Source and Lens Mass with Score-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based models can serve as expressive, data-driven priors for scientific inverse problems. In strong gravitational lensing, they enable posterior inference of a background galaxy from its distorted, multiply-imaged observation. Previous work, however, assumes that the lens mass distribution (and thus the forward operator) is known. We relax this assumption by jointly inferring the source and a parametric lens-mass profile, using a sampler based on GibbsDDRM but operating in continuous time. The resulting reconstructions yield residuals consistent with the observational noise, and the marginal posteriors of the lens parameters recover true values without systematic bias. To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of joint source-and-lens inference with a score-based prior.</description>

      <title>Novel Solar System Probes for Primordial Black Holes</title>

Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) represent one of the more interesting ways to address dark matter, at the interface of both cosmology and quantum gravity. It is no surprise then that testing PBHs is a venue of active interest, with several cosmological and astrophysical probes constraining different mass ranges. In this work, we propose novel Solar System scale searches for PBHs, motivated by the unique precision and coverage of local observables. We show that asteroid to dwarf planet mass PBHs can induce measurable dipolar timing signatures in pulsar timing arrays, while planetary mass PBHs can generate detectable ADAF accretion flares through interactions with Kuiper Belt bodies. Together, these complementary approaches open a new observational frontier for probing PBHs across mass ranges that remain unconstrained by conventional cosmological methods.</description>

      <title>Low-reheating scenario in dark Higgs inflation and its impact on dark photon dark matter production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dark matter (DM) phenomenology and cosmic inflation within a unified framework based on a dark $U(1)_D$ gauge extension of the Standard Model (SM). The associated dark gauge boson, namely the dark photon, serves as a viable DM candidate, which we call dark photon dark matter (DPDM), whilst the dark Higgs field drives inflation. We explore a low-reheating scenario where DM production occurs during reheating, resulting in significant entropy dilution of the DPDM abundance. Both weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) and feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP) DM scenarios are explored, depending on the dark gauge coupling strength. For FIMP-type DM, the entropy dilution allows for stronger couplings whilst maintaining the correct relic abundance, potentially bringing these candidates within the reach of current and near-future detection experiments. Similarly, WIMP-type DM can be realised with weaker couplings. We perform a comprehensive parameter scan incorporating constraints from collider data, DM direct and indirect detection experiments, and cosmological observations. Taking quantum corrections and running of the couplings into account, we demonstrate that dark Higgs inflation yields predictions for the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ that are consistent with the Planck, BICEP/Keck, and ACT data. The nonminimal coupling of the dark Higgs inflaton field to gravity is shown to be much smaller than in the case of the SM Higgs inflation scenario, avoiding unitarity concerns. We show that reheating temperatures as low as 1 GeV and 1 MeV can be achieved through the decay and scattering processes of the inflaton, respectively, with the latter allowing for larger Higgs mixing angles and enhanced detection prospects. Our results establish that this minimal extension successfully unifies DM physics with inflationary cosmology.</description>

      <title>Exact Renormalisation Group Evolution of the Inflation Dynamics: Reconciling $\alpha$-Attractors with ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative framework for the dynamics of slow-roll inflation that consistently incorporates quantum corrections, based on an alternative functional renormalisation group (RG) approach. We derive the coupled Friedmann-RG flow equations governing the joint evolution of spacetime, the inflaton field, and its effective potential. Applying this formalism to $\alpha$-attractor E-models, we find that the RG flow induces a dynamical destabilisation of the inflationary trajectory, leading to a premature termination of slow roll. Remarkably, the resulting predictions bring $\alpha$-attractors into full agreement with the latest ACT data without introducing new physics beyond a consistent quantum-corrected treatment of the inflaton dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity, de Sitter Space, and Normalizability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a resolution to the longstanding problem of perturbative normalizability in canonical quantum gravity of the Lorentzian Chern-Simons-Kodama (CSK) state with a positive cosmological constant in four dimensions. While the CSK state is an exact solution to the Hamiltonian constraint in the self-dual formulation and semiclassically describes de Sitter spacetime, its physical viability has been questioned due to apparent nonnormalizability and CPT asymmetry. Starting from a nonperturbative holomorphic inner product derived from the reality conditions of the self-dual Ashtekar variables, we show that the linearization, in terms of gravitons, of the CSK state is perturbatively normalizable for super-Planckian cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a rotation in phase space, a generalization of Thiemann's complexifier, can render the full perturbative state normalizable for all $\Lambda$ by analytically continuing the non-convergent modes in phase space. This provides the first concrete realization of a CPT-breaking, yet normalizable, gravitational vacuum state rooted in a nonperturbative quantum gravity framework. Our results establish the CSK state-long thought formal-as a viable candidate for the ground state of quantum gravity in de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{unimpeded}$: A Public Nested Sampling Database for Bayesian Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference is central to modern cosmology. While parameter estimation is achievable with unnormalised posteriors traditionally obtained via MCMC methods, comprehensive model comparison and tension quantification require Bayesian evidences and normalised posteriors, which remain computationally prohibitive for many researchers. To address this, we present $\texttt{unimpeded}$, a publicly available Python library and data repository providing DiRAC-funded (DP192 and 264) pre-computed nested sampling and MCMC chains with their normalised posterior samples, computed using $\texttt{Cobaya}$ and the Boltzmann solver $\texttt{CAMB}$. $\texttt{unimpeded}$ delivers systematic analysis across a grid of eight cosmological models (including $\Lambda$CDM and seven extensions) and 39 modern cosmological datasets (comprising individual probes and their pairwise combinations). The built-in tension statistics calculator enables rapid computation of six tension quantification metrics. All chains are hosted on Zenodo with permanent access via the unimpeded API, analogous to the renowned Planck Legacy Archive but utilising nested sampling in addition to traditional MCMC methods.</description>

      <title>One Galaxy Sample to Rule Them All: Halo Occupation Distribution Modeling of DES Year 3 Source Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the joint analysis of second-order weak lensing and galaxy clustering statistics, so-called $3{\times}2$ analyses, the selection and characterization of optimal galaxy samples is a major area of research. One promising choice is to use the same galaxy sample as lenses and sources, which reduces the systematics parameter space that describes uncertainties related to galaxy samples. Such a ``lens-equal-source'' analysis significantly improves self-calibration of photo-z systematics leading to improved cosmological constraints. With the aim to enable a lens-equal-source analysis on small scales we investigate the halo-galaxy connection of DES-Y3 source galaxies. We develop a technique to construct mock source galaxy populations by matching COSMOS/UltraVISTA photometry onto {\sc{UniverseMachine}} galaxies. These mocks predict a source halo occupation distribution (HOD) that exhibits significant redshift evolution, non-trivial central incompleteness and galaxy assembly bias. We produce multiple realizations of mock source galaxies drawn from the {\sc{UniverseMachine}} posterior with added uncertainties in measured DES photometry and galaxy shapes. We fit a modified HOD formalism to these realizations to produce priors on the galaxy-halo connection for cosmological analyses. We additionally train an emulator that predicts this HOD to $\sim2\%$ accuracy from redshift $z = 0.1 - 1.3$ that models the dependence of this HOD on 1) observational uncertainties in galaxy size and photometry, and 2) uncertainties in the {\sc{UniverseMachine}} predictions.</description>

      <title>Spectral Imaging with QUBIC: building astrophysical components from Time-Ordered-Data using Bolometric Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of B-modes in the CMB polarization pattern is a major issue in modern cosmology and must therefore be handled with analytical methods that produce reliable results. We describe a method that uses the frequency dependency of the QUBIC synthesized beam to perform component separation at the map-making stage, to obtain more precise results. We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of component separation during the map-making stage in time domain space. This new technique leads to a more accurate description of the data and reduces the biases in cosmological analysis. The method uses a library for highly parallel computation which facilitates the programming and permits the description of experiments as easily manipulated operators. These operators can be combined to obtain a joint analysis using several experiments leading to maximized precision. The results show that the method works well and permits end-to-end analysis for the CMB experiments, and in particular, for QUBIC. The method includes astrophysical foregrounds, and also systematic effects like gain variation in the detectors. We developed a software pipeline that produces uncertainties on tensor-to-scalar ratio at the level of $\sigma(r) \sim 0.023$ using only QUBIC simulated data.</description>

Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry can lead to the formation of domain walls in the early Universe. In this work, we explore the impact of bias directions on the dynamics of $Z_N$ domain walls, mainly focusing on the $N = 3$ model with a biased potential. Utilizing the Press-Ryden-Spergel method, we numerically investigate the dynamics of domain walls with lattice simulations. We find notable differences in the dynamics of domain walls due to bias directions. Our results indicate that the annihilation time depends not only on the vacuum energy difference $\delta V$ but also on bias directions described by the relative potential difference $ \zeta $.</description>

      <title>Updated cosmological constraints on axion dark energy with DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on the parameters of an axion dark energy model, for which we took into account the properties of its characteristic potential and its full cosmological evolution. We show that the values of the axion parameters appear sufficiently constrained by the data, including the latest DESI DR1, and are consistent with the theoretical expectations of a field mass $m_a$ in the ultralight regime $\log (m_a c^2/~\mathrm{eV}) \simeq -32.60~\pm~0.12$, and an effective energy scale $f_a$ close to the reduced Planck energy $\log (f_a/~ M_\mathrm{Pl}) \simeq -0.28~\pm~0.19$. Our results also support the idea of dynamical dark energy, although Bayesian evidence still favors the phenomenological dark energy model $w_0w_a$ over the axion dark energy, with the Bayes factor indicating moderate and weak strength of the evidence, respectively, when the models are compared to the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. However, the results suggest that axion dark energy remains a well-motivated model and its parameters may be better constrained if the upcoming DESI data show further evidence for dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear evolution of cosmological perturbations in theories with scale-dependent perturbation growth, first in general and then focusing on Horndeski gravity. Within the framework of standard perturbation theory, we derive the second- and third-order kernels and show that they are fully determined by two effective functions, \( h_1 \) and \( h_c \), which parametrize deviations from general relativity. Using the Wronskian method, we obtain solutions for the nonlinear growth functions and present explicit expressions for the resulting kernels, including bias and redshift space distortions, valid in the limit in which the $k$-dependent part is subdominant. We show that the kernels are entirely dependent on the linear growing mode: once this is calculated, the kernels are analytic up to a time integral. We also include redshift-space distortions (RSD) and scale-dependent bias. Our approach provides a physically motivated framework for evaluating the one-loop galaxy power spectrum in scale-dependent theories, suitable for the forecasts and actual data analysis.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-Free Galaxy Bias in Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a renormalization-free framework for modeling galaxy bias based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ULPT). In this approach, the biased density fluctuation is built solely from Galileon-type operators associated with the intrinsic nonlinear growth of dark matter. This ensures the bias expansion is well defined at the field level, automatically satisfies statistical conditions of vanishing ensemble and volume averages, and removes the need for ad hoc renormalization. We derive analytic one-loop expressions for the galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter power spectra and implement an efficient numerical algorithm using \texttt{FFTLog} and \texttt{FAST-PT}, enabling rapid and accurate evaluation. The model requires only a minimal set of bias parameters: three parameters are sufficient to describe correlation functions in configuration space, while four parameters are needed for power spectra in Fourier space. To test accuracy, we jointly fit halo auto- and cross-spectra from the \textit{Dark Emulator}, covering nine redshift-mass combinations with 100 cosmologies each. A single set of bias parameters reproduces both spectra within $\sim1\%$ up to $k \simeq 0.3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for typical linear bias $b_1 \sim 0.8$-2, and to $k \simeq 0.2\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $b_1 \sim 3$. The same parameters also match two-point correlation functions down to $r \simeq 15\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. Moreover, ULPT predicts the relation $b_{K^2}^{\mathrm{E}} = -\tfrac{3}{4} b_2^{\mathrm{E}}$, validated against $N$-body results. These results demonstrate that ULPT provides a physically consistent and efficient model for nonlinear galaxy bias, with applications to redshift-space distortions, bispectra, and reconstruction. The numerical implementation is released as the open-source Python package https://github.com/naonori/ulptkit.</description>

      <title>The Hubble Tension resolved by the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological observations. However, severe challenges to the phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM model have emerged recently, including the Hubble constant tension and the significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration. Despite many explanations for the two challenges have been proposed, the origins of them are still intriguing mysteries. Here, we investigate the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) measurements to interpret the Hubble constant tension. Employing a non-parametric method, we find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift from DESI BAO data and type Ia supernovae. From the Friedmann equations, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) is derived from $w(z)$ model-independently. We find that the values of $H_0$ show a descending trend as a function of redshift, and can effectively resolve the Hubble constant tension. Our study finds that the two unexpected challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM model can be understood in one physical framework, e.g., dynamical dark energy.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we spectroscopically select narrow-line AGNs (NLAGNs) among the ~300 publicly available medium-resolution spectra of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS). Using both traditional and newly identified emission line NLAGN diagnostics diagrams, we identified 52 NLAGNs at 2&lt;z&lt;9, on which we performed a detailed multiwavelength analysis. We also identified four new z&lt;2 broad-line AGNs (BLAGNs), in addition to the eight previously reported z&gt;4.5 BLAGNs. We found that most of the high-z NLAGN were selected using the recently proposed AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [Oiii] $\lambda$4363 auroral line or high-ionization emission lines. We compared the emission line velocity dispersion and the obscuration levels of the sample of NLAGNs with those of the parent sample without finding significant differences between the two distributions, suggesting a population of AGNs heavily buried and not significantly impacting the host galaxies physical properties, as was further confirmed by spectral energy distribution fitting. The bolometric luminosities of the high-z NLAGNs selected in this work are ~1.5dex below the ones sampled by surveys before JWST, potentially explaining the weak impact of these AGNs. Finally, we investigated the X-ray properties of the selected NLAGNs and of the sample of high-z BLAGNs. We found that all but four NLAGNs are undetected in the deep X-ray image of the field, as well as all the high-z BLAGNs. We did not obtain a detection even by stacking the undetected sources, resulting in an X-ray weakness of ~1-2 dex from what was expected based on their bolometric luminosities. To discriminate between a heavily obscured AGN scenario or an intrinsic X-ray weakness of these sources, we performed a radio (1.4GHz) stacking analysis, which did not reveal any detection and left open the questions about the origin of the X-ray weakness.</description>

      <title>The radio properties of the JWST-discovered AGN</title>

Abstract: We explore the radio emission of JWST-selected Broad Line AGN (BLAGN, or type 1) in the GOODS-N field. We use deep radio data at different frequencies (144\,MHz, 1.5\,GHz, 3\,GHz, 5.5\,GHz, 10\,GHz), and we find that none of the {37} sources investigated is detected at any of the aforementioned frequencies. Similarly, the radio stacking analysis does not reveal any detection down to an rms of ${\sim 0.15}\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, corresponding to a $3\sigma$ upper limit at rest frame 5 GHz of $L_{5GHz}=2\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the mean redshift of the sample $z\sim 5.1$. We compared this and individual sources upper limits with expected radio luminosities estimated assuming different AGN scaling relations, {to check whether these are consistent with the standard BLAGN spectral energy distribution}. For most of the sources the radio luminosity upper limits are still compatible with expectations for radio-quiet (RQ) AGN; nevertheless, the more stringent stacking upper limits and the fact that no detection is found {might suggest} that JWST-selected BLAGN are weaker than standard AGN even at radio frequencies. Indeed, the probability of having none of the BLAGN detected in none of the investigated radio images is expected to be on average very low ($P&lt;10^{-4}$). We discuss some scenarios that could explain the possible radio weakness, such as free-free absorption from a dense medium, or the lack of either magnetic field or a corona, possibly as a consequence of super-Eddington accretion. These scenarios would also explain the observed X-ray weakness. We also conclude that $\sim$1 dex more sensitive radio observations are needed to better constrain the level of radio emission (or lack thereof) for the bulk of these sources. The Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will likely play a crucial role in assessing the properties of this AGN population.</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington accretion in high-redshift quasar hosts: Black-hole driven outflows, galaxy quenching, and the nature of little red dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revolutionised our understanding of the high-redshift Universe through its detection of bright, massive galaxies up to $z\gtrsim 10$ and its identification of peculiar sources called `little red dots' (LRDs). The origin of both classes of objects remains uncertain but is likely linked to the formation and early growth of the first massive black holes (MBHs), which may be more easily explained by invoking phases of super-Eddington accretion. In this study, we used a state-of-the-art zoom-in cosmological simulation of a quasar host to investigate whether these objects could resemble any of the peculiar sources observed with JWST during their assembly. We find that the impact of MBH feedback on star formation is typically moderate, with outflows preferentially escaping perpendicular to the galactic disc. However, for approximately ten percent of the galaxy's lifetime, the system enters a distinct quenched phase following rapid MBH growth driven by super-Eddington accretion. This phase culminates in a powerful feedback event, during which the MBH jet and disc-driven winds interact directly with the galactic disc and carve out a central cavity. We also find that, during the history of the quasar host progenitor, the spectral properties of the system can resemble both LRDs and quenched galaxies, depending on the specific evolutionary stage considered. These findings suggest that both conditions may represent transient phases in the life cycle of high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Effects of the ekpyrotic mechanism on inflationary phase in loop quantum cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In bouncing cosmological models, either classical or quantum, the big bang singularity is replaced by a regular bounce. A challenging question in such models is how to keep the shear under control in the contracting phase, as it is well-known that the shear grows as fast as $1/a^{6}$ toward the bounce, where $a$ is the average expansion factor of the universe. A common approach is to introduce a scalar field with an ekpyrotic-like potential which becomes negative near the bounce, so the effective equation of state of the scalar field will be greater than one, whereby it dominates the shear in the bounce region. As a result, a homogeneous and isotropic universe can be produced after the bounce. In this paper, we study how the ekpyrotic mechanism affects the inflationary phase in both loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I), because in these frameworks inflation is generic without such a mechanism. After numerically studying various cases in which the potential of the inflaton consists of two parts, an inflationary potential and an ekpyrotic-like one, we find that, despite the fact that the influence is significant, by properly choosing the free parameters involved in the models, the ekpyrotic-like potential dominates in the bounce region, during which the effective equation of state is larger than one, so the shear problem is resolved. As the time continuously increases after the bounce, the inflationary potential grows and ultimately becomes dominant, resulting in an inflationary phase. This phase can last long enough to solve the cosmological problems existing in the big bang model.</description>

      <title>The importance of being non-minimally coupled: scalar Hawking radiation from regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In curved space-time, a scalar field $\phi$ is generically expected to couple to curvature, via a coupling of the form $\xi\phi^2R$. Yet in the study of Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We revisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four representative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case $\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation. We compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter can be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A crucial role is played by the sign of the term $\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in Schwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal coupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the D'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\xi$, the low-energy emission spectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\xi fR&lt;0$ throughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the transmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the case where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the non-minimal coupling on their evaporation history.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from the sound shell model: direct and inverse phase transitions in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological phase transitions are a frequent phenomenon in particle physics models beyond the Standard Model, and the corresponding gravitational wave signal offers a key probe of new physics in the early Universe. Depending on the underlying microphysics, the transition can exhibit either direct or inverse hydrodynamics, leading to a different phenomenology. Most studies to date have focused on direct transitions, where the cosmic fluid is pushed or dragged by the expanding vacuum bubbles. In contrast, inverse phase transitions are characterized by fluid profiles where the plasma is sucked in by the expanding bubbles. Using the sound shell model, we derive and compare the gravitational wave spectra from sound waves for direct and inverse phase transitions, providing new insights into the potential observable features and the possibility of discriminating among the various fluid solutions in gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Cosmological and High Energy Physics implications from gravitational-wave background searches in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's O1-O4a runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for gravitational-wave background signals produced by various early Universe processes in the Advanced LIGO O4a dataset, combined with the data from the earlier O1, O2, and O3 (LIGO-Virgo) runs. The absence of detectable signals enables powerful constraints on fundamental physics. We derive gravitational-wave background energy density upper limits from the O1-O4a data to constrain parameters associated with various possible processes in the early Universe: first-order phase transitions, cosmic strings, domain walls, stiff equation of state, axion inflation, second-order scalar perturbations, primordial black hole binaries, and parity violation. In our analyses, the presence of an astrophysical background produced by compact (black hole and neutron star) binary coalescences throughout the Universe is also considered. We address the implications for various cosmological and high energy physics models based on the obtained parameter constraints. We conclude that LIGO-Virgo data already yield significant constraints on numerous early Universe scenarios.</description>

      <title>Geometric acceleration in $f(Q,C)$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $f(Q,C)$ framework of gravity enables the depiction of an effective dark energy fluid that emerges from geometry itself, thus leading to modifications in the cosmological phenomenology of General Relativity. We pursue this approach to discover new and observationally supported (effective) evolving dark energy models. We propose a general $f(Q,C)$ formulation that cannot be simply split into separate functions of $Q$ and $C$, yet it still results in second-order field equations. By employing a particular type of connection, we derive guidelines for new cosmological models, including a variant of the DGP model that appears to be statistically favored over $\Lambda$CDM. Notably, we also demonstrate how to translate solutions within this $f(Q,C)$ framework to $f(Q)$ counterparts at the background level.</description>

      <title>Conserved Quantities in Expanding G\"odel Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At linear order we study perturbations to a G\"odel background spacetime which includes expansion in addition to rotation. We investigate the transformation behaviour of these perturbations under gauge transformations and construct gauge invariant quantities. Using the perturbed energy conservation equation we find that there are conserved quantities in Expanding G\"odel (EG) Cosmology, in particular a spatial metric trace perturbation, {\zeta} SMTP , which is conserved on large scales for pressureless dust. We intend to extend our discussion to a perfect fluid matter content with a view to also obtaining conserved quantities in this context.</description>

      <title>Observational tests of the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider detailed cosmological tests of dark energy models obtained from the general conformal transformation of the Kropina metric, representing an $(\alpha,\beta)$-type Finslerian geometry. In particular, we restrict our analysis to the osculating Barthel Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric function is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\alpha$ and of the one-form $\beta$. In this framework, we also consider the role of the conformal transformations of the metric, which allows us to introduce a family of conformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models obtained in this way are described by second-order field equations, in the presence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The generalized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the Riemannian metric $\alpha$ the Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker representation. In order to close the cosmological field equations, we assume a specific relationship between the component of the one-form $\beta$ and the conformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is determined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free parameter $\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel Kropina cosmological models are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of $\gamma$. A comparison with the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM model is also performed. {Our results indicate that the conformal osculating Barthel Kropina model can be considered as a successful, and simple, alternative to standard cosmological models.</description>
