      <title>Lower Bounds for Bit Pigeonhole Principles in Bounded-Depth Resolution over Parities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove lower bounds for proofs of the bit pigeonhole principle (BPHP) and its generalizations in bounded-depth resolution over parities (Res$(\oplus)$). For weak BPHP$_n^m$ with $m = cn$ pigeons (for any constant $c&gt;1$) and $n$ holes, for all $\epsilon&gt;0$, we prove that any depth $N^{1.5 - \epsilon}$ proof in Res$(\oplus)$ must have exponential size, where $N = cn\log n$ is the number of variables.
  Inspired by recent work in TFNP on multicollision-finding, we consider a generalization of the bit pigeonhole principle, denoted $t$-BPHP$_n^m$, asserting that there is a map from $[m]$ to $[n]$ ($m &gt; (t-1)n$) such that each $i \in [n]$ has fewer than $t$ preimages. We prove that any depth $N^{2-1/t-\epsilon}$ proof in Res$(\oplus)$ of $t$-BPHP$_n^{ctn}$ (for any constant $c \geq 1$) must have exponential size.
  For the usual bit pigeonhole principle, we show that any depth $N^{2-\epsilon}$ Res$(\oplus)$ proof of BPHP$_n^{n+1}$ must have exponential size. As a byproduct of our proof, we obtain that any randomized parity decision tree for the collision-finding problem with $n+1$ pigeons and $n$ holes must have depth $\Omega(n)$, which matches the upper bound coming from a deterministic decision tree.
  We also prove a lifting theorem for bounded-depth Res$(\oplus)$ with a constant size gadget which lifts from $(p, q)$-DT-hardness, recently defined by Bhattacharya and Chattopadhyay. By combining our lifting theorem with the $(\Omega(n), \Omega(n))$-DT-hardness of the $n$-variate Tseitin contradiction over a suitable expander, proved by Bhattacharya and Chattopadhyay, we obtain an $N$-variate constant-width unsatisfiable CNF formula with $O(N)$ clauses for which any depth $N^{2-\epsilon}$ Res$(\oplus)$ proof requires size $\exp(\Omega(N^\epsilon))$. Previously no superpolynomial lower bounds were known for Res$(\oplus)$ proofs when the depth is superlinear in the size of the formula.</description>

      <title>Enumeration With Nice Roman Domination Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Extension Perfect Roman Domination is NP-complete, all minimal (with respect to the pointwise order) perfect Roman dominating functions can be enumerated with polynomial delay. This algorithm uses a bijection between minimal perfect Roman dominating functions and Roman dominating functions and the fact that all minimal Roman dominating functions can be enumerated with polynomial delay. This bijection considers the set of vertices with value 2 under the functions. In this paper, we will generalize this idea by defining so called nice Roman Domination properties for which we can employ this method. With this idea, we can show that all minimal maximal Roman Dominating functions can be enumerated with polynomial delay in O(1.9332^n) time. Furthermore, we prove that enumerating all minimal connected/total Roman dominating functions on cobipartite graphs can be achieved with polynomial delay. Additionally, we show the existence of a polynomial-delay algorithm for enumerating all minimal connected Roman dominating function on interval graphs. We show some downsides to this method as well.</description>
