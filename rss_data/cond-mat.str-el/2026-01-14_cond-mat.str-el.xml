      <title>Geometric Spin Rotation in Triangular Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a geometric phenomenon in which a traveling wave made of degenerate Goldstone modes leaves behind a transformed ground state. In a triangular Heisenberg antiferromagnet, a pulse of circularly polarized spin waves rotates the spins within their plane. An exact solution of the nonlinear equations of motion demonstrates that the accumulated rotation is a geometric phase related to parallel transport of the order parameter. We point out a curious analogy between the motion of the magnetic order parameter and that of a wobbling coin. This phenomenon opens a new route for controlling antiferromagnetic order by spin waves and may extend to other frustrated magnets as well as other physical systems with noncommuting broken-symmetry generators.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary boundary correlations at deconfined quantum critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing appreciation for the effects of quantum critical fluctuations on gapless boundary degrees of freedom. Here we consider the boundary dynamics of the non-compact $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ (NCCP$^{N-1}$) model in two spatial dimensions, with $N$ complex boson species coupled to a fluctuating $\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge field. These models describe quantum phase transitions beyond the Landau paradigm, such as the deconfined quantum critical point between superconducting (SC) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) phases. We show that, in a large-$N$ limit and with the bulk tuned to criticality, boundaries of the NCCP$^{N-1}$ model display logarithmically decaying, or ``extraordinary-log,'' correlations. In particular, when monopole operators exhibit quasi-long-ranged order at the boundary, we find that the extraordinary-log exponent of the NCCP$^{N-1}$ model in the large-$N$ limit is $q=N/4$, signifying a new family of boundary universality classes parameterized by $N$. In the context of the QSH -- SC transition, the quantum critical point inherits helical edge modes from the QSH phase, and this extraordinary-log behavior manifests in their Cooper pair correlations.</description>

      <title>Large room temperature anomalous Nernst effect coupled with topological Nernst effect from incommensurate spin structure in a Kagome antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome magnets exhibit a range of novel and nontrivial topological properties due to the strong interplay between topology and magnetism, which also extends to their thermoelectric applications. Recent advances in the study of magnetic topological materials have highlighted their intriguing anomalous Hall and thermoelectric effects, arising primarily from large intrinsic Berry curvature. Here, we report observation of a large room-temperature (RT) anomalous Nernst effects (ANE) of S_xy^A ~ 1.3 {\mu}V K^(-1) in the kagome antiferromagnet (AFM) ErMn6Sn6, which is comparable to the largest signals observed in known magnetic materials. Surprisingly, we further found that a significant topological Nernst signal at RT and peaking a maximum of approximately 0.2 {\mu}V K^(-1) at 180 K, exactly coupling with ANE in the spiral AFM state, originates from the real-space nonzero spin chirality caused by incommensurate spin structure. This study demonstrates a potential room-temperature thermoelectric application platform based on Nernst effect, and provides insights for discovering significant anomalous and topological transverse transport effects in the incommensurate AFM system.</description>

      <title>Collinear Magnetic Structure in the Diamond Network Magnet EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic structure of EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$, in which magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions form a diamond network, was investigated using neutron and resonant X-ray diffraction on powder and single-crystal samples. The propagation vector was determined to be $\textbf{\textit{q}}_{\rm m}=(1,0,0)$~r.l.u. from these diffraction measurements. All possible magnetic structures in the space group $Fd\bar{3}m$ with this propagation vector were examined using the irreducible representation method and magnetic space group analysis. This magnetic structure was identified as a collinear antiferromagnetic structure with the magnetic space group $P_Inna$ (\#52.320) or $P_Inn2$ (\#34.164) under zero magnetic field. In these magnetic structure, frustration arises from competing magnetic interactions on the diamond network. These findings provide a concrete experimental reference for assessing the role of competing interactions in diamond-network magnets and motivate further studies of interaction-driven quantum states.</description>

      <title>Linear Canonical-Ensemble Quantum Monte Carlo: From Dilute Fermi Gas to Flat-Band Ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite-temperature canonical-ensemble determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that enforces an exact fermion number and enables stable simulations of correlated lattice electrons. We propose a stabilized QR update that reduces the computational complexity from standard cubic scaling $O(\beta N^3)$ to linear scaling $O(\beta N N_e^2)$ with respect to the system size $N$, where $N_e$ is the particle number. This yields a dramatic speedup in dilute regimes ($N_e \ll N$), opening unbiased access to large-scale simulations of strongly correlated low-density phases. We validate the method on the dilute electron gas with onsite Hubbard interactions, observing the suppression of the fermion sign problem in the dilute limit. Furthermore, we apply this approach to an one-dimensional flat-band system, where the canonical ensemble allows for precise control over filling. We reveal a ferromagnetic instability at low temperatures in the half-filling regime. Our linear-scaling approach provides a powerful tool for investigating emergent phenomena in dilute quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states in 2+1d: non-invertible symmetries, interfaces, and parameterized families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct 2+1-dimensional lattice models of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with non-invertible symmetries and investigate their properties using tensor networks. These models, which we refer to as generalized cluster models, are constructed by gauging a subgroup symmetry $H \subset G$ in models with a finite group 0-form symmetry $G$. By construction, these models have a non-invertible symmetry described by the group-theoretical fusion 2-category $\mathcal{C}(G; H)$. After identifying the tensor network representations of the symmetry operators, we study the symmetry acting on the interface between two generalized cluster states. In particular, we will see that the symmetry at the interface is described by a multifusion category known as the strip 2-algebra. By studying possible interface modes allowed by this symmetry, we show that the interface between generalized cluster states in different SPT phases must be degenerate. This result generalizes the ordinary bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we construct parameterized families of generalized cluster states and study the topological charge pumping phenomena, known as the generalized Thouless pump. We exemplify our construction with several concrete cases, and compare them with known phases, such as SPT phases with $2\mathrm{Rep}((\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]})\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[0]})$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Parameterized families of 2+1d $G$-cluster states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a $G$-cluster Hamiltonian in 2+1 dimensions and analyze its properties. This model exhibits a $G\times2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, where the $2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ sector realizes a non-invertible symmetry obtained by condensing appropriate algebra objects in $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$. Using the symmetry interpolation method, we construct $S^1$- and $S^2$-parameterized families of short-range-entangled (SRE) states by interpolating an either invertible $0$-form or $1$-form symmetry contained in $G\times2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$. Applying an adiabatic evolution argument to this family, we analyze the pumped interface mode generated by this adiabatic process. We then explicitly construct the symmetry operator acting on the interface and show that the interface mode carries a nontrivial charge under this symmetry, thereby demonstrating the nontriviality of the parameterized family.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Ordered Spin Moments in Antiferromagnets of S = 5/2 Ions (Fe3+, Mn2+) Driven by Local Magnetic Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For antiferromagnets composed of spin five-half ions, the moments of these ions in the ordered antiferromagnetic state can be significantly smaller than 5 BM (i.e., 1.56 - 4.48 BM) if these ions form quantum fluctuating entities (QFEs), for example, quasi one-dimensional uniform antiferromagnetic chains or quasi zero-spin antiferromagnetic spin dimers. It is reasonable to suppose that the stronger the quantum fluctuation in such an antiferromagnet, the greater the reduction in its ordered moment would become, but this supposition has not yet been confirmed because quantifying the strength of quantum fluctuation is not a straightforward matter. Here we show that the local magnetic excitations involving the QFEs can be used to quantify the strength of quantum fluctuation by analyzing six antiferromagnets showing significant reduction in their ordered spin moments.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric torque in polar magnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-efficient fast switching of spin orientations or textures is a core issue of spintronics, which is highly demanded but remains challenging. Different from the mainstream routes based on spin-transfer torque or spin-orbit torque, here we propose another mechanism coined as magnetoelectric torque to switch the magnetization in polar magnetic bilayers via pure electric field. In some magnetic van der Waals bilayers, when the electrostatic energy of polarization can compensate the interlayer magnetic coupling, a magnetoelectric torque is generated to fastly flip spins within a few picoseconds, which is demonstrated by combining the first-principles calculations, analytic model, as well as atomistic simulations. Such a magnetoelectric torque doesn't rely on the spin-orbit coupling and is generally active in polar magnetic homostructures and heterostructures. Our work provides an alternative route to switch magnetization in nanoscale, which may benefit the energy-saving and fast-response spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Dissipative ground-state preparation of a quantum spin chain on a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a dissipative protocol for ground-state preparation of a quantum spin chain on a trapped-ion quantum computer. As a first step, we derive a Kraus representation of a dissipation channel for the protocol recently proposed by Ding et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 033147 (2024)] that still holds for arbitrary temporal discretization steps, extending the analysis beyond the Lindblad dynamics regime. The protocol guarantees that the fidelity with the ground state monotonically increases (or remains unchanged) under repeated applications of the channel to an arbitrary initial state, provided that the ground state is the unique steady state of the dissipation channel. Using this framework, we implement dissipative ground-state preparation of a transverse-field Ising chain for up to 19 spins on the trapped-ion quantum computer Reimei provided by Quantinuum. Despite the presence of hardware noise, the dynamics consistently converges to a low-energy state far away from the maximally mixed state even when the corresponding quantum circuits contain as many as 4110 entangling gates, demonstrating the intrinsic robustness of the protocol. By applying zero-noise extrapolation, the resulting energy expectation values are systematically improved to agree with noiseless simulations within statistical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Nodal Superconductivity of UTe$_2$ Probed by Field-Angle-Resolved Specific Heat on a Crystal with $T_{\rm c}=2.1$ K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field-angle-resolved specific-heat measurements were performed on a clean single crystal of a spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}=2.1$ K and a low residual electronic specific heat. At low temperatures, the specific heat exhibits a linear dependence on the magnetic field when the field is applied precisely along the $b$ axis, in stark contrast to its rapid increase at low fields for other orientations. This pronounced anisotropy suggests the presence of nodal quasiparticle excitations with the Fermi velocity predominantly aligned along the $b$ axis. Considering the characteristic field-angle dependences of both the specific heat and the upper critical field, these observations are broadly compatible with theoretical models that assume a superconducting gap structure featuring either point nodes consistent with $B_{\rm 2u}$ symmetry, allowed in the infinitely strong spin-orbit coupling scheme, or line nodes confined to flat regions of the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface, consistent with $^3B_{\rm 3u}$ symmetry in the finite spin-orbit classification scheme. These results yield crucial hints for resolving the pairing symmetry of UTe$_2$, paving the way for a deeper understanding of its spin-triplet superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Universal Transport Theory for Paired Fractional Quantum Hall States in the Quantum Point Contact Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states can be viewed as topological superconductors of composite fermions, supporting a charged chiral mode and $|\mathcal{C}_{cf}|$ neutral Majorana modes set by the Chern number $\mathcal{C}_{cf}$. Despite ongoing efforts, distinguishing the many competing paired phases remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a unified theory of charge transport across a quantum point contact (QPC) for general paired FQH states described by an $so(N)_1 \times u(1)$ conformal field theory. We derive the boundary effective action for an arbitrary number of Majorana fermions $N=|\mathcal{C}_{cf}|$ and develop a non-perturbative instanton approximation to describe tunneling processes. We establish a weak-strong duality relating strong quasiparticle tunneling to weak electron tunneling. We calculate the scaling dimensions of the tunneling operators and demonstrate that while the weak-coupling fixed point is generally unstable, the strong-coupling fixed point is stable for physically relevant filling fractions and number of Majorana fermions. These transport exponents provide a distinct experimental fingerprint to identify the topological phases of even-denominator FQH states.</description>

Abstract: We study Coulomb correlation effects and their role in superconductivity of $\varepsilon$-iron under pressure from 12 to 33 GPa by using a combination of density functional and dynamical mean-field theory. Our results indicate a persistence of the Fermi-liquid behavior below the temperature $\sim$1000 K. The Coulomb correlations are found to substantially renormalize the density of states, reducing the distance from the peak to the Fermi level to 0.4 eV compared to 0.75 eV obtained in DFT calculations. We find significant antiferromagnetic correlations, which are accompanied by the formation of short-lived local magnetic moments. We use the obtained results as a starting point for construction of the multi-band Bethe-Salpeter equation, which eigenvalues indicate that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations may result in the superconducting pairing in $\varepsilon$-Fe. Moreover, the tendency to superconducting instability becomes weaker with the increase of pressure, which may explain the disappearance of superconductivity at $\sim$30 GPa.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose--Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose--Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. The chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion becomes the nonabelian Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. We argue that a chiral (pseudo-)spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of this Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ground state of a Jeff = 1/2 based frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet</title>

Abstract: The subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom, crystal electric fields, and spin correlations can lead to exotic quantum states in 4f ion-based frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnets. We present the crystal structure, thermodynamic and muon spin relaxation ({\mu}SR) studies of the 4f ion-based frustrated magnet Ba4YbReWO12, wherein Yb3+ ions constitute a triangular lattice. The magnetic susceptibility does not show any signature of spin freezing down to 1.9 K or long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.4 K. The low-temperature Curie-Weiss fit to the inverse magnetic susceptibility data reveals a weak antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, which is corroborated by the fit of magnetic specific heat data following the J1-J2 model with the nearest neighbor exchange interaction of J1 = -0.197 K between the Jeff = 1/2 states of the Yb3+ moments in the lowest Kramers doublet. The lowest Kramers ground state doublet is well separated from the first excited state with a gap of 278 K, as evidenced by our {\mu}SR experiments that support the realization of Jeff = 1/2 at low temperatures. The specific heat experiments do not detect a phase transition down to 56 mK. The magnetic specific heat shows a broad maximum 90 mK suggesting a disordered ground state with short range spin correlations. The associated magnetic entropy release at low temperatures is consistent with that expected for the Jeff = 1/2 state. The zero-field {\mu}SR measurements show neither the signature of spin freezing nor a phase transition, at least down to 43 mK. Our results suggest a dynamic, disordered ground state in this Jeff = 1/2 frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet. Ba4RReWO12 (R=rare earth) offers a viable platform to realize intriguing quantum states borne out of spin-orbit coupling and frustration</description>

      <title>Role of Ward-Takahashi identity in an electron-phonon coupled system -- Revisiting phonon shift current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study bulk photovoltaic effects in electron-phonon coupled systems. The conservation of current or gauge invariance, manifested as the Ward-Takahashi identity, plays an essential role in the analysis of the Feynman diagrams, and the leading order contribution to the phonon shift current is identified accordingly. The leading order contribution essentially arises from the electric polarization carried by optically excited phonons, where the shift current is generated due to a change of electric polarization in the steady state under the optical excitation of phonons.</description>

      <title>Ground-state phase diagram of S = 1/2 Heisenberg model on 2D square-hexagon-octagon lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo and density matrix renormalization group methods, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the two-dimensional square-hexagon-octagon (SHO) lattice. The model incorporates nearest-neighbor interactions $J_1$ (intrahexagon interaction) and $J_2$ (interhexagon), as well as a selected third-neighbor interaction $J_3$ along the $x$ direction. We identify five distinct phases in the parameter regime $0&lt;\lambda_1=J_2/J_1&lt;4, 0&lt;\lambda_2=J_3/J_1&lt;4$: a N\'eel antiferromagentic phase, two dimer phases (orthogonal and ladder staggered dimers), a hexagon singlet phase, and notably a Haldane-like symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. The topological nature of the Haldane-like phase is confirmed by the degeneracy of the ground-state energy under open boundary conditions and the twofold degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum. Phase boundaries are accurately determined using finite-size scaling of the spin stiffness and Binder cumulant. Data collapse analysis reveals that all transitions from nonmagnetic phases to the antiferromagnetic phase belong to the three-dimensional $O(3)$ Heisenberg universality class. In addition, we investigate the robustness of the SPT phase to other interactions, such as those that could arise in experimental materials. Our work establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding magnetic and topological phases on the SHO lattice.</description>

      <title>Infinite-component $BF$ field theory: Nexus of fracton order, Toeplitz braiding, and non-Hermitian amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the infinite-component Chern-Simons theory of three-dimensional fracton phases by Ma et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, 195124 (2022)] and the Toeplitz braiding of anyons by Li et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we show that stacking $(3+1)$D $BF$ topological field theories along a fourth spatial direction gives rise to an exotic class of four-dimensional fracton phases. Their low-energy physics is governed by a new field-theoretic framework -- infinite-component $BF$ (i$BF$) theories -- characterized by asymmetric integer Toeplitz $K$ matrices. Under open boundary conditions, i$BF$ theories exhibit a striking phenomenon: \textit{Toeplitz particle-loop braiding}, where a particle and a loop placed on opposite three-dimensional boundaries acquire a finite braiding phase even at infinite separation. This nonlocal braiding admits a geometric interpretation: transporting the particle induces a winding boundary trajectory on the opposite boundary that encircles the loop. We show that this robustness originates from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of Toeplitz $K$ matrices revealed by singular value decomposition (SVD), rather than from the eigenvalue zero modes responsible for previously known Toeplitz braiding of anyons. We analytically and numerically study representative i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger--type $K$ matrices, establishing a universal correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz particle-loop braiding. Our results identify boundary zero singular modes as the mechanism behind Toeplitz particle-loop braiding and establish infinite-component $BF$ theory as a predictive framework for higher-dimensional fracton topological orders.</description>

      <title>Disorder Suppression of Charge Density Wave in the Honeycomb Holstein Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of charge-density-wave order in Dirac fermion systems via electron-phonon coupling represents a significant topic in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon within the Holstein model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific focus on the effect of disorder. While the interplay between electron-electron interactions and disorder has long been a central theme in the field, recent attention has increasingly turned to the combined influence of disorder and electron-phonon coupling. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \(\beta_c\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, we observed a suppression of electron kinetic energy and dc conductivity under disorder, highlighting the role of Anderson localization in the degradation of electronic transport. These findings offer significant theoretical insight into the stability and critical phenomena of correlated phases in disordered two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Optical Detection and Manipulation of Pseudospin Orders in Wigner Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Wigner-crystal states of two-dimensional electrons, the spin ordering remains poorly understood. The small energy differences between candidate spin orders make theoretical studies less reliable, and probing magnetic order at a nonzero wave vector is experimentally challenging. In modern realizations of Wigner crystals, the electronic spin degree of freedom is often replaced by a valley pseudospin associated with nonzero Berry curvature. The resulting anomalous velocity couples the electrons' pseudospin texture to their orbital vibration. We show that this mechanism enables optical detection of pseudospin orders in Wigner crystals by producing sharp signatures in the terahertz optical conductivity. For example, antiferromagnetic pseudospin order enables light to excite collective electronic vibrations at the ordering wave vector, generating a characteristic absorption peak. Based on the same principle, we further show that a strong optical drive generates an effective potential that reshapes the pseudospin energy landscape, inducing phase transitions to stripe antiferromagnetic states. These results point to a route for optical detection and control of spin order via its coupling to orbital motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P.~W.~Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:
  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and
  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)).
  These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</description>

      <title>Classical periodic trajectories and quantum scars in many-spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00258v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum hard-rods model and obtain compact analytical expressions for density form factors, and a semi-analytical treatment for dynamic and static structure factors calculations, greatly reducing computational complexity. We identify conditions under which these form factors vanish and analyze real-space correlations, confirming the model's Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior. The results reveal universal features of low energy physics of a gapless quantum fluid and its relation to Luttinger liquid theory, providing precise benchmarks for numerical simulations. This work establishes quantum hard rods as an important testbed for theories of strongly correlated one-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Classifying fusion rules of anyons or SymTFTs: A general algebraic formula for domain wall problems and quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formula for the transformation law of anyons in topologically ordered phases or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) through a gapped or symmetry-preserving domain wall. Our formalism is based on the ring homomorphism between the $\mathbb{C}$-linear commutative fusion rings, also known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). The fundamental assumption in our formalism is the validity of the Verlinde formula, applicable to commutative fusion rings. By combining it with more specific data of the settings, our formula provides classifications of anyons compatible with developing categorical formulations. It also provides the massless renormalization group (RG) flows between conformal field theories (CFTs), or a series of measurement-induced quantum phase transitions, in the language of SymTFT, through the established correspondence between CFTs and TQFTs. Moreover, by studying the correspondence between the ideal structure in the massless RG and the module in the related massive RG, one can make the Nambu-Goldstone-type arguments for generalized symmetry. By combining our formula with orbifolding, extension, and similarity transformation, one can get a series of classifications for the corresponding extended models, or symmetry-enriched topological orders and quantum criticalities.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to Unitary Hamiltonians in Non-Unitary String-Net Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Levin-Wen string-net formalism provides a canonical mapping from spherical fusion categories to local Hamiltonians defining Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\text{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations.</description>
