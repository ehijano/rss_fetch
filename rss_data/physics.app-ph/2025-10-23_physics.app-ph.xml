      <title>Experimental and numerical simulation study on the thermal performance of building envelope structures incorporating the solid-solid phase change material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is an experimental and numerical study of the thermal performance of building envelope structures incorporating a solid-solid phase change material (S-S PCM), consisting in a cross-linked polyurethane designated as PUX-1500-20. This S-S PCM is capable of storing and releasing thermal energy via phase transitions within the human comfort temperature range, facilitating the temporal and spatial transfer of solar energy for optimizing energy efficiency. The primary aim of this work is to integrate the S-S PCM into hollow bricks used in building envelopes and to evaluate their thermal inertia through both experimental testing and numerical simulation. The experimental results demonstrate that the integration of the PCM effectively delays and decreases the indoor temperature peak. The simulation results also show that the incorporation of the S-S PCM into hollow bricks gives rise to a phase shift of 7 hours and a decrement factor of 0.38. In comparison with the thermal behavior of the building envelopes (hollow brick) without PCMs, our results provide convincing evidence of the important thermal inertia of these structures incorporating the PCMs, revealing their significant potential in reducing energy consumption of building.</description>

      <title>Active tuning of ENZ resonances in meta-antenna through phase modulation of optical pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanoantennas offer new avenues to manipulate the propagation of light in materials due to their near field enhancement and ultrafast response time. Here we investigate the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) response in an L-shaped nanoantenna structure under the phenomenon of plasmonic analog of enhancement in the index of refraction. Using a quantum mechanical approach, we analyze the modulation in the response of probe field and emergence of ENZ frequency region both in the linear and nonlinear plasmonic system. We also demonstrate the active tuning of ENZ frequency region in a nanoantenna structure by modulating the phase of control pulse. The analytical and 3D FDTD simulation results show a significant spectral shift in the ENZ modes. Our proposed method offers the possibility to design and control optical tunable ENZ response in plasmonic metasurfaces without the use of ENZ material. Such metasurfaces can be used in on-chip photonic integrated circuits, further localization of incident fields, slow light operations and various quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field estimation using Gaussian process regression for interactive wireless power system design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless power transfer (WPT) with coupled resonators offers a promising solution for the seamless powering of electronic devices. Interactive design approaches that visualize the magnetic field and power transfer efficiency based on system geometry adjustments can facilitate the understanding and exploration of the behavior of these systems for dynamic applications. However, typical electromagnetic field simulation methods, such as the Method of Moments (MoM), require significant computational resources, limiting the rate at which computation can be performed for acceptable interactivity. Furthermore, the system's sensitivity to positional and geometrical changes necessitates a large number of simulations, and structures such as ferromagnetic shields further complicate these simulations. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), demonstrating for the first time the rapid estimation of the entire magnetic field and power transfer efficiency for near-field coupled systems. To achieve quick and accurate estimation, we develop 3D adaptive grid systems and an active learning strategy to effectively capture the nonlinear interactions between complex system geometries and magnetic fields. By training a regression model, our approach achieves magnetic field computation with sub-second latency and with an average error of less than 6% when validated against independent electromagnetic simulation results.</description>

      <title>Dynamic control of dipole decay rate via graphene plexcitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active control of the radiative properties of quantum emitters through engineered light-matter interactions is a key challenge in nanophotonics and quantum optics. In this work, we demonstrate dynamic modulation of dipole's decay rate by exploiting the tunable plexcitonic modes (graphene plasmons and QD-excitons) in the strong coupling regime. By integrating a quantum dot inside a graphene spherical shell and tuning the local optical response of hybrid modes via voltage-bias, we achieve continuous and reversible control over the decay rate, leading to significant enhancement or suppression of dipole emission from near- to far-infrared regime. Furthermore, the plexcitonic peaks shows much sharper linewidths in contrast to bare graphene plasmons even in the off-resonant coupling which indicates higher sensitivity of the systems at tuned wavelengths. We demonstrate the phenomenon with the numerical solution of 3D Maxwell's equations using MNPBEM tool. Our approach demonstrate a versatile platform for programmable emission control and offer a promising pathway for developing reconfigurable quantum photonic devices, such as tunable single-photon sources and ultrafast optical switches.</description>

      <title>Wind Variability and Its Effect on Transmission Line Capacity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of wind velocity averaging on Dynamic Thermal Rating (DTR) calculations. It is based on a high-temporal-resolution (1 second) wind measurements obtained from a transmission line in Slovenia, Europe. Wind speed and direction variability are analysed, and two averaging methods, namely vector averaging, where velocity is averaged as vector, and hybrid averaging, where speed is averaged as scalar, are employed. DTR calculations are performed on both high-resolution data and averaged data (5 minute averaging window). It is demonstrated that averaging has a significant effect on both Nusselt number and ampacity, and the effect exhibits a strong angular dependency on the relative angle of the wind to the line. Therefore, two limit cases are studied: in the case of parallel wind, averaged data underestimates the ampacity, and there is a significant amount of cases where the underestimation is larger than 10 %. In the case of perpendicular wind, the two averaging methods affect the results in different ways, but both result in a substantial amount of cases where ampacity is overestimated, potentially leading to unsafe operation. The main takeaway of the study is that averaging wind velocity has a significant impact on DTR results, and special emphasis should be given to the averaging method, as different methods affect the results in different ways.</description>

      <title>T2 mapping at 0.55 T using Ultra-Fast Spin Echo MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-field T2 mapping MRI can democratize neuropediatric imaging by improving accessibility and providing quantitative biomarkers of brain development. \textbf{Purpose:} To evaluate the feasibility of high-resolution T2 mapping using a single-shot fast spin-echo (SS-FSE) sequence at 0.55~T in a healthy control cohort. \textbf{Study Type:} Prospective single-center study. \textbf{Population:} In vivo: ten healthy adults (18--43~years, 5 females/5 males). In vitro: NIST Phantom. \textbf{Field strength/sequence:} Multi-echo ultra-fast spin-echo at 0.55~T and 1.5~T. \textbf{Assessment:} Feasibility was first assessed in vitro using the NIST Phantom, comparing T2 relaxation times to spectrometer references at 0.55~T. Acquisition and T2-fitting parameters optimized in vitro were applied in vivo. Repeatability was evaluated by atlas-based analysis of white matter (WM) and cortical grey matter (GM) regions. Coefficients of variation (CoV) were computed across runs, sessions, and subjects. \textbf{Statistical Tests:} Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction ($\alpha = 0.05/n_{ROI}$) assessed CoV differences. Pearson correlation coefficients quantified T2 associations. \textbf{Results:} In vitro, mono-exponential fitting under Gaussian--Rician noise yielded deviations $&lt;12\%$ from reference values. In vivo, inter-subject CoV was 5.2\% (WM) and 17.7\% (GM), comparable to 1.5~T. Mean T2 times were 118~ms (WM) and 188~ms (GM) at 0.55~T, with a 16.5-minute acquisition. \textbf{Conclusion:} A rapid, robust high-resolution T2 mapping protocol at 0.55~T for HASTE MRI is presented, employing Gaussian noise-based fitting. We report the first normative T2 values for healthy adult brains at 0.55~T, demonstrating technical feasibility and reliability.</description>

      <title>Synergistic effects of rare-earth doping on the magnetic properties of orthochromates: A machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiferroic materials, particularly rare-earth orthochromates (RECrO$_3$), have garnered significant interest due to their unique magnetic and electric-polar properties, making them promising candidates for multifunctional devices. Although extensive research has been conducted on their antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature (N$\acute{\textrm{e}}$el temperature, $T_\textrm{N}$), ferroelectricity, and piezoelectricity, the effects of doping and substitution of rare-earth (RE) elements on these properties remain insufficiently explored. In this study, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were employed to predict and analyze the physical properties of RECrO$_3$ compounds under various doping scenarios. Experimental and literature data were integrated to train machine learning models, enabling accurate predictions of $T_\textrm{N}$, besides remanent polarization ($P_\textrm{r}$) and piezoelectric coefficients ($d_{33}$). The results indicate that doping with specific RE elements significantly impacts $T_\textrm{N}$, with optimal doping levels identified for enhanced performance. Furthermore, high-entropy RECrO$_3$ compounds were systematically analyzed, demonstrating how the inclusion of multiple RE elements influences magnetic properties. This work establishes a robust framework for predicting and optimizing the properties of RECrO$_3$ materials, offering valuable insights into their potential applications in energy storage and sensor technologies.</description>

      <title>Twisted superconducting quantum diodes: Towards anharmonicity and high fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum technologies advance, a fundamental challenge is mitigating noise and backscattering in superconducting circuits to achieve scalable, high-fidelity operations. Conventional superconducting components lack directionality, causing energy loss and decoherence. Superconducting diodes, that allow dissipationless current in one direction and resistive flow in the other, offer a potential remedy, yet their efficiency and quantum integration remain limited. Here, we realize a quantum diode in twisted NbSe2 bilayers under in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. A mere 1 degree twist yields an efficiency enhancement over pristine devices, reaching 27.6 percent. Quantum simulations reveal that this intermediate efficiency, well below 100 percent ideal, is both experimentally practical and optimal for preserving qubit anharmonicity and stabilizing two-level systems. These findings show that maximal rectification is not always beneficial for quantum information, establishing a new principle for designing the fundamental properties of twisted superconductors towards low-power, high-fidelity quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Detuning Tunable OAM Generation via Double-$\Lambda$ Four-Wave Mixing in Hot Rubidium Vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate detuning-tunable generation of orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) light using a double Lambda four-wave-mixing (FWM) process in Doppler broadened rubidium vapor. Two near-resonant pumps on the D1 line drive non degenerate FWM that produces bright probe conjugate beams whose transverse modes evolve with pump detuning. A paraxial density-matrix model coupled to split-step propagation predicts detuning-dependent spatial gain shaping that sets the OAM content; experiments with a mode cleaned pump laser and a 12-mm AR-coated vapor cell validate these predictions. We quantify mode formation by imaging, spectroscopy, and power measurements, and verify OAM conservation between the generated beams. The results establish resonant atomic vapor as a compact, tunable platform for structured-light generation with applications to high-dimensional quantum communications and imaging.</description>

      <title>Addressing spins at the clock transitions with a frequency- and bandwidth-tunable superconducting resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state spin ensembles addressed via superconducting circuits are promising candidates for quantum memory applications, offering multimodal storage capability and second-long coherence times at their clock transition. Implementing practical memory schemes requires dynamic control over both the resonator frequency and bandwidth. In this letter, we report measurements of a superconducting resonator whose frequency can be tuned by passing a DC current through the high-kinetic-inductance thin film, and whose bandwidth can be tuned by parametric coupling to a low-Q buffer resonator. Using this resonator, we address an ensemble of bismuth donors at their clock transition, measuring a Hahn-echo coherence time of 450 ms. We demonstrate RF driving of the bismuth donor hyperfine transitions, as well as dynamic bandwidth control of the resonator.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Design Assistant for the Simulation of Inertial Fusion Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inertial fusion energy promises nearly unlimited, clean power if it can be achieved. However, the design and engineering of fusion systems requires controlling and manipulating matter at extreme energies and timescales; the shock physics and radiation transport governing the physical behavior under these conditions are complex requiring the development, calibration, and use of predictive multiphysics codes to navigate the highly nonlinear and multi-faceted design landscape. We hypothesize that artificial intelligence reasoning models can be combined with physics codes and emulators to autonomously design fusion fuel capsules. In this article, we construct a multi-agent system where natural language is utilized to explore the complex physics regimes around fusion energy. The agentic system is capable of executing a high-order multiphysics inertial fusion computational code. We demonstrate the capacity of the multi-agent design assistant to both collaboratively and autonomously manipulate, navigate, and optimize capsule geometry while accounting for high fidelity physics that ultimately achieve simulated ignition via inverse design.</description>

      <title>TunnElQNN: A Hybrid Quantum-classical Neural Network for Efficient Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQCNNs) represent a promising frontier in machine learning, leveraging the complementary strengths of both models. In this work, we propose the development of TunnElQNN, a non-sequential architecture composed of alternating classical and quantum layers. Within the classical component, we employ the Tunnelling Diode Activation Function (TDAF), inspired by the I-V characteristics of quantum tunnelling. We evaluate the performance of this hybrid model on a synthetic dataset of interleaving half-circle for multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of class overlap. The model is compared against a baseline hybrid architecture that uses the conventional ReLU activation function (ReLUQNN). Our results show that the TunnElQNN model consistently outperforms the ReLUQNN counterpart. Furthermore, we analyse the decision boundaries generated by TunnElQNN under different levels of class overlap and compare them to those produced by a neural network implementing TDAF within a fully classical architecture. These findings highlight the potential of integrating physics-inspired activation functions with quantum components to enhance the expressiveness and robustness of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning architectures.</description>

      <title>Acoustic phonon-restricted four-phonon interactions: Impact on thermal and thermoelectric transport in monolayer h-NbN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To explore the thermal and thermoelectric potential of 2D materials, we study the h-NbN monolayer, which lacks mirror symmetry and features a large acoustic-optical phonon gap and quadratic flexural mode. First-principles calculations and the Boltzmann transport formalism reveal a complex interplay of multi-phonon scattering processes, where flexural phonons and four-phonon interactions play a significant role in heat transport, primarily dominated by acoustic phonons. Notably, the four-phonon interactions are predominantly confined to acoustic phonons. Tensile strain preserves the underlying scattering mechanisms while reducing anharmonicity, consequently, the scattering rates, enhancing thermal conduction. Simultaneously, competing modifications in thermal and electrical transport shape the strain-dependent thermoelectric response, achieving a figure of merit approaching 1 at elevated temperatures, a testament to its thermoelectric promise. Our findings underscore the critical role of microscopic transport modeling in accurately capturing thermal and thermoelectric properties, paving the way for advanced applications of 2D materials.</description>

Abstract: A neuroevolution potential (NEP) for the ternary $\alpha$-Fe--C--H system was developed based on a database generated from spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations, achieving empirical potential efficiency with DFT accuracy. At the same power consumption, simulation speeds using NEP are comparable to, or even faster than, those with bond order potentials. The NEP achieves DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of scenarios commonly encountered in studies of $\alpha$-Fe- and $\alpha$-Fe--C under hydrogen environments. The NEP enables large-scale atomistic simulations with DFT-level accuracy at the cost of empirical potentials, offering a practical tool to study hydrogen embrittlement in steel.</description>
