      <title>The algebraic structures of social organizations: the operad of cooperative games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to settle a conceptual framework for cooperative game theory in which the notion of composition/aggregation of games is the defining structure. This is done via the mathematical theory of algebraic operads: we start by endowing the collection of all cooperative games with any number of players with an operad structure, and we show that it generalises all the previous notions of sums, products and compositions of games considered by Owen, Shapley, von Neumann and Morgenstern, and many others. Furthermore, we explicitly compute this operad in terms of generators and relations, showing that the M\"obius transform map induces a canonical isomorphism between the operad of cooperative games and the operad that encodes commutative triassociative algebras. In other words, we prove that any cooperative game is a linear combination of iterated compositions of the 2-player bargaining game and the 2-player dictator games. We show that many interesting classes of games (simple, balanced, capacities a.k.a fuzzy measures and convex functions, totally monotone, etc) are stable under compositions, and thus form suboperads. In the convex case, this gives by the submodularity theorem a new operad structure on the family of all generalized permutahedra. Finally, we focus on how solution concepts in cooperative game theory behave under composition: we study the core of a composite and describe it in terms of the core of its components, and we give explicit formulas for the Shapley value and the Banzhaf index of a compound game.</description>

      <title>Marcello's completion of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper initiates a study on a new optimization problem with regards to graph completion. The defined procedure is called, \emph{Marcello's completion} of a graph. For graph $G$ of order $n$ the \emph{Marcello number} is obtained by iteratively constructing graphs, $G_1,G_2,\dots,G_k$ by adding a maximal number of edges between pairs of distinct, non-adjacent vertices in accordance with the \emph{Marcello rule}. If for smallest $k$ the resultant graph $G_k \cong K_n$ then the Marcello number of a graph $G$ denoted by $\varpi(G)$ is equal to $\varpi(G) = k$. By convention $\varpi(K_n) = 0$, $n \geq 1$. Certain introductory results are presented.</description>

      <title>Fundamental and homogeneous bases of Hopf algebras built from nonsymmetric operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new partial order structures on the underlying sets of free nonsymmetric operads. These posets involve decorated ordered rooted trees, and their terminal intervals are lattices. These lattices are not graded, not self-dual, and not semi-distributive, but they are EL-shellable, and their M\"bius functions take values in $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. They admit sublattices on the families of $m$-Fuss-Catalan objects and of forests of trees. This latter order structure is used to construct two new bases for the natural Hopf algebras of free nonsymmetric operads: a fundamental basis and a homogeneous basis. Along with the already known elementary basis of these Hopf algebras, this yields a triple of bases. The situation is similar to what is observed in the Hopf algebras of Malvenuto-Reutenauer, Loday-Ronco, and noncommutative symmetric functions, each of which presents such triples of bases and basis changes involving, respectively, the right weak partial order, the Tamari partial order, and the Boolean lattice partial order.</description>

      <title>Some Tur\'{a}n-type results for signless Laplacian spectral radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Half a century ago, Bollob\'{a}s and Erd\H{o}s [Bull. London Math. Soc. 5 (1973)] proved that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $e(G)\ge (1- \frac{1}{k} + \varepsilon )\frac{n^2}{2}$ edges contains a blowup $K_{k+1}[t]$ with $t=\Omega_{k,\varepsilon}(\log n)$. A well-known theorem of Nikiforov [Combin. Probab. Comput. 18 (3) (2009)] asserts that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph with adjacency spectral radius $\lambda (G)\ge (1- \frac{1}{k} + \varepsilon)n$, then $G$ contains a blowup $K_{k+1}[t]$ with $t=\Omega_{k,\varepsilon}(\log n)$. This gives a spectral version of the Bollob\'{a}s--Erd\H{o}s theorem. In this paper, we systematically explore variants of Nikiforov's result in terms of the signless Laplacian spectral radius, extending the supersaturation, blowup of cliques and the stability results.</description>

      <title>Oriented Diameter of Mixed Graphs with Given Maximum Undirected Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2018, Dankelmann, Gao, and Surmacs [J. Graph Theory, 88(1): 5--17, 2018] established sharp bounds on the oriented diameter of a bridgeless undirected graph and a bridgeless undirected bipartite graph in terms of vertex degree. In this paper, we extend these results to \emph{mixed graphs}, which contain both directed and undirected edges.
  Let the \emph{undirected degree} $d^*_G(x)$ of a vertex $x \in V(G)$ be the number of its incident undirected edges in a mixed graph $G$ of order $n$, and let the \emph{maximum undirected degree} be $\Delta^*(G) = \max\{d^*_G(v) : v \in V(G)\}$. We prove that \begin{align*} \text{(1)}\quad &amp; \overrightarrow{\mathrm{diam}}(G) \leq n - \Delta^* + 3 &amp;&amp; \text{if $G$ is undirected, or contains a vertex $u$ with $d^*_G(u) = \Delta^*$} \\ &amp; &amp;&amp; \text{and $d^+_G(u) + d^-_G(u) \geq 2$, or $\Delta^* = 5$ and $d^+_G(u) + d^-_G(u) = 1$;} \\ \text{(2)}\quad &amp; \overrightarrow{\mathrm{diam}}(G) \leq n - \Delta^* + 4 &amp;&amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{align*} We also establish bounds for mixed bipartite graphs. If $G$ is a bridgeless mixed bipartite graph with partite sets $A$ and $B$, and $u \in B$, then \begin{align*} \text{(1)}\quad &amp; \overrightarrow{\mathrm{diam}}(G) \leq 2(|A| - d(u)) + 7 &amp;&amp; \text{if $G$ is undirected;\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } \\ \text{(2)}\quad &amp; \overrightarrow{\mathrm{diam}}(G) \leq 2(|A| - d^*(u)) + 8 &amp;&amp; \text{if $d^+_G(u) + d^-_G(u) \geq 2$;} \\ \text{(3)}\quad &amp; \overrightarrow{\mathrm{diam}}(G) \leq 2(|A| - d^*(u)) + 10 &amp;&amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{align*}
  All of the above bounds are sharp, except possibly the last one.</description>

      <title>On the (in)equivalence of Brouwer's fixed point theorem and Sperner's lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Brouwer's fixed point theorem and Sperner's lemma in one dimension. We present a proof of the Brouwer theorem using the Sperner lemma, and vice versa. However, we also show that they are not equivalent, because the Sperner lemma holds in the ordered field of rational numbers, whereas proving the Brouwer theorem requires the property of completeness.</description>

      <title>Characterizing circle graphs with binomial partial Petrial polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partial Petrial polynomial was first introduced by Gross, Mansour, and Tucker as a generating function that enumerates the Euler genera of all possible partial Petrials on a ribbon graph. Yan and Li later extended this polynomial invariant to circle graphs by utilizing the correspondence between circle graphs and bouquets. Their explicit computation demonstrated that paths produce binomial polynomials, specifically those containing exactly two non-zero terms. This discovery led them to pose a fundamental characterization problem: identify all connected circle graphs whose partial Petrial polynomial is binomial. In this paper, we solve this open problem in terms of local complementation and prove that for connected circle graphs, the binomial property holds precisely when the graph is a path.</description>

      <title>Method of Weighted Words on Cylindric Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generating functions of cylindric partitions having profile $c=(c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_r)$ with rank $2$ and levels $2, 3$ and $4$. As a result, we give expressions alternative to Borodin's formula for these generating functions. We use the method of weighted words which was first introduced by Alladi and Gordon, later was applied by Dousse in a new version to prove some partition identities and to get infinite products. We adopt the method to our subject with a more combinatorial approach.</description>

      <title>Vertex-transitive nut graph order-degree existence problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nut graph is a nontrivial simple graph whose adjacency matrix has a simple eigenvalue zero such that the corresponding eigenvector has no zero entries. It is known that the order $n$ and degree $d$ of a vertex-transitive nut graph satisfy $4 \mid d$, $d \ge 4$, $2 \mid n$ and $n \ge d + 4$; or $d \equiv 2 \pmod 4$, $d \ge 6$, $4 \mid n$ and $n \ge d + 6$. Here, we prove that for each such $n$ and $d$, there exists a $d$-regular Cayley nut graph of order $n$. As a direct consequence, we obtain all the pairs $(n, d)$ for which there is a $d$-regular vertex-transitive (resp. Cayley) nut graph of order $n$.</description>

      <title>New orientable sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orientable sequences of order n are infinite periodic sequences with symbols drawn from a finite alphabet of size k with the property that any particular subsequence of length n occurs at most once in a period in either direction. They were introduced in the early 1990s in the context of possible applications in position sensing. Bounds on the period of such sequences and a range of methods of construction have been devised, although apart from very small cases a significant gap remains between the largest known period for such a sequence and the best known upper bound. In this paper we first give improved upper bounds on the period of such sequences. We then give a new general method of construction for orientable sequences involving subgraphs of the de Bruijn graph with special properties, and describe two different approaches for generating such subgraphs. This enables us to construct orientable sequences with periods meeting the improved upper bounds when n is 2 or 3, as well as n=4 and k odd. For 4\leq n\leq 8, in some cases the sequences produced by the methods described have periods larger than for any previously known sequences.</description>

      <title>Semisimple algebras related to immaculate tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a direct sum $A$ of full matrix algebras, if there is a combinatorial interpretation associated with both the dimension of $A$ and the dimensions of the irreducible $A$-modules, then this can be thought of as providing an analogue of the famous Frobenius-Young identity $n! = \sum_{\lambda \vdash n} ( f^{\lambda} )^{2}$ derived from the semisimple structure of the symmetric group algebra $\mathbb{C}S_{n}$, letting $f^{\lambda}$ denote the number of Young tableaux of partition shape $\lambda \vdash n$. By letting $g^{\alpha}$ denote the number of standard immaculate tableaux of composition shape $\alpha \vDash n$, we construct an algebra $\mathbb{C}\mathcal{I}_{n}$ with a semisimple structure such that $\dim \mathbb{C}\mathcal{I}_{n} = \sum_{\alpha \vDash n} (g^{\alpha})^{2}$ and such that $\mathbb{C}\mathcal{I}_{n} $ contains an isomorphic copy of $\mathbb{C}S_{n}$. We bijectively prove a recurrence for $\dim \mathbb{C}\mathcal{I}_{n}$ so as to construct a basis of $\mathbb{C}\mathcal{I}_{n}$ indexed by permutation-like objects that we refer to as immacutations. We form a basis $\mathcal{B}_{n}$ of $\mathbb{C}\mathcal{I}_{n}$ such that $\mathbb{C} \mathcal{B}_n$ has the structure of a monoid algebra in such a way so that $\mathcal{B}_n$ is closed under the multiplicative operation of $\mathbb{C} \mathcal{I}_n$, yielding a monoid structure on the set of order-$n$ immacutations.</description>

      <title>The ordering of hypertrees and unicyclic hypergraphs by the traces of $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha}$-tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a real number $\alpha\in[0,1]$ and a $k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha}(\mathcal{H})=\alpha\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H})+(1-\alpha)\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{H})$ is called the $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha}$-tensor of $\mathcal{H}$, where $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H})$ and $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{H})$ are the degree tensor and adjacency tensor of $\mathcal{H}$, respectively. The sum of the $d$-th powers of all eigenvalues of $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha}(\mathcal{H})$ is called the $d$-th order $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha}$-spectral moment of $\mathcal{H}$, which is equal to the $d$-th order trace of $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha}(\mathcal{H})$. In this paper, some hypergraphs are ordered lexicographically by their $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha}$-spectral moments in non-decreasing order. The first, the second, the last and the second last hypergraphs among all $k$-uniform linear unicyclic hypergraphs and hypertrees are characterized, respectively. We give the first and the last hypergraphs among all $k$-uniform linear unicyclic hypergraphs with given grith, and characterize the last hypertree among all $k$-uniform hypertrees with given diameter. Furthermore, we determine some extreme values of the $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha}$-spectral moments for hypertrees and linear unicyclic hypergraphs, respectively.</description>

      <title>The pure condition for incidence geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of \emph{parallel redrawings} of an incidence geometry $(P,H,I)$ with an assigned set of normals is the set of points and hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying the incidences given by $(P,H,I)$, such that the hyperplanes have the assigned normals.
  In 1989, Whiteley characterized the incidence geometries that have d-dimensional realizations with generic hyperplane normals such that all points and hyperplanes are distinct. However, some incidence geometries can be realized as points and hyperplanes in d-dimensional space, with the points and hyperplanes distinct, but only for specific choices of normals. Such incidence geometries are the topic of this article.
  In this article, we introduce a pure condition for parallel redrawings of incidence geometries, analogous to the pure condition for bar-and-joint frameworks, introduced by White and Whiteley. The d-dimensional pure condition of an incidence geometry (P,H,I) imposes a condition on the normals assigned to the hyperplanes of (P,H,I) required for d-dimensional realizations of (P,H,I) with distinct points. We use invariant theory to show that is a bracket polynomial. We will also explicitly compute the pure condition as a bracket polynomial for some examples in the plane.</description>

      <title>A note on maximal plane subgraphs of the complete twisted graph containing perfect matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The twisted graph $T_{n}$ is a drawing of the complete graph with $n$ vertices $v_{1},v_{2},\ldots ,v_{n}$ in which two edges $v_{i}v_{j}$ ($i&lt;j$) and $v_{s}v_{t}$ ($s&lt;t$) cross if and only if $i&lt;s&lt;t&lt;j$ or $s&lt;i&lt;j&lt;t$. We show that for any maximal plane subgraphs $S$ and $R$ of $T_{n}$, each containing at least one perfect matching, there is a sequence $S=F_0, F_1, \ldots, F_m=R$ of maximal plane subgrahs of $T_n$, also containing perfect matchings, such that for $i=0,1, \ldots, m-1$, $F_{i+1}$ can be obtained from $F_{i}$ by a single edge exchange.</description>

      <title>The Local Structure Theorem for Graph Minors with Finite Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Local Structure Theorem (LST) for graph minors roughly states that every $H$-minor free graph $G$ that contains a sufficiently large wall $W$, there is a set of few vertices $A$ such that, upon removing $A$, the resulting graph $G':=G - A$ admits an "almost embedding" $\delta$ into a surface $\Sigma$ in which $H$ does not embed. By almost embedding, we mean that there exists a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ whose vertex set is a subset of the vertex set of $G$ and an embedding of $\mathcal{H}$ in $\Sigma$ such that 1) the drawing of each hyperedge of $\mathcal{H}$ corresponds to a cell of $\delta$, 2) the boundary of each cell intersects only the vertices of the corresponding hyperedge, and 3) all remaining vertices and edges of $G'$ are drawn in the interior of cells. The cells corresponding to hyperedges of arity at least $4$, called vortices, are few in number and have small "depth", while a "large" part of the wall $W$ is drawn outside the vortices and is "grounded" in the embedding $\delta$. Now suppose that the subgraphs drawn inside each of the non-vortex cells are equipped with some finite index, i.e., each such cell is assigned a color from a finite set. We prove a version of the LST in which the set $C$ of colors assigned to the non-vortex cells exhibits "large" bidimensionality: The graph $G'$ contains a minor model of a large grid $\Gamma$ where each bag corresponding to a vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$, contains the subgraph drawn within a cell carrying color $\alpha$, for every color $\alpha \in C$. Moreover, the grid $\Gamma$ can be chosen in a way that is "well-connected" to the original wall $W$.</description>

      <title>The V-Number of Binomial Edge Ideals: Minimal Cuts and Cycle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The v-number of a graded ideal is an invariant recently introduced in the context of coding theory, particularly in the study of Reed--Muller-type codes. In this work, we study the localized v-numbers of a binomial edge ideal $J_G$ associated to a finite simple graph $G$. We introduce a new approach to compute these invariants, based on the analysis of transversals in families of subsets arising from dependencies in certain rank-two matroids. This reduces the computation of localized v-numbers to the determination of the radical of an explicit ideal and provides upper bounds for these invariants. Using this method, we explicitly compute the localized v-numbers of $J_G$ at the associated minimal primes corresponding to minimal cuts of $G$. Additionally, we determine the v-number of binomial edge ideals for cycle graphs and give an almost complete answer to a recent conjecture, showing that the v-number of a cycle graph $C_n$ is either $\textstyle \left\lceil \frac{2n}{3} \right\rceil$ or $\textstyle \left\lceil \frac{2n}{3} \right\rceil - 1$.</description>

      <title>A geometric model for the non-$\tau$-rigid modules of type $\widetilde{D}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a geometric model for the non-$\tau$-rigid modules over acyclic path algebras of type $\widetilde{D}_n$. Similar models have been provided for module categories over path algebras of types $A_n, D_n,$ and $\widetilde{A}_n$ as well as the $\tau$-rigid modules of type $\widetilde{D}_n$. A major draw of these geometric models is the "intersection-dimension formulas" they often come with. These formulas give an equality between the intersection number of the curves representing the modules in the geometric model and the dimension of the extension spaces between the two modules. This formula allows us to calculate the homological data between two modules combinatorially. Since there are infinitely many distinct homogeneous stable tubes in the regular component of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of type $\widetilde{D}_n$, all of which are disjoint, our geometric data requires an extra decoration on the admissible edges in our geometric model to prevent intersections between curves corresponding to modules in distinct stable tubes of the Auslander-Reiten quiver.</description>

      <title>Metric dimension reduction modulus for logarithmic distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given parameters $n$ and $\alpha$, the metric dimension reduction modulus $k^\alpha_n(\ell_\infty)$ is defined as the smallest $k$ such that every $n$--point metric space can be embedded into some $k$-dimensional normed space $X$ with bi--Lipschitz distortion at most $\alpha$. A fundamental task in the theory of metric embeddings is to obtain sharp asymptotics for $k^\alpha_n(\ell_\infty)$ for all choices of $\alpha$ and $n$, with the range $\alpha=\Theta(\log n)$ bearing special importance. While advances in the theory lead to the upper bound $k^{\alpha}_n(\ell_\infty) = O(\log n)$ for $\alpha=\Theta(\log n)$, obtaining a matching lower bound has remained an open problem. We prove that $k^{\beta\log n}_n(\ell_\infty) = \Omega(\log n)$ for every constant $\beta&gt;0$, thereby closing the long--standing gap and resolving a question from the 2018 ICM plenary lecture of Naor.</description>

      <title>Proof of a magnificent conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by super-Yang-Mills theory on a Calabi-Yau 4-fold, Nekrasov and Piazzalunga have assigned weights to $r$-tuples of solid partitions and conjectured a formula for their weighted generating function.
  We define $K$-theoretic virtual invariants of Quot schemes of 0-dimensional quotients of $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^4}^{\oplus r}$ by realizing them as zero loci of isotropic sections of orthogonal bundles on non-commutative Quot schemes. Via the Oh-Thomas localization formula, we recover Nekrasov-Piazzalunga's weights and derive their sign rule.
  Our proof passes through refining the $K$-theoretic invariants to sheaves and describing them via Clifford modules, which lets us show that they arise from a factorizable sequence of sheaves in the sense of Okounkov. Taking limits of the equivariant parameters, we then deduce the Nekrasov-Piazzalunga conjecture from its 3-dimensional analog.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Lines in Finite Lie Incidence Geometries of Classical Type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider any classical Grassmannian geometry $\Gamma$; that is, any projective or polar Grassmann space. Suppose every line in $\Gamma$ contains $s+1$ points. Then we classify all sets of points in $\Gamma$ of cardinality $s+1$, with the property, that no object of opposite type in the corresponding building, is opposite every point of the set. It turns out that such sets are either lines, or hyperbolic lines in symplectic residues, or ovoids in large symplectic subquadrangles of rank 2 residues in characteristic 2. This is a far-reaching extension of a famous and fundamental result of Bose &amp; Burton from the 1960s. We describe a new way to classify geometric lines in finite classical geometries and how our results correspond to blocking sets.</description>

      <title>Regions of Level $\ell$ of Catalan/Semiorder-Type Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1996, Stanley extended the classical Catalan arrangement and semiorder arrangement, which are called the Catalan-type arrangement $\mathcal{C}_{n,A}$ and the semiorder-type arrangement $\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*$ in this paper. By establishing a labeled Dyck path model for the regions of $\mathcal{C}_{n,A}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*$, this paper explores several enumerative problems related to the number of regions of level $\ell$, denoted as $r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})$ and $r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)$, which includes:
  (1) proving a Stirling convolution relation between $r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})$ and $r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)$, refining a result by Stanley and Postnikov;
  (2) showing that the sequences$\left(r_\ell{(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})}\right)_{n\geq 0}$ and $(r_\ell {(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)})_{n\geq 0}$ exhibit properties of binomial type in the sense of Rota;
  (3) establishing the transformational significance of $r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})$ and $r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)$ under Stanley's ESA framework: they can be viewed as transition matrices from binomial coefficients to their characteristic polynomials respectively.
Further, we present two applications of the theories and methods: first, we provide a hyperplane arrangement counting interpretation of the two-parameter generalization of Fuss--Catalan numbers, which is closely related to the number of regions of level $\ell$ in the $m$-Catalan arrangement. Second, using labeled Dyck paths to depict the number of regions in the $m$-Catalan arrangement, we algorithmically provide the inverse mapping of the Fu, Wang, and Zhu mapping.</description>

      <title>The Fine interior of dilations of a rational polytope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nondegenerate toric hypersurface of negative Kodaira dimension can be characterized by the empty Fine interior of its Newton polytope according to recent work by Victor Batyrev, where the Fine interior is the rational subpolytope consisting of all points which have an integral distance of at least 1 to all integral supporting hyperplanes of the Newton polytope. Moreover, we get more information in this situation if we can describe how the Fine interior behaves for dilations of the Newton polytope, e.g. if we can determine the smallest dilation with a non-empty Fine interior. Therefore, in this article we give a purely combinatorial description of the Fine interiors of all dilations of a rational polytope, which allows us in particular to compute this smallest dilation and to classify all lattice 3-polytopes with empty Fine interior, for which we have only one point as Fine interior of the smallest dilation with non-empty Fine interior.</description>

      <title>Oriented Ramsey numbers of some sparse graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $H$ be an oriented graph without directed cycle. The oriented Ramsey number of $H$, denoted by $\overrightarrow{r}(H)$, is the smallest integer $N$ such that every tournament on $N$ vertices contains a copy of $H$. Rosenfeld (JCT-B, 1974) conjectured that $\overrightarrow{r}(H)=|H|$ if $H$ is a cycle of sufficiently large order, which was confirmed for $|H|\geq 9$ by Zein recently, and so does if $H$ is a path. Note that $\overrightarrow{r}(H)=|H|$ implies any tournament contains $H$ as a spanning subdigraph, it is interesting to ask when $\overrightarrow{r}(H)=|H|$ for $H$ being a sparse oriented graph. S\'os (1986) conjectured this is true if $H$ is a directed path plus an additional edge containing the origin of the path as one end, which was confirmed by Petrovi\'{c} (JGT, 1988). In this paper, we show that $\overrightarrow{r}(H)=|H|$ for $H$ being an oriented graph obtained by identifying a vertex of an antidirected cycle with one end of a directed path. Some other oriented Ramsey numbers for oriented graphs with one cycle are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koml\'os-S\'ark\"ozy-Szemer\'edi (KSS) theorem establishes that a certain bound on the minimum degree of a graph guarantees it contains all bounded degree trees of the same order. Recently several authors put forward variants of this result, where the tree is of smaller order than the host graph, and the host graph also obeys a maximum degree condition. Also, Kathapurkar and Montgomery extended the KSS theorem to digraphs. We bring these two directions together by establishing minimum and maximum degree bounds for digraphs that ensure the containment of oriented trees of smaller order. Our result is restricted to balanced antidirected trees of bounded degree. More precisely, we show that for every $\gamma &gt; 0$, $c\in\mathbb{R}$, $\ell\geq 2$ sufficiently large $n$ and all $k\geq\gamma n$, the following holds for every $n$-vertex digraph $D$ and every balanced antidirected tree $T$ with $k$ arcs whose total maximum degree is bounded by $(\log n)^c$. If $D$ has a vertex of outdegree at least $(1+\gamma)(\ell -1)k$, a vertex of indegree at least $(1+\gamma)(\ell -1)k$ and minimum semidegree $\delta^0(D)\geq\left(\frac{\ell}{2\ell -1}+\gamma\right)k$, then $D$ contains $T$.</description>

For $n \le 16$, we determine the maximum size among sets of mutually unbiased weighing matrices of order $n$ and weight $9$. Notably, our findings reveal that $13$ is the smallest order where such pairs exist, and $16$ is the first order for which a maximum class of unbiased weighing matrices is found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chip firing provides a way to study the sandpile group (also known as the Jacobian) of a graph. We use a generalized version of chip firing to bound the number of invariant factors of the critical group of an arithmetical structure on a graph. We also show that, under suitable hypotheses, critical groups are additive under wedge sums of graphs with arithmetical structures. These results allow us to relate the number of invariant factors of critical groups associated to any given tree to decompositions of the tree into simpler trees. We use this to classify those trees for which every arithmetical structure has cyclic critical group. Finally, we show how to construct arithmetical structures on trees with prescribed critical groups. In particular, every finite abelian group is realized as the critical group of some arithmetical structure on a tree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multigraph G is said to be an (s,q)-graph if every s-set of vertices in G supports at most q edges (counting multiplicities). In this paper we consider the maximal sum and product of edge multiplicities in an (s,q)-graph on n vertices. These are multigraph analogues of a problem of Erd\H{o}s raised by F\"uredi and K\"undgen and Mubayi and Terry respectively, with applications to counting problems and extremal hypergraph theory.
  We make major progress, settling conjectures of Day, Falgas-Ravry and Treglown and of Falgas-Ravry, establishing intricate behaviour for both the sum and the product problems, and providing both a general picture and evidence that the problems may prove computationally intractable in general.</description>

      <title>Rainbow copies of spanning subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G_{n,p}^{[\kappa]}$ denote the space of $n$-vertex edge coloured graphs, where each edge occurs independently with probability $p$. The colour of each existing edge is chosen independently and uniformly at random from the set $[\kappa]$. We consider the threshold for the existence of rainbow colored copies of a spanning subgraph $H$. We provide lower bounds on $p$ and $\kappa$ sufficient to prove the existence of such copies w.h.p.</description>

      <title>Concentration of the maximum size of an induced subtree in moderately sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kamaldinov, Skorkin, and Zhukovskii proved that the maximum size of an induced subtree in the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ is concentrated at two consecutive points, whenever $p\in(0,1)$ is a constant. Using improved bounds on the second moment of the number of induced subtrees, we show that the same result holds when $n^{-\frac{e-2}{3e-2}+\varepsilon}\leq p=o(1)$.</description>

      <title>Some sharp bounds on the average Steiner (k, l)-eccentricity for trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17915v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce some transformations for trees that do not increase the average Steiner $(k,l)$-eccentricity for all $0\leq l\leq k\leq n$. Using these transformations, we obtain some sharp bounds on the average Steiner $(k,l)$-eccentricity for trees with some certain conditions, including given nodes, given diameter, given max degree and given leaves, and get the corresponding extremal trees as well.</description>

      <title>Some exact inducibility-type results for graphs via flag algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $(\kappa,\ell)$-edge-inducibility problem asks for the maximum number of $\kappa$-subsets inducing exactly $\ell$ edges that a graph of given order $n$ can have. Using flag algebras and stability approach, we resolve this problem for all sufficiently large $n$ (including a description of all extremal and almost extremal graphs) in eleven new non-trivial cases when $\kappa\le 7$.
  We also compute the $F$-inducibility constant (the asymptotically maximum density of induced copies of $F$ in a graph of given order $n$) and obtain some corresponding structure results for three new graphs $F$ with $5$ vertices: the 3-edge star plus an isolated vertex, the 4-cycle plus an isolated vertex, and the 4-cycle with a pendant edge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the largest subset $A\subseteq \{1,\dotsc,n\}$ such that for all $a,b\in A$, the product $ab$ is not squarefree. Specifically, the maximum size is achieved by the complement of the odd squarefree numbers.
  This resolves a problem of Paul Erd\H{o}s and Andr\'as S\'ark\"ozy from 1992.</description>

      <title>The unstable formula theorem revisited via algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is about the surprising interaction of a foundational result from model theory, about stability of theories, with algorithmic stability in learning. First, in response to gaps in existing learning models, we introduce a new statistical learning model, called ``Probably Eventually Correct'' or PEC. We characterize Littlestone (stable) classes in terms of this model. As a corollary, Littlestone classes have frequent short definitions in a natural statistical sense. In order to obtain a characterization of Littlestone classes in terms of frequent definitions, we build an equivalence theorem highlighting what is common to many existing approximation algorithms, and to the new PEC. This is guided by an analogy to definability of types in model theory, but has its own character. Drawing on these theorems and on other recent work, we present a complete algorithmic analogue of Shelah's celebrated Unstable Formula Theorem, with algorithmic properties taking the place of the infinite.</description>

      <title>Sina\u{i} excursions: An analogue of Sparre Andersen's formula for the area process of a random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12941v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sina\u{i} initiated the study of random walks with persistently positive area processes, motivated by shock waves in solutions to the inviscid Burgers' equation. We find the precise asymptotic probability that the area process of a random walk bridge is an excursion. A key ingredient is an analogue of Sparre Andersen's classical formula. The asymptotics are related to von Sterneck's subset counting formulas from additive number theory. Our results sharpen bounds by Aurzada, Dereich and Lifshits and respond to a question of Caravenna and Deuschel, which arose in their study of the wetting model. In this context, Sina\u{\i} excursions are a class of random polymer chains exhibiting entropic repulsion.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Sphere Sizes in the Sum-Rank Metric and Coordinate-Additive Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides new bounds on the size of spheres in any coordinate-additive metric with a particular focus on improving existing bounds in the sum-rank metric. We derive improved upper and lower bounds based on the entropy of a distribution related to the Boltzmann distribution, which work for any coordinate-additive metric. Additionally, we derive new closed-form upper and lower bounds specifically for the sum-rank metric that outperform existing closed-form bounds.</description>

      <title>Lattice 3-polytopes of lattice width 2 and corresponding toric hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kodaira dimension of a nondegenerate toric hypersurface can be computed from the dimension of the Fine interior of its Newton polytope according to recent work of Victor Batyrev, where the Fine interior of the Newton polytope is the subpolytope consisting of all points which have an integral distance of at least $1$ to all integral supporting hyperplanes. In particular, if we have a Fine interior of codimension $1$, then the hypersurface is of general type and the Newton polytope has lattice width $2$. In this article we study this situation for lattice $3$-polytopes and the corresponding surfaces of general type. In particular, we classify all $2$-dimensional Fine interiors of those lattice $3$-polytopes which have at most $40$ interior lattice points, thus obtaining many examples of surfaces of general type and genus at most $40$.</description>

      <title>Contributions to conjectures in planar graphs: Induced Subgraphs, Treewidth, and Dominating Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two of the most prominent unresolved conjectures in graph theory, the Albertson-Berman conjecture and the Matheson-Tarjan conjecture, have been extensively studied by many researchers.
  (AB) Every planar graph of order $n$ has an induced forest of order at least $\frac{n}{2}$.
  (MT) Every plane triangulation of sufficiently large order $n$ has a dominating set of cardinality at most $\frac{n}{4}$.
  Although partial progress and weaker bounds are known, both conjectures remain unsolved. To shed further light on them, researchers have explored a variety of related notions and generalizations. In this paper, we clarify relations among several of these notions, most notably connected domination and induced outerplanar subgraphs, and investigate the corresponding open problems. Furthermore, we construct an infinite family of plane triangulations of order $n$ whose connected domination number exceeds $n/3$. This construction gives a negative answer to a question of Bradshaw et al. [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 36 (2022) 1416-1435], who asked whether the maxleaf number of every plane triangulation of order $n$ is at least $2n/3$. We also obtain new results on induced subgraphs with bounded treewidth and induced outerplanar subgraphs.</description>
