      <title>Nijenhuis operators on Banach fibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the infinite-dimensional Banach setting, we consider general smooth Banach fibrations $\tau:M\to M_0$ and `$(1,1)$-tensors' $N:TM\to TM$ that are projectable (in the obvious sense) onto Nijenhuis operators $N_0:TM_0\to TM_0$ on $M_0$. We prove that the vanishing of the Nijenhuis torsion of $N_0$ is equivalent to the fact that the Nijenhuis torsion of $N$ takes only vertical values, i.e., values in $ker(T\tau)$. Consequences for almost complex structures on (real) Banach manifolds are also derived. As canonical examples, we define tangent lifts $d_T(N_0):TT M_0\to TT M_0$ of Nijenhuis operators $N_0$ in the Banach category, and prove that they are automatically projectable for the canonical fibrations $\tau_{M_0}:TM_0\to M_0$. Finally, we comment on the projectability in the case of Banach homogeneous manifolds $\tau:G\to G/K$, studied recently by some authors.</description>

      <title>On Hamiltonian stationarity of twisted Lagrangian tori in ${\mathbb{C}}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chekanov's exotic tori have been playing an important role in symplectic geometry as they are the only known examples of Lagrangian tori in ${\mathbb{C}}^2$ that are not Hamiltonian isotopic to a product torus. In this paper, we explore the differential geometry of a wider range of tori constructed by twisting simple closed planar curves, which include both certain product tori and Chekanov's exotic tori. In particular, we investigate the minimality of area of such twisted tori under Hamiltonian deformations and show that the only minimal twisted tori are the product ones. This tells us that Chekanov's exotic tori are not area minimal in their Hamiltonian isotopy classes.</description>

      <title>First eigenvalue and nodal domains of the drift Laplacian on symmetric self-shrinkers in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider $\mathbb{R}^3$ equipped with the Euclidean metric and the Gaussian measure. Let $\Sigma$ be a complete embedded self-shrinker in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with the induced metric and weighted measure, and let $\lambda_1$ denote the first eigenvalue of the drift Laplacian in the weighted $L^2$ space. Inspired by Choe and Soret's estimate of the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on symmetric minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^3$, we prove that $\lambda_1$= 1/2 for self-shrinkers invariant under the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_{g+1}$ or the prismatic group $\mathbb{D}_{g+1}\times \mathbb{Z}_2$. In particular, this holds for known self-shrinkers confirming a universal spectral property tied to their symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a CR-invariant equation for vanishing $E_1$ surfaces in the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group. This is shown to be a hyperbolic equation. We prove the local uniqueness theorem for an initial value problem and classify all such global surfaces with rotational symmetry. We also show that the Clifford torus in the CR 3-sphere is not a local minimizer of $E_1$ by computing the second variation.</description>

      <title>The sigma invariant of the $n$ torus, the K3 surface, and Euclidean and elliptic 3d manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the space of isometric embeddings $f_g$ of metrics $g$ on a manifold $M^n$ into the standard $(\mb{S}^{\tn=\tn(n)},\tg)$, we consider the total exterior scalar curvature $\Theta_{f_g}(M)$, and squared $L^2$ norm of the mean curvature vector $\Phi_{f_g}(M)$ and second fundamental form $\Pi_{f_g}(M)$ functionals of $f_g$, respectively. Then $\mc{W}_{f_g}(M) =(1-\delta_{n,1})(n/(n-1)) \Theta_{f_{g}}(M) + \Phi_{f_{g)}}(M)$ and $\mc{D}_{f_g}(M)=(1-\delta_{n,1}) (1/(n-1))\Theta_{f_g}(M)+\Pi_{f_{g)}}(M)$ are functionals intrinsically defined in the space of metrics in the conformal class of $g$, and $\mc{S}_g(M):=\int s_g d\mu_g=\mc{W}_{f_g}(M)- \mc{D}_{f_g}(M)$. We extend the notions of $\sigma$ invariant and Kazdan-Warner type to manifolds of dimension $n\geq 1$. $M$ is a manifold of type II if, and only if, it admits a Ricci flat metric $g$ with minimal isometric embedding $f_g$ that minimizes $\mc{W}_{f_{g'}}(M)$ and $\mc{D}_{f_{g'}}(M)$ among metrics $g'$ in conformal classes $[g']$ with scalar flat representatives. We show that the torus $T^n$, the K3 surface, and any Euclidean 3d manifold are manifolds of Kazdan-Warner type II, exhibiting in each case the canonical Ricci flat $g$ that realizes the vanishing $\sigma$ invariant and said minimal value $\mc{W}_{f_g}(M)= \mc{D}_{f_g}(M)$, with Euclidean 3d manifolds of isomorphic $\pi_1$ being diffeomorphic iff the values of $\mc{W}_{f_g}(M)$ for their canonical $g$s are the same. An elliptic 3d manifold $(M,\Gamma_M)$ of underlying group $\pi_1(M)\cong \Gamma_M \subset \mb{S}\mb{O}(4)$ has $\sigma(M) =6(2\pi^2)^{\frac{2}{3}}/|\pi_1(M)|^{\frac{2}{3}}$, and if $(M,\Gamma_M)$ and $(M',\Gamma_{M'})$ are two of them of isomorphic $\pi_1$, $M$ is diffeomorphic to $M'$ iff the spaces of $\Gamma_M$ and $\Gamma_{M'}$ invariant homogeneous spherical harmonics of degree $|\pi_1|$ are the same.</description>

Abstract: In this work we provide a complete characterization of left-invariant symmetric Killing tensors on almost abelian Lie groups endowed with a left-invariant Riemannian metric. We show in particular that all such tensors are decomposable, in the sense that they can be expressed as a polynomial in the Killing vector fields and the Riemannian metric.</description>

      <title>Concavity of spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent breathtaking progress in the synthetic study of Lorentzian geometry, we investigate the local concavity of time separation functions on Finsler spacetimes as a Lorentzian counterpart to Busemann's convexity in metric geometry. We show that a Berwald spacetime is locally concave if and only if its flag curvature is nonnegative in timelike directions. We also give another characterization of nonnegative flag curvature by the convexity of future (or past) capsules, inspired by Krist\'aly--Kozma's result in the positive definite case. These characterizations are new even for Lorentzian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Kapranov $L_{\infty}[1]$ algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given any K\"ahler manifold $X$, Kapranov discovered an $L_\infty[1]$ algebra structure on $\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X(T^{1,0}_X)$. Motivated by this result, we introduce, as a generalization of $L_\infty[1]$ algebras, a notion of $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra, where $\mathfrak{R}$ is a differential graded commutative algebra with unit. We show that standard notions (such as quasi-isomorphism and linearization) and results (including homotopy transfer theorems) can be extended to this context. For instance, we provide a linearization theorem.
  As an application, we prove that, given any DG Lie algebroid $(\mathcal{L},Q_{\mathcal{L}})$ over a DG manifold $(\mathcal{M},Q)$, there exists an induced $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra structure on $\Gamma(\mathcal{L})$, where $\mathfrak{R}$ is the DG commutative algebra $(C^\infty(\mathcal{M}),Q)$ -- its unary bracket is $Q_{\mathcal{L}}$ while its binary bracket is a cocycle representative of the Atiyah class of the DG Lie algebroid. This $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra $\Gamma(\mathcal{L})$ is linearizable if and only if the Atiyah class of the DG Lie algebroid vanishes. However, the $L_\infty[1]$ ($\mathbb{K}$-)algebra $\Gamma(\mathcal{L})$ induced by this $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra is necessarily homotopy abelian.
  As a special case, we prove that, given any complex manifold $X$, the Kapranov $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra $\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X(T^{1,0}_X)$, where $\mathfrak{R}$ is the DG commutative algebra $(\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X,\bar{\partial})$, is linearizable if and only if the Atiyah class of the holomorphic tangent bundle $T_X$ vanishes. Nevertheless, the induced $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathbb{C}$-algebra structure on $\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X(T^{1,0}_X)$ is necessarily homotopy abelian.</description>

      <title>Curvature measures and the sub-Riemannian Gauss-Bonnet theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt a measure-theoretic perspective on the Riemannian approximation scheme proving a sub-Riemannian Gauss-Bonnet theorem for surfaces in 3D contact manifolds. We show that the zero-order term in the limit is a singular measure supported on isolated characteristic points. In particular, this provides a unified interpretation of previous results.
  Moreover we give natural geometric conditions under which our result holds, namely when the surface admits characteristic points of finite order of degeneracy. This notion, which we introduce, extends the concept of mildly degenerate characteristic points for the Heisenberg group.
  As a byproduct, we prove that the mean curvature around an isolated characteristic point of finite order of degeneracy is locally integrable. In particular, this positively answers a question for analytic surfaces in every analytic 3D contact manifold.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fermat's principle and Snell's law for cone structures and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermat's principle is fully generalized to the case where a smooth interface separates two cone structures -- Lorentz-Finsler lightcones -- representing wave propagation in a potentially inhomogeneous, anisotropic, time-dependent and discontinuous medium. The interface, wave source and receiver are assumed to be a hypersurface, a submanifold and a curve in the spacetime, respectively, of any causal character. For a trajectory to fullfil Fermat's principle -- i.e., to be a critical point of the arrival time functional -- its direction must change at the interface, obeying a precise condition that generalizes Snell's law of refraction when the wave crosses the interface, or the law of reflection when it remains in a single medium. Both laws are analyzed in detail to establish the conditions ensuring the existence and uniqueness of refracted and reflected trajectories, and to determine whether they actually minimize the arrival time. Applications to Zermelo's navigation problem and the determination of geodesics in discretized spacetimes are also emphasized.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Monge-Amp\`ere Equation on a Cylinder: Well-Posedness and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a rigorous analytic framework for the hyperbolic Monge-Amp\`ere equation on strip-like domains, which model wrinkled patterns in thin elastic sheets. Our work addresses the rigid side of the classical rigidity-flexibility dichotomy by defining this regime not by high smoothness, but by the more fundamental property of partial convexity. The hodograph transformation is the natural tool for this setting, as its validity is predicated on partial convexity. It converts the nonlinear Monge-Amp\`ere equation into a linear damped wave equation, allowing us to formulate a well-posed Cauchy-Goursat problem. A key challenge is the corner singularity that arises where characteristic and non-characteristic boundary data meet. To resolve this, we develop a parametrix-corrector decomposition that captures the solution's inherent singular behavior. This method recasts the problem as a singular Volterra integral equation, for which we prove the existence and uniqueness of a new class of hodograph weak solutions. Finally, we derive energy estimates to establish the quantitative stability of these rigid solutions under perturbations of the underlying curvature function.</description>

      <title>Geometric Learning of Canonical Parameterizations of $2D$-curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations, rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a $2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link: $\href{https://github.com/GiLonga/Geometric-Learning}{https://github.com/GiLonga/Geometric-Learning}$.

      <title>Bismut torsion parallel metrics with constant holomorphic sectional curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An old conjecture in non-K\"ahler geometry states that, if a compact Hermitian manifold has constant holomorphic sectional curvature, then the metric must be K\"ahler (when the constant is non-zero) or Chern flat (when the constant is zero). It is known to be true in complex dimension $2$ by the work of Balas and Gauduchon in 1985 (when the constant is negative or zero) and Apostolov, Davidov and Muskarov in 1996 (when the constant is positive). In dimension $3$ or higher, the conjecture is only known in some special cases, such as the locally conformally K\"ahler case (when the constant is negative or zero) by the work of Chen, Chen and Nie, or for complex nilmanifolds with nilpotent $J$ by the work of Li and the second named author.
  In this note, we confirm the above conjecture for all non-balanced Bismut torsion parallel (BTP) manifolds. Here the BTP condition means that the Bismut connection has parallel torsion. In particular, the conjecture is valid for all Vaisman manifolds.</description>

      <title>Killing (Super)Algebras Associated to Connections on Spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalise the notion of a Killing superalgebra, which arises in the physics literature on supergravity, to general dimension, signature and choice of spinor module and Dirac current. We also allow for Lie algebras as well as superalgebras, capturing a set of examples previously defined using geometric Killing spinors on higher-dimensional spheres. Our definition requires a connection on a spinor bundle - provided by supersymmetry transformations in the supergravity examples and by the Killing spinor equation on the spheres - and we obtain a set of sufficient conditions on such a connection for the Killing (super)algebra to exist. We show that these Lie (super)algebras are filtered deformations of graded subalgebras of (a generalisation of) the Poincar\'e superalgebra and then study such deformations abstractly using Spencer cohomology. In the highly supersymmetric Lorentzian case, we describe the filtered subdeformations which are of the appropriate form to arise as Killing superalgebras, lay out a classification scheme for their odd-generated subalgebras and prove that, under certain technical conditions, there exist homogeneous Lorentzian spin manifolds on which these deformations are realised as Killing superalgebras. Our results generalise previous work in the 11-dimensional supergravity literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide some examples of Killing superalgebras on 2-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifolds within the theoretical framework established in [SIGMA 21 (2025), 081, 61 pages, arXiv:2409.11306]. We compute the Spencer cohomology group $\mathsf{H}^{2,2}(\mathfrak{s}_-;\mathfrak{s})$ and filtered deformations of the non-chiral flat model (Euclidean and Poincar\'e) superalgebra $\mathfrak{s}$ for various Dirac currents and show these arise as Killing superalgebras for (imaginary) geometric Killing and skew-Killing spinors in both Riemannian and Lorentzian signature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of a Jacobi manifold is a natural generalization of that of a Poisson manifold. A Jacobi manifold has a natural foliation in which each leaf has either a contact structure or a locally conformal symplectic structure. In this paper, we study a characteristic class called the Godbillon-Vey class for Jacobi manifolds with regular foliation and express it explicitly in terms of Jacobi structures.</description>

      <title>The structure and rigidiy of FBCMC hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the combination of strict positivity of $k$-tri-Ricci curvature with non-negative $3$-intermediate Ricci curvature forces rigidity of two-sided stable free boundary minimal hypersurface in a 5-manifold with bounded geometry and weakly convex boundary. This improves the result of Wu \cite{Wuyujie2023} to 5-dimensions and also extends the method of Hong-Yan \cite{Hong-cmc nonexis} to the free boundary case. We give a characterization of one-endedness for weakly stable free boundary constant mean curvature(FBCMC) hypersurfaces, which is an extension of Cheng-Cheung-Zhou \cite{Cheng-Cheung-Zhou2008}.</description>

      <title>Expanding Ricci solitons and Higgs bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the long-time behavior of Ricci flows that collapse with bounded curvature, we study expanding Ricci solitons with nilpotent symmetry on vector bundles over a closed manifold. We prove that, under mild assumptions that are satisfied by Ricci flow limits, the equations dimension-reduce to the so-called twisted harmonic-Einstein equations. When the base is a surface, we establish a correspondence between solutions of the latter and a class of G-Higgs bundles. This allows us to produce infinite families of new examples that are not locally homogeneous, and in particular to obtain a complete description in dimension 4. We also show that all our examples admit Einstein one-dimensional extensions.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Poisson geometry, totally geodesic foliations and Jacobi-Jordan algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce symmetric Poisson structures as pairs consisting of a symmetric bivector field and a torsion-free connection satisfying an integrability condition analogous to that in usual Poisson geometry. Equivalent conditions in Poisson geometry have inequivalent analogues in symmetric Poisson geometry and we distinguish between symmetric and strong symmetric Poisson structures. We prove that symmetric Poisson structures correspond to locally geodesically invariant distributions together with a characteristic metric, whereas strong symmetric Poisson structures correspond to totally geodesic foliations together with a leaf metric and a leaf connection. We introduce, using the Patterson-Walker metric, a dynamics on the cotangent bundle and show its connection to symmetric Poisson geometry, the parallel transport equation and the Newtonian equation for conservative systems. Finally, we prove that linear symmetric Poisson structures are in correspondence with Jacobi-Jordan algebras, whereas strong symmetric correspond to those that are moreover associative.</description>

      <title>Area minimizing hypersurfaces modulo $p$: a geometric free-boundary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.08135v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider area minimizing $m$-dimensional currents $\mathrm{mod}(p)$ in complete $C^2$ Riemannian manifolds $\Sigma$ of dimension $m+1$. For odd moduli we prove that, away from a closed rectifiable set of codimension $2$, the current in question is, locally, the union of finitely many smooth minimal hypersurfaces coming together at a common $C^{1,\alpha}$ boundary of dimension $m-1$, and the result is optimal. For even $p$ such structure holds in a neighborhood of any point where at least one tangent cone has $(m-1)$-dimensional spine. These structural results are indeed the byproduct of a theorem that proves (for any modulus) uniqueness and decay towards such tangent cones. The underlying strategy of the proof is inspired by the techniques developed by Leon Simon in "Cylindrical tangent cones and the singular set of minimal submanifolds" (J. Diff. Geom. 1993) in a class of multiplicity one stationary varifolds. The major difficulty in our setting is produced by the fact that the cones and surfaces under investigation have arbitrary multiplicities ranging from $1$ to $\lfloor \frac{p}{2}\rfloor$.</description>

      <title>Formation of quiescent big bang singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawking's singularity theorem says that cosmological solutions arising from initial data with positive mean curvature have a past singularity. However, the nature of the singularity remains unclear. We therefore ask: If the initial hypersurface has sufficiently large mean curvature, does the curvature necessarily blow up towards the singularity?
  In case the eigenvalues of the expansion-normalized Weingarten map are everywhere distinct and satisfy a certain algebraic condition (which in 3+1 dimensions is equivalent to them being positive), we prove that this is the case in the CMC Einstein-non-linear scalar field setting. More specifically, we associate a set of geometric expansion-normalized quantities to any initial data set with positive mean curvature. These quantities are expected to converge, in the quiescent setting, in the direction of crushing big bang singularities. Our main result says that if the mean curvature is large enough, relative to an appropriate Sobolev norm of these geometric quantities, and if the algebraic condition is satisfied, then a quiescent (as opposed to oscillatory) big bang singularity with curvature blow-up forms. This provides a stable regime of big bang formation without requiring proximity to any particular class of background solutions.
  An important recent result by Fournodavlos, Rodnianski and Speck demonstrates stable big bang formation for all the spatially flat and spatially homogeneous solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations satisfying the algebraic condition. Here we obtain analogous stability results for any solution inducing data at the singularity, in the sense introduced by the third author, in particular generalizing the aforementioned result. Moreover, we are able to prove both future and past global non-linear stability of a large class of spatially locally homogeneous solutions.</description>

      <title>A family of instanton-invariants for four-manifolds and their relation to Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13285v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article provides a review of the gauge-theoretic approach to Khovanov homology, framed in terms of a generalisation of Witten's original proposal. Concretely, the physical arguments underlying Witten's insights suggest that there is a one-parameter family of Haydys-Witten instanton Floer homology groups $HF_{\theta}(W^4)$ for four-manifolds. At the heart of the proposal is a systematic investigation of the dimensional reductions of the Haydys-Witten equations. It is shown that on the five-dimensional cylinder $M^5=\mathbb{R}_s\times W^4$ with nowhere-vanishing vector field $v=\cos\theta\, \partial_s+\sin\theta\, w$, the Haydys-Witten equations provide flow equations for the $\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations on $W^4$. Similar reductions to lower dimensions include the twisted extended Bogomolny equations on three-manifolds and the twisted octonionic Nahm equations on one-manifolds, whose solutions provide natural boundary conditions along the boundary and corners of $W^4$. These reductions determine the indicial roots of the Haydys-Witten and $\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations with twisted Nahm-pole boundary conditions, which are required to establish elliptic regularity. Motivated by these insights, the groups $HF_{\theta}(W^4)$ are defined in analogy with Yang-Mills instanton Floer theory: solutions of the $\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations on $W^4$ modulo Haydys-Witten instantons on the cylinder $\mathbb{R}_s\times W^4$ interpolating between them. The relation to knot invariants observed by Witten arises when the four-manifold is the geometric blow-up $W^4=[X^3\times\mathbb{R}^+,K]$ along a knot $K\subset X^3\times{0}$ in its three-dimensional boundary. This yields a precise restatement of Witten's conjecture as the equality between $HF^\bullet_{\pi/2}([S^3\times\mathbb{R}^+,K])$ and Khovanov homology $Kh^\bullet(K)$.</description>

      <title>A Review on Riemannian Metric Learning: Closer to You than You Imagine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Riemannian metric learning is an emerging field in machine learning, unlocking new ways to encode complex data structures beyond traditional distance metric learning. While classical approaches rely on global distances in Euclidean space, they often fall short in capturing intrinsic data geometry. Enter Riemannian metric learning: a powerful generalization that leverages differential geometry to model the data according to their underlying Riemannian manifold. This approach has demonstrated remarkable success across diverse domains, from causal inference and optimal transport to generative modeling and representation learning. In this review, we bridge the gap between classical metric learning and Riemannian geometry, providing a structured and accessible overview of key methods, applications, and recent advances. We argue that Riemannian metric learning is not merely a technical refinement but a fundamental shift in how we think about data representations. Thus, this review should serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring Riemannian metric learning and convince them that it is closer to them than they might imagine-both in theory and in practice.</description>

      <title>Loop Hori Formulae for T-duality and Twisted Bismut-Chern Character</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to establish the loop space formulation of T-duality in the presence of background flux. In particular, we construct a loop space analogue of the Hori formula, termed \textbf{the loop Hori map}, and demonstrate that it induces a quasi-isomorphism between the exotic twisted equivariant cohomologies on the free loop spaces of the T-dual sides. Spacetime, when viewed as the constant loops, is a submanifold of loop space. The duality that we prove on loop space restricts to the T-duality with $H$-flux on spacetime. This significantly refines the earlier work of the authors in 2015 where T-duality was established after localisation to the base space. The construction of the loop Hori map is an application of our generalization of the Bismut--Chern character in 2015, originally introduced in the loop space interpretation of the Atiyah--Singer index theorem by Atiyah--Witten and Bismut.</description>
