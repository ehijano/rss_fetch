      <title>Spread complexity and localization in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for investigating wave function spreading in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum systems using spread complexity and spread entropy. We consider a tight-binding chain with complex on-site potentials at the boundary sites. In the $\mathcal{PT}$-unbroken phase, the wave function is delocalized. We find that in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, it becomes localized on one edge of the tight-binding lattice. This localization is a realization of the non-Hermitian skin effect. Localization in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase is observed both in the lattice chain basis and the Krylov basis. Spread entropy, entropic complexity, and a further measure that we term the Krylov inverse participation ratio probe the dynamics of wave function spreading and quantify the strength of localization probed in the Krylov basis. The number of Krylov basis vectors required to store the information of the state reduces with the strength of localization. Our results demonstrate how measures in Krylov space can be used to characterize the non-hermitian skin effect and its localization phase transition.</description>

      <title>Corners and Islands in the S-matrix Bootstrap of the Open Superstring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We bootstrap the Veneziano superstring amplitude in 10 dimensions from the bottom-up. Starting with the most general maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills EFT, we input information about the lowest-lying massive states, which we assume contribute via tree-level exchanges to the 4-point amplitude. We show the following: (1) if there is only a single state at the lowest mass, it must be a scalar. (2) Assuming a string-inspired gap between the mass of this scalar and any other massive states, the allowed region of Wilson coefficients has a new sharp corner where the Veneziano amplitude is located. (3) Upon fixing the next massive state to be a vector, the EFT bounds have a one-parameter family of corners; these would correspond to models with linear Regge trajectories of varying slopes, one of which is the open superstring. (4) When the ratio between the massive scalar coupling and the $\text{tr}\, F^4$ coefficient is fixed to its string value, the spin and mass of the second massive state is determined by the bootstrap and the Veneziano amplitude is isolated on a small island in parameter space. Finally, we compare with other recent bootstraps approaches, both the pion model and imposing Regge-inspired maximal spin constraints.</description>

      <title>BPS complexes and Chern--Simons theories from $G$-structures in gauge theory and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a variety of physical systems in which one has states that can be thought of as generalised instantons. These include Yang--Mills theories on manifolds with a torsion-free $G$-structure, analogous gravitational instantons and certain supersymmetric solutions of ten-dimensional supergravity, using their formulation as generalised $G$-structures on Courant algebroids. We provide a universal algebraic construction of a complex, which we call the BPS complex, that computes the infinitesimal moduli space of the instanton as one of its cohomologies. We call a class of these spinor type complexes, which are closely connected to supersymmetric systems, and show how their Laplacians have nice properties. In the supergravity context, the BPS complex becomes a double complex, in a way that corresponds to the left- and right-moving sectors of the string, and becomes much like the double complex of $(p,q)$-forms on a K\"ahler manifold. If the BPS complex has a symplectic inner product, one can write down an associated linearised BV Chern--Simons theory, which reproduces several classic examples in gauge theory. We discuss applications to (quasi-)topological string theories and heterotic superpotential functionals, whose quadratic parts can also be constructed naturally from the BPS complex.</description>

      <title>Field Theory for Superconducting Branes and Generalized Particle-Vortex Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a field theory of closed $p$-brane $C_p^{}$ interacting with a $(p+1)$-form gauge field $A_{p+1}^{}$. This is a generalization of the Ginzburg-Landau theory (Abelian-Higgs model) for superconducting particles to higher-dimensional superconducting branes. A higher-form gauge invariant action is constructed by utilizing the Area derivative, which is a higher-dimensional generalization of the ordinary derivative. We find that the fundamental phenomena of superconductivity, such as the Meisser effect, topological defects, topological order, are naturally extended in the brane-field theory. We explicitly construct a topologically non-trivial static configuration that is characterized by the first homotopy group. Then, we calculate the low-energy effective theory in the presence of the topological defect and find that it is described by a BF-type topological field theory coupled with the world-volume of the topological defect. We also conjecture an infra-red duality between the superconducting brane-field model and dual brane-field model with a global $\mathrm{U}(1)$ higher-form symmetry as a generalization of the Particle-Vortex duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectrum, unitarity bound and holographic central charge of spin-2 operators in a warped $\text{AdS}_2 \times \text{S}^2 \times \text{T}^4 \times \mathcal{I}_\psi \times \mathcal{I}_\rho$ background in the Type IIB theory. We were able to identify a class of solutions that is completely independent of the functions that define the background solution. We comment on the relation of our results to the previous ones in the literature.</description>

      <title>Constructing tree amplitudes of scalar EFT from double soft theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well known Adler zero can fully determine tree amplitudes of non-linear sigma model (NLSM), but fails to fix tree pion amplitudes with higher-derivative interactions. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose a new method based on exploiting the double soft theorem for scalars, which can be applied to a wider range. A remarkable feature of this method is, we only assume the universality of soft behavior at the beginning, and determine the explicit form of double soft factor in the process of constructing amplitudes. To test the applicability, we use this method to construct tree NLSM amplitudes and tree amplitudes those pions in NLSM couple to bi-adjoint scalars. We also construct the simplest pion amplitudes which receive leading higher-derivative correction, with arbitrary number of external legs. All resulted amplitudes are formulated as universal expansions to appropriate basis.</description>

      <title>On universal splittings of tree-level particle and string scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the newly discovered universal splitting behavior for tree-level scattering amplitudes of particles and strings~\cite{Cao:2024gln}: when a set of Mandelstam variables (and Lorentz products involving polarizations for gluons/gravitons) vanish, the $n$-point amplitude factorizes as the product of two lower-point {\it currents} with $n{+}3$ external legs in total. We refer to any such subspace of the kinematic space of $n$ massless momenta as ``2-split kinematics", where the scattering potential for string amplitudes and the corresponding scattering equations for particle amplitudes nicely split into two parts. Based on these, we provide a systematic and detailed study of the splitting behavior for essentially all ingredients which appear as integrands for open- and closed-string amplitudes as well as Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formulas, including Parke-Taylor factors, correlators in superstring and bosonic string theories, and CHY integrands for a variety of amplitudes of scalars, gluons and gravitons. These results then immediately lead to the splitting behavior of string and particle amplitudes in a wide range of theories, including bi-adjoint $\phi^3$ (with string extension known as $Z$ and $J$ integrals), non-linear sigma model, Dirac-Born-Infeld, the special Galileon, \textit{etc.}, as well as Yang-Mills and Einstein gravity (with bosonic and superstring extensions). Our results imply and extend some other factorization behavior of tree amplitudes considered recently, including smooth splittings~\cite{Cachazo:2021wsz} and factorizations near zeros~\cite{Arkani-Hamed:2023swr}, to all these theories. A special case of splitting also yields soft theorems for gluons/gravitons as well as analogous soft behavior for Goldstone particles near their Adler zeros.</description>

      <title>Higher-Matter and Landau-Ginzburg Theory of Higher-Group Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-matter is defined by higher-representation of a symmetry algebra, such as the $p$-form symmetries, higher-group symmetries or higher-categorical symmetries. In this paper, we focus on the cases of higher-group symmetries, which are formulated in terms of the strictification of weak higher-groups. We systematically investigate higher-matter charged under 2-group symmetries, defined by automorphism 2-representations. Furthermore, we construct a Lagrangian formulation of such higher-matter fields coupled to 2-group gauge fields in the path space of the spacetime manifold. We interpret such model as the Landau-Ginzburg theory for 2-group symmetries, and discuss the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 2-group symmetries under this framework. Examples of discrete and continuous 2-groups are discussed. Interestingly, we find that a non-split 2-group symmetry can admit an SSB to a split 2-group symmetry, where the Postnikov class is trivialized. We also briefly discuss the strictification of weak 3-groups, weak 3-group gauge fields and 3-representations in special cases.</description>

      <title>Self-resonance after inflation: The case of $\alpha$-attractor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to explain the amplification of curvature perturbations on small scales arising from the phenomenon of self-resonance. By making a series expansion of the inflationary potential and employing perturbative techniques to solve for the inflaton field, we reformulate the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation into a Hill equation. Then, we derive expressions for the Floquet exponents corresponding to a potential having both cubic and quartic terms in its expansion. Our analytical results are then compared with numerical computations. Moreover, we propose potential applications including the generation of Primordial Black Holes, Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves, and Oscillons.</description>

      <title>Holographic stress tensor correlators on higher genus Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive study of holographic stress tensor correlators on general Riemann surfaces, extending beyond the previously well-studied torus cases to explore higher genus conformal field theories (CFTs) within the framework of the Anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. We develop a methodological approach to compute holographic stress tensor correlators, employing the Schottky uniformization technique to address the handlebody solutions for higher genus Riemann surfaces. Through rigorous calculations, we derive four-point stress tensor correlators, alongside recurrence relations for higher-point correlators, within the $\mathrm{AdS}_3/\mathrm{CFT}_2$ context. Additionally, our research delves into the holography of cutoff $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ spaces, offering novel insights into the lower-point correlators of the $T\bar{T}$-deformed theories on higher genus Riemann surfaces up to the first deformation order.</description>

      <title>Towards bit threads in general gravitational spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of the generalized entanglement wedge was recently proposed by Bousso and Penington, which states that any bulk gravitational region $a$ possesses an associated generalized entanglement wedge $E(a) \supset a$ on a static Cauchy surface $M$ in general gravitational spacetimes, where $E(a)$ may contain an entanglement island $I(a)$. It suggests that the fine-grained entropy for bulk region $a$ is given by the generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$. Motivated by this proposal, we extend the quantum bit thread description to general gravitational spacetimes, no longer limited to the AdS spacetime. By utilizing the convex optimization techniques, a dual flow description for the generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$ of a bulk gravitational region $a$ is established on the static Cauchy surface $M$, such that $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$ is equal to the maximum flux of any flow that starts from the boundary $\partial M$ and ends at bulk region $a$, or equivalently, the maximum number of bit threads that connect the boundary $\partial M$ to the bulk region $a$. In addition, the nesting property of flows is also proved. Thus the basic properties of the entropy for bulk regions, i.e. the monotonicity, subadditivity, Araki-Lieb inequality and strong subadditivity, can be verified from flow perspectives by using properties of flows, such as the nesting property. Moreover, in max thread configurations, we find that there exists some lower bounds on the bulk entanglement entropy of matter fields in the region $E(a)\setminus a$, particularly on an entanglement island region $I(a) \subset (E(a)\setminus a)$, as required by the existence of a nontrivial generalized entanglement wedge. Our quantum bit thread formulation may provide a way to investigate more fine-grained entanglement structures in general spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the particle creation of a harmonic oscillator using the classical stochastic method. This method reproduces all the vacuum expectation values in quantum theory. We prepare the vacuum state at the initial time and evolve it over time using Langevin equations of motion. By averaging over the ensemble, we compute the energy of the state at the final time and determine the amount of particles created. We verify that the particle creation agrees with predictions from quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for analog Hawking effect in dielectric media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the analog Hawking radiation for dielectric media, we analyze a toy-model and also the 2D reduction of the Hopfield model for a specific monotone and realistic profile for the refractive index. We are able to provide exact solutions, which do not require any weak dispersion approximation. The theory of Fuchsian ordinary differential equations is the basic tool for recovering exact solutions, which are rigoroulsy identified, and involve the so-called generalized hypergeometric functions $_4F_3(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3,\alpha_4;\beta_1,\beta_2,\beta_3;z)$. A complete set of connection formulas are available, both for the subcritical case and for the transcritical one, and also the Stokes phenomenon occurring in the problem is fully discussed. From the physical point of view, we focus on the problem of thermality. Under suitable conditions, the Hawking temperature is deduced, and we show that it is in fully agreement with the expression deduced in other frameworks under various approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that tree-level and one-loop Mellin space correlators in anti-de Sitter space obey certain difference equations, which are the direct analog to the differential equations for Feynman loop integrals in the flat space. Finite-difference relations, which we refer to as ``summation-by-parts relations'', in parallel with the integration-by-parts relations for Feynman loop integrals, are derived to reduce the integrals to a basis. We illustrate the general methodology by explicitly deriving the difference equations and summation-by-parts relations for various tree-level and one-loop Witten diagrams up to the four-point bubble level.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore several features related to the newly discovered hidden amplitude zeros arXiv:2312.16282, which describes the vanishing of scattering amplitudes on special external kinematics. We prove the conjecture that amplitude zeros uniquely fix Tr $\phi^3$, by showing that any amplitude can be divided into special subsets, which independently satisfy the zero condition. We further prove that the same subsets satisfy a previously unknown secret enhancement under Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten shifts, which turns out to be equivalent to the amplitude zero condition. Similar but weaker statements also hold for non-linear sigma model, while for Yang-Mills, when imposed together with color-kinematic duality, amplitude zeros uniquely fix the different tensor components of gluon amplitudes. This direction suggests a straightforward avenue for understanding previous uniqueness results, as well as the connections between naively independent properties of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Spectral flow and the conformal block expansion for strings in AdS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of spectrally flowed four-point functions in the SL(2,$\mathbb{R}$) WZW model, focusing on their conformal block decomposition. Dei and Eberhardt conjectured a general formula relating these observables to their unflowed counterparts. Although the latter are not known in closed form, their conformal block expansion has been formally established. By combining this information with the integral transform that encodes the effect of spectral flow, we show how to describe a considerable number of $s$-channel exchanges, including cases with both flowed and unflowed intermediate states. For all such processes, we compute the normalization of the corresponding conformal blocks in terms of products of the recently derived flowed three-point functions with arbitrary spectral flow charges. Our results constitute a highly non-trivial consistency check, thus strongly supporting the aforementioned conjecture, and establishing its computational power.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of planar conformal gauge theory, we study five-point correlation functions between the interaction Lagrangian and four of the lightest single-trace, gauge-invariant scalar primaries. After performing two light-cone OPEs, we express this correlator in terms of the three-point functions between two leading-twist spinning operators and the Lagrangian. For finite values of spin, we compute these structure constants in perturbation theory up to two loops in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory. Large values of spin are captured by null polygon kinematics, where we use dualities with null polygon Wilson loops as well as factorization properties to bootstrap the universal behavior of the structure constants at all loops. We find explicit maps that relate the Lagrangian structure constants with the leading-twist anomalous dimension. From the large-spin map, we recover the cusp anomalous dimension at strong and weak coupling, including genus-one terms.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks Assisted Metropolis-Hastings for Bayesian Estimation of Critical Exponent on Elliptic Black Hole Solution in 4D Using Quantum Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical gravitational collapse is known to produce continuous self-similar solutions characterized by the Choptuik critical exponent, $\gamma$. We examine all solutions within the complete domains of the linear perturbation equations, considering the numerical measurement errors. Specifically, we study quantum perturbation theory for the four-dimensional Einstein-axion-dilaton system of the elliptic class of $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ transformations. We developed a novel artificial neural network-assisted Metropolis-Hastings based on quantum perturbation theory to find the critical exponent in a Bayesian framework. Unlike existing methods, this new probabilistic approach identifies the available deterministic solutions and explores the range of physically distinguishable critical exponents that may arise due to numerical measurement errors.</description>

      <title>More Axion Stars from Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if dark matter consists of QCD axions in the post-inflationary scenario more than ten percent of it efficiently collapses into Bose stars at matter-radiation equality. Such a result is mostly independent of the present uncertainties on the axion mass. This large population of solitons, with asteroid masses and Earth-Moon distance sizes, might plausibly survive until today, with potentially interesting implications for phenomenology and experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Precise interpretations of traditional fine-tuning measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover two precise interpretations of traditional electroweak fine-tuning (FT) measures that were historically missed. (i) a statistical interpretation: the traditional FT measure shows the change in plausibility of a model in which a parameter was exchanged for the $Z$ boson mass relative to an untuned model in light of the $Z$ boson mass measurement. (ii) an information-theoretic interpretation: the traditional FT measure shows the exponential of the extra information, measured in nats, relative to an untuned model that you must supply about a parameter in order to fit the $Z$ mass. We derive the mathematical results underlying these interpretations, and explain them using examples from weak scale supersymmetry. These new interpretations shed fresh light on historical and recent studies using traditional FT measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix elements of Wilson-line dressed operators play a central role in the factorization of soft and collinear modes in gauge theories. When expressed using spinor helicity variables, these so-called form factors admit a classification starting from a Maximally Helicity Violating configuration, in close analogy with gauge theory amplitudes. We show that a single-line complex momentum shift can be used to derive recursion relations that efficiently compute these helicity form factors at tree-level: a combination of lower point form factors and on-shell amplitudes serve as the input building blocks. We obtain novel compact expressions for the $1\to 2$ and $1\to 3$ splitting functions in QCD, which also serves to validate our methods.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Asymmetry in non-Abelian Anyonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons, a promising platform for fault-tolerant topological quantum computation, adhere to the charge super-selection rule (cSSR), which imposes restrictions on physically allowed states and operations. However, the ramifications of cSSR and fusion rules in anyonic quantum information theory remain largely unexplored. In this study, we unveil that the information-theoretic characteristics of anyons diverge fundamentally from those of non-anyonic systems such as qudits, bosons, and fermions and display intricate structures. In bipartite anyonic systems, pure states may have different marginal spectra, and mixed states may contain pure marginal states. More striking is that in a pure entangled state, parties may lack equal access to entanglement. This entanglement asymmetry is manifested in quantum teleportation employing an entangled anyonic state shared between Alice and Bob, where Alice can perfectly teleport unknown quantum information to Bob, but Bob lacks this capability. These traits challenge conventional understanding, necessitating new approaches to characterize quantum information and correlations in anyons. We expect that these distinctive features will also be present in non-Abelian lattice gauge field theories. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of the information-theoretic aspects of anyons and may lead to realizations of quantum communication and cryptographic protocols where one party holds sway over the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the $4+n$ dimensional spacetimes among which one is the four dimensional physical Universe and the other is an n-dimensional sphere with constant radius in the framework of Lanczos-Lovelock gravity. We find that the curvature of extra dimensional sphere contributes a huge but negative energy density provided that its radius is sufficiently small, such as the scale of Planck length. Therefore, the huge positive vacuum energy, i.e. the large positive cosmological constant is exactly cancelled out by the curvature of extra sphere. In the mean time the higher order of Lanczos-Lovelock term contributes an observations-allowed small cosmological constant if the number of extra dimensions is sufficiently large, such as $n\approx{69}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Einstein gravity extended with quadratic curvature invariants, where the well-known Ricci-flat Taub-NUT black hole remains a solution. An analysis of the unstable Lichnerowicz modes in the Taub-NUT background enables us to identify the mass and NUT parameters (m,n) where new Taub-NUT black holes can emerge. We then adopt numerical technique to construct these new Taub-NUT black holes that bifurcate away from the Ricci-flat ones. Unlike the Ricci-flat Taub-NUT, there can exist two new black holes for an appropriate given temperature, making it a total of three if we include the Ricci-flat one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the full spacetime metric of a generalized uncertainty-inspired quantum black hole. We examine a previous model of the interior in this approach and show that extending its metric to the full spacetime leads to serious issues in the asymptotic region. To remedy this, we introduce an "improved scheme" mimicking a similar prescription used in loop quantum gravity, where the quantum parameters are made momentum-dependent. Under this scheme, we rework the interior of the black hole and extend it to the full spacetime. We find that the resulting metric is asymptotically flat and its associated Kretschmann scalar is regular everywhere. We also show that the null expansion and Raychaudhuri equation are regular everywhere in this spacetime, implying that the classical singularity is resolved.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on phenomenological emergent dark energy and barotropic dark matter characterized by a constant equation of state parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. This proposal is based on extensive research on the extended properties of dark matter in the context of a cosmological constant and the intriguing findings that have emerged from our exploration of dark matter properties within the context of PEDE in our previous studies. We then place constraints on this model in light of the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia supernovae, a prior on $H_0$ that based on the latest local measurement by Riess et al., and the combination of KiDS and the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (KiDS+VIKING-450). The results indicate a preference for a positive dark matter equation of state parameter at 68\% confidence level for CMB+BAO, CMB+BAO+Pantheon and CMB+BAO+Pantheon+$H_0$ datasets. Furthermore, the Hubble tension between all of the datasets we used with R22 is very close to those of the PEDE, and the $S_8$ tension between Planck 2018 and KiDS+VIKING-450 is reduced from 2.3$\sigma$ in the PEDE model to 0.4$\sigma$ in the new model. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that PEDE favors our new model with very strong evidence from all the datasets considered in this study. Consequently, we conclude that the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model is not a viable alternative to the PEDE model.</description>

Abstract: We review the description of classical gravitational scatterings of two compact objects by means of the eikonal framework. This encodes via scattering amplitudes both the motion of the bodies and the gravitational-wave signals that such systems produce. As an application, we combine the next-to-leading post-Minkowskian (PM) waveform derived in the post-Newtonian (PN) limit with the 4PM static loss due to the linear memory effect to reproduce known results for the total angular mometum loss in the center-of-mass frame up to $\mathcal O(G^4)$ and 2.5PN order. We also provide similar expressions for the change in the system's mass dipole, discussing the subtleties related to its sensitivity to the Coulombic components of the field and to the nonlinear memory effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic Skyrmion is described by one control parameter and one length scale. We study the two extreme limits of the control parameter -- infinitely large and vanishing - and find that the magnetic Skyrmion becomes a "restricted" magnetic Skyrmion and an O(3) sigma model lump, respectively. Depending on the potential under consideration, the restricted limit manifests differently. In the case of the Zeeman term, the restricted magnetic Skyrmion becomes a "supercompacton" that develops a discontinuity, whereas for the Zeeman term to the power 3/2 it becomes a normal compacton. Finally, we observe that the case of the Zeeman term squared, which can also be understood as a special combination of the Zeeman term and the easy-plane potential - realizable in the laboratory, the lump solution is an analytically exact solution for all values of the control parameter.</description>

      <title>Calculating Bayesian evidence for inflationary models using CONNECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian evidence is a standard method used for comparing the ability of different models to fit available data and is used extensively in cosmology. However, since the evidence calculation involves performing an integral of the likelihood function over the entire space of model parameters this can be prohibitively expensive in terms of both CPU and time consumption. For example, in the simplest $\Lambda$CDM model and using CMB data from the Planck satellite, the dimensionality of the model space is over 30 (typically 6 cosmological parameters and 28 nuisance parameters). Even the simplest possible model requires $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ calls to an Einstein--Boltzmann solver such as CLASS or CAMB and takes several days.
  Here we present calculations of Bayesian evidence using the CONNECT framework to calculate cosmological observables. We demonstrate that we can achieve results comparable to those obtained using Einstein--Boltzmann solvers, but at a minute fraction of the computational cost. As a test case, we then go on to compute Bayesian evidence ratios for a selection of slow-roll inflationary models.
  In the setup presented here, the total computation time is completely dominated by the likelihood function calculation which now becomes the main bottleneck for increasing computation speed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of achieving post-inflationary reheating exclusively through the gravitational interaction in Starobinsky inflation, which itself assumes nothing but gravity. We consider the possibility that the reheating sector couples to gravity via a non-minimal coupling. Our analysis is performed both in a perturbative and in a non-perturbative approach, where particle production is computed from Bogoliubov coefficients. Our findings indicate that, for sufficiently large non-minimal coupling ($\xi\gtrsim~\text{few}\times 10$), non-perturbative particle production allows for temperatures of order $10^{12}$ GeV to be reached while also ensuring that the Universe becomes radiation-dominated. This shows that the gravitational interaction could be the sole responsible for reheating the Universe after inflation, without the need to assume other ad hoc inflaton interactions.</description>

Abstract: We consider head-on collisions at critical coupling of vortices modelled by the Abelian-Higgs model. We investigate the 2-vortex scattering, whereby the vortices are excited by the shape mode causing fluctuations in the gauge-invariant quantities. When the vortices are excited with a sufficiently large amplitude the moduli space approximation fails, and we observe an interesting behaviour in which the vortices can become trapped in a quasi-bound state with multiple bounces. We perform a detailed investigation on the behaviour of these excited vortices and sample a phase space of solutions. Interestingly, we find a fractal structure dependent on the initial phase of the mode and velocity of the vortices.</description>

      <title>An explanation for the absence of echoes in black hole light curve autocorrelations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed radiation from hot gas accreting onto a black hole depends on both the details of the flow and the spacetime geometry. The lensing behavior of a black hole produces a distinctive pattern of autocorrelations within its photon ring that encodes its mass, spin, and inclination. In particular, the time autocorrelation of the light curve is expected to display a series of peaks produced by light echoes of the source, with each peak delayed by the characteristic time lapse $\tau$ between light echoes. However, such peaks are absent from the light curves of observed black holes. Here, we develop an analytical model for such light curves that demonstrates how, even though light echoes always exist in the signal, they do not produce autocorrelation peaks if the characteristic correlation timescale $\lambda_0$ of the source is greater than $\tau$. We validate our model against simulated light curves of a stochastic accretion model ray traced with a general-relativistic code, and then fit the model to an observed light curve for Sgr A*. We infer that $\lambda_0&gt;\tau$, providing an explanation for the absence of light echoes in the time autocorrelations of Sgr A* light curves. Our results highlight the importance for black hole parameter inference of spatially resolving the photon ring via future space-based interferometry.</description>

Abstract: In \cite{Kawasetsu:2018irs}, Kawasetsu proved that the simple W-algebra associated with a minimal nilpotent element $W_{k}(\mathfrak{g},f_\theta)$ is rational and $C_2$-cofinite for $\mathfrak{g}=D_4,E_6,E_7,E_8$ with non-admissible level $k=-h^\vee/6$. In this paper, we study ${W}_{k}(\mathfrak{g},f_\theta)$ algebra for $\mathfrak{g}=E_6,E_7,E_8$ with non-admissible level $k=-h^\vee/6+1$. We determine all irreducible (Ramond twisted) modules, compute their characters and find coset constructions and Hecke operator interpretations. These W-algebras are closely related to intermediate Lie algebras and intermediate vertex subalgebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homology theories categorifying quantum group link invariants are known to be governed by the representation theory of quiver Hecke algebras, also called KLRW algebras. Here we show that certain cylindrical KLRW algebras, relevant in particular for cylindrical generalizations of link homology theories, can be realized by Lagrangian Floer homology in multiplicative Coulomb branches. This confirms a homological mirror symmetry prediction of the first author.</description>

      <title>Translation symmetry restoration under random unitary dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finite parts of a large, locally interacting many-body system prepared out-of-equilibrium eventually equilibrate. Characterising the underlying mechanisms of this process and its timescales, however, is particularly hard as it requires to decouple universal features from observable-specific ones. Recently, new insight came by studying how certain symmetries of the dynamics that are broken by the initial state are restored at the level of the reduced state of a given subsystem. This provides a high level, observable-independent probe. Until now this idea has been applied to the restoration of internal symmetries, e.g. U(1) symmetries related to charge conservation. Here we show that that the same logic can be applied to the restoration of space-time symmetries, and hence can be used to characterise the relaxation of fully generic systems. We illustrate this idea by considering the paradigmatic example of "generic" many-body dynamics, i.e. a local random unitary circuit. We show that, surprisingly, the restoration of translation symmetry in these systems only happens on time-scales proportional to the subsystem's volume. In fact, for large enough subsystems the time of symmetry restoration becomes initial-state independent (as long as the latter breaks the symmetry at time zero) and coincides with the thermalisation time. For intermediate subsystems, however, one can observe the so-called "quantum Mpemba effect", where the state of the system restores a symmetry faster if it is initially more asymmetric.</description>

      <title>Nonminimal Couplings and the Forgotten Field of Axion Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.04179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the multifield dynamics of axion models nonminimally coupled to gravity. As usual, we consider a canonical $U(1)$ symmetry-breaking model in which the axion is the phase of a complex scalar field. If the complex scalar field has a nonminimal coupling to gravity, then the (oft-forgotten) radial component can drive a phase of inflation prior to an inflationary phase driven by the axion field. In this setup, the mass of the axion field is dependent on the radial field because of the nonminimal coupling, and the axion remains extremely light during the phase of radial inflation. As the radial field approaches the minimum of its potential, there is a transition to a second phase of inflation during which the axion field contributes a substantial fraction of the system's total energy density, yielding a phase of "natural inflation." This system exhibits ultra-light isocurvature perturbations, which are converted to adiabatic perturbations by a turning field-space trajectory. For models wherein the CMB pivot scale exited the horizon well before the turn, this acts to suppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, without generating CMB non-Gaussianity or observable isocurvature perturbations. Finally, we note that for certain parameters the interaction strength between axion and gauge fields can be suppressed during the first phase of inflation relative to its value during the second phase by several orders of magnitude. This decouples the constraints on the inflationary production of gauge fields (e.g., from primordial black holes) from the constraints on their production during (p)reheating.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Euclidean conformal integrals for an arbitrary number of points in any dimension are evaluated. Conformal transformations in the Euclidean space can be formulated as the Moebius group in terms of Clifford algebras. This is used to interpret conformal integrals as functions on the configuration space of points on the Euclidean space, solving linear differential equations, which, in turn, is related to toric GKZ systems. Explicit series solutions for the conformal integrals are obtained using toric methods as GKZ hypergeometric functions. The solutions are made symmetric under the action of permutation of the points, as expected of quantities on the configuration space of unordered points, using the monodromy-invariant unique Hermitian form. Consistency of the solutions among different number of points is shown.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we systematically derive explicit expressions for the Poincar\'e Group generators on arbitrary-rank tensors and spinor-tensors in $D=3+1$ and $D=2+1$ spacetimes, thus generalizing previous works in the literature for the groups $ISO(3,1)$ and $ISO(2,1)$. From the Casimir eigenvalue equations, we demonstrate in a model-independent way the Fierz-Pauli constraints for massive particles for spins $\mathfrak{s}=5/2$, 3, and 4 in $D=3+1$ and helicities $\alpha=5/2$, 3, and 4 in $D=2+1$ dimensions. We also comment on the demonstration of the Fierz-Pauli constraints for the general case of arbitrary spin (helicity).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a thermal scalar equation of motion (EOM) that takes into account curvature corrections for backgrounds supported by Ramond-Ramond fluxes. This can be used to obtain the Hagedorn temperature for type II string theory on AdS and pp-wave backgrounds. For Ramond-Ramond flux supported pp-waves we show that the proposed thermal scalar EOM reproduces the leading curvature correction in the Hagedorn temperature equation obtained from the type II string theory spectrum. Furthermore, we use the thermal scalar EOM to obtain curvature corrections to the Hagedorn temperature for the AdS$_5 \times S^5$ and AdS$_4 \times \mathbb{C} P^3$ backgrounds. These corrections match with strong coupling results of the integrable dual field theories, recently obtained by the Quantum Spectral Curve technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Wilson line defect half-indices of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric $SU(N)$ Chern-Simons theories of level $k\le -N$ with Neumann boundary conditions for the gauge fields, together with 2d Fermi multiplets and fundamental 3d chiral multiplets to cancel the gauge anomaly. We derive some exact results and also make some conjectures based on expansions of the $q$-series. We find several interesting connections with special functions known in the literature, including Rogers-Ramanujan functions for which we conjecture integral representations, and the appearance of Appell-Lerch sums for certain Wilson line half-index grand canonical ensembles which reveal an unexpected appearance of mock modular functions. We also find intriguing $q$-difference equations relating half-indices to Wilson line half-indices. Some of these results also have a description in terms of a dual theory with Dirichlet boundary conditions for the vector multiplet in the dual theory.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we bootstrapped the 4-point correlators on the 1D celestial circle using 3D symmetries in the Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory as constraints. We find that the dual inversion property is strong enough to replace the crossing symmetry condition when bootstrapping. We also give some results about the conformal block expansion coefficients which contain the spectrum and the leading multi-OPE of this celestial CFT. Finally, we find a non-local 2-particle operator from the multi-OPE at the leading OPE. Although we studied a specific theory, the methods used are valid for general cases.</description>

      <title>New Approach to Strongly Coupled N = 4 SYM via Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding a systematic expansion of the spectrum of free superstrings on AdS${}_5\times $S${}^5$, or equivalently strongly coupled N = 4 SYM in the planar limit, remains an outstanding challenge. No first principle string theory methods are readily available, instead the sole tool at our disposal is the integrability-based Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC). For example, through the QSC the first five orders in the strong coupling expansion of the conformal dimension of an infinite family of short operators have been obtained. However, when using the QSC at strong coupling one must often rely on numerics, and the existing methods for solving the QSC rapidly lose precision as we approach the strong coupling regime.
  In this paper, we introduce a new framework that utilises a novel set of QSC variables with a regular strong coupling expansion. We demonstrate how to use this approach to construct a new numerical algorithm that remains stable even at a 't Hooft coupling as large as $10^6$ (or g ~ 100). Employing this approach, we derive new analytic results for some states in the sl(2) sector and beyond. We present a new analytic prediction for a coefficient in the strong coupling expansion of the conformal dimension for the lowest trajectory at a given twist L. For non-lowest trajectories, we uncover a novel feature of mixing with operators outside the sl(2) sector, which manifests as a new type of analytic dependence on the twist.</description>

      <title>Path Integrals from Spacetime Quantum Actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.05383v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possibility of extending the canonical formulation of quantum mechanics (QM) to a space-time symmetric form has recently attracted wide interest. In this context, a recent proposal has shown that a spacetime symmetric many-body extension of the Page and Wootters mechanism naturally leads to the so-called Quantum Action (QA) operator, a quantum version of the action of classical mechanics. In this work, we focus on connecting the QA with the well-established Feynman's Path Integral (PI). In particular, we present a novel formalism which allows one to identify the "sum over histories" with a quantum trace, where the role of the classical action is replaced by the corresponding QA. The trace is defined in the extended Hilbert space resulting from assigning a conventional Hilbert space to each time slice and then taking their tensor product. The formalism opens the way to the application of quantum computation protocols to the evaluation of PIs and general correlation functions, and reveals that different representations of the PI arise from distinct choices of basis in the evaluation of the same trace expression. The Hilbert space embedding of the PIs also discloses a new approach to their continuum time limit. Finally, we discuss how the ensuing canonical-like version of QM inherits many properties from the PI formulation, thus allowing an explicitly covariant treatment of spacetime symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.12325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy is a powerful technique based on semi-definite programming that can be used for both classical and quantum optimization problems. This hierarchy goes under several names; in particular, in quantum chemistry it is called the reduced density matrix (RDM) method. We consider the ability of this hierarchy to reproduce weak coupling perturbation theory for three different kinds of systems: spin (or qubit) systems, bosonic systems (the anharmonic oscillator), and fermionic systems with quartic interactions. For such fermionic systems, we show that degree-$4$ SoS (called $2$-RDM in quantum chemsitry) does not reproduce second order perturbation theory but degree-$6$ SoS ($3$-RDM) does (and we conjecture that it reproduces third order perturbation theory). Indeed, we identify a fragment of degree-$6$ SoS which can do this, which may be useful for practical quantum chemical calculations as it may be possible to implement this fragment with less cost than the full degree-$6$ SoS. Remarkably, this fragment is very similar to one studied by Hastings and O'Donnell for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model.</description>

Abstract: The forward and backward shift relations are basic properties of the (basic) hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the Askey scheme (Jacobi, Askey-Wilson, $q$-Racah, big $q$-Jacobi etc.) and they are related to the factorization of the differential or difference operators. Based on other factorizations, we obtain another type of forward and backward shift relations. Essentially, these shift relations shift only the parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There may exist extended configurations in the dark matter sector that are analogues of structures in the visible sector. In this work, we explore non-topological solitonic configurations, specifically Q-balls, and study when they may form macroscopic astrophysical structures and what their distinct characteristics might be. We study in some detail theoretical bounds on their sizes and constraints on the underlying parameters, based on criteria for an astrophysical Q-ball's existence, gravitational stability and viability of solutions. Following this path, one is able to obtain novel limits on astrophysical Q-ball sizes and their underlying parameters. We also explore the gravitational lensing features of different astrophysical Q-ball profiles, which are more general than the simple thin-wall limit. It is seen that the magnification characteristics may be very distinct, depending on the actual details of the solution, even for astrophysical Q-balls having the same size and mass. Assuming that such astrophysical Q-balls may form a small component of the dark matter in the universe, we place limits on this fraction from the gravitational microlensing surveys EROS-2, OGLE-IV, HSC-Subaru and the proposed future survey WFIRST. Exploring various astrophysical Q-ball profiles and sizes, it is found that while for most intermediate masses that we consider, the dark matter fraction comprising astrophysical Q-balls is at most sub-percent, for other masses it may be significantly higher.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous work we studied the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole implementing an effective minimal length, by applying a modification to the Poisson brackets of the theory. In this work we perform a proper quantization of such a system. Specifically, we quantize the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole in two ways: once by using the standard quantum theory, and once by following a minimal uncertainty approach. Then, we compare the obtained results from the two approaches. We show that, as expected, the wave function in the standard approach diverges in the region where classical singularity is located and the expectation value of the Kretschmann scalar also blows up on this state in that region. On the other hand, by following a minimal uncertainty quantization approach, we obtain 5 new and important results as follows. 1) All the interior states remain well-defined and square-integrable. 2) The expectation value of the Kretschmann scalar on the states remains finite over the whole interior region, particularly where used to be the classical singularity, therefore signaling the resolution of the black hole singularity. 3) A new quantum number is found which plays a crucial role in determining the convergence of the norm of states, as well as the convergence and finiteness of the expectation value of the Kretschmann scalar. 4) A minimum for the radius of the (2-spheres in the) black holes is found 5) By demanding square-integrability of states in the whole interior region, an exact relation between the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and the minimal uncertainty scale is found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08288v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present compelling evidence for the parity asymmetry (a discrete symmetry that is separate from isotropy) in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map, measured through two-point temperature correlations. This parity asymmetric CMB challenges our understanding of the quantum physics of the early Universe rather than LCDM ($\Lambda$ Cold-Dark-Matter). We commence by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the Planck CMB, focusing on the distribution of power in low-multipoles and temperature anticorrelations at parity conjugate points in position space. We find tension with the near scale-invariant power-law power spectrum of Standard Inflation (SI), with p-values of the order $\mathcal{O}\left( 10^{-4}-10^{-3} \right)$. Alternatively, we explore the framework of direct-sum inflation (DSI), where a quantum fluctuation arises as a direct-sum of two components evolving forward and backward in time at parity conjugate points in physical space. We found that DSI is consistent with data on parity asymmetry, the absence of power at $\theta&gt;60^{\circ}$, and power suppression at low-even-multipoles, which are major data anomalies in the SI. Furthermore, we discover that the parameters characterizing the hemispherical power asymmetry anomaly become statistically insignificant when the large SI quadrupole amplitude is reduced to align with the data. DSI explains this low quadrupole with a p-value of $3.5\%$, 39 times higher than SI. Combining statistics from parameters measuring parity and low-$\ell$ angular power spectrum, we find that DSI is 50-650 times more probable than SI. In summary, our investigation suggests that CMB temperature fluctuations exhibit homogeneity and isotropy but parity-asymmetric consistent with predictions of DSI. This observation provides tantalizing evidence for the quantum mechanical nature of gravity.</description>

Abstract: Fermion soliton stars are a consistent model of exotic compact objects which involve a nonlinear interaction between a real scalar field and fermions through a Yukawa term. This interaction results in an effective fermion mass that depends upon the vacuum structure in the scalar potential. In this work we investigate the tidal deformations of fermion soliton stars and compute the corresponding tidal Love numbers for different model parameters. Furthermore, we discuss the existence of approximate universal relations for the electric and magnetic tidal deformabilities of these stars, and compare them with other solutions of general relativity, such as neutron stars or boson stars. These relations for fermion soliton stars are less universal than for neutron stars, but they are sufficiently different from the ordinary neutron star case that a measurement of the electric and magnetic tidal Love numbers (as potentially achievable by next-generation gravitational wave detectors) can be used to disentangle these families of compact objects. Finally, we discuss the conditions for tidal disruption of fermion soliton stars in a binary system and estimate the detectability of the electromagnetic signal associated with such tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of departures from classical black hole scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a general investigation into gravitational wave signatures of modifications to scattering of gravitational radiation from black holes. Such modifications may be present due to the quantum dynamics that makes black holes consistent with quantum mechanics, or in other models for departures from classical black hole behavior. We propose a parameterization of the corrections to scattering as a physically meaningful, model-independent, and practical bridge between theoretical and observational aspects of the problem; this parameterization can incorporate different models in the literature. We then describe how these corrections influence the gravitational wave signal, e.g. of a body orbiting a much more massive black hole. In particular, they generically change the rate of energy emission; this effect can be leveraged over many orbits of inspiral to enhance the sensitivity to small corrections, as has been noticed in simple models. We provide preliminary estimates of the sensitivity of future gravitational wave observations to these corrections, and outline further work to be done to connect both to a more fundamental theory of quantum black holes, and to realistic observational situations.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using quantum singular value transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06051</link>

Abstract: Recovering quantum information from a noisy quantum system is one of the central challenges in quantum information science and fundamental physics. The key to this goal is explicitly constructing a decoder. In this paper, we provide two explicit decoding quantum circuits that are both capable of recovering quantum information when a decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. The decoders are constructed by using the fixed-point amplitude amplification algorithm based on the quantum singular value transformation, which significantly extends an approach by Yoshida and Kitaev in a specific noise model to general situations. We also show that the proposed decoding circuits reduce the computational cost compared to a previously known explicit decoder. Our constructions not only show an intriguing intersection between decoders and quantum algorithms but also reveal the power of an algorithmic approach to recovering quantum information.</description>

      <title>Simulating Floquet scrambling circuits on trapped-ion quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum many-body dynamics spread initially localized quantum information across the entire system. Information scrambling refers to such a process, whose simulation is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We demonstrate the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the interferometric protocol for calculating out-of-time-ordered correlators to study the scrambling property of a one-dimensional kicked-Ising model on 20-qubit trapped-ion quantum processors. The simulated quantum circuits have a geometrically local structure that exhibits the ballistic growth of entanglement, resulting in the circuit depth being linear in the number of qubits for the entire state to be scrambled. We experimentally confirm the growth of signals in the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the decay of out-of-time-ordered correlators at late times. As an application of the created scrambling circuits, we also experimentally demonstrate the calculation of the microcanonical expectation values of local operators adopting the idea of thermal pure quantum states.</description>

      <title>Kerr-MOG-(A)dS black hole and its shadow in scalar-tensor-vector gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scalar-tensor-vector gravity (STVG) theory has attracted significant interest due to its ability to effectively address the issue of galaxy rotation curves and clusters of galaxies without considering the influence of dark matter. In this paper, we construct rotating black hole solutions with a cosmological constant in the STVG theory (i.e., Kerr-MOG-(A)dS black hole solutions), where the import of a gravitational charge as a source modifies the gravitational constant, determined by $ G=G_{\text{N}}(1+\alpha) $. For Kerr-MOG-dS spacetime, the observer is situated at a specific location within the domain of outer communication, rather than being located infinitely far away. Since black hole shadows are shaped by light propagation in spacetime, the interaction between the MOG parameter and the cosmological constant is expected to produce novel effects on these shadows. As the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ increases, the apparent size of the black hole shadow on the screen decreases. Additionally, the shadow expands with an increase in the MOG parameter $\alpha$, reaching a maximum at a certain value, and its shape becomes more rounded under an arbitrary rotation parameter, which leads to degeneracy between different black hole parameters. However, by employing numerical backward ray-tracing techniques, we have found that gravitational lensing and the frame-dragging effect effectively distinguish this degeneracy. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of black holes in modified gravity, their observational signatures, and constraints.</description>

      <title>Spectral Flow for the Riemann zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, with Mussardo we defined a quantum mechanical problem of a single particle scattering with impurities wherein the quantized energy levels $E_n (\sigma)$ are exactly equal to the zeros of the Riemann $\zeta (s)$ where $\sigma = \Re (s)$ in the limit $\sigma \to 1/2$. The S-matrix is based on the Euler product and is unitary by construction, thus the underlying hamiltonian is hermitian and all eigenvalues must be real. Motivated by the Hilbert-P\'olya idea we study the spectral flows for $\{ E_n (\sigma) \}$. This leads to a simple criterion for the validity of the Riemann Hypothesis. The spectral flow arguments are simple enough that we present analogous results for the Generalized and Grand Riemann Hypotheses. We also illustrate our results for a counter example where the Riemann Hypothesis is violated since there is no underlying unitary S-matrix due to the lack of an Euler product.</description>
