      <title>Moderator: Moderating Text-to-Image Diffusion Models through Fine-grained Context-based Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Moderator, a policy-based model management system that allows administrators to specify fine-grained content moderation policies and modify the weights of a text-to-image (TTI) model to make it significantly more challenging for users to produce images that violate the policies. In contrast to existing general-purpose model editing techniques, which unlearn concepts without considering the associated contexts, Moderator allows admins to specify what content should be moderated, under which context, how it should be moderated, and why moderation is necessary. Given a set of policies, Moderator first prompts the original model to generate images that need to be moderated, then uses these self-generated images to reverse fine-tune the model to compute task vectors for moderation and finally negates the original model with the task vectors to decrease its performance in generating moderated content. We evaluated Moderator with 14 participants to play the role of admins and found they could quickly learn and author policies to pass unit tests in approximately 2.29 policy iterations. Our experiment with 32 stable diffusion users suggested that Moderator can prevent 65% of users from generating moderated content under 15 attempts and require the remaining users an average of 8.3 times more attempts to generate undesired content.</description>

      <title>Extending Network Intrusion Detection with Enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present research investigates how to improve Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) by combining Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, addressing the growing challenge of cybersecurity threats. A thorough process for data preparation, comprising activities like cleaning, normalization, and segmentation into training and testing sets, lays the framework for model training and evaluation. The study uses the CSE-CIC-IDS 2018 and LITNET-2020 datasets to compare ML methods (Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost) and DL models (CNNs, RNNs, DNNs, MLP) against key performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score). The Decision Tree model performed better across all measures after being fine-tuned with Enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO), demonstrating the model's ability to detect network breaches effectively. The findings highlight EPSO's importance in improving ML classifiers for cybersecurity, proposing a strong framework for NIDS with high precision and dependability. This extensive analysis not only contributes to the cybersecurity arena by providing a road to robust intrusion detection solutions, but it also proposes future approaches for improving ML models to combat the changing landscape of network threats.</description>

      <title>Protecting Onion Service Users Against Phishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phishing websites are a common phenomenon among Tor onion services, and phishers exploit that it is tremendously difficult to distinguish phishing from authentic onion domain names. Operators of onion services devised several strategies to protect their users against phishing. But as we show in this work, none protect users against phishing without producing traces about visited services - something that particularly vulnerable users might want to avoid. In search of a solution we review prior research addressing this problem, and find that only two known approaches, hash visualization and PAKE, are capable of solving this problem.
  Hash visualization requires users to recognize large hash values. In order to make hash visualization more practical we design a novel mechanism called recognizer, which substantially reduces the amount of information that users must recognize. We analyze the security and privacy properties of our system formally, and report on our prototype implementation as a browser extension for the Tor web browser.</description>

      <title>Zero Day Ransomware Detection with Pulse: Function Classification with Transformer Models and Assembly Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding automated AI techniques to proactively defend against malware has become increasingly critical. The ability of an AI model to correctly classify novel malware is dependent on the quality of the features it is trained with and the authenticity of the features is dependent on the analysis tool. Peekaboo, a Dynamic Binary Instrumentation tool defeats evasive malware to capture its genuine behavior. The ransomware Assembly instructions captured by Peekaboo, follow Zipf's law, a principle also observed in natural languages, indicating Transformer models are particularly well suited to binary classification. We propose Pulse, a novel framework for zero day ransomware detection with Transformer models and Assembly language. Pulse, trained with the Peekaboo ransomware and benign software data, uniquely identify truly new samples with high accuracy. Pulse eliminates any familiar functionality across the test and training samples, forcing the Transformer model to detect malicious behavior based solely on context and novel Assembly instruction combinations.</description>

      <title>GridSE: Towards Practical Secure Geographic Search via Prefix Symmetric Searchable Encryption (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of location-based services and applications has brought significant attention to data and location privacy. While general secure computation and privacy-enhancing techniques can partially address this problem, one outstanding challenge is to provide near latency-free search and compatibility with mainstream geographic search techniques, especially the Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS). This paper proposes a new construction, namely GridSE, for efficient and DGGS-compatible Secure Geographic Search (SGS) with both backward and forward privacy. We first formulate the notion of a semantic-secure primitive called \textit{symmetric prefix predicate encryption} (SP$^2$E), for predicting whether or not a keyword contains a given prefix, and provide a construction. Then we extend SP$^2$E for dynamic \textit{prefix symmetric searchable encryption} (pSSE), namely GridSE, which supports both backward and forward privacy. GridSE only uses lightweight primitives including cryptographic hash and XOR operations and is extremely efficient. Furthermore, we provide a generic pSSE framework that enables prefix search for traditional dynamic SSE that supports only full keyword search. Experimental results over real-world geographic databases of sizes (by the number of entries) from $10^3$ to $10^7$ and mainstream DGGS techniques show that GridSE achieves a speedup of $150\times$ - $5000\times$ on search latency and a saving of $99\%$ on communication overhead as compared to the state-of-the-art. Interestingly, even compared to plaintext search, GridSE introduces only $1.4\times$ extra computational cost and $0.9\times$ additional communication cost. Source code of our scheme is available at https://github.com/rykieguo1771/GridSE-RAM.</description>

      <title>Practical Privacy-Preserving Identity Verification using Third-Party Cloud Services and FHE (Role of Data Encoding in Circuit Depth Management)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: National digital identity verification systems have played a critical role in the effective distribution of goods and services, particularly, in developing countries. Due to the cost involved in deploying and maintaining such systems, combined with a lack of in-house technical expertise, governments seek to outsource this service to third-party cloud service providers to the extent possible. This leads to increased concerns regarding the privacy of users' personal data. In this work, we propose a practical privacy-preserving digital identity (ID) verification protocol where the third-party cloud services process the identity data encrypted using a (single-key) Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme such as BFV. Though the role of a trusted entity such as government is not completely eliminated, our protocol does significantly reduces the computation load on such parties.
  A challenge in implementing a privacy-preserving ID verification protocol using FHE is to support various types of queries such as exact and/or fuzzy demographic and biometric matches including secure age comparisons. From a cryptographic engineering perspective, our main technical contribution is a user data encoding scheme that encodes demographic and biometric user data in only two BFV ciphertexts and yet facilitates us to outsource various types of ID verification queries to a third-party cloud. Our encoding scheme also ensures that the only computation done by the trusted entity is a query-agnostic "extended" decryption. This is in stark contrast with recent works that outsource all the non-arithmetic operations to a trusted server. We implement our protocol using the Microsoft SEAL FHE library and demonstrate its practicality.</description>

      <title>Security Challenges of Complex Space Applications: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software applications in the space and defense industries have their unique characteristics: They are complex in structure, mission-critical, and often targets of state-of-the-art cyber attacks sponsored by adversary nation states. These applications have typically a high number of stakeholders in their software component supply chain, data supply chain, and user base. The aforementioned factors make such software applications potentially vulnerable to bad actors, as the widely adopted DevOps tools and practices were not designed for high-complexity and high-risk environments.
  In this study, I investigate the security challenges of the development and management of complex space applications, which differentiate the process from the commonly used practices. My findings are based on interviews with five domain experts from the industry and are further supported by a comprehensive review of relevant publications.
  To illustrate the dynamics of the problem, I present and discuss an actual software supply chain structure used by Thales Alenia Space, which is one of the largest suppliers of the European Space Agency. Subsequently, I discuss the four most critical security challenges identified by the interviewed experts: Verification of software artifacts, verification of the deployed application, single point of security failure, and data tampering by trusted stakeholders. Furthermore, I present best practices which could be used to overcome each of the given challenges, and whether the interviewed experts think their organization has access to the right tools to address them. Finally, I propose future research of new DevSecOps strategies, practices, and tools which would enable better methods of software integrity verification in the space and defense industries.</description>

      <title>KGV: Integrating Large Language Models with Knowledge Graphs for Cyber Threat Intelligence Credibility Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber threat intelligence is a critical tool that many organizations and individuals use to protect themselves from sophisticated, organized, persistent, and weaponized cyber attacks. However, few studies have focused on the quality assessment of threat intelligence provided by intelligence platforms, and this work still requires manual analysis by cybersecurity experts. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph-based verifier, a novel Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) quality assessment framework that combines knowledge graphs and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach introduces LLMs to automatically extract OSCTI key claims to be verified and utilizes a knowledge graph consisting of paragraphs for fact-checking. This method differs from the traditional way of constructing complex knowledge graphs with entities as nodes. By constructing knowledge graphs with paragraphs as nodes and semantic similarity as edges, it effectively enhances the semantic understanding ability of the model and simplifies labeling requirements. Additionally, to fill the gap in the research field, we created and made public the first dataset for threat intelligence assessment from heterogeneous sources. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to create a dataset on threat intelligence reliability verification, providing a reference for future research. Experimental results show that KGV (Knowledge Graph Verifier) significantly improves the performance of LLMs in intelligence quality assessment. Compared with traditional methods, we reduce a large amount of data annotation while the model still exhibits strong reasoning capabilities. Finally, our method can achieve XXX accuracy in network threat assessment.</description>

      <title>Detection and Impact of Debit/Credit Card Fraud: Victims' Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It might be intuitive to expect that small or reimbursed financial loss resulting from credit or debit card fraud would have low or no financial impact on victims. However, little is known about the extent to which financial fraud impacts victims psychologically, how victims detect the fraud, which detection methods are most efficient, and how the fraud detection and reporting processes can be improved. To answer these questions, we conducted a 150-participant survey of debit/credit card fraud victims in the US. Our results show that significantly more participants reported that they were impacted psychologically than financially. However, we found no relationship between the amount of direct financial loss and psychological impact, suggesting that people are at risk of being psychologically impacted regardless of the amount lost to fraud. Despite the fact that bank or card issuer notifications were related to faster detection of fraud, more participants reported detecting the fraud after reviewing their card or account statements rather than from notifications. This suggests that notifications may be underutilized. Finally, we provide a set of recommendations distilled from victims' experiences to improve the debit/credit card fraud detection and reporting processes.</description>

      <title>Unlearnable Examples Detection via Iterative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are proven to be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. Recently, a specific type of data poisoning attack known as availability attacks has led to the failure of data utilization for model learning by adding imperceptible perturbations to images. Consequently, it is quite beneficial and challenging to detect poisoned samples, also known as Unlearnable Examples (UEs), from a mixed dataset. In response, we propose an Iterative Filtering approach for UEs identification. This method leverages the distinction between the inherent semantic mapping rules and shortcuts, without the need for any additional information. We verify that when training a classifier on a mixed dataset containing both UEs and clean data, the model tends to quickly adapt to the UEs compared to the clean data. Due to the accuracy gaps between training with clean/poisoned samples, we employ a model to misclassify clean samples while correctly identifying the poisoned ones. The incorporation of additional classes and iterative refinement enhances the model's ability to differentiate between clean and poisoned samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art detection approaches across various attacks, datasets, and poison ratios, significantly reducing the Half Total Error Rate (HTER) compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Adversarial Attacks via Parameter Adaptive Adversarial Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent times, the swift evolution of adversarial attacks has captured widespread attention, particularly concerning their transferability and other performance attributes. These techniques are primarily executed at the sample level, frequently overlooking the intrinsic parameters of models. Such neglect suggests that the perturbations introduced in adversarial samples might have the potential for further reduction. Given the essence of adversarial attacks is to impair model integrity with minimal noise on original samples, exploring avenues to maximize the utility of such perturbations is imperative. Against this backdrop, we have delved into the complexities of adversarial attack algorithms, dissecting the adversarial process into two critical phases: the Directional Supervision Process (DSP) and the Directional Optimization Process (DOP). While DSP determines the direction of updates based on the current samples and model parameters, it has been observed that existing model parameters may not always be conducive to adversarial attacks. The impact of models on adversarial efficacy is often overlooked in current research, leading to the neglect of DSP. We propose that under certain conditions, fine-tuning model parameters can significantly enhance the quality of DSP. For the first time, we propose that under certain conditions, fine-tuning model parameters can significantly improve the quality of the DSP. We provide, for the first time, rigorous mathematical definitions and proofs for these conditions, and introduce multiple methods for fine-tuning model parameters within DSP. Our extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed P3A method. Our code is accessible at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/P3A-A12C/</description>

      <title>Adapting cybersecurity frameworks to manage frontier AI risks: A defense-in-depth approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex and evolving threat landscape of frontier AI development requires a multi-layered approach to risk management ("defense-in-depth"). By reviewing cybersecurity and AI frameworks, we outline three approaches that can help identify gaps in the management of AI-related risks. First, a functional approach identifies essential categories of activities ("functions") that a risk management approach should cover, as in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF). Second, a lifecycle approach instead assigns safety and security activities across the model development lifecycle, as in DevSecOps and the OECD AI lifecycle framework. Third, a threat-based approach identifies tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malicious actors, as in the MITRE ATT&amp;CK and MITRE ATLAS databases. We recommend that frontier AI developers and policymakers begin by adopting the functional approach, given the existence of the NIST AI RMF and other supplementary guides, but also establish a detailed frontier AI lifecycle model and threat-based TTP databases for future use.</description>

      <title>A Multi-task Adversarial Attack Against Face Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep-learning-based identity management systems, such as face authentication systems, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, existing attacks are typically designed for single-task purposes, which means they are tailored to exploit vulnerabilities unique to the individual target rather than being adaptable for multiple users or systems. This limitation makes them unsuitable for certain attack scenarios, such as morphing, universal, transferable, and counter attacks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task adversarial attack algorithm called MTADV that are adaptable for multiple users or systems. By interpreting these scenarios as multi-task attacks, MTADV is applicable to both single- and multi-task attacks, and feasible in the white- and gray-box settings. Furthermore, MTADV is effective against various face datasets, including LFW, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ, and can work with different deep learning models, such as FaceNet, InsightFace, and CurricularFace. Importantly, MTADV retains its feasibility as a single-task attack targeting a single user/system. To the best of our knowledge, MTADV is the first adversarial attack method that can target all of the aforementioned scenarios in one algorithm.</description>

      <title>DPM: Clustering Sensitive Data through Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering is an important tool for data exploration where the goal is to subdivide a data set into disjoint clusters that fit well into the underlying data structure. When dealing with sensitive data, privacy-preserving algorithms aim to approximate the non-private baseline while minimising the leakage of sensitive information. State-of-the-art privacy-preserving clustering algorithms tend to output clusters that are good in terms of the standard metrics, inertia, silhouette score, and clustering accuracy, however, the clustering result strongly deviates from the non-private KMeans baseline. In this work, we present a privacy-preserving clustering algorithm called \DPM that recursively separates a data set into clusters based on a geometrical clustering approach. In addition, \DPM estimates most of the data-dependent hyper-parameters in a privacy-preserving way. We prove that \DPM preserves Differential Privacy and analyse the utility guarantees of \DPM. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation for synthetic and real-life data sets. We show that \DPM achieves state-of-the-art utility on the standard clustering metrics and yields a clustering result much closer to that of the popular non-private KMeans algorithm without requiring the number of classes.</description>

      <title>A Public and Reproducible Assessment of the Topics API on Real Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Topics API for the web is Google's privacy-enhancing alternative to replace third-party cookies. Results of prior work have led to an ongoing discussion between Google and research communities about the capability of Topics to trade off both utility and privacy. The central point of contention is largely around the realism of the datasets used in these analyses and their reproducibility; researchers using data collected on a small sample of users or generating synthetic datasets, while Google's results are inferred from a private dataset. In this paper, we complement prior research by performing a reproducible assessment of the latest version of the Topics API on the largest and publicly available dataset of real browsing histories. First, we measure how unique and stable real users' interests are over time. Then, we evaluate if Topics can be used to fingerprint the users from these real browsing traces by adapting methodologies from prior privacy studies. Finally, we call on web actors to perform and enable reproducible evaluations by releasing anonymized distributions. We find that for the 1207 real users in this dataset, the probability of being re-identified across websites is of 2%, 3%, and 4% after 1, 2, and 3 observations of their topics by advertisers, respectively. This paper shows on real data that Topics does not provide the same privacy guarantees to all users and that the information leakage worsens over time, further highlighting the need for public and reproducible evaluations of the claims made by new web proposals.</description>

      <title>MapComp: A Secure View-based Collaborative Analytics Framework for Join-Group-Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces MapComp, a novel view-based framework to facilitate join-group-aggregation (JGA) queries for collaborative analytics. Through specially crafted materialized view for join and novel design of group-aggregation (GA) protocols, MapComp removes duplicated join workload and expedites subsequent GA, improving the efficiency of JGA query execution. To support continuous data updates, our materialized view offers payload-independence feature and brings in significant efficiency improvement of view refreshing with free MPC overhead. This feature also allows further acceleration for GA, where we devised multiple novel protocols that outperform prior works. Notably, our work represents the first endeavor to expedite secure collaborative JGA queries using materialized views. Our experiments demonstrate a significant advantage of MapComp, achieving up to a 2189.9x efficiency improvement compared to the non-view based baseline when executing queries eight times.</description>

      <title>ConfusedPilot: Confused Deputy Risks in RAG-based LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.
  In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.</description>

      <title>CRISP: Confidentiality, Rollback, and Integrity Storage Protection for Confidential Cloud-Native Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trusted execution environments (TEEs) protect the integrity and confidentiality of running code and its associated data. Nevertheless, TEEs' integrity protection does not extend to the state saved on disk. Furthermore, modern cloud-native applications heavily rely on orchestration (e.g., through systems such as Kubernetes) and, thus, have their services frequently restarted. During restarts, attackers can revert the state of confidential services to a previous version that may aid their malicious intent. This paper presents CRISP, a rollback protection mechanism that uses an existing runtime for Intel SGX and transparently prevents rollback. Our approach can constrain the attack window to a fixed and short period or give developers the tools to avoid the vulnerability window altogether. Finally, experiments show that applying CRISP in a critical stateful cloud-native application may incur a resource increase but only a minor performance penalty.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Uncertainty and Calibration on Likelihood-Ratio Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a membership inference attack (MIA), an attacker exploits the overconfidence exhibited by typical machine learning models to determine whether a specific data point was used to train a target model. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art likelihood ratio attack (LiRA) within an information-theoretical framework that allows the investigation of the impact of the aleatoric uncertainty in the true data generation process, of the epistemic uncertainty caused by a limited training data set, and of the calibration level of the target model. We compare three different settings, in which the attacker receives decreasingly informative feedback from the target model: confidence vector (CV) disclosure, in which the output probability vector is released; true label confidence (TLC) disclosure, in which only the probability assigned to the true label is made available by the model; and decision set (DS) disclosure, in which an adaptive prediction set is produced as in conformal prediction. We derive bounds on the advantage of an MIA adversary with the aim of offering insights into the impact of uncertainty and calibration on the effectiveness of MIAs. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived analytical bounds predict well the effectiveness of MIAs.</description>

      <title>Trained Random Forests Completely Reveal your Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an optimization-based reconstruction attack capable of completely or near-completely reconstructing a dataset utilized for training a random forest. Notably, our approach relies solely on information readily available in commonly used libraries such as scikit-learn. To achieve this, we formulate the reconstruction problem as a combinatorial problem under a maximum likelihood objective. We demonstrate that this problem is NP-hard, though solvable at scale using constraint programming -- an approach rooted in constraint propagation and solution-domain reduction. Through an extensive computational investigation, we demonstrate that random forests trained without bootstrap aggregation but with feature randomization are susceptible to a complete reconstruction. This holds true even with a small number of trees. Even with bootstrap aggregation, the majority of the data can also be reconstructed. These findings underscore a critical vulnerability inherent in widely adopted ensemble methods, warranting attention and mitigation. Although the potential for such reconstruction attacks has been discussed in privacy research, our study provides clear empirical evidence of their practicability.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for moduli space of genus two curves and an application to isogeny based cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use machine learning to study the moduli space of genus two curves and more specifically distribution of fine moduli points and detecting if a genus two curve has $(n, n)$-split Jacobian.
  We show that there are very few rational moduli points with small weighted height and $(n, n)$-split Jacobian for $n=2, 3, 5$. Moreover, using a K-Neighbors Classifier we are able to detect splitting with an accuracy of 99.9\%. This shows that artificial neural networks and machine learning techniques could be quite reliable on arithmetic questions in the moduli space of genus two curves and can possibly be used to applications in isogeny based cryptography.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Sentinel: LLM Agent for Adversarial Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past two years, the use of large language models (LLMs) has advanced rapidly. While these LLMs offer considerable convenience, they also raise security concerns, as LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks by some well-designed textual perturbations. In this paper, we introduce a novel defense technique named Large LAnguage MOdel Sentinel (LLAMOS), which is designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of LLMs by purifying the adversarial textual examples before feeding them into the target LLM. Our method comprises two main components: a) Agent instruction, which can simulate a new agent for adversarial defense, altering minimal characters to maintain the original meaning of the sentence while defending against attacks; b) Defense guidance, which provides strategies for modifying clean or adversarial examples to ensure effective defense and accurate outputs from the target LLMs. Remarkably, the defense agent demonstrates robust defensive capabilities even without learning from adversarial examples. Additionally, we conduct an intriguing adversarial experiment where we develop two agents, one for defense and one for attack, and engage them in mutual confrontation. During the adversarial interactions, neither agent completely beat the other. Extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively defends against adversarial attacks, thereby enhancing adversarial robustness.</description>
