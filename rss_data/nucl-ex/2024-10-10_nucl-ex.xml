      <title>Statistical properties and photon strength functions of the ${}^{112,114}$Sn isotopes below the neutron separation threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report on the first measurements of the $\gamma$-ray strength functions and nuclear level densities of ${}^{112,114}$Sn performed at the 9~MV Tandem accelerator facilities at IFIN-HH using the Oslo method. We extract thermodynamic properties as well as both gross and fine properties of the pygmy dipole resonance for systematic comparison in the chain of Sn isotopes. The results are compared with microscopic models implemented in the TALYS reaction code, and the fully microscopic quasiparticle-phonon model for the underlying nuclear structure of the dipole strength in ${}^{112,114}$Sn. The experimental data and theoretical results are further included into the cross-section and reaction rate calculations for the $(\mathrm{n},\gamma)$ production reaction of the $p$-process nuclei ${}^{112,114}$Sn showing a significant increase in reaction rates at high temperatures compared to existing nuclear databases.</description>

      <title>Coherent Control of $\gamma$-Ray Intensity Waveforms by Vibrating Resonant Absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a method for coherent control of the $\gamma$-photons enabling the shaping of $\gamma$-ray intensity in various waveforms. The creation of different intensity waveforms is achieved by adjusting the motion profile of the resonant absorber and tuning the energy of the incident radiation. A crucial aspect of this methodology is the utilisation of a low fundamental frequency of the vibrations, which makes experiments feasible and broadens the possibilities of $\gamma$-ray control. The results of numerical simulations are proved experimentally by generating single and double $\gamma$-pulses, and inducing short-term absorption using different absorber motion profiles composed of 12 harmonics with the fundamental frequency of 1 MHz. The proposed technique represents advancement in the manipulation of $\gamma$-rays and x-rays, paving the way for the performance of new types of $\gamma$-ray or x-ray quantum experiments and the development of new tools such as adjustable table-top $\gamma$-pulse sources or $\gamma$-ray or x-ray delays and gates.</description>

      <title>Antiproton annihilation at rest in thin solid targets and comparison with Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanism of antiproton-nucleus annihilation at rest is not fully understood, despite substantial previous experimental and theoretical work. In this study we used slow extracted antiprotons from the ASACUSA apparatus at CERN to measure the charged particle multiplicities and their energy deposits from antiproton annihilations at rest on three different nuclei: carbon, molybdenum and gold. The results are compared with predictions from different models in the simulation tools Geant4 and FLUKA. A model that accounts for all the observed features is still missing, as well as measurements at low energies, to validate such models.</description>

      <title>Study of $^{7}$Li+$^{10}$B elastic scattering and the lithium-induced reaction of one-nucleon transfers from $^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The angular distributions of elastic scattering of $^{7}$Li, as well as the lithium-induced reaction of one-nucleon transfers $^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B were measured at $E_\text{lab}$ = 58 MeV. Experiment was done using U-400 accelerator beam of the FLNR JINR, Dubna. Angular distribution for reaction $^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B with excitation of the 3.56 MeV state ($^{6}$Li*) is presented for the first time. The DWBA analysis of the differential cross section of the $^{10}$B($^{7}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{11}$B ground state (g.s.) transition and excited ($J^\pi$ = 0$^+$, $T$ = 1, $E$ = 3.56 MeV) state of $^{6}$Li transition was performed. The optical model potentials were obtained by fitting of measured elastic scattering data and evaluating parameters for the output reaction channels. Phenomenological approach based on solving an approximate equation for the reaction form factor was used to determine its radial dependence and empirical values of asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC). Obtained values of ANCs for the $^{6}$Li$_\text{g.s.}$ and $^{6}$Li*(3.56 MeV) states are in agreement with the literature ones. Comparison of the radial dependences of form factors shows that the wave function of the $^{6}$Li nucleus in excited ($J^\pi$ = 0$^+$, $T$ = 1, $E$ = 3.56 MeV) state has increased spatial dimension compared to the ground state. This result is an argument in favor of a halo existence in $^{6}$Li*(3.56 MeV) state, while the question of a halo in $^{6}$Li$_\text{g.s.}$ still leaves open.</description>

      <title>Empirical determination of the energy loss of heavy quarks in nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy quarks produced in the heavy ion collisions loose energy while propagting in the hot partonic matter which finally fragment to heavy ($D$ or $B$) mesons. The energy loss suffered by the heavy quarks is imprinted in the nuclear modification factor as a function of transverse momenta ($p_T$) of these heavy mesons. An alternate measure of in-medium energy loss comes through the effective shift in transverse momentum spectra of hadrons recorded in nucleus-nucleus collisions when it is compared to the same in proton-proton collisions. We start by parametrizing invariant momentum yields of heavy mesons in p+p collisions. The fit function from p+p collisions and measured nuclear modification factor in heavy ion collisions are then utilised to obtain the shift in the transeverse mass $\Delta m_T$ of heavy mesons produced at the RHIC and LHC experiments.The energy loss $\Delta m_T$ so obtained is found to scale with the transverse mass ($m_T$) of heavy mesons through a power law at different energies and centralities of collisions. We have also calculated using theoretical formalism, the total energy loss suffered by a charm quark in quark-gluon plasma produced in Pb~+~Pb collisions at the LHC energies. The evolution of the plasma is described by (2+1) dimensional longitudinal boost-invariant ideal hydrodynamics. It is found that the total energy loss of charm quarks scales with the transverse mass of charm quarks through a similar power law which supports our empirical analysis of energy loss.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of heavy-ion initial condition in isobar collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01294v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisions of isobar nuclei, those with the same mass number but different structure parameters, provide a new way to probe the initial condition of the heavy ion collisions. Using transport model simulation of $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr collisions at two energies $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=0.2$ TeV and 5.02 TeV, where $^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr nuclei have significantly different deformations and radial profiles, we identify sources of eccentricities contributing independently to the final state harmonic flow $v_n$. The efficacy for flow generation differs among these sources, and explains the modest energy dependence of the isobar ratios of $v_n$. Additionally, a significant component of $v_n$ is found to be uncorrelated with the eccentricity but is instead generated dynamically during system evolution. Experimental measurement of these ratios at the LHC energy and comparison with RHIC energy can provide insight into the collision-energy dependence of the initial condition.</description>

      <title>Nuclear suppression of coherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction in heavy-ion UPCs and leading twist nuclear shadowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the nuclear suppression factor $S_{Pb}(x)$, where $x=M_{J/\psi}^2/W_{\gamma p}^2$ with $M_{J/\psi}$ the $J/\psi$ mass and $W_{\gamma p}$ the photon-nucleon energy, for the cross section of coherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction in heavy-ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) by performing the $\chi^2$ fit to all available data on the cross section $d\sigma^{AA \to J/\psi AA}/dy$ as a function of the $J/\psi$ rapidity $y$ and the photoproduction cross section $\sigma^{\gamma A \to J/\psi A}(W_{\gamma p})$ as a function of $W_{\gamma p}$. We find that while the $d\sigma^{AA \to J/\psi AA}/dy$ data alone constrain $S_{Pb}(x)$ for $x \geq 10^{-3}$, the combined $d\sigma^{AA \to J/\psi AA}/dy$ and $\sigma^{\gamma A \to J/\psi A}(W_{\gamma p})$ data allow us to determine $S_{Pb}(x)$ in the wide interval $10^{-5} &lt; x &lt; 0.05$. In particular, the data favor $S_{Pb}(x)$, which decreases with a decrease of $x$ in the $10^{-4} &lt; x &lt; 0.01$ interval, and can be both decreasing or constant for $x&lt; 10^{-4}$. Identifying $S_{Pb}(x)$ with the ratio of the gluon distributions in Pb and the proton $R_g(x,Q_0^2)=g_A(x,Q_0^2)/[A g_p(x,Q_0^2)]$, we demonstrate that the leading twist approximation (LTA) for nuclear shadowing provides a good description of all the data on $d\sigma^{AA \to J/\psi AA}/dy$ and $\sigma^{\gamma A \to J/\psi A}(W_{\gamma p})$ as well as on the experimental values for $S_{Pb}(x)$ derived from $\sigma^{\gamma A \to J/\psi A}(W_{\gamma p})$. We also show that modern nuclear PDFs reasonably reproduce $S_{Pb}(x)$ as well.</description>

      <title>Impact of the radial profile of atomic nuclei on observables in high-energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In heavy-ion phenomenology, the nucleon density distribution in colliding nuclei is commonly described by a two-parameter Woods-Saxon (WS) distribution. However, this approach overlooks the detailed radial structure in the density distribution that arises from the quantal filling patterns of neutrons and protons. These fine structures, as estimated by the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock density functional, cause slight deviations in heavy-ion observables from the WS baseline, which cannot be captured by simply readjusting the WS parameters. These deviations depend on centrality and observable but often exhibit similar shapes for different nuclei. To fully exploit the exceptional sensitivity of isobar collisions to nuclear structure, such fine structures should be considered.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Gravitational Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving analysis of strong interaction quantum field equations is used to complete a unified treatment of pion, kaon, nucleon electromagnetic and gravitational form factors. Findings include a demonstration that the pion near-core pressure is roughly twice that in the proton, so both are significantly greater than that of a neutron star; parton species separations of the nucleon's three gravitational form factors, in which, inter alia, the glue-to-quark ratio for each form factor is seen to take the same constant value, independent of momentum transfer; and a determination of proton radii orderings, with the mechanical (normal force) radius being less than the mass-energy radius, which is less than the proton charge radius. This body of predictions should prove useful in an era of anticipated experiments that will enable them to be tested.</description>
