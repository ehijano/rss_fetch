      <title>Agglomerative Clustering in Uniform and Proportional Feature Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pattern comparison represents a fundamental and crucial aspect of scientific modeling, artificial intelligence, and pattern recognition. Three main approaches have typically been applied for pattern comparison: (i) distances; (ii) statistical joint variation; (iii) projections; and (iv) similarity indices, each with their specific characteristics. In addition to arguing for intrinsic interesting properties of multiset-based similarity approaches, the present work describes a respectively based hierarchical agglomerative clustering approach which inherits the several interesting characteristics of the coincidence similarity index -- including strict comparisons allowing distinguishing between closely similar patterns, inherent normalization, as well as substantial robustness to the presence of noise and outliers in datasets. Two other hierarchical clustering approaches are considered, namely a multiset-based method as well as the traditional Ward's approach. After characterizing uniform and proportional features spaces and presenting the main basic concepts and methods, a comparison of relative performance between the three considered hierarchical methods is reported and discussed, with several interesting and important results. In particular, though intrinsically suitable for implementing proportional comparisons, the coincidence similarity methodology also works effectively in several types of data in uniform feature spaces</description>

      <title>Patterns of link reciprocity in directed, signed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the analyses concerning signed networks have focused on the balance theory, hence identifying frustration with undirected, triadic motifs having an odd number of negative edges; much less attention has been paid to their directed counterparts. To fill this gap, we focus on signed, directed connections, with the aim of exploring the notion of frustration in such a context. When dealing with signed, directed edges, frustration is a multi-faceted concept, admitting different definitions at different scales: if we limit ourselves to consider cycles of length two, frustration is related to reciprocity, i.e. the tendency of edges to admit the presence of partners pointing in the opposite direction. As the reciprocity of signed networks is still poorly understood, we adopt a principled approach for its study, defining quantities and introducing models to consistently capture empirical patterns of the kind. In order to quantify the tendency of empirical networks to form either mutualistic or antagonistic cycles of length two, we extend the Exponential Random Graphs framework to binary, directed, signed networks with global and local constraints and, then, compare the empirical abundance of the aforementioned patterns with the one expected under each model. We find that the (directed extension of the) balance theory is not capable of providing a consistent explanation of the patterns characterising the directed, signed networks considered in this work. Although part of the ambiguities can be solved by adopting a coarser definition of balance, our results call for a different theory, accounting for the directionality of edges in a coherent manner. In any case, the evidence that the empirical, signed networks can be highly reciprocated leads us to recommend to explicitly account for the role played by bidirectional dyads in determining frustration at higher levels (e.g. the triadic one).</description>

      <title>Generalized Diffusive Epidemic Process with Permanent Immunity in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the generalized diffusive epidemic process, which is a metapopulation model for an epidemic outbreak where a non-sedentary population of walkers can jump along lattice edges with diffusion rates $D_S$ or $D_I$ if they are susceptible or infected, respectively, and recovered individuals possess permanent immunity. Individuals can be contaminated with rate $\mu_c$ if they share the same lattice node with an infected individual and recover with rate $\mu_r$, being removed from the dynamics. Therefore, the model does not have the conservation of the active particles composed of susceptible and infected individuals. The reaction-diffusion dynamics are separated into two stages: (i) Brownian diffusion, where the particles can jump to neighboring nodes, and (ii) contamination and recovery reactions. The dynamics are mapped into a growing process by activating lattice nodes with successful contaminations where activated nodes are interpreted as infection sources. In all simulations, the epidemic starts with one infected individual in a lattice filled with susceptibles. Our results indicate a phase transition in the dynamic percolation universality class controlled by the population size, irrespective of diffusion rates $D_S$ and $D_I$ and a subexponential growth of the epidemics in the percolation threshold.</description>

      <title>U-Park: A User-Centric Smart Parking Recommendation System for Electric Shared Micromobility Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric Shared Micromobility Services (ESMS) has become a vital element within the Mobility as a Service framework, contributing to sustainable transportation systems. However, existing ESMS face notable design challenges such as shortcomings in integration, transparency, and user-centred approaches, resulting in increased operational costs and decreased service quality. A key operational issue for ESMS revolves around parking, particularly ensuring the availability of parking spaces as users approach their destinations. For instance, a recent study illustrated that nearly 13% of shared E-Bike users in Dublin, Ireland, encounter difficulties parking their E-Bikes due to inadequate planning and guidance. In response, we introduce U-Park, a user-centric smart parking recommendation system designed for ESMS, providing tailored recommendations to users by analysing their historical mobility data, trip trajectory, and parking space availability. We present the system architecture, implement it, and evaluate its performance using real-world data from an Irish-based shared E-Bike provider, MOBY Bikes. Our results illustrate U-Park's ability to predict a user's destination within a shared E-Bike system, achieving an approximate accuracy rate of over 97.60%, all without requiring direct user input. Experiments have proven that this predictive capability empowers U-Park to suggest the optimal parking station to users based on the availability of predicted parking spaces, improving the probability of obtaining a parking spot by 24.91% on average and 29.66% on maximum when parking availability is limited.</description>

      <title>Nucleation phenomena and extreme vulnerability of spatial k-core systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K-core percolation is a fundamental dynamical process in complex networks with applications that span numerous real-world systems. Earlier studies focus primarily on random networks without spatial constraints and reveal intriguing mixed-order transitions. However, real-world systems, ranging from transportation and communication networks to complex brain networks, are not random but are spatially embedded. Here, we study k-core percolation on two-dimensional spatially embedded networks and show that, in contrast to regular percolation, the length of connections can control the transition type, leading to four different types of phase transitions associated with novel phenomena and a rich phase diagram. A key finding is the existence of a metastable phase in which microscopic localized damage, independent of system size, can cause a macroscopic phase transition, a result which cannot be achieved in traditional percolation. In this case, local failures can spontaneously propagate the damage radially until the system entirely collapses, a phenomenon analogous to the nucleation process. These findings suggest novel features and extreme vulnerabilities of spatially embedded k-core network systems, and highlight the necessity to take into account the characteristic length of links when designing robust spatial networks. Furthermore, our insight about the microscopic processes and their origin during the mixed order and first order abrupt transitions in k-core networks could shed light on the mechanisms of many systems where such transitions occur.</description>

      <title>The SIS process on Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs: determining the infected fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are many methods to estimate the quasi-stationary infected fraction of the SIS process on (random) graphs. A challenge is to adequately incorporate correlations, which is especially important in sparse graphs. Methods typically are either significantly biased in sparse graphs, or computationally very demanding already for small network sizes. In this paper we present a new method to determine the infected fraction in sparse graphs, which we test on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. Our method does take into account correlations and gives accurate predictions. At the same time, computations are very feasible and can easily be done even for large networks.</description>
