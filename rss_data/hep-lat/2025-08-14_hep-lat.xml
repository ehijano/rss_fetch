      <title>Symanzik Effective Action for Karsten-Wilczek Minimally Doubled Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Karsten-Wilczek (KW) fermions are a popular variant of minimally doubled fermions. We construct Symanzik effective action for KW fermions, which is known to break the hypercubic symmetry of the lattice action. In this work we make the two fermionic modes, called tastes, explicit using the point-splitting proposal of Creutz and Misumi and write the KW action in terms of the taste fields. We identify the symmetries of the point-split action and write down the Symanzik effective action up to dimension-5, including the divergent dimension-3, operators for both free and interacting KW fermions.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network formulation of QCD in the strong-coupling expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a tensor-network formulation for the strong-coupling expansion of QCD with staggered quarks at non-zero chemical potential, for arbitrary number of dimensions, colors, and flavors. We integrate out the gauge and quark degrees of freedom and rewrite the partition function as the complete trace of a tensor network. This network consists of local tensors that contain a numerical and a Grassmann part. We truncate the initial tensor at a fixed order in the inverse coupling $\beta$ and compute analytical results for the partition function, the free energy, and the chiral condensate on a $2\times2$ lattice up to order $\beta^4$. In a follow-up paper we will introduce an enhanced tensor-network method, order-separated GHOTRG, to explicitly compute the expansion coefficients of the partition function for larger lattices.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of fermionic excitations in heavy-quark QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of fermionic excitations in heavy-quark QCD on the lattice with Wilson fermions. The grand potential is calculated analytically in the hopping parameter expansion (HPE) on the basis of the cumulant expansion. Using the grand potential, we compute the quark number susceptibilities and their ratios up to next-to-leading order in the HPE. The ratio of fourth- to second-order susceptibilities is shown to be unity (nine) in the deconfined (confined) phase at the leading order. Excitation properties of baryonic and quark modes in each phase are also investigated utilizing the Boltzmann statistics. We obtain an analytic formula for the quark excitation energy in the deconfined phase, while that for baryonic excitations in the confined phase is decomposed into flavor multiplets.</description>

      <title>Charge dependence of mesons with flavored contact-interaction couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective interaction models of quantum chromodynamics, based on quark degrees of freedom, have been successfully employed to compute the properties of a large array of ground and excited meson and baryon states, along with their electromagnetic form factors, distribution functions and thermal behavior. Amongst them, the contact-interaction model, while non-renormalizable, implements confinement, satisfies Lorentz covariance and correctly describes chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking pattern. Original studies focused on the light hadron sector in the isospin limit and were thereafter extended to heavy mesons and baryons. The strong effective couplings, as well as infrared and ultraviolet regulators, are flavor-dependent model parameters adjusted to reproduce hadronic observables. In contrast, in this study we combine SU(4) flavor-symmetry breaking couplings, obtained from one-loop vacuum polarization amplitudes in the presence of background constituent quark currents, with the contact-interaction model. This allows us to reduce the number of mass-dimensioned parameters and to consistently relate all flavored couplings to a single mass scale, while the masses and weak decay constants of the pions, kaons, $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are in good agreement with average reference values. Allowing for realistic isospin breaking, $m_d/m_u = 1.7$, in conjunction with the effect of the flavored couplings, leads to a mass splitting, $m_{\pi^+}- m_{\pi^0} \approx 0.3$ MeV, that agrees with lattice QCD values. For the kaons, the mass difference is $m_{K^0}- m_{K^\pm} \approx 2.3$ MeV, whereas $m_{D^\pm} - m_{D^0} \approx 0.5$ MeV and the $\eta_c$ is 6\% lighter than the experimental mass.</description>

      <title>Spinless glueballs in generalized linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the generalized linear sigma model, a comprehensive analysis of scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs and their mixing with mesons is presented. The Lagrangian of the model contains two chiral nonets, a quark-antiquark type and a two-quark two-antiquark type. The pseudoscalar and scalar glueballs are introduced through their connections with the axial and the trace anomalies of QCD, respectively. It is found that in order to satisfy the axial anomaly and at the same time accurately generate all seven eta masses, it is necessary to include at least two pseudoscalar glueballs, a physical one and an unphysical one that gets integrated out and yields an effective instanton-type term which is needed in generation of the eta masses. At the leading order, which corresponds to keeping effective terms in the Lagrangian that contain no more than eight underlying quarks and antiquarks, the mass spectrum of the model is worked out and shown to be in complete agreement with experiment. The quark and glue contents of the isosinglet scalars below 2 GeV, and of the isosinglet pseudoscalars up to around 2.2 GeV, are analyzed in detail and their correlations with the scalar glueball condensate are examined. Decay widths of isosinglet scalars as well as different self consistencies within this framework are used to probe the glueball condensate and thereby estimate the quark and glue contents of these states. In the pseudoscalar sector, the state that is dominantly made of glue is clearly a state with mass above 2 GeV. In the scalar sector, the identification of glue contents is less certain and in principle the three isosinglets in the 1.5-2.0 GeV can contain substantial glue. These glue contents are determined as functions of the scalar glueball condensate which is the key quantity in this analysis.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Simulations of Scattering in Scalar Field Theory on 120 Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulations of collisions of fundamental particles on a quantum computer are expected to have an exponential advantage over classical methods and promise to enhance searches for new physics. Furthermore, scattering in scalar field theory has been shown to be BQP-complete, making it a representative problem for which quantum computation is efficient. As a step toward large-scale quantum simulations of collision processes, scattering of wavepackets in one-dimensional scalar field theory is simulated using 120 qubits of IBM's Heron superconducting quantum computer ibm_fez. Variational circuits compressing vacuum preparation, wavepacket initialization, and time evolution are determined using classical resources. By leveraging physical properties of states in the theory, such as symmetries and locality, the variational quantum algorithm constructs scalable circuits that can be used to simulate arbitrarily-large system sizes. A new strategy is introduced to mitigate errors in quantum simulations, which enables the extraction of meaningful results from circuits with up to 4924 two-qubit gates and two-qubit gate depths of 103. The effect of interactions is clearly seen, and is found to be in agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations. The developments that will be necessary to simulate high-energy inelastic collisions on a quantum computer are discussed.</description>

      <title>Untwisted and Twisted R\'enyi Negativities: Toward a R\'enyi Proxy for Logarithmic Negativity in Fermionic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum entanglement for pure states, but for large-scale many-body systems, R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy is much more computationally accessible. For mixed states, logarithmic negativity (LN) serves as a widely used entanglement measure, but its direct computation is often intractable, leaving R\'{e}nyi negativity (RN) as the practical alternative. In fermionic systems, RN is further classified into untwisted and twisted types, depending on the definition of the fermionic partial transpose. However, which of these serves as the true R\'{e}nyi proxy for LN has remained unclear -- until now. In this work, we address this question by developing a robust quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to compute both untwisted and twisted RNs, focusing on the rank-4 twisted RN, where non-trivial behavior emerges. We identify and overcome two major challenges: the singularity of the Green's function matrix and the exponentially large variance of RN estimators. Our method is demonstrated in the Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model, revealing critical distinctions between untwisted and twisted RNs, as well as between rank-2 and high-rank RNs. Remarkably, we find that the twisted R\'{e}nyi negativity ratio (RNR) adheres to the area law and decreases monotonically with temperature, in contrast to the untwisted RNR but consistent with prior studies of bosonic systems. This study not only establishes the twisted RNR as a more pertinent R\'{e}nyi proxy for LN in fermionic systems but also provides comprehensive technical details for the stable and efficient computation of high-rank RNs. Our work lays the foundation for future studies of mixed-state entanglement in large-scale fermionic many-body systems.</description>
