      <title>Exploring The Neural Burden In Pruned Models: An Insight Inspired By Neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformer and its variants have been adopted in many visual tasks due to their powerful capabilities, which also bring significant challenges in computation and storage. Consequently, researchers have introduced various compression methods in recent years, among which the pruning techniques are widely used to remove a significant fraction of the network. Therefore, these methods can reduce significant percent of the FLOPs, but often lead to a decrease in model performance. To investigate the underlying causes, we focus on the pruning methods specifically belonging to the pruning-during-training category, then drew inspiration from neuroscience and propose a new concept for artificial neural network models named Neural Burden. We investigate its impact in the model pruning process, and subsequently explore a simple yet effective approach to mitigate the decline in model performance, which can be applied to any pruning-during-training technique. Extensive experiments indicate that the neural burden phenomenon indeed exists, and show the potential of our method. We hope that our findings can provide valuable insights for future research. Code will be made publicly available after this paper is published.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning in Bio-plausible Spiking Neural Networks with Hebbian and Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity: A Survey and Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the use bio-plausible learning techniques such as Hebbian and Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) have drawn significant attention for the design of compute-efficient AI systems that can continuously learn on-line at the edge. A key differentiating factor regarding this emerging class of neuromorphic continual learning system lies in the fact that learning must be carried using a data stream received in its natural order, as opposed to conventional gradient-based offline training where a static training dataset is assumed available a priori and randomly shuffled to make the training set independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). In contrast, the emerging class of neuromorphic continual learning systems covered in this survey must learn to integrate new information on the fly in a non-i.i.d manner, which makes these systems subject to catastrophic forgetting. In order to build the next generation of neuromorphic AI systems that can continuously learn at the edge, a growing number of research groups are studying the use of bio-plausible Hebbian neural network architectures and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) equipped with STDP learning. However, since this research field is still emerging, there is a need for providing a holistic view of the different approaches proposed in literature so far. To this end, this survey covers a number of recent works in the field of neuromorphic continual learning; provides background theory to help interested researchers to quickly learn the key concepts; and discusses important future research questions in light of the different works covered in this paper. It is hoped that this survey will contribute towards future research in the field of neuromorphic continual learning.</description>

      <title>Optimization of breeding program design through stochastic simulation with evolutionary algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective planning and allocation of resources in modern breeding programs is a complex task. Breeding program design and operational management have a major impact on the success of a breeding program and changing parameters such as the number of selected/phenotyped/genotyped individuals will impact genetic gain, genetic diversity, and costs. As a result, careful assessment and balancing of design parameters is crucial, considering the trade-offs between different breeding goals and associated costs. In a previous study, we optimized the resource allocation strategy in a dairy cattle breeding scheme via the combination of stochastic simulations and kernel regression, aiming to maximize a target function containing genetic gain and the inbreeding rate under a given budget. However, the high number of simulations required when using the proposed kernel regression method to optimize a breeding program with many parameters weakens the effectiveness of such a method. In this work, we are proposing an optimization framework that builds on the concepts of kernel regression but additionally makes use of an evolutionary algorithm to allow for a more effective and general optimization. The key idea is to consider a set of potential parameterizations of the breeding program, evaluate their performance based on stochastic simulations, and use these outputs to derive new parametrization to test in an iterative procedure. The evolutionary algorithm was implemented in a Snakemake pipeline to allow for efficient scaling on large distributed computing platforms. The algorithm achieved convergence to the same optimum with a massively reduced number of simulations. Thereby, the incorporation of class variables and accounting for a higher number of parameters in the optimization pipeline leads to substantially reduced computing time and better scaling for the desired optimization of a breeding program.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans and many animals show remarkably adaptive behavior and can respond differently to the same input depending on their internal goals. The brain not only represents the intermediate abstractions needed to perform a computation but also actively maintains a representation of the computation itself (task abstraction). Such separation of the computation and its abstraction is associated with faster learning, flexible decision-making, and broad generalization capacity. We investigate if such benefits might extend to neural networks trained with task abstractions. For such benefits to emerge, one needs a task inference mechanism that possesses two crucial abilities: First, the ability to infer abstract task representations when no longer explicitly provided (task inference), and second, manipulate task representations to adapt to novel problems (task recomposition). To tackle this, we cast task inference as an optimization problem from a variational inference perspective and ground our approach in an expectation-maximization framework. We show that gradients backpropagated through a neural network to a task representation layer are an efficient heuristic to infer current task demands, a process we refer to as gradient-based inference (GBI). Further iterative optimization of the task representation layer allows for recomposing abstractions to adapt to novel situations. Using a toy example, a novel image classifier, and a language model, we demonstrate that GBI provides higher learning efficiency and generalization to novel tasks and limits forgetting. Moreover, we show that GBI has unique advantages such as preserving information for uncertainty estimation and detecting out-of-distribution samples.</description>

      <title>Discovering Dynamic Symbolic Policies with Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence techniques are increasingly being applied to solve control problems, but often rely on black-box methods without transparent output generation. To improve the interpretability and transparency in control systems, models can be defined as white-box symbolic policies described by mathematical expressions. While current approaches to learn symbolic policies focus on static policies that directly map observations to control signals, these may fail in partially observable and volatile environments. We instead consider dynamic symbolic policies with memory, optimised with genetic programming. The resulting policies are robust, and consist of easy to interpret coupled differential equations. Our results show that dynamic symbolic policies compare with black-box policies on a variety of control tasks. Furthermore, the benefit of the memory in dynamic policies is demonstrated on experiments where static policies fall short. Overall, we present a method for evolving high-performing symbolic policies that offer interpretability and transparency, which lacks in black-box models.</description>

      <title>Natively neuromorphic LMU architecture for encoding-free SNN-based HAR on commercial edge devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic models take inspiration from the human brain by adopting bio-plausible neuron models to build alternatives to traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) solutions. The scarce availability of dedicated hardware able to actualize the emulation of brain-inspired computation, which is otherwise only simulated, yet still hinders the wide adoption of neuromorphic computing for edge devices and embedded systems. With this premise, we adopt the perspective of neuromorphic computing for conventional hardware and we present the L2MU, a natively neuromorphic Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) which entirely relies on Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. Specifically, the original recurrent architecture of LMU has been redesigned by modelling every constituent element with neural populations made of LIF or Current-Based (CuBa) LIF neurons. To couple neuromorphic computing and off-the-shelf edge devices, we equipped the L2MU with an input module for the conversion of real values into spikes, which makes it an encoding-free implementation of a Recurrent Spiking Neural Network (RSNN) able to directly work with raw sensor signals on non-dedicated hardware. As a use case to validate our network, we selected the task of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). We benchmarked our L2MU on smartwatch signals from hand-oriented activities, deploying it on three different commercial edge devices in compressed versions too. The reported results remark the possibility of considering neuromorphic models not only in an exclusive relationship with dedicated hardware but also as a suitable choice to work with common sensors and devices.</description>

      <title>A Library of Mirrors: Deep Neural Nets in Low Dimensions are Convex Lasso Models with Reflection Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01046v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that training neural networks on 1-D data is equivalent to solving convex Lasso problems with discrete, explicitly defined dictionary matrices. We consider neural networks with piecewise linear activations and depths ranging from 2 to an arbitrary but finite number of layers. We first show that two-layer networks with piecewise linear activations are equivalent to Lasso models using a discrete dictionary of ramp functions, with breakpoints corresponding to the training data points. In certain general architectures with absolute value or ReLU activations, a third layer surprisingly creates features that reflect the training data about themselves. Additional layers progressively generate reflections of these reflections. The Lasso representation provides valuable insights into the analysis of globally optimal networks, elucidating their solution landscapes and enabling closed-form solutions in certain special cases. Numerical results show that reflections also occur when optimizing standard deep networks using standard non-convex optimizers. Additionally, we demonstrate our theory with autoregressive time series models.</description>

      <title>The Platonic Representation Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07987v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that representations in AI models, particularly deep networks, are converging. First, we survey many examples of convergence in the literature: over time and across multiple domains, the ways by which different neural networks represent data are becoming more aligned. Next, we demonstrate convergence across data modalities: as vision models and language models get larger, they measure distance between datapoints in a more and more alike way. We hypothesize that this convergence is driving toward a shared statistical model of reality, akin to Plato's concept of an ideal reality. We term such a representation the platonic representation and discuss several possible selective pressures toward it. Finally, we discuss the implications of these trends, their limitations, and counterexamples to our analysis.</description>
