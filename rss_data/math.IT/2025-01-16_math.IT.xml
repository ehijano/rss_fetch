      <title>The geometry of moral decision making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how (resource) bounded rationality can be understood as the interplay of two fundamental moral principles: deontology and utilitarianism. In particular, we interpret deontology as a regularisation function in an optimal control problem, coupled with a free parameter, the inverse temperature, to shield the individual from expected utility. We discuss the information geometry of bounded rationality and aspects of its relation to rate distortion theory. A central role is played by Markov kernels and regular conditional probability, which are also studied geometrically. A gradient equation is used to determine the utility expansion path. Finally, the framework is applied to the analysis of a disutility model of the restriction of constitutional rights that we derive from legal doctrine. The methods discussed here are also relevant to the theory of autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>Joint Detection and Decoding: A Graph Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrowing the performance gap between optimal and feasible detection in inter-symbol interference (ISI) channels, this paper proposes to use graph neural networks (GNNs) for detection that can also be used to perform joint detection and decoding (JDD). For detection, the GNN is build upon the factor graph representations of the channel, while for JDD, the factor graph is expanded by the Tanner graph of the parity-check matrix (PCM) of the channel code, sharing the variable nodes (VNs). A particularly advantageous property of the GNN is a) the robustness against cycles in the factor graphs which is the main problem for sum-product algorithm (SPA)-based detection, and b) the robustness against channel state information (CSI) uncertainty at the receiver. Additionally, we propose using an input embedding resulting in a GNN independent of the channel impulse response (CIR). Consequently, a fully deep learning-based receiver enables joint optimization instead of individual optimization of the components, so-called end-to-end learning. Furthermore, we propose a parallel flooding schedule that also reduces the latency, which turns out to improve the error correcting performance. The proposed approach is analyzed and compared to state-of-the-art baselines for different modulations and codes in terms of error correcting capability and latency. The gain compared to SPA-based detection might be explained with improved messages between nodes and adaptive damping of messages. For a higher order modulation in a high-rate turbo detection and decoding (TDD) scenario the GNN shows a, at first glance, surprisingly high gain of 6.25 dB compared to the best, feasible non-neural baseline.</description>

      <title>Degradedness Under Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cooperation problems in broadcast and relay networks, where the receivers do not satisfy the classical physical degradedness assumptions. New notions of degradedness, strongly less noisy and strongly more capable are introduced. We show that under these conditions, decode and forward (D&amp;F) is optimal for classes of cooperative systems with limited conference rates, thus yielding new capacity results for these systems. In particular, we derive bounds on the capacity region of a class of broadcast channels with cooperation, that are tight on part of the capacity region. It is shown that the cut-set bound is tight for classes of primitive relay and diamond channels, beyond the physically or stochastically degraded models.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Security for Ambient-Powered Programmable Reflections with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient Internet-of-Things (AIoT) form a new class of emerging technology that promises to deliver pervasive wireless connectivity to previously disconnected devices and products, assisting dependent industries (for example, supply chain, clothing, remote surveillance, climate monitoring, and sensors) to obtain granular real-time service visibility. Such ultra-low complexity and power consumption devices, that are either battery-less or have the capability for limited energy storage, can provide data feeds about the condition of any aspect (e.g., an environment or an item) that is being monitored, enabling proactive or reactive control by any application server. Although the security of data involving AIoT devices is critical for key decisions of any dependent operational system, the implementation of resource intensive cryptographic algorithms and other security mechanisms becomes nearly infeasible, or very challenging, due to the device energy and computational limitations. In this article, we present a lightweight security solution that enables confidentiality, integrity, and privacy protection in wireless links including AIoT. We consider, as a case study, an ambient-powered Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) that harvests energy from its incident radio waves to realize programmable reflective beamforming, enabling the communication between a Base Station (BS) and end-user terminals. The proposed lightweight security solution is applied to the control channel between the BS and the RIS controller which is responsible for the metasurface's dynamic management and phase configuration optimization.</description>

      <title>Secure Composition of Quantum Key Distribution and Symmetric Key Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows Alice and Bob to share a secret key over an insecure channel with proven information-theoretic security against an adversary whose strategy is bounded only by the laws of physics. Composability-based security proofs of QKD ensure that using the established key with a one-time-pad encryption scheme provides information theoretic secrecy for the message. In this paper, we consider the problem of using the QKD established key with a secure symmetric key-based encryption algorithm and use an approach based on hybrid encryption to provide a proof of security for the composition.
  Hybrid encryption was first proposed as a public key cryptographic algorithm with proven security for messages of unrestricted length. We use an extension of this framework to correlated randomness setting (Sharifian et al. in ISIT 2021) to propose a quantum-enabled Key Encapsulation Mechanism (qKEM) and quantum-enabled hybrid encryption (qHE), and prove a composition theorem for the security of the qHE. We construct a qKEM with proven security using an existing QKD (Portmann et al. in Rev. of Mod. Physics 2022). Using this qKEM with a secure Data Encapsulation Mechanism (DEM), that can be constructed using a one-time symmetric key encryption scheme, results in an efficient encryption system for unrestricted length messages with proved security against an adversary with access to efficient computations on a quantum computer (i.e. post-quantum secure encryption without using any computational assumptions.)</description>

      <title>The Physics of Life: Exploring Information as a Distinctive Feature of Living Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the idea that information is an essential and distinctive feature of living systems. Unlike non-living systems, living systems actively acquire, process, and use information about their environments to respond to changing conditions, sustain themselves, and achieve other intrinsic goals. We discuss relevant theoretical frameworks such as ``semantic information'' and ``fitness value of information''. We also highlight the broader implications of our perspective for fields such as origins-of-life research and astrobiology. In particular, we touch on the transition to information-driven systems as a key step in abiogenesis, informational constraints as determinants of planetary habitability, and informational biosignatures for detecting life beyond Earth. We briefly discuss experimental platforms which offer opportunities to investigate these theoretical concepts in controlled environments. By integrating theoretical and experimental approaches, this perspective advances our understanding of life's informational dynamics and its universal principles across diverse scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Differentiability and overlap concentration in optimal Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we consider models of optimal Bayesian inference of finite-rank tensor products. We add to the model a linear channel parametrized by $h$. We show that at every interior differentiable point $h$ of the free energy (associated with the model), the overlap concentrates at the gradient of the free energy and the minimum mean-square error converges to a related limit. In other words, the model is replica-symmetric at every differentiable point. At any signal-to-noise ratio, such points $h$ form a full-measure set (hence $h=0$ belongs to the closure of these points). For a sufficiently low signal-to-noise ratio, we show that every interior point is a differentiable point.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Analytic Combinatorics for Cost Constrained Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytic combinatorics in several variables is a branch of mathematics that deals with deriving the asymptotic behavior of combinatorial quantities by analyzing multivariate generating functions. We study information-theoretic questions about sequences in a discrete noiseless channel under cost constraints. Our main contributions involve the relationship between the graph structure of the channel and the singularities of the bivariate generating function whose coefficients are the number of sequences satisfying the constraints. We use these new results to invoke theorems from multivariate analytic combinatorics to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the number of cost-limited strings that are admissible by the channel. This builds a new bridge between analytic combinatorics in several variables and labeled weighted graphs, bringing a new perspective and a set of powerful results to the literature of cost-constrained channels. Along the way, we show that the cost-constrained channel capacity is determined by a cost-dependent singularity of the bivariate generating function, generalizing Shannon's classical result for unconstrained capacity, and provide a new proof of the equivalence of the combinatorial and probabilistic definitions of the cost-constrained capacity.</description>

      <title>Delay Sensitive Hierarchical Federated Learning with Stochastic Local Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of local averaging on the performance of federated learning (FL) systems is studied in the presence of communication delay between the clients and the parameter server. To minimize the effect of delay, clients are assigned into different groups, each having its own local parameter server (LPS) that aggregates its clients' models. The groups' models are then aggregated at a global parameter server (GPS) that only communicates with the LPSs. Such setting is known as hierarchical FL (HFL). Unlike most works in the literature, the number of local and global communication rounds in our work is randomly determined by the (different) delays experienced by each group of clients. Specifically, the number of local averaging rounds is tied to a wall-clock time period coined the sync time $S$, after which the LPSs synchronize their models by sharing them with the GPS. Such sync time $S$ is then reapplied until a global wall-clock time is exhausted.
  First, an upper bound on the deviation between the updated model at each LPS with respect to that available at the GPS is derived. This is then used as a tool to derive the convergence analysis of our proposed delay-sensitive HFL algorithm, first at each LPS individually, and then at the GPS. Our theoretical convergence bound showcases the effects of the whole system's parameters, including the number of groups, the number of clients per group, and the value of $S$. Our results show that the value of $S$ should be carefully chosen, especially since it implicitly governs how the delay statistics affect the performance of HFL in situations where training time is restricted.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Holographic MIMO Based Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-based integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed for both downlink and uplink scenarios. The spatial correlation is incorporated into the communication channel modeling, while a spherical wave-based model is used to characterize the sensing link. By considering both instantaneous and statistical channel state information, closed-form expressions are derived for sensing rates (SRs), communication rates (CRs), and outage probabilities under various ISAC designs. This enables an investigation into the theoretical performance limits of the proposed holographic MIMO-based ISAC (HISAC) framework. Further insights are gained by examining the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) slopes and diversity orders. Specifically: i) for the downlink case, a sensing-centric (S-C) design and a communications-centric (C-C) design are investigated using different beamforming strategies, and a Pareto optimal design is proposed to characterize the attainable SR-CR region; ii) for the uplink case, the S-C design and the C-C design differ in the interference cancellation order between the communication and sensing signals, with the rate region obtained through a time-sharing strategy. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that HISAC systems outperform both conventional MIMO-based ISAC systems and holographic MIMO-based frequency-division sensing and communications systems, underscoring the superior performance of the HISAC framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage in zero-error function computation with side information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of zero-error function computation with side information. Alice and Bob have correlated sources $X,Y$ with joint p.m.f. $p_{XY}(\cdot, \cdot)$. Bob wants to calculate $f(X,Y)$ with zero error. Alice communicates $m$-length blocks $(m \geq 1)$ with Bob over error-free channels: classical or quantum. In the classical setting, the minimum communication rate depends on the asymptotic growth of the chromatic number of an appropriately defined $m$-instance ``confusion graph'' $G^{(m)}$. In the quantum setting, it depends on the asymptotic growth of the orthogonal rank of the complement of $G^{(m)}$. The behavior of the quantum advantage (ratio of classical and quantum rates) depends critically on $G^{(m)}$ which is shown to be sandwiched between $G^{\boxtimes m}$ ($m$-times strong product) and $G^{\lor m}$ ($m$-times OR product) respectively. Our work presents necessary and sufficient conditions on the function $f(\cdot, \cdot)$ and joint p.m.f. $p_{XY}(\cdot,\cdot)$ such that $G^{(m)}$ equals either $G^{\boxtimes m}$ or $G^{\lor m}$. We study the behavior of the quantum advantage in the single-instance case and the asymptotic (in $m$) case for several classes of confusion graphs and demonstrate, e.g., that there exist problems where there is a quantum advantage in the single-instance rate but no quantum advantage in the asymptotic rate.</description>

      <title>Integrated Push-and-Pull Update Model for Goal-Oriented Effective Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies decision-making for goal-oriented effective communication. We consider an end-to-end status update system where a sensing agent (SA) observes a source, generates and transmits updates to an actuation agent (AA), while the AA takes actions to accomplish a goal at the endpoint. We integrate the push- and pull-based update communication models to obtain a push-and-pull model, which allows the transmission controller at the SA to decide to push an update to the AA and the query controller at the AA to pull updates by raising queries at specific time instances. To gauge effectiveness, we utilize a grade of effectiveness (GoE) metric incorporating updates' freshness, usefulness, and timeliness of actions as qualitative attributes. We then derive effect-aware policies to maximize the expected discounted sum of updates' effectiveness subject to induced costs. The effect-aware policy at the SA considers the potential effectiveness of communicated updates at the endpoint, while at the AA, it accounts for the probabilistic evolution of the source and importance of generated updates. Our results show the proposed push-and-pull model outperforms models solely based on push- or pull-based updates both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, using effect-aware policies at both agents enhances effectiveness compared to periodic and/or probabilistic effect-agnostic policies at either or both agents.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the application of point-to-point communication networks and biological storage, we investigate new achievability bounds for noisy permutation channels with strictly positive and full-rank square matrices. Our new bounds use $\epsilon$-packing with Kullback-Leibler divergence as a metric to bound the distance between distributions and are tighter than existing bounds. Additionally, Gaussian approximations of achievability bounds are derived, and the numerical evaluation shows the precision of the approximation.</description>

      <title>A Tractable Approach for Queueing Analysis on Buffer-Aware Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-latency communication has recently attracted considerable attention owing to its potential of enabling delay-sensitive services in next-generation industrial cyber-physical systems. To achieve target average or maximum delay given random arrivals and time-varying channels, buffer-aware scheduling is expected to play a vital role. Evaluating and optimizing buffer-aware scheduling relies on its queueing analysis, while existing tools are not sufficiently tractable. Particularly, Markov chain and Monte-Carlo based approaches are computationally intensive, while large deviation theory (LDT) and extreme value theory (EVT) fail in providing satisfactory accuracy in the small-queue-length (SQL) regime. To tackle these challenges, a tractable yet accurate queueing analysis is presented by judiciously bridging Markovian analysis for the computationally manageable SQL regime and LDT/EVT for large-queue-length (LQL) regime where approximation error diminishes asymptotically. Specifically, we leverage censored Markov chain augmentation to approximate the original one in the SQL regime, while a piecewise approach is conceived to apply LDT/EVT across various queue-length intervals with different scheduling parameters. Furthermore, we derive closed-form bounds on approximation errors, validating the rigor and accuracy of our approach. As a case study, the approach is applied to analytically analyze a Lyapunov-drift-based cross-layer scheduling for wireless transmissions. Numerical results demonstrate its potential in balancing accuracy and complexity.</description>

Abstract: Information is a structural pattern that represents another structural pattern. This perspective hypothesizes that modelling of structure creation through causal sets can elucidate the natural origin, evolution and ontology of information.</description>
