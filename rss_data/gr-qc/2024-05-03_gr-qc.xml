      <title>The effects of the pole dark energy on gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the effects of pole dark energy on the evolution of gravitational waves. The background evolution of gravitational waves in a flat FRW universe is considered and its dynamics are studied in the presence of pole dark energy. Two different potential functions are considered for the study. Using the field equations, we formulated the perturbed equations governing the evolution of gravitational waves with respect to redshift z within the background of the FRW Universe. Subsequently, we delved into the characteristics of gravitational waves for the pole dark energy model and reached interesting results.</description>

      <title>Revisiting relativistic electrically charged polytropic spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the structure and physical properties of electrically charged static spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell system of equations where the matter model is a polytropic gas. We consider a relativistic polytrope equation of state and take the electric charge density to be proportional to the rest mass density. We construct the families of solutions corresponding to various sets of parameters and analyze their stability and compliance with the causality requirement, with special emphasis on the possibility of constructing black hole mimickers. Concretely, we want to test how much electric charge a given object can hold and how compact it can be. We conclude that there is a microscopic bound on the charge density to rest mass density ratio coincident with the macroscopic bound regarding the extremal Reissner-Nordst\"om black hole. The macroscopic charge to mass ratio for the object can exceed the corresponding microscopic ratio if the object is non-extremal. Crucially, the only way to obtain a black hole mimicker is by taking a subtle limit in which an electrically counterpoised dust solution is obtained.</description>

      <title>Gravitational collapse and gravitational wave in Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet theory with two scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational collapse to form the black hole in the acceleratingly expanding universe in the frame of Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet theory having two scalar fields and we study the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW). The collapsing spacetime can be obtained by using the formulation of the ``reconstruction'', that is, we find a model that realises the desired or given geometry. In the reconstructed models, ghosts often appear, which could be eliminated by imposing constraints. We show that the standard cosmological solutions or self-gravitating objects such as a planet, the Sun, various types of stars, etc., in Einstein's gravity, are also solutions in this model. Using the dynamical value of Gauss-Bonnet coupling, the propagation of the high-frequency GW is investigated. The propagating speed changes due to the coupling during the period of the black hole formation. The speed at which the GW propagates The speed at which the GW propagates going into the black hole is different from that of the wave going out.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the mass of superradiantly unstable scalar fields around Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we compute numerical bounds on the mass $\mu$ of superradiantly unstable scalar fields in a Kerr black hole background using the continued fraction method. We show that the normalized upper bound on the mass $\mu$ increases with the angular momentum number $\ell$ and the azimuthal number $m$, approaching the most stringent analytical bound known to date when $\ell=m \gg 1$. We also provide an analytical fit to the numerically determined mass bound as a function of the dimensionless spin parameter $a/M$ of the black hole with an accuracy of the order $0.1\%$ for the fundamental mode with $\ell=m=1$, and of the order $1\%$ for higher-order modes (up to $\ell=m=20$). We argue that this analytical fit is particularly useful in astrophysical scenarios, since the lowest $\ell=m$ modes are capable of producing the strongest observable imprints of superradiance.</description>

      <title>Summing Gravitational Effects from Loops of Inflationary Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a procedure for re-summing the large logarithms induced in gravity by loops of inflationary scalars. We first show how the scalar can be integrated out of the field equations in the presence of constant graviton field. We then extend this result to a fully conserved form which explains the need for a finite renormalization of the cosmological constant which was previously inferred from explicit computation. A variant of the renormalization group turns out to explain the large logarithmic corrections revealed by explicit computation in the electric field strength of gravitational radiation and in the potentials which characterize the response to a point mass. The implications for graviton loops are discussed.</description>

      <title>Observations on representations of the spatial diffeomorphism group and algebra in all dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical quantisation of General Relativity including matter on a spacetime manifold in the globally hyperbolic setting involves in particular the representation theory of the spatial diffeomorphism group (SDG), and/or its Lie algebra (SDA), of the underlying spatial submanifold. There are well known Fock representations of the SDA in one spatial dimension and non-Fock representations of the SDG in all dimensions. The latter are not strongly continuous and do not descend to representations of the SDA.
  In this work we report some partial results on non anomalous representations of the SDA for both geometry and matter: 1. Background independent Fock representations of the SDA by operators exist in all dimensions. 2. Infinitely many unitary equivalence classes of background dependent Fock representations of the SDA by operators exist in one dimension but these do not extend to higher dimensions. 3. Infinitely many unitary equivalence classes of background dependent Fock representations of the SDA of volume preserving diffeomorphisms by operators exist in all dimensions. 4. Infinitely many unitary equivalence classes of background dependent Fock representations of the SDA by quadratic forms exist in all dimensions.
  Except for 1. these representations do not descend from an invariant state of the Weyl algebra and 4. points to a new strategy for solving the quantum constraints.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Quantum Gravity in Fock representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbative quantum gravity starts from prescribing a background metric. That background metric is then used in order to carry out two separate steps: 1. One splits the non-perturbative metric into background and deviation from it (graviton) and expands the action in terms of the graviton which results in an ifinite series of unknown radius of convergence. 2. One constructs a Fock representation for the graviton and performs perturbative graviton quantum field theory on the fixed background as dictated by the perturbative action. The result is a non-renormalisable theory without predictive power.
  It is therefore widely believed that a non-perturbative approach is mandatory in order to construct a fundamental, not only effective, predictive quantum field theory of the gravitational interaction. Since perturbation theory is by definition background dependent, the notions of background dependence (BD) and perturbation theory (PT) are often considered as symbiotic, as if they imply each other.
  In the present work we point out that there is no such symbiosis, these two notions are in fact logically independent. In particular, one can use BD structures while while not using PT at all. Specifically, we construct BD Fock representations (step 2 above) for the full, non-perturbative metric rather than the graviton (not step 1 above) and therefore never perform a perturbative expansion. Despite the fact that the gravitational Lagrangean is a non-polynomial, not even analytic, function of the metric we show that e.g. the Hamiltonian constraint with any density weight can be defined as a quadratic form with dense form domain in such a representation.</description>

      <title>Numerical experiments on stationary, oscillating, and damped spherical galaxy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically analyse solutions of the spherically symmetric gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system close to compactly supported stable steady states. We observe either partially undamped oscillations or macroscopically damped solutions. We investigate for many steady states to which of these behaviours they correspond. A linear relation between the exponents of polytropic steady states and the qualitative behaviour close to them is identified. Undamped oscillations are also observed around not too concentrated King models and around all shells with a sufficiently large vacuum region. We analyse all solutions both at the non-linear and linearised level and find that the qualitative behaviours are identical at both. To relate the observed phenomena to theoretical results, we further include a comprehensive numerical study of the radial particle periods in the equilibria.</description>

      <title>Boosting gravitational waves: a review of kinematic effects on amplitude, polarization, frequency and energy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the kinematic effects on a gravitational wave due to either a peculiar motion of the astrophysical source emitting it or a local motion of the observer. We show, at fully non-linear order in velocity, that the amplitude of the wave is amplified by the Doppler factor in the case in which the source moves with respect to a reference frame, while it is invariant if the observer moves (with respect to a reference observer). However, the observed specific intensity transforms in the same way under a boost of the source or of the observer. We also show at fully non-linear order that under a boost (of either source or observer), the polarization tensor is rotated in the same way the wave direction is rotated by aberration, such that the only net effect of a boost on polarization is to change the phase of the helicity components. We apply these results to a wave emitted by a binary system of compact objects in the cosmological context.</description>

      <title>The effects of a minimal length on the Kerr metric and the Hawking temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A brief review of the pseudo complex General Relativity (pcGR) will be presented, with its consequences, as the accumulation of a dark energy around a mass and a generalized Machs principle. The main objective in this contribution is to determine the Hawking temperature and the Entropy for various limits: i) The pc-Schwarzschild case with no minimal length present, ii) the pc-Kerr metric without a minimal length and iii) the general case, the pc-Kerr metric with a minimal length present. The physical consequences of a minimal length will be discussed, a possible interpretation of a gravitational Schwinger effect and the appearance of negative temperature. For large masses a minimal length does not show any sensible effect, but only for very small masses, several orders of the Planck mass, where non-trivial effects emerge, important for the production of mini-black holes in the early universe. Our results are more general than being restricted to pcGR. Any other model which assumes a distribution of dark energy around a stellar body produces the same effects. In contrast to these models, pcGR demands the presence of a dark energy term.</description>

      <title>GRBoondi: A code for evolving Generalized Proca theories on arbitrary backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While numerical simulations offer unparalleled precision and robustness in studying complex physical systems, their execution is often hindered by complexity, costliness, and time consumption due to the intricate equations involved. This challenge is already encountered in General Relativity, where non-flat spacetimes exacerbate the computational burden. This complexity is further intensified when dealing with additional degrees of freedom. To address this challenge head-on, we introduce GRBoondi, a groundbreaking fixed-background numerical relativity code designed to provide a unified interface for numerically solving Generalized Proca theories. GRBoondi grants users the ability to make arbitrary modifications to the Proca equations of motion on any background, providing a robust and versatile tool for exploring diverse classes of Generalized Proca theories. This letter serves as part of the submission of GRBoondi to the Journal of Open Source Software. For access to the code, please visit https://github.com/ShaunFell/GRBoondi.git.</description>

      <title>Investigations on Lorentzian Spin-foams and Semiclassical Space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis is developed in the context of the spin-foam approach to quantum gravity; all results are concerned with the Lorentzian theory and with semiclassical methods. A correspondence is given between Majorana 2-spinors and time-like hypersurfaces in Minkowski 3-space based on complexified quaternions. It is shown that the former suggest a symplectic structure on the spinor phase space which, together with an area-matching constraint, yields a symplectomorphism to $T^*\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$. A complete 3-dimensional Lorentzian spin-foam amplitude for both space- and time-like triangles is proposed. It is shown to asymptote to Regge theory in the semiclassical regime. The asymptotic limit of the 4-dimensional Conrady-Hnybida model for general polytopes is scrutinized. Minkowski's theorem on convex polyhedra is generalized to Lorentzian signature, and new boundary states for time-like polygons are introduced. It is found that the semiclassical amplitude for such polygons is insufficiently constrained. A method for the asymptotic evaluation of integrals subject to external parameters is discussed. The method is developed in detail for the special problem of spin-foam gluing constraints away from their dominant critical points. A relation to the gluing constraints of effective spin-foams is suggested.</description>

      <title>Arrows of time in bouncing cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different approaches to quantum gravity, such as loop quantum cosmology and group field theory, predict the resolution of the initial cosmological singularity via a 'bounce': a regular spacetime region that connects the expanding branch of the universe to a contracting branch. The cosmological arrow of time, which by definition points in the direction of cosmic expansion, is reversed at the bounce. Nonetheless, it is still possible to discriminate between the two branches by considering different arrows, as defined for instance by the growth of perturbations. After reviewing general aspects of the time arrow problem in cosmology, we examine the properties of different arrows of time in bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the loop quantum cosmology bounce as a case study. We also present a new exact solution to the effective Friedmann equations of loop quantum cosmology with pressureless dust and a cosmological constant, which is a simplified version of the $\Lambda$CDM bounce scenario, where these issues can be examined in detail.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gertsenshtein effect could in principle be used to detect a single graviton by firing it through a region filled with a constant magnetic field that enables its conversion to a photon, which can be efficiently detected via standard techniques. The quantization of the gravitational field could then be inferred indirectly. We show that for currently available single-photon detector technology, the Gertsenshtein detector is generically inefficient, meaning that the probability of detection is $\ll 1$. The Gertsenshtein detector can become efficient on astrophysical scales for futuristic single-photon detectors sensitive to frequencies in the Hz to kHz range. It is not clear whether such devices are in principle possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous papers of this series we analysed the reduced phase space approach to perturbations of Einstein-Maxwell theory to second order around spherically symmetric backgrounds in the Gullstrand Painlev\'e Gauge and confirmed consistency with previous approaches. In this paper we generalize this result and show that the analysis can be performed in gauges for the background variables compatible with the Gullstrand Painlev\'e gauge. We obtain the same structure for the reduced Hamiltonian that contains the well known Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli potentials. Possible applications of this generalization are discussed.</description>

      <title>Force metrology with plane parallel plates: Final design review and outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the past few decades, abundant evidence for physics beyond the two standard models of particle physics and cosmology was found. Yet, we are tapping into the dark regarding our understanding of the dark sector. For more than a century, open problems related to the nature of the vacuum remain unresolved. Besides the traditional high-energy frontier and cosmology, technological advancement provides complementary access to new physics via high-precision experiments. Among the latter, the Casimir And Non-Newtonian force EXperiment (\cannex{}) has successfully completed its proof-of-principle phase and will soon commence operation. Benefiting from its plane parallel plate geometry, both interfacial and gravity-like forces are maximized, leading to increased sensitivity. A wide range of dark sector forces, Casimir forces in and out of thermal equilibrium, and gravity will be tested. This article describes the final experimental design, its sensitivity, and expected results.</description>

      <title>Exterior stability of Minkowski spacetime with borderline decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1993, the global stability of Minkowski spacetime has been proven in the celebrated work of Christodoulou and Klainerman \cite{Ch-Kl}. In 2003, Klainerman and Nicol\`o \cite{Kl-Ni} revisited Minkowski stability in the exterior of an outgoing null cone. In \cite{Shen23}, the author extended the results of \cite{Ch-Kl} to minimal decay assumptions. In this paper, we prove that the exterior stability of Minkowski holds with decay which is borderline compared to the minimal decay considered in \cite{Shen23}.</description>

      <title>Higher spins and Finsler geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finsler geometry is a natural generalization of (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry, where the line element is not the square root of a quadratic form but a more general homogeneous function. Parameterizing this in terms of symmetric tensors suggests a possible interpretation in terms of higher-spin fields. We will see here that, at linear level in these fields, the Finsler version of the Ricci tensor leads to the curved-space Fronsdal equation for all spins, plus a Stueckelberg-like coupling. Nonlinear terms can also be systematically analyzed, suggesting a possible interacting structure. No particular choice of spacetime dimension is needed. The Stueckelberg mechanism breaks gauge transformations to a redundancy that does not change the geometry. This is however not enough to eliminate non-transverse modes, at least for some versions of Finsler dynamics.</description>

      <title>Decoherence by warm horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently Danielson, Satishchandran, and Wald (DSW) have shown that quantum superpositions held outside of Killing horizons will decohere at a steady rate. This occurs because of the inevitable radiation of soft photons (gravitons), which imprint a electromagnetic (gravitational) ``which-path'' memory onto the horizon. Rather than appealing to this global description, an experimenter ought to also have a local description for the cause of decoherence. One might intuitively guess that this is just the bombardment of Hawking/Unruh radiation on the system, however simple calculations challenge this idea -- the same superposition held in a finite temperature inertial laboratory does not decohere at the DSW rate. In this work we provide a local description of the decoherence by mapping the DSW set-up onto a worldline-localized model resembling an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector. We present an interpretation in terms of random local forces which do not sufficiently self-average over long times. Using the Rindler horizon as a concrete example we clarify the crucial role of temperature, and show that the Unruh effect is the only quantum mechanical effect underlying these random forces. A general lesson is that for an environment which induces Ohmic friction on the central system (as one gets from the classical Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac force, in an accelerating frame) the fluctuation-dissipation theorem implies that when this environment is at finite temperature it will cause steady decoherence on the central system. Our results agree with DSW and provide the complementary local perspective.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich velocity reconstruction from Planck and unWISE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect is a blackbody cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropy induced by Thomson scattering off free electrons in bulk motion with respect to the CMB rest frame. The statistically anisotropic cross-correlation between the CMB and galaxy surveys encodes the radial bulk velocity (more generally, the remote dipole field), which can be efficiently reconstructed using a quadratic estimator. Here, we develop and implement a quadratic estimator for the remote dipole field to data from the Planck satellite and the unWISE galaxy redshift catalog. With this data combination, we forecast a $\sim 1$-$\sigma$ detection within $\Lambda$CDM assuming a simple model for the distribution of free electrons. Using reconstructions based on individual frequency temperature maps, we characterize the impact of foregrounds, concluding that they can be effectively mitigated by masking and removing the estimator monopole. We demonstrate that reconstructions based on component-separated CMB maps have no detectable biases from foregrounds or systematics at the level of the expected statistical error. We use these reconstructions to constrain the multiplicative optical depth bias to $b_v &lt; 1.40$ at $68 \%$ confidence. Our fiducial signal model with $b_v =1$ is consistent with this measurement. Our results support an optimistic future for kSZ velocity reconstruction with near-term datasets.</description>

      <title>Gravitational algebras and the generalized second law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the generalized second law (GSL) for arbitrary cuts of Killing horizons from the perspective of crossed-product gravitational algebras, making use of a recent proposal by one of us for the construction of local gravitational algebras. This construction relies on the existence of a state whose modular flow is geometric on the horizon. In both free and interacting quantum field theories, such states are guaranteed to exist by the properties of half-sided translations on the horizon. Using geometric identities derived from the canonical analysis of general relativity on null surfaces, we show that the crossed product entropy agrees with the generalized entropy of the horizon cut in a semiclassical limit, and further reproduce Wall's result relating the GSL to monotonicity of relative entropy of the quantum field algebras. We also give a novel generalization of the GSL for interacting theories in asymptotically flat spacetimes involving the concept of an algebra at infinity for a half-sided translation, which accounts for triviality of the algebra of fields smeared only on the horizon. Going beyond the semiclassical limit, we compute subleading corrections to the crossed product entropy, but are unable to determine if the GSL continues to hold after accounting for these. We speculate that an improved GSL could follow from a hidden subalgebra structure of the crossed products, assuming the existence of an operator-valued weight between horizon cut algebras.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Euclidean vacuum for linearized gravity on the global de Sitter space, obtained from the Euclidean Green's function on the 4-sphere. We use the notion of Calder\'on projectors to recover a quantum state for the Lorentzian theory on de Sitter space. We show that while the state is gauge invariant and Hadamard, it is not positive on the whole of the phase space. We show however that a suitable modification at low energies yields a well-defined Hadamard state on global de Sitter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ framework, the Euclidean BTZ black hole corresponds to the dominant high-temperature phase of its dual field theory. We initially employ perturbative methods to solve the Einstein equations as boundary value problems, providing correlators for the energy-momentum tensor operator at low points. Utilizing operator equations established in our previous work, we further compute arbitrary high-point correlators for the energy-momentum tensor operator in the high-temperature phase and recursive relations for these high-point functions. Concurrently, we employ the Chern-Simons formalism to derive consistent results. Further, using the cut-off AdS/$T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT duality, we calculate the energy-momentum tensor correlators, contributing to the comprehensive understanding of the system's dynamics. Finally, stress tensor correlators enable us to ascertain the corresponding KdV operator correlators at low-temperature.</description>

Abstract: We derive the cutoff length scale of the quadratic gravity in $d \geq 5$ dimensional spacetime by demanding that the quantum focusing conjecture for the smeared quantum expansion holds at the classical level. The cutoff scale has different dependence on the spacetime dimension depending on the sign of the coupling constant of the quadratic gravity. We also investigate a concrete example of the 5-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime and directly confirm that the quantum focusing conjecture holds when the quantum expansion is smeared over the scale larger than our cutoff scale.</description>

      <title>Inflationary complexity of thermal state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the inflationary complexity of the two-mode squeezed state with thermal effect for the single field inflation, modified dispersion relation, and non-trivial sound speed with the method of closed system and open system, respectively, which our analysis is valid for most inflationary models. First, the numeric of Krylov complexity in the method of the closed system indicates that the evolution of Krylov complexity highly depends on the squeezed angle parameter once taking the thermal effect into account, which will decay into some very tiny values, but the Krylov complexity will always enhance without thermal effect. For comparison, the numeric of circuit complexity shows that the evolution is always increasing no matter whether there are thermal effects or not which is independent of the evolution of squeezed angle parameter. By utilizing the method of open system, we first construct the wave function. As for the Krylov complexity with the method of open system, our investigations show the evolution of Krylov complexity will enhance upon some peaks factoring in the thermal effects. For completeness, we also calculate the Krylov entropy in the method of closed system and open system, which indicates that the hotter universe, the more chaotic the universe. Furthermore, our derivation for the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy could nicely recover into the case of closed system under weak dissipative approximation, which confirms the validity of construction for the wave function. Finally, our numeric of Lanczos coefficient shows that the non-trivial sound speed has minimal chaos compared to the other two cases.</description>

      <title>The Effect of a Dark Matter Core on the Structure of a Rotating Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars represent unique laboratories, offering insights into the physics of supranuclear-density matter and serving as potential hosts for dark matter. This study explores the impact of dark matter cores on rapidly rotating neutron stars through the two-fluid approximation, assuming minimal interaction between baryonic matter and dark matter. The investigation employs phenomenological models for fermionic and bosonic dark matter, revealing that universal relations governing mass and radius changes due to rotation remain largely unaffected in the presence of a dark matter core. Specifically, for a 5 % dark matter mass fraction, the percent deviations in total mass ($M_{tot}$), the baryonic equatorial radius ($R_{Be}$), and polar-to-equatorial baryonic radius ratio ($R_{ratioB}$) are within 3.9 %, 1.8 %, and 1.4 %, respectively. These findings suggest that the universal relations governing neutron star shape can be utilized to infer constraints on the properties of dark matter cores even in cases where the dark matter significantly softens the neutron star's equation of state.</description>

Abstract: Effective Lifshitz black holes with arbitrary dynamical exponent are addressed in the fluid/gravity membrane paradigm. The transport and the response coefficients in the dual Lifshitz field theory are calculated and analyzed, including the charge diffusion constant and the shear mode damping constant, along with the shear-viscosity-to-entropy density ratio. The Kubo formula is employed to obtain the electrical DC conductivity for the gauge sector corresponding to impurity through the holographic linear response of gauge vector fluctuations in the Lifshitz black brane geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that when the Wald-Zoupas prescription is implemented, the resulting charges realize the BMS symmetry algebra without any 2-cocycle nor central extension, at any cut of future null infinity. We refine the covariance prescription for application to the charge aspects, and introduce a new aspect for Geroch's super-momentum with better covariance properties. For the extended BMS symmetry with singular conformal Killing vectors we find that a Wald-Zoupas symplectic potential exists, if one is willing to modify the symplectic structure by a corner term. The resulting algebra of Noether currents between two arbitrary cuts is center-less. The charge algebra at a given cut has a residual field-dependent 2-cocycle, but time-independent and non-radiative. More precisely, super-rotation fluxes act covariantly, but super-rotation charges act covariantly only on global translations. The take home message is that in any situation where 2-cocycles appears in the literature, covariance has likely been lost in the charge prescription, and that the criterium of covariance is a powerful one to reduce ambiguities in the charges, and can be used also for ambiguities in the charge aspects.</description>

Abstract: We consider two non-relativistic quantum clocks interacting with a Newtonian gravitational field produced by a spherical mass. In the framework of Page and Wootters approach, we derive a time dilation for the time states of the clocks. The delay is in agreement up to first order with the gravitational time dilation obtained from the Schwarzschild metric. This result can be extended by considering the relativistic gravitational potential: in this case we obtain the agreement with the exact Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the gravitational radiation produced by a keplerian binary system within the context of Very Special Linear Gravity (VSLG), a novel theory of linearized gravity in the framework of Very Special Relativity (VSR) allowing for a gauge-invariant mass $m_g$ of the graviton. For this task, we exploit Effective Field Theory's techniques, which require, among others, the calculation of the squared amplitude of the emission process and therefore the polarization sum for VSLG gravitons. Working in the radiation zone and using the standard energy momentum tensor's expression for keplerian binaries, we derive and study the properties of the VSLG energy loss and period decrease rates, also verifying they reduce to the correct General Relativity limit when sending $m_g\to0$. Finally, using astronomical data from the Hulse-Taylor binary and the Double Pulsar J0737-3039, we obtain an upperbound on the VSLG graviton mass of $m_g\sim 10^{-21}eV$ that, while being comparable to bounds obtained in this same way for other massive gravity models, is still weaker than the kinematical bound $\sim 10^{-22}eV$ obtained from the combined observation of the astronomical events GW170817 and GRB170817A, which should still hold in VSLG.</description>

Abstract: We propose a setting that simulates Hawking radiation from an analogue bouncing geometry, i.e., a collapsing geometry that reverts its collapse after a finite time, in a setup consisting of a coplanar waveguide terminated in superconducting quantum-interference devices at both ends. We demonstrate experimental feasibility of the proposed setup within the current technology. Our analysis illustrates the resilience of Hawking radiation under changes in the physics at energy scales much larger than the temperature, supporting the idea that regular alternatives to black holes would also emit Hawking radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the late-time cosmological dynamics in a simple case of explicit spacetime-symmetry breaking. By expanding in a small symmetry-breaking coefficient we are able to write the Friedmann equations as $\Lambda$CDM + dynamical dark energy, which we show contains logarithmic dependence of the scale factor. We find that the dark energy equation of state displays divergencies and phantom behaviour for certain values of the symmetry-breaking coefficient, where the NEC is also broken. We discuss the adiabatic sound speed of dark energy and compare the model to current constraints using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrisation. Remarkably, although the constraints on the same symmetry-breaking coefficient from e.g. gravitational-wave propagation are orders of magnitude stronger than what we obtain in this paper, we are able to cut those constraints, which are more or less symmetric around zero, in half by showing that same coefficient must be negative (or zero) if one wishes to keep the NEC intact.</description>

Abstract: An effective field theory framework is used to investigate some Lorentz-violating effects on the generation of electromagnetic and gravitational waves, complementing previous work on propagation. Specifically we find solutions to a modified, anisotropic wave equation, sourced by charge or fluid matter.

For gravitational waves, the results show longitudinal and breathing polarizations proportional to coefficients for spacetime-symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of a parent theory for general relativity and unimodular gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) and Unimodular Gravity (UG) provide two equivalent descriptions of gravity that differ in the nature of the cosmological constant. While GR is based on the group of diffeomorphisms that permits the cosmological constant in the action, UG is based on the subgroup of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms together with Weyl transformations which forbid the presence of the cosmological constant. However, the cosmological constant reappears in UG as an integration constant so it arises as a global degree of freedom. Since gauge symmetries are simply redundancies in our description of physical systems, a natural question is whether there exists a "parent theory" with the full diffeomorphisms and Weyl transformations as gauge symmetries so that it reduces to GR and UG respectively by performing suitable (partial) gauge fixings. We will explore this question by introducing Stueckelberg fields both in GR and UG to complete the gauge symmetries in each theory to that of the would-be parent theory. Despite the dynamical equivalence of the two theories, we find that precisely the additional global degree of freedom provided by the cosmological constant in UG obstructs the construction of the parent theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Measurement in the Mid-Band with Atom Interferometers</title>

Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) have been detected in the $\sim$100 Hz and nHz bands, but most of the gravitational spectrum remains unobserved. A variety of detector concepts have been proposed to expand the range of observable frequencies. In this work, we study the capability of GW detectors in the ``mid-band'', the $\sim$30 mHz -- 10 Hz range between LISA and LIGO, to measure the signals from and constrain the properties of ${\sim}$1 -- 100 $M_\odot$ compact binaries. We focus on atom-interferometer-based detectors. We describe a Fisher matrix code, AIMforGW, which we created to evaluate their capabilities, and present numerical results for two benchmarks: terrestrial km-scale detectors, and satellite-borne detectors in medium Earth orbit. Mid-band GW detectors are particularly well-suited to pinpointing the location of GW sources on the sky. We demonstrate that a satellite-borne detector could achieve sub-degree sky localization for any detectable source with chirp mass $\mathcal{M}_c \lesssim 50 M_\odot$. We also compare different detector configurations, including different locations of terrestrial detectors and various choices of the orbit of a satellite-borne detector. As we show, a network of only two terrestrial single-baseline detectors or one single-baseline satellite-borne detector would each provide close-to-uniform sky-coverage, with signal-to-noise ratios varying by less than a factor of two across the entire sky. We hope that this work contributes to the efforts of the GW community to assess the merits of different detector proposals.</description>

      <title>Gravitational atoms in the braneworld scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Randall-Sundrum (RS) II braneworld scenario, general relativity (GR) is modified by adding an extra dimension such that it is indistinguishable from GR in the weak gravity limit. However, such modifications may leave a mark in the strong field regime. We therefore analyze massive scalar perturbations around rotating black holes in the RS II model. Unlike black holes in GR, these braneworld black holes carry a tidal charge that contains information about the extra spatial dimension, and the rotation parameter for such black holes can exceed unity. Through the method of continued fractions, we investigate the quasinormal mode spectra, and the superradiant instabilities associated with the existence of quasibound states, that is, gravitational atoms. In comparison to the four-dimensional Kerr black hole, we report distinctive signatures of the tidal charge and the rotation parameter, which manifest as signals of the extra dimension, on both the fundamental quasinormal mode and the formation of gravitational atoms. These findings offer insights into testing modifications to GR and detecting ultralight bosonic particles around black holes.</description>

      <title>Black holes surrounded by generic matter distributions: polar perturbations and energy flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a numerical approach to compute polar parity perturbations within fully relativistic models of black hole systems embedded in generic, spherically symmetric, anisotropic fluids. We apply this framework to study gravitational wave generation and propagation from extreme mass-ratio inspirals in the presence of several astrophysically relevant dark matter models, namely the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White, and Einasto profiles. We also study dark matter spike profiles obtained from a fully relativistic calculation of the adiabatic growth of a BH within the Hernquist profile, and provide a closed-form analytic fit of these profiles. Our analysis completes prior numerical work in the axial sector, yielding a fully numerical pipeline to study black hole environmental effects. We study the dependence of the fluxes on the DM halo mass and compactness. We find that, unlike the axial case, polar fluxes are not adequately described by simple gravitational-redshift effects, thus offering an exciting avenue for the study of black hole environments with gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Keplerian parametrization for eccentric compact binaries in scalar-tensor theories at second post-Newtonian order and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized post-Keplerian parametrization for compact binaries on eccentric bound orbits is established at second post-Newtonian (2PN) order in a class of massless scalar-tensor theories. This result is used to compute the orbit-averaged flux of energy and angular momentum at Newtonian order, which means relative 1PN order beyond the leading-order dipolar radiation of scalar-tensor theories. The secular evolution of the orbital elements is then computed at 1PN order. At leading order, the closed form "Peters and Mathews" relation between the semi-major axis $a$ and the eccentricity $e$ is found to be independent of any scalar-tensor parameter, and is given by $a \propto e^{4/3}/(1-e^2)$. Finally, the waveform is obtained at Newtonian order in the form of a spherical harmonic mode decomposition, extending to eccentric orbits the results obtained in arXiv:2201.10924.</description>

      <title>Bayesian $\mathcal{F}$-statistic-based parameter estimation of continuous gravitational waves from known pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method and implementation to obtain Bayesian posteriors on the amplitude parameters $\{h_0, \cos \iota, \psi, \phi_0\}$ of continuous-gravitational waves emitted by known pulsars. This approach leverages the well-established $\mathcal{F}$-statistic framework and software. We further explore the benefits of employing a likelihood function that is analytically marginalized over $\phi_0$, which avoids signal degeneracy problems in the $\psi$-$\phi_0$ subspace. The method is tested on simulated signals, hardware injections in Advanced-LIGO detector data, and by performing percentile-percentile (PP) self-consistency tests of the posteriors via Monte-Carlo simulations. We apply our methodology to PSR J1526-2744, a recently discovered millisecond pulsar. We find no evidence for a signal and obtain a Bayesian upper limit $h_0^{95\%}$ on the gravitational-wave amplitude of approximately $7 \times 10^{-27}$, comparable with a previous frequentist upper limit.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Source of black bounces in Rastall gravity''</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Atazadeh and Hadi (JCAP \textbf{01}, 067 (2024)), the authors proposed that black bounce solutions, such as the Simpson-Visser and the Bardeen-type spacetimes, can be obtained from Rastall gravity. To achieve these spacetimes, the authors consider the presence of a phantom scalar field with nonlinear electrodynamics. However, in this comment, we obtained different electromagnetic Lagrangians from the original work. The most problematic issue is not the incorrect expression of the electromagnetic Lagrangian itself. We show that the method obtains electromagnetic functions that are inconsistent. To obtain the black bounce spacetimes as solutions of Rastall gravity, it is necessary to consider an isotropic fluid, combined with the nonlinear electrodynamics and the phantom scalar field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11301v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In view to scrutinize the idea that nonlocal modifications of General Relativity could dynamically address the dark energy problem, we investigate the evolution of the Universe at infrared scales as an Infinite Derivative Gravity model of the Ricci scalar, without introducing the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ or any scalar field. The accelerated expansion of the late Universe is shown to be compatible with the emergence of nonlocal gravitational effects at sufficiently low energies. A technique for circumventing the mathematical complexity of the nonlocal cosmological equations is developed and, after drawing a connection with the Starobinsky gravity, verifiable predictions are considered, like a possible decreasing in the strength of the effective gravitational constant. In conclusion, the emergence of nonlocal gravity corrections at given scales could be an efficient mechanism to address the dark energy problem.</description>

      <title>Finite Pulse-Time Effects in Long-Baseline Quantum Clock Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum-clock interferometry has been suggested as a quantum probe to test the universality of free fall (UFF) and the universality of gravitational redshift (UGR). In typical experimental schemes it seems advantageous to employ Doppler-free E1-M1 transitions which have so far been investigated in quantum gases at rest. Here, we consider the fully quantized atomic degrees of freedom and study the interplay of the quantum center-of-mass (COM) $-$ that can become delocalized $-$ together with the internal clock transitions. In particular, we derive a model for finite-time E1-M1 transitions with atomic intern-extern coupling and arbitrary position-dependent laser intensities. We further provide generalizations to the ideal expressions for perturbed recoilless clock pulses. Finally, we show at the example of a Gaussian laser beam that the proposed quantum-clock interferometers are stable against perturbations from varying optical fields for a sufficiently small quantum delocalization of the atomic COM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a doped holographic superconductor in the Gubser-Rocha model, and realize a superconducting dome in the middle of the temperature-doping phase diagram. It is worth noting that unlike the previous researches, the profile of our dome shrinks inward near zero temperature. From the numerical observation for the coupling dependence of the phase diagram, we find that the coupling between the two gauge fields plays a crucial role in the formation of dome. We also analytically calculate the DC conductivity of the normal phase of the system in the momentum dissipation and obtain the resistivity which is proportional to temperature. The AC conductivity is calculated numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss relations between closed and open string amplitudes at one-loop. While at tree-level these relations are known as Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) and/or double copy relations, here we investigate how such relations are manifested at one-loop. While there exist examples of one-loop closed string amplitudes that can strikingly be written as sum over squares of one-loop open string amplitudes, generically the one-loop closed string amplitudes assume a form reminiscent from the one-loop doubly copy structure of gravitational amplitudes involving a loop momentum. This double copy structure represents the one-loop generalization of the KLT relations.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from the Normalized Velocity Profile of Gaia Wide Binary Stars and Statistical Testing of Newtonian and Milgromian Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-acceleration gravitational anomaly is investigated with a new method of exploiting the normalized velocity profile $\tilde{v}\equiv v_p/v_c$ of wide binary stars as a function of the normalized sky-projected radius $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ where $v_p$ is the sky-projected relative velocity between the pair, $v_c$ is the Newtonian circular velocity at the sky-projected separation $s$, and $r_{\rm{M}}$ is the MOND radius. With a Monte Carlo method Gaia observed binaries and their virtual Newtonian counterparts are probabilistically distributed on the $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ versus $\tilde{v}$ plane and a logarithmic velocity ratio parameter $\Gamma$ is measured in the bins of $s/r_{\rm{M}}$. With three samples of binaries covering a broad range in size, data quality, and implied fraction of hierarchical systems including a new sample of 6389 binaries selected with accurate distances and radial velocities, I find a unanimous systematic variation from the Newtonian flat line. With $\Gamma=0$ at $s/r_{\rm{M}}\lesssim 0.15$ or $s\lesssim 1$~kilo astronomical units (kau), I get $\Gamma=0.068\pm 0.015$ (stat) $_{-0.015}^{+0.024}$ (syst) for $s/r_{\rm{M}} \gtrsim 0.7$ or $s\gtrsim 5$~kau. The gravitational anomaly (i.e.\ acceleration boost) factor given by $\gamma_g = 10^{2\Gamma}$ is measured to be $\gamma_g = 1.37_{-0.09}^{+0.10}$ (stat) $_{-0.09}^{+0.16}$ (syst). With a reduced $\chi^2$ test of Newtonian and Milgromian nonrelativistic theories, I find that Newtonian gravity is ruled out at $5.8\sigma$ ($\chi^2_\nu=9.4$) by the new sample (and $9.2\sigma$ by the largest sample used). The Milgromian AQUAL theory is acceptable with $0.5\lesssim \chi^2_\nu\lesssim 3.1$. These results agree well with earlier results with the ``acceleration-plane analysis'' for a variety of samples and the ``stacked velocity profile analysis'' for a pure binary sample.</description>

      <title>On the non-perturbative bulk Hilbert space of JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is the bulk Hilbert space of quantum gravity? In this paper, we resolve this problem in 2d JT gravity, both with and without matter, providing the first example of an explicit definition of a non-perturbative Hilbert space specified in terms of metric variables. The states are wavefunctions of the length and matter state, but with a non-trivial and highly degenerate inner product. We explicitly identify the null states, and discuss their importance for defining operators non-perturbatively. To highlight the power of the formalism we developed, we study the non-perturbative effects for two bulk linear operators that may serve as proxies for the experience of an observer falling into a two-sided black hole: one captures the length of an Einstein-Rosen bridge and the other captures the center-of-mass collision energy between two particles falling from opposite sides. We track the behavior of these operators up to times of order $e^{S_\text{BH}}$, at which point the wavefunction spreads to the complete set of eigenstates of these operators. If these observables are indeed good proxies for the experience of an infalling observer, our results indicate an O(1) probability of detecting a firewall at late times that is self-averaging and universal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has revolutionized our ability to study black holes by providing unprecedented spatial resolution and unveiling horizon-scale details. With advancements leading to the next-generation EHT, there is potential to probe even deeper into the black hole's dark region, especially the inner shadow characterized by low-intensity foreground emissions from the jet, thanks to a significant enhancement in dynamic range by two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate how such enhanced observations could transform supermassive black holes into powerful probes for detecting annihilating dark matter, which can form a dense profile in the vicinity of supermassive black holes, by examining the morphology of the black hole image.</description>
