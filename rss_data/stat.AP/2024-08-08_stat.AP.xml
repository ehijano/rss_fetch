      <title>Varying coefficients correlated velocity models in complex landscapes with boundaries applied to narwhal responses to noise exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03741v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narwhals in the Arctic are increasingly exposed to human activities that can temporarily or permanently threaten their survival by modifying their behavior. We examine GPS data from a population of narwhals exposed to ship and seismic airgun noise during a controlled experiment in 2018 in the Scoresby Sound fjord system in Southeast Greenland. The fjord system has a complex shore line, restricting the behavioral response options for the narwhals to escape the threats. We propose a new continuous-time correlated velocity model with varying coefficients that includes spatial constraints on movement. To assess the sound exposure effect we compare a baseline model for the movement before exposure to a response model for the movement during exposure. Our model, applied to the narwhal data, suggests increased tortuosity of the trajectories as a consequence of the spatial constraints, and further indicates that sound exposure can disturb narwhal motion up to a couple of tens of kilometers. Specifically, we found an increase in velocity and a decrease in the movement persistence.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impacts of Air Quality on Travel Behavior and Activity Participation: Evidence from Travel Diary Surveys in Northern Utah</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explored whether and how area-wide air pollution affected individuals' activity participation and travel behaviors, and how these effects differed by neighborhood context. Using multi-day travel survey data provided by 403 adults from 230 households in a small urban area in northern Utah, US, we analyzed a series of 20 activity and travel outcomes. We investigated the associations of three different metrics of (measured and perceived) air quality with these outcomes, separately for residents of urban and suburban/rural neighborhoods, and controlled for personal and household characteristics. Our models found some measurable changes in activity and travel patterns on days with poor air quality. In urban areas, people engaged in more mandatory (work/school) activities, whereas there was no discernible change in suburban/rural areas. The total travel time for urban residents increased, driven by increases in trip-making and travel time by public modes (bus) and increases in travel time by private modes (car). On the other hand, suburban/rural residents traveled shorter total distances (mostly through lower vehicle miles traveled), and there was a notable uptick in the probability of being an active mode user (walk/bike). Air quality perceptions also seemed to play a role, at least for urban residents who walked/biked longer distances, rode the bus for longer distances/times, and drove fewer miles on days with worse perceived air pollution. Overall, the results are somewhat encouraging, finding more evidence of altruistic than risk-averse travel behavioral responses to episodes of area-wide air pollution; although, more research is needed.</description>

      <title>Chapter 10: Quantitative Models of Discounting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter provides a tutorial that the reader can follow towards analyzing discounting data. Previous chapters have already described the breadth of outcomes associated with discounting (Odum et al. 2020) and other background information (Odum 2011). We focus on delay discounting, where indifference points describe the value of a delayed reward that a participant would be willing to accept in order to have the reward immediately for a variety of delays. This chapter describes the two-stage approach to analyzing discounting data, as this is the simplest approach that is also statistically defensible. The two-stage approach first quantifies the discounting rate of each participant individually, and second stage analyzes these rates as a function of relevant variables (e.g., between smokers and non-smokers)</description>

      <title>The Wasserstein Bipolarization Index: A New Measure of Public Opinion Polarization, with an Application to Cross-Country Attitudes toward COVID-19 Vaccination Mandates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the topic of opinion polarization receives much attention from the media, public opinion researchers and political scientists, the phenomenon itself has not been adequately characterized in either the lay or academic literature. To study opinion polarization among the public, researchers compare the distributions of respondents to survey questions or track the distribution of responses to a question over time using ad-hoc methods and measures such as visual comparisons, variances, and bimodality coefficients. To remedy this situation, we build on the axiomatic approach in the economics literature on income bipolarization, specifying key properties a measure of bipolarization should satisfy: in particular, it should increase as the distribution spreads away from a center toward the poles and/or as clustering below or above this center increases. We then show that measures of bipolarization used in public opinion research fail to satisfy one or more of these axioms. Next, we propose a $p$-Wasserstein polarization index that satisfies the axioms we set forth. Our index measures the dissimilarity between an observed distribution and a distribution with all the mass clustered on the lower and upper endpoints of the scale. We use our index to examine bipolarization in attitudes toward governmental COVID-19 vaccine mandates across 11 countries, finding the U.S and U.K are most polarized, China, France and India the least polarized, while the others (Brazil, Australia, Colombia, Canada, Italy, Spain) occupy an intermediate position.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation for the generalized extreme value distribution: a method that combines bootstrapping and r largest order statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A critical problem in extreme value theory (EVT) is the estimation of parameters for the limit probability distributions. Block maxima (BM), an approach in EVT that seeks estimates of parameters of the generalized extreme value distribution (GEV), can be generalized to take into account not just the maximum realization from a given dataset, but the r largest order statistics for a given r. In this work we propose a parameter estimation method that combines the r largest order statistic (r-LOS) extension of BM with permutation bootstrapping: surrogate realizations are obtained by randomly reordering the original data set, and then r-LOS is applied to these shuffled measurements - the mean estimate computed from these surrogate realizations is the desired estimate. We used synthetic observations and real meteorological time series to verify the performance of our method; we found that the combination of r-LOS and bootstrapping resulted in estimates more accurate than when either approach was implemented separately.</description>

      <title>Combining BART and Principal Stratification to estimate the effect of intermediate on primary outcomes with application to estimating the effect of family planning on employment in sub-Saharan Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is interest in learning about the causal effect of family planning (FP) on empowerment related outcomes. Experimental data related to this question are available from trials in which FP programs increase access to FP. While program assignment is unconfounded, FP uptake and subsequent empowerment may share common causes. We use principal stratification to estimate the causal effect of an intermediate FP outcome on a primary outcome of interest, among women affected by a FP program. Within strata defined by the potential reaction to the program, FP uptake is unconfounded. To minimize the need for parametric assumptions, we propose to use Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) for modeling stratum membership and outcomes of interest. We refer to the combined approach as Prince BART. We evaluate Prince BART through a simulation study and use it to assess the causal effect of modern contraceptive use on employment in six cities in Nigeria, based on quasi-experimental data from a FP program trial during the first half of the 2010s. We show that findings differ between Prince BART and alternative modeling approaches based on parametric assumptions.</description>

      <title>Predicting milk traits from spectral data using Bayesian probabilistic partial least squares regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04457v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional spectral data -- routinely generated in dairy production -- are used to predict a range of traits in milk products. Partial least squares (PLS) regression is ubiquitously used for these prediction tasks. However, PLS regression is not typically viewed as arising from a probabilistic model, and parameter uncertainty is rarely quantified. Additionally, PLS regression does not easily lend itself to model-based modifications, coherent prediction intervals are not readily available, and the process of choosing the latent-space dimension, $\mathtt{Q}$, can be subjective and sensitive to data size. We introduce a Bayesian latent-variable model, emulating the desirable properties of PLS regression while accounting for parameter uncertainty in prediction. The need to choose $\mathtt{Q}$ is eschewed through a nonparametric shrinkage prior. The flexibility of the proposed Bayesian partial least squares (BPLS) regression framework is exemplified by considering sparsity modifications and allowing for multivariate response prediction. The BPLS regression framework is used in two motivating settings: 1) multivariate trait prediction from mid-infrared spectral analyses of milk samples, and 2) milk pH prediction from surface-enhanced Raman spectral data. The prediction performance of BPLS regression at least matches that of PLS regression. Additionally, the provision of correctly calibrated prediction intervals objectively provides richer, more informative inference for stakeholders in dairy production.</description>

      <title>A novel CFA+EFA model to detect aberrant respondents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aberrant respondents are common but yet extremely detrimental to the quality of social surveys or questionnaires. Recently, factor mixture models have been employed to identify individuals providing deceptive or careless responses. We propose a comprehensive factor mixture model for continuous outcomes that combines confirmatory and exploratory factor models to classify both the non-aberrant and aberrant respondents. The flexibility of the proposed {classification model} allows for the identification of two of the most common aberrant response styles, namely faking and careless responding. We validated our approach by means of two simulations and two case studies. The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed model in dealing with aberrant responses in social and behavioural surveys.</description>

      <title>Digital Twins and Civil Engineering Phases: Reorienting Adoption Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology has received immense attention over the years due to the promises it presents to various stakeholders in science and engineering. As a result, different thematic areas of DT have been explored. This is no different in specific fields such as manufacturing, automation, oil and gas, and civil engineering, leading to fragmented approaches for field-specific applications. The civil engineering industry is further disadvantaged in this regard as it relies on external techniques by other engineering fields for its DT adoption. A rising consequence of these extensions is a concentrated application of DT to the operations and maintenance phase. On another spectrum, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is pervasively utilized in the planning/design phase, and the transient nature of the construction phase remains a challenge for its DT adoption. In this paper, we present a phase-based development of DT in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction industry. We commence by presenting succinct expositions on DT as a concept and as a service, and establish a five-level scale system. Furthermore, we present separately a systematic literature review of the conventional techniques employed at each civil engineering phase. In this regard, we identified enabling technologies such as computer vision for extended sensing and the Internet of Things for reliable integration. Ultimately, we attempt to reveal DT as an important tool across the entire life cycle of civil engineering projects, and nudge researchers to think more holistically in their quest for the integration of DT for civil engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Networks And Productivity -- A Study In Economic Scholars During COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted traditional academic collaboration patterns, offering a unique opportunity to analyze the influence of peer effects and collaboration dynamics on research productivity. Using a novel network dataset, this paper investigates the role of peer effects on the productivity of economists, as measured by their publication count, during both pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. The results indicate that peer effects were significant in the pre-pandemic period but not during the pandemic. Additionally, the study sheds light on gender and race differences. These findings enhance our understanding of how research collaboration impacts knowledge production and provide insights that may inform policies aimed at promoting collaboration and boosting research productivity within the academic community.</description>

      <title>Volatility Forecasting Using Similarity-based Parameter Correction and Aggregated Shock Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a procedure for forecasting the volatility of a time series immediately following a news shock. Adapting the similarity-based framework of Lin and Eck (2020), we exploit series that have experienced similar shocks. We aggregate their shock-induced excess volatilities by positing the shocks to be affine functions of exogenous covariates. The volatility shocks are modeled as random effects and estimated as fixed effects. The aggregation of these estimates is done in service of adjusting the $h$-step-ahead GARCH forecast of the time series under study by an additive term. The adjusted and unadjusted forecasts are evaluated using the unobservable but easily-estimated realized volatility (RV). A real-world application is provided, as are simulation results suggesting the conditions and hyperparameters under which our method thrives.</description>
