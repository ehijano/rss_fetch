      <title>Diagrammatic expressions for steady-state distribution and static responses in population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental questions in population dynamics is how biological populations respond to environmental perturbations. In population dynamics, the mean fitness and the fraction of a trait in the steady state are important because they indicate how well the trait and the population adapt to the environment. In this study, we examine the parallel mutation-reproduction model, which is one of the simplest models of an evolvable population. As an extension of the Markov chain tree theorem, we derive diagrammatic expressions for the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution of the population. For the parallel mutation-reproduction model, we consider self-loops, which represent trait reproduction and are excluded from the Markov chain tree theorem for the linear master equation. To generalize the theorem, we introduce the concept of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests, which generalize spanning trees with loops. We demonstrate that the weights of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests yield the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution. Our results provide exact expressions for the static responses and the steady-state distribution. Additionally, we discuss approximations of these expressions in cases where reproduction or mutation is dominant. We provide numerical examples to illustrate these approximations and exact expressions.</description>

      <title>The Mean-Field Survival Model for Stripe Formation in Zebrafish Exhibits Turing Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zebrafish have been used as a model organism in many areas of biology, including the study of pattern formation. The mean-field survival model is a coupled ODE system describing the expected evolution of chromatophores coordinating to form stripes in zebrafish. This paper presents analysis of the model focusing on parameters for the number of cells, length of distant-neighbor interactions, and rates related to birth and death of chromatophores. We derive the conditions on these parameters for a Turing bifurcation to occur and show that the model predicts patterns qualitatively similar to those in nature.
  In addition to answering questions about this particular model, this paper also serves as a case study for Turing analysis on coupled ODE systems. The qualitative behavior of such coupled ODE models may deviate significantly from continuum limit models. The ability to analyze such systems directly avoids this concern and allows for a more accurate description of the behavior at physically relevant scales.</description>
