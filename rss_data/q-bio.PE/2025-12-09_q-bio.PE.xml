      <title>The emergence and diversification of dog morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dogs exhibit an exceptional range of morphological diversity as a result of their long-term association with humans. Attempts to identify when dog morphological variation began to expand have been constrained by the limited number of Pleistocene specimens, the fragmentary nature of remains, and difficulties in distinguishing early dogs from wolves on the basis of skeletal morphology. In this study, we used three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to analyze the size and shape of 643 canid crania spanning the past 50,000 years. Our analyses show that a distinctive dog morphology first appeared at about 11,000 calibrated years before present, and substantial phenotypic diversity already existed in early Holocene dogs. Thus, this variation emerged many millennia before the intense human-mediated selection shaping modern dog breeds beginning in the 19th century.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effect of adaptive optimal control function in epidemic dynamics: predictions and strategy evolution based on SIR/V game theoretic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an adaptive optimal control problem for an SIR/V epidemic model with human behavioral effects.We develop a model where effective management of infectious diseases are monitored by the means of non pharmaceutical interventions.This study develops an adaptive optimal control function within an SIR/V framework embedding a non cooperative game theoretic mechanism to capture the dynamic interplay between individual vaccination behavior and population level transmission. We derive analytical expression for the optimal control trajectory under resource constrain and heterogeneous susceptibility and we validate our model using numerical simulations,calibrated with the real world epidemic parameters. We find that for the adaptive optimal policy for a generally known SIR/V model depending on the game theoretic epidemic state leads to substantial reduction in expenses compared to non adaptive policies. Moreover, our results demonstrate that, adaptive strategies significantly outperform the static policies by achieving lower peak infections and faster epidemic extinctions while evolutionary game dynamics identify critical behavioral thresholds that drive strategy evolution and inform timely policy adaptation</description>

      <title>Algorithmic design of "smart canopy" maize architectures that maximize light use efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computational framework that integrates functional-structural plant modeling (FSPM) with an evolutionary algorithm to optimize three-dimensional maize canopy architecture for enhanced light interception under high-density planting. The optimization revealed an emergent ideotype characterized by two distinct strategies: a vertically stratified leaf profile (steep, narrow upper leaves for penetration; broad, horizontal lower leaves for capture) and a radially tiled azimuthal arrangement that breaks the conventional distichous symmetry of maize to minimize self and mutual shading. Reverse ray-tracing simulations show that this architecture intercepts significantly more photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) than virtual canopies parameterized from high-performing field hybrids, with gains that generalize across multiple U.S. latitudes and planting densities. The optimized trait combinations align with characteristics of modern density-tolerant cultivars, supporting biological plausibility. Because recent gene editing advances enable more independent control of architectural traits, the designs identified here are increasingly feasible. By uncovering effective, non-intuitive trait configurations, our approach provides a scalable, predictive tool to guide breeding targets, improve light-use efficiency, and ultimately support sustainable yield gains.</description>

      <title>How Conflict Aversion Can Enable Authoritarianism: An Evolutionary Dynamics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use evolutionary game theory to examine how conflict-averse centrism can unintentionally facilitate authoritarian success in polarized political conflicts. Many such conflicts are asymmetric: authoritarian actors can employ norm-breaking or coercive tactics, while democratic resistance faces stronger constraints on what counts as normatively acceptable behavior. Yet formal models typically treat opposing sides symmetrically and rarely examine conflict-averse behavior. Drawing on empirical research on protest backlash, civility norms, and authoritarian resilience, we model these dynamics as a three-strategy evolutionary game in which resistance, authoritarianism, and conflict-averse centrism interact under replicator dynamics. This framework yields two distinct outcomes -- cyclic resurgence of authoritarian strength through a heteroclinic cycle and a stable centrist-authoritarian coalition that excludes resistance -- depending on how actors respond to confrontation. The analysis shows how payoff differences can reorganize long-run dynamics in asymmetric conflicts. Our contribution is to demonstrate how an established dynamical framework, combined with empirically grounded behavioral assumptions, clarifies the strategic conditions under which conflict aversion can diminish the effectiveness of democratic resistance.</description>

      <title>Self-organized criticality in complex model ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that spatial extensions of many-species population dynamics models, such as the Lotka-Volterra model with random interactions we focus on in this work, generically exhibit scale-free correlation functions of population sizes in the limit of an infinite number of species. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we describe the many-species system in terms of single-species dynamics with demographic and environmental noises. We show that the single-species model features a random mass term, or equivalently a random space-time averaged growth rate, poising some species very close to extinction. This introduces a hierarchy of ever larger correlation times and lengths as the extinction threshold is approached. In turn, every species, even those far from extinction, are coupled to these near-critical fields which combine to make fluctuations of population sizes generically scale-free. We argue that these correlations are described by exponents derived from those of directed percolation in spatial dimension $d=3$, but not in lower dimensions.</description>

      <title>Two waves of adaptation: speciation induced by dormancy in a model with changing environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a population model in which the season alternates between winter and summer, and individuals can acquire mutations either that are advantageous in the summer and disadvantageous in the winter, or vice versa. Also, we assume that individuals in the population can either be active or dormant, and that individuals can move between these two states. Dormant individuals do not reproduce but do not experience selective pressures. We show that, under certain conditions, over time we see two waves of adaptation. Some individuals repeatedly acquire mutations that are beneficial in the summer, while others repeatedly acquire mutations that are beneficial in the winter. Individuals can survive the season during which they are less fit by entering a dormant state. This result demonstrates that, for populations in fluctuating environments, dormancy has the potential to induce speciation.</description>

      <title>A Behaviour and Disease Model of Testing and Isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been interest in the interactions between infectious disease dynamics and behaviour for most of the history of mathematical epidemiology. This has included consideration of which mathematical models best capture each phenomenon, as well as their interaction, but typically in a manner that is agnostic to the exact behaviour in question. Here, we investigate interacting behaviour and disease dynamics specifically related to decisions around testing and isolation. To carry out our investigation we extend an existing "behaviour and disease" (BaD) model by incorporating the dynamics of symptomatic testing and isolation, including the influence of positive tests on perception of infection risk. We provide a dynamical systems analysis of the ordinary differential equations that define this model, providing theoretical results on its behaviour early in a new outbreak (particularly its basic reproduction number) and endemicity of the system (its steady states and associated stability criteria). We then supplement these findings with a numerical analysis to inform how temporal and cumulative outbreak metrics depend on the model parameter values for epidemic and endemic regimes. We observe novel model outputs such as epidemics that have more observed cases detected through increased testing, but are less objectively severe in terms of total number of infections.</description>

      <title>PhyloLM : Inferring the Phylogeny of Large Language Models and Predicting their Performances in Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04671v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces PhyloLM, a method adapting phylogenetic algorithms to Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore whether and how they relate to each other and to predict their performance characteristics. Our method calculates a phylogenetic distance metric based on the similarity of LLMs' output. The resulting metric is then used to construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture known relationships across a set of 111 open-source and 45 closed models. Furthermore, our phylogenetic distance predicts performance in standard benchmarks, thus demonstrating its functional validity and paving the way for a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. To sum up, by translating population genetic concepts to machine learning, we propose and validate a tool to evaluate LLM development, relationships and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.</description>

      <title>Correlation-Weighted Communicability Curvature as a Structural Driver of Dengue Spread: A Bayesian Spatial Analysis of Recife (2015-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the structural connectivity of urban road networks helps explain dengue incidence in Recife, Brazil (2015--2024). For each neighborhood, we compute the average \emph{communicability curvature}, a graph-theoretic measure capturing the ability of a locality to influence others through multiple network paths. We integrate this metric into Negative Binomial models, fixed-effects regressions, SAR/SAC spatial models, and a hierarchical INLA/BYM2 specification. Across all frameworks, curvature is the strongest and most stable predictor of dengue risk. In the BYM2 model, the structured spatial component collapses ($\phi \approx 0$), indicating that functional network connectivity explains nearly all spatial dependence typically attributed to adjacency-based CAR terms. The results show that dengue spread in Recife is driven less by geographic contiguity and more by network-mediated structural flows.</description>
