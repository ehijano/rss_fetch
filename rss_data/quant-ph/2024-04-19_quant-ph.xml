      <title>Dyons with phase $\delta_{\theta}=n\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper (Heras in $\href{https://doi.org/10.1140/epjp/s13360-023-03914-5}{{\rm Eur. Phys. J. Plus\, 138: 329, 2023}}$), we have demonstrated that when a dyon encircles an infinitely long solenoid enclosing electric and magnetic fluxes, its wave function accumulates a quantum phase invariant under electromagnetic duality transformations. In this paper, we show that this phase, in conjunction with the Witten effect, gives rise to a topological phase proportional to the vacuum angle $\theta$ and thereby connected with CP violation. We show that this phase becomes quantised in a vacuum state $\delta_{\theta}=n\theta$ and that the most general vacuum state associated with this quantisation identifies with an Abelian form of the $\theta$-vacua. We discuss two hypothetical interference effects in the vacuum where the angle $\theta$ could manifest.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer entropies are monotones for magic-state resource theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the monotonicity of stabilizer entropies for $\alpha\geq 2$ within the context of magic-state resource theory restricted to pure states. Additionally, we show that linear stabilizer entropies serve as strong monotones. Furthermore, we provide the extension to mixed states of stabilizer entropies as magic monotones through convex roof constructions.</description>

      <title>Optimized measurement-free and fault-tolerant quantum error correction for neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in performing quantum error correction (QEC) is implementing reliable measurements and conditional feed-forward operations. In quantum computing platforms supporting unconditional qubit resets, or a constant supply of fresh qubits, alternative schemes which do not require measurements are possible. In such schemes, the error correction is realized via crafted coherent quantum feedback. We propose implementations of small measurement-free QEC schemes, which are fault-tolerant to circuit-level noise. These implementations are guided by several heuristics to achieve fault-tolerance: redundant syndrome information is extracted, and additional single-shot flag qubits are used. By carefully designing the circuit, the additional overhead of these measurement-free schemes is moderate compared to their conventional measurement-and-feed-forward counterparts. We highlight how this alternative approach paves the way towards implementing resource-efficient measurement-free QEC on neutral-atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Photon blockade in non-Hermitian optomechanical systems with nonreciprocal couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the photon blockade at exceptional points for a non-Hermitian optomechanical system coupled to the driven whispering-gallery-mode microresonator with two nanoparticles under the weak optomechanical coupling approximation, where exceptional points emerge periodically by controlling the relative angle of the nanoparticles. We find that conventional photon blockade occurs at exceptional points for the eigenenergy resonance of the single-excitation subspace driven by a laser field, and discuss the physical origin of conventional photon blockade. Under the weak driving condition, we analyze the influences of the different parameters on conventional photon blockade. We investigate conventional photon blockade at non-exceptional points, which exists at two optimal detunings due to the eigenstates in the single-excitation subspace splitting from one (coalescence) at exceptional points to two at non-exceptional points. \textbf{Unconventional photon blockade can occur at non-exceptional points, while it does not exist at exceptional points since the destructive quantum interference cannot occur due to the two different quantum pathways to the two-photon state being not formed.} The realization of photon blockade in our proposal provides a viable and flexible way for the preparation of single-photon sources in the non-Hermitian optomechanical system.</description>

      <title>Parametrically-controlled microwave-photonic interface for the fluxonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Converting quantum information from stationary qubits to traveling photons enables both fast qubit initialization and efficient generation of flying qubits for redistribution of quantum information. This conversion can be performed using cavity sideband transitions. In the fluxonium, however, direct cavity sideband transitions are forbidden due to parity symmetry. Here we circumvent this parity selection rule by using a three-wave mixing element to couple the fluxonium to a resonator. We experimentally demonstrate a scheme for interfacing the fluxonium with traveling photons through microwave-induced parametric conversion. We perform fast reset on the fluxonium qubit, initializing it with &gt; 95% ground state population. We then implement controlled release and temporal shaping of a flying photon, useful for quantum state transfer and remote entanglement. The simplicity and flexibility of our demonstrated scheme enables fluxonium-based remote entanglement architectures.</description>

      <title>Experimental Hybrid Shadow Tomography and Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of quantum states is a fundamental requirement in quantum science and technology. As a promising framework, shadow tomography shows significant efficiency in estimating linear functions, however, for the challenging nonlinear ones, it requires measurements at an exponential cost. Here, we implement an advanced shadow protocol, so-called hybrid shadow~(HS) tomography, to reduce the measurement cost in the estimation of nonlinear functions in an optical system. We design and realize a deterministic quantum Fredkin gate with single photon, achieving high process fidelity of $0.935\pm0.001$. Utilizing this novel Fredkin gate, we demonstrate HS in the estimations, like the higher-order moments up to 4, and reveal that the sample complexity of HS is significantly reduced compared with the original shadow protocol. Furthermore, we utilize these higher-degree functions to implement virtual distillation, which effectively extracts a high-purity quantum state from two noisy copies. The virtual distillation is also verified in a proof-of-principle demonstration of quantum metrology, further enhancing the accuracy of parameter estimation. Our results suggest that HS is efficient in state characterization and promising for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Active robustness against the detuning-error for Rydberg quantum gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error suppression to the experimental imperfections is a central challenge for useful quantum computing. Recent studies have shown the advantages of using single-modulated pulses based on optimal control which can realize high-fidelity two-qubit gates in neutral-atom arrays. However, typical optimization only minimizes the ideal gate error in the absence of any decay, which allows the gate to be passively influenced by all error sources leading to an exponential increase of sensitivity when the error becomes larger. In the present work, we propose the realization of two-qubit CZ gates with active robustness against two-photon detuning errors. Our method depends on a modified cost function in numerical optimization for shaping gate pulses, which can minimize, not only the ideal gate error but also the fluctuations of gate infidelity over a wide error range. We introduce a family of Rydberg blockade gates with active robustness towards the impacts of versatile noise sources such as Doppler dephasing and ac Stark shifts. The resulting gates with robust pulses can significantly increase the insensitivity to any type of errors acting on the two-photon detuning, benefiting from a relaxed requirement of colder atomic temperatures or more stable lasers for current experimental technology.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Fault-Tolerance to Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard approach to universal fault-tolerant quantum computing is to develop a general purpose quantum error correction mechanism that can implement a universal set of logical gates fault-tolerantly. Given such a scheme, any quantum algorithm can be realized fault-tolerantly by composing the relevant logical gates from this set. However, we know that quantum computers provide a significant quantum advantage only for specific quantum algorithms. Hence, a universal quantum computer can likely gain from compiling such specific algorithms using tailored quantum error correction schemes. In this work, we take the first steps towards such algorithm-tailored quantum fault-tolerance. We consider Trotter circuits in quantum simulation, which is an important application of quantum computing. We develop a solve-and-stitch algorithm to systematically synthesize physical realizations of Clifford Trotter circuits on the well-known $[\![ n,n-2,2 ]\!]$ error-detecting code family. Our analysis shows that this family implements Trotter circuits with optimal depth, thereby serving as an illuminating example of tailored quantum error correction. We achieve fault-tolerance for these circuits using flag gadgets, which add minimal overhead. The solve-and-stitch algorithm has the potential to scale beyond this specific example and hence provide a principled approach to tailored fault-tolerance in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>On the generic increase of observational entropy in isolated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational entropy - a quantity that unifies Boltzmann's entropy, Gibbs' entropy, von Neumann's macroscopic entropy, and the diagonal entropy - has recently been argued to play a key role in a modern formulation of statistical mechanics. Here, relying on algebraic techniques taken from Petz's theory of statistical sufficiency and on a Levy-type concentration bound, we prove rigorous theorems showing how the observational entropy of a system undergoing a unitary evolution chosen at random tends to increase with overwhelming probability and to reach its maximum very quickly. More precisely, we show that for any observation that is sufficiently coarse with respect to the size of the system, regardless of the initial state of the system (be it pure or mixed), random evolution renders its state practically indistinguishable from the microcanonical distribution with a probability approaching one as the size of the system grows. The same conclusion holds not only for random evolutions sampled according to the unitarily invariant Haar distribution, but also for approximate 2-designs, which are thought to provide a more physically reasonable way to model random evolutions.</description>

      <title>Image Compression and Reconstruction Based on Quantum Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum network is an emerging type of network structure that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to transmit and process information. Compared with classical data reconstruction algorithms, quantum networks make image reconstruction more efficient and accurate. They can also process more complex image information using fewer bits and faster parallel computing capabilities. Therefore, this paper will discuss image reconstruction methods based on our quantum network and explore their potential applications in image processing. We will introduce the basic structure of the quantum network, the process of image compression and reconstruction, and the specific parameter training method. Through this study, we can achieve a classical image reconstruction accuracy of 97.57\%. Our quantum network design will introduce novel ideas and methods for image reconstruction in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a hybrid quantum-classical approach for the $K$-Nearest Neighbour algorithm, where the information is embedded in a phase-distributed multimode coherent state with the assistance of a single photon. The task of finding the closeness between the data points is delivered by the quantum optical computer, while the sorting and class assignment are performed by a classical computer. We provide the quantum optical architecture corresponding to our algorithm. The subordinate optical network is validated by numerical simulation. We also optimize the computational resources of the algorithm in the context of space, energy requirements and gate complexity. Applications are presented for diverse and well-known public benchmarks and synthesized data sets.</description>

      <title>Generic free fermions with nearest neighbour interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generic free fermions are free fermions with a single particle spectrum that satisfies the $q$ no resonance condition, i.e., where equal sums of single-particle energies are unique. This property guaranties that they have no degeneracies and gives them relaxation properties more similar to those of generic systems. In this article we provide a minimal example of a generic free fermionic model with nearest neighbour interactions -- a tight-binding model with complex hopping. Using some standard results from number theory we prove that this model fulfils the $q$ no resonance condition when the number of lattice sites is prime. Whenever this is not the case one can recover the $q$ no resonance condition by adding hopping terms between sites corresponding to the divisors of the number of sites. We further discuss its many-body spectral statistics and show that local probes -- like the ratio of consecutive level spacings -- look very similar to what is expected for the Poisson statistics. We however demonstrate that free fermion models can never have Poisson statistics with an analysis of the moments of the spectral form factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently developed approach to the thermodynamics of open quantum systems, on the basis of the principle of minimal dissipation, is applied to the spin-boson model. Employing a numerically exact quantum dynamical treatment based on the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we investigate the influence of the environment on quantities such as work, heat and entropy production in a range of parameters which go beyond the weak-coupling limit and include both the non-adiabatic and the adiabatic regimes. The results reveal significant differences to the weak-coupling forms of work, heat and entropy production, which are analyzed in some detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cost of classical simulations of quantum many-body dynamics is often determined by the amount of entanglement in the system. In this paper, we study entanglement in stochastic quantum trajectory approaches that solve master equations describing open quantum system dynamics. First, we introduce and compare adaptive trajectory unravelings of master equations. Specifically, building on Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 243601 (2022)], we study several greedy algorithms that generate trajectories with a low average entanglement entropy. Second, we consider various conventional unravelings of a one-dimensional open random Brownian circuit and locate the transition points from area- to volume-law-entangled trajectories. Third, we compare various trajectory unravelings using matrix product states with a direct integration of the master equation using matrix product operators. We provide concrete examples of dynamics, for which the simulation cost of stochastic trajectories is exponentially smaller than the one of matrix product operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally and theoretically study the formation of dressed states emerging from strong collective coupling of the narrow intercombination line of Yb atoms to a single mode of a high-finesse optical cavity. By permanently trapping and cooling the Yb atoms during their interaction with the cavity, we gain continuous experimental access to the dressed states. This allows us to detect both their field and their atomic properties, by simultaneously measuring the steady-state cavity transmission and free-space fluorescence. By varying the cavity and probe frequencies, we observe coupled atom-cavity states with atom number-dependent splitting, the hallmark of collective strong coupling of the atoms with the single cavity mode. We find additional fluorescence output at atomic resonance, which we explain by the effects of dephasing and inhomogeneous broadening. We compare our experimental results with a theoretical model and find good qualitative agreement.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle cooling algorithms for quantum many-body state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing correlated states of many-body systems is one of the central tasks for quantum simulators and processors. A promising approach to state preparation is to realize desired correlated states as steady states of engineered dissipative evolution. A recent experiment with a Google superconducting quantum processor [X. Mi et al., Science 383, 1332 (2024)] demonstrated a cooling algorithm utilizing auxiliary degrees of freedom that are periodically reset to remove quasiparticles from the system, thereby driving it towards the ground state. We develop a kinetic theory framework to describe quasiparticle cooling dynamics, and employ it to compare the efficiency of different cooling algorithms. In particular, we introduce a protocol where coupling to auxiliaries is modulated in time to minimize heating processes, and demonstrate that it allows a high-fidelity preparation of ground states in different quantum phases. We verify the validity of the kinetic theory description by an extensive comparison with numerical simulations of a 1d transverse-field Ising model using a solvable model and tensor-network techniques. Further, the effect of noise, which limits efficiency of variational quantum algorithms in near-term quantum processors, can be naturally described within the kinetic theory. We investigate the steady state quasiparticle population as a function of noise strength, and establish maximum noise values for achieving high-fidelity ground states. This work establishes quasiparticle cooling algorithms as a practical, robust method for many-body state preparation on near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Boolean Matching Reversible Circuits: Algorithm and Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean matching is an important problem in logic synthesis and verification. Despite being well-studied for conventional Boolean circuits, its treatment for reversible logic circuits remains largely, if not completely, missing. This work provides the first such study. Given two (black-box) reversible logic circuits that are promised to be matchable, we check their equivalences under various input/output negation and permutation conditions subject to the availability/unavailability of their inverse circuits. Notably, among other results, we show that the equivalence up to input negation and permutation is solvable in quantum polynomial time, while its classical complexity is exponential. This result is arguably the first demonstration of quantum exponential speedup in solving design automation problems. Also, as a negative result, we show that the equivalence up to both input and output negations is not solvable in quantum polynomial time unless UNIQUE-SAT is, which is unlikely. This work paves the theoretical foundation of Boolean matching reversible circuits for potential applications, e.g., in quantum circuit synthesis.</description>

      <title>Qubit dynamics driven by smooth pulses of finite duration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the dynamics of a qubit driven by a pulsed field of finite duration. The pulse shape starts and ends linearly in time. The most typical example of such a shape is the sine function between two of its nodes, but several other pulse shapes are also studied. All of them present smooth alternatives to the commonly used rectangular pulse shape, resulting in much weaker power broadening, much faster vanishing wings in the excitation line profile and hence much reduced sidebands. In the same time, such shapes with a well-defined finite duration do not suffer from the spurious effects arising when truncating a pulse of infinite duration, e.g. Gaussian. We derive two approximate analytic solutions which describe the ensuing quantum dynamics. Both approximations assume that the field changes linearly at the beginning and the end of the driving pulse, and adiabatically in between. The first approximation matches the linear and adiabatic parts at an appropriate instant of time and is expressed in terms of Weber's parabolic cylinder functions. The second, much simpler, approximation uses the asymptotics of the Weber function in order to replace it by simpler functions, and some additional transformations. Both approximations prove highly accurate when compared to experimental data obtained with two of the IBM Quantum processors. Both the greatly reduced power broadening and the greatly suppressed sidebands are observed for all pulse shapes, in a nearly complete agreement between theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Area laws from classical entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The area law-like scaling of local quantum entropies is the central characteristic of the entanglement inherent in quantum fields, many-body systems, and spacetime. Whilst the area law is primarily associated with the entanglement structure of the underlying quantum state, we here show that it equally manifests in classical entropies over measurement distributions when vacuum contributions dictated by the uncertainty principle are subtracted. Using the examples of the Gaussian ground and thermal states, but also the non-Gaussian particle state of a relativistic scalar field, we present analytical and numerical area laws for the entropies of various distributions and unveil how quantities of widespread interest such as the central charge and the (local) temperature are encoded in classical observables. With our approach, quantum entropies are no longer necessary to probe quantum phenomena, thereby rendering area laws and other quantum features directly accessible to theoretical models of high complexity as well as state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Subtraction and Addition of Propagating Photons by Two-Level Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent manipulation of quantum states of light is key to photonic quantum information processing. In this Letter, we show that a passive two-level nonlinearity suffices to implement non-Gaussian quantum operations on propagating field modes. In particular, the collective light-matter interaction can efficiently extract a single photon from a multi-photon input wave packet to an orthogonal temporal mode. We accurately describe the single-photon subtraction process by elements of an intuitive quantum-trajectory model. By employing this process, quantum information protocols gain orders of magnitude improved efficiency over heralded schemes with linear optics. The reverse process can be used to add photons one-by-one to a single wave-packet mode and compose arbitrarily large Fock states with a finite total success probability $&gt;96.7\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor has established itself as a general framework for the analysis and detection of equilibrium phase transitions in isolated quantum systems. We propose a novel generalization of the quantum geometric tensor, which offers a universal approach to studying phase transitions in non-Hermitian quantum systems. Our generalization is based on the concept of the generator of adiabatic transformations and can be applied to systems described by either a Liouvillian superoperator or by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We illustrate the proposed method by analyzing the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and a generic quasi-free dissipative fermionic system with a quadratic Liouvillian. Our findings reveal that this method effectively identifies phase transitions across all examined models, providing a universal tool for investigating general non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermophoresis is the migration of a particle due to a thermal gradient. Here, we theoretically uncover the quantum version of thermophoresis. As a proof of principle, we analytically find a thermophoretic force on a trapped quantum particle having three energy levels in $\Lambda$ configuration. We then consider a model of N sites, each coupled to its first neighbors and subjected to a local bath at a certain temperature, so as to show numerically how quantum thermophoresis behaves with increasing delocalization of the quantum particle. We discuss how negative thermophoresis and the Dufour effect appear in the quantum regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: False vacuum decay and nucleation offer the opportunity to study non-equilibrium dynamical phenomena in quantum many-body systems with confinement. Recent work has examined false vacuum decay in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spins and superfluids. In this paper, we study false vacuum nucleation dynamics in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with Rydberg interactions, using both numerical simulations and analytic modeling. We apply a staggered local detuning field to generate the false and true vacuum states. Our efforts focus on two dynamical regimes: decay and annealing. In the first, we corroborate the phenomenological decay rate scaling and determine the associated parameter range for the decay process; in the second, we uncover and elucidate a procedure to anneal the false vacuum from the initial to the final system, with intermediate nucleation events. We further propose experimental protocols to prepare the required states and perform quenches on near-term neutral atom quantum simulators, examining the experimental feasibility of our proposed setup and parameter regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastable false vacuum states arise in a range of quantum systems and can be observed in various dynamical scenarios, including decay, bubble nucleation, and long-lived oscillations. False vacuum phenomenology has been examined in quantum many-body systems, notably in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spin systems and superfluids. In this paper, we study long-lived oscillations of false and true vacuum states in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with long-range Rydberg interactions. We use a staggered local detuning field to achieve confinement. Using theoretical and numerical models, we identify novel spectral signatures of quasiparticle oscillations distinct to antiferromagnetic neutral atom systems and interpret them using a classical energy model of deconfinement from Rydberg tails. Finally, we evaluate the experimental accessibility of our proposed setup on current neutral-atom platforms and discuss experimental feasibility and constraints.</description>

      <title>Mass-Assisted Local Deconfinement in a Confined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a prominent phenomenon in condensed matter and high-energy physics that has recently become the focus of quantum-simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). As such, a theoretical understanding of the effect of confinement on LGT dynamics is not only of fundamental importance, but can lend itself to upcoming experiments. Here, we show how confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT can be \textit{locally} avoided by proximity to a resonance between the fermion mass and the electric field strength. Furthermore, we show that this local deconfinement can become global for certain initial conditions, where information transport occurs over the entire chain. In addition, we show how this can lead to strong quantum many-body scarring starting in different initial states. Our findings provide deeper insights into the nature of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs and can be tested on current and near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>On the electromagnetic interaction and the anomalous term in the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of vectorial mesons embedded in an electromagnetic field via Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) formalism is reinvestigated. Considering the electromagnetic interaction as a minimal coupling, an incorrect value $(g=1)$ is identified for the gyromagnetic factor ($g$-factor). Furthermore, it is shown that is cumbersome to find analytical solutions due to the presence of the so-called anomalous term for the spin-1 sector of the DKP theory. Suspecting that the anomalous term results from an incomplete version of the DKP equation to describe the electromagnetic interaction, we consider the addition of a non-minimal coupling. This leads to the correct $g$-factor $(g=2)$, and as a consequence, the anomalous term becomes proportional to an external four current. As an application, the DKP equation with a static uniform magnetic field is considered, yielding the corresponding Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Satisfiability of commutative vs. non-commutative CSPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mermin-Peres magic square is a celebrated example of a system of Boolean linear equations that is not (classically) satisfiable but is satisfiable via linear operators on a Hilbert space of dimension four. A natural question is then, for what kind of problems such a phenomenon occurs? Atserias, Kolaitis, and Severini answered this question for all Boolean Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs): For 2-SAT, Horn-SAT, and Dual Horn-SAT, classical satisfiability and operator satisfiability is the same and thus there is no gap; for all other Boolean CSPs, the two notions differ as there is a gap, i.e., there are unsatisfiable instances that are satisfied via operators on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. We generalize their result to CSPs on arbitrary finite domains: CSPs of so-called bounded-width have no satisfiability gap, whereas all other CSPs have a satisfiability gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an adaptation of Entanglement Renormalization for quantum field theories that, through the use of discrete wavelet transforms, strongly parallels the tensor network architecture of the \emph{Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz} (a.k.a. MERA). Our approach, called wMERA, has several advantages of over previous attempts to adapt MERA to continuum systems. In particular, (i) wMERA is formulated directly in position space, hence preserving the quasi-locality and sparsity of entanglers; and (ii) it enables a built-in RG flow in the implementation of real-time evolution and in computations of correlation functions, which is key for efficient numerical implementations. As examples, we describe in detail two concrete implementations of our wMERA algorithm for free scalar and fermionic theories in (1+1) spacetime dimensions. Possible avenues for constructing wMERAs for interacting field theories are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms developed to solve many-body quantum problems, like tensor networks, can turn into powerful quantum-inspired tools to tackle problems in the classical domain. In this work, we focus on matrix product operators, a prominent numerical technique to study many-body quantum systems, especially in one dimension. It has been previously shown that such a tool can be used for classification, learning of deterministic sequence-to-sequence processes and of generic quantum processes. We further develop a matrix product operator algorithm to learn probabilistic sequence-to-sequence processes and apply this algorithm to probabilistic cellular automata. This new approach can accurately learn probabilistic cellular automata processes in different conditions, even when the process is a probabilistic mixture of different chaotic rules. In addition, we find that the ability to learn these dynamics is a function of the bit-wise difference between the rules and whether one is much more likely than the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement generation or harvesting between two identical Unruh-DeWitt detectors in the cosmological de Sitter spacetime. We consider two comoving two-level detectors at a coincident spatial position. The detectors are assumed to be unentangled initially. The detectors are individually coupled to a scalar field, which eventually leads to coupling between the two detectors. We consider two kinds of scalar fields -- conformally symmetric and massless minimally coupled, for both real and complex cases. By tracing out the degrees of freedom corresponding to the scalar field, we construct the reduced density matrix for the two detectors, whose eigenvalues characterise transitions between the energy levels of the detectors. By using the existing results for the detector response functions per unit proper time for these fields, we next compute the logarithmic negativity, quantifying the degree of entanglement generated at late times between the two detectors. The similarities and differences of these results for different kind of scalar fields have been discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In metals and semiconductors, an impurity spin is quantum entangled with and thereby screened by surrounding conduction electrons at low temperatures, called the Kondo screening cloud. Quantum confinement of the Kondo screening cloud in a region, called a Kondo box, with a length smaller than the original cloud extension length strongly deforms the screening cloud and provides a way of controlling the entanglement. Here we realize such a Kondo box and develop an approach to controlling and monitoring the entanglement. It is based on a spin localized in a semiconductor quantum dot, which is screened by conduction electrons along a quasi-one-dimensional channel. The box is formed between the dot and a quantum point contact placed on a channel. As the quantum point contact is tuned to make the confinement stronger, electron conductance through the dot as a function of temperature starts to deviate from the known universal function of the single energy scale, the Kondo temperature. Nevertheless, the entanglement is monitored by the measured conductance according to our theoretical development. The dependence of the monitored entanglement on the confinement strength and temperature implies that the Kondo screening is controlled by tuning the quantum point contact. Namely, the Kondo cloud is deformed by the Kondo box in the region across the original cloud length. Our findings offer a way of manipulating and detecting spatially extended quantum many-body entanglement in solids by electrical means.</description>

      <title>Diamond surfaces with lateral gradients for systematic optimization of surface chemistry for relaxometry -- A low pressure plasma-based approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamond is increasingly popular because of its unique material properties. Diamond defects called nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers allow measurements with unprecedented sensitivity. However, to achieve ideal sensing performance NV centers need to be within nanometers from the surface and are thus strongly dependent on the local surface chemistry. Several attempts have been made to compare diamond surfaces. However, due to the high price of diamond crystals with shallow NV centers, a limited number of chemical modifications have been studied. Here, we developed a systematic method to investigate a continuity of different local environments with a varying density and nature of surface groups in a single experiment on a single diamond plate. To achieve this goal, we used diamonds with a shallow ensemble of NV centers and introduced a chemical gradient across the surface. More specifically we used air and hydrogen plasma. The gradients were formed by low pressure plasma treatment after masking with a right-angled triangular prism shield. As a result, the surface contained gradually more oxygen/hydrogen towards the open end of the shield. We then performed widefield relaxometry to determine the effect of surface chemistry on the sensing performance. As expected, relaxation times and thus sensing performance indeed varies along the gradient.</description>

      <title>Protecting gauge symmetries in the the dynamics of SU(3) lattice gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of the dynamics of a lattice gauge theory demands imposing on-site constraints. Ideally, the dynamics remain confined within the physical Hilbert space, where all the states satisfy those constraints. For non-Abelian gauge theories, implementing local constraints is non-trivial, as is keeping the dynamics confined in the physical Hilbert space, considering the erroneous quantum devices. SU(3) gauge group, albeit crucial for describing the strong interaction of nature, is notorious for studying via Hamiltonian simulation. This work presents a couple of symmetry protection protocols for simulating the exact dynamics of SU(3) gauge theory in $1+1$ dimension. The first protocol doesn't require imposing any local symmetry but relies on protecting global symmetries, which are Abelian with a preferred choice of framework, namely the loop-string-hadron framework. Generalization to a higher dimension is possible, however, the protection scheme needs to be local for that case but is still Abelian and thus advantageous. The symmetry protection schemes presented here are important steps towards quantum simulating the full theory of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Abnormal solutions of Bethe--Salpeter equation with massless and massive exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize the main properties of the so called ''abnormal solutions'' of the Wick--Cutkosky model, i.e. two massive scalar particles interacting via massless scalar exchange ("photons"), within the Bethe--Salpeter equation. These solutions do not exist in the non-relativistic limit, in spite of having very small binding energies. They present a genuine many-body character dominated by photons, with a norm of the valence constituent wave function (two-body norm) that vanishes in the limit of zero binding energy.
  We present new results concerning the massive-exchange case, in particular determine under which conditions is it possible to obtain such peculiar solutions without spoiling the model by tachyonic states ($M^2&lt;0$).</description>

Abstract: In this paper we discuss how to use arborescent knots to construct entangled multi-qubit states. We show that Bell-states, GHZ-states and cluster states can be constructed from such knots. The latter are particularly interesting since they form a base for the measurement-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Theory of Mobility Rings in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through Avila global theorem, we analytically study the non-Hermitian mobility edge. The results show that the mobility edge in non-Hermitian systems has a ring structure, which we named as "mobility ring". Furthermore, we carry out numerical analysis of the eigenenergy spectra in several typical cases, and the consistence of the numerical results with the analytical expression proves the correctness and universality of the mobility ring theory. Further, based on the analytical expression, we discuss the properties of multiple mobility rings. Finally, we compare the results of mobility rings with that of dual transformations, and find that although the self-dual method can give the interval of real eigenvalues corresponding to the extended states, it can not fully display the mobility edge information in the complex plane. The mobility ring theory proposed in this paper is universal for all non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Extended unitarity and absence of skin effect in periodically driven systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most striking features of non-Hermitian quasiperiodic systems with arbitrarily small asymmetry in the hopping amplitudes and open boundaries is the accumulation of all the bulk eigenstates at one of the edges of the system, termed in literature as the skin effect, below a critical strength of the potential. In this Letter, we uncover that a time-periodic drive in such systems can eliminate the SE up to a finite strength of this asymmetry. Remarkably, the critical value for the onset of SE is independent of the driving frequency and approaches to the static behavior in the thermodynamic limit. We find that the absence of SE is intricately linked to the emergence of extended unitarity in the delocalized phase, providing dynamical stability to the system. Interestingly, under periodic boundary condition, our non-Hermitian system can be mapped to a Hermitian analogue in the large driving frequency limit that leads to the extended unitarity irrespective of the hopping asymmetry and the strength of the quasiperiodic potential, in stark contrast to the static limit. Additionally, we numerically verify that this behavior persists Based on our findings, we propose a possible experimental realization of our driven system, which could be used as a switch to control the light funneling mechanism.</description>

      <title>Area laws and thermalization from classical entropies in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling of local quantum entropies is of utmost interest for characterizing quantum fields, many-body systems, and gravity. Despite their importance, theoretically and experimentally accessing quantum entropies is challenging as they are nonlinear functionals of the underlying quantum state. Here, we show that suitably chosen classical entropies capture the very same features as their quantum analogs for an experimentally relevant setting. We describe the post-quench dynamics of a multi-well spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate from an initial product state via measurement distributions of spin observables and estimate the corresponding entropies using the asymptotically unbiased k-nearest neighbor method. We observe the dynamical build-up of quantum correlations signaled by an area law, as well as local thermalization revealed by a transition to a volume law, both in regimes characterized by non-Gaussian distributions. We emphasize that all relevant features can be observed at small sample numbers without assuming a specific functional form of the distributions, rendering our method directly applicable to a large variety of models and experimental platforms.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the information extractable from measurement distributions of two non-commuting spin observables in a multi-well spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. We provide a variety of analytic and numerical evidence that suitably chosen classical entropies and classical mutual informations thereof contain the typical feature of quantum entropies known in quantum field theories, that is, the area law, even in the non-Gaussian regime and for a non-zero temperature. Towards a feasible experimental implementation, we estimate entropic quantities from a finite number of samples without any additional assumptions on the underlying quantum state using k-nearest neighbor estimators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate elementary excitations of dipolar quantum gases across the superfluid to supersolid phase transition in a toroidal trap. We show how decoupled first sound, second sound, and Higgs modes emerge by following their origin from superfluid modes across the transition. The structure of these excitations reveals the interplay between crystal and superfluid oscillations. Our results unify previous notions of coupled Goldstone and Higgs modes in harmonic traps, allowing us to establish a correspondence between excitations of trapped and infinitely extended supersolids. We propose protocols for selectively probing these sound and amplitude modes, accessible to state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Supersymmetric Systems and the Cohomology Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.00011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the complexity of the local Hamiltonian problem in the context of fermionic Hamiltonians with $\mathcal N=2 $ supersymmetry and show that the problem remains $\mathsf{QMA}$-complete. Our main motivation for studying this is the well-known fact that the ground state energy of a supersymmetric system is exactly zero if and only if a certain cohomology group is nontrivial. This opens the door to bringing the tools of Hamiltonian complexity to study the computational complexity of a large number of algorithmic problems that arise in homological algebra, including problems in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and group theory. We take the first steps in this direction by introducing the $k$-local Cohomology problem and showing that it is $\mathsf{QMA}_1$-hard and, for a large class of instances, is contained in $\mathsf{QMA}$. We then consider the complexity of estimating normalized Betti numbers and show that this problem is hard for the quantum complexity class $\mathsf{DQC}1$, and for a large class of instances is contained in $\mathsf{BQP}$. In light of these results, we argue that it is natural to frame many of these homological problems in terms of finding ground states of supersymmetric fermionic systems. As an illustration of this perspective we discuss in some detail the model of Fendley, Schoutens, and de Boer consisting of hard-core fermions on a graph, whose ground state structure encodes $l$-dimensional holes in the independence complex of the graph. This offers a new perspective on existing quantum algorithms for topological data analysis and suggests new ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In distributed computing, a Byzantine fault is a condition where a component behaves inconsistently, showing different symptoms to different components of the system. Consensus among the correct components can be reached by appropriately crafted communication protocols even in the presence of byzantine faults. Quantum-aided protocols built upon distributed entangled quantum states are worth considering, as they are more resilient than traditional ones. Based on earlier ideas, here we establish a parameter-dependent family of quantum-aided weak broadcast protocols. We compute upper bounds on the failure probability of the protocol, and define and illustrate a procedure that minimizes the quantum resource requirements. Following earlier work demonstrating the suitability of noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices for the study of quantum networks, we experimentally create our resource quantum state on publicly available quantum computers. Our work highlights important engineering aspects of the future deployment of quantum communication protocols with multi-qubit entangled states.</description>

      <title>Geometric relative entropies and barycentric R\'enyi divergences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14282v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give systematic ways of defining monotone quantum relative entropies and (multi-variate) quantum R\'enyi divergences starting from a set of monotone quantum relative entropies.
  Despite its central importance in information theory, only two additive and monotone quantum extensions of the classical relative entropy have been known so far, the Umegaki and the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropies. Here we give a general procedure to construct monotone and additive quantum relative entropies from a given one with the same properties; in particular, when starting from the Umegaki relative entropy, this gives a new one-parameter family of monotone and additive quantum relative entropies interpolating between the Umegaki and the Belavkin-Staszewski ones on full-rank states.
  In a different direction, we use a generalization of a classical variational formula to define multi-variate quantum R\'enyi quantities corresponding to any finite set of quantum relative entropies $(D^{q_x})_{x\in X}$ and signed probability measure $P$, as $$ Q_P^{\mathrm{b},\mathbf{q}}((\rho_x)_{x\in X}):=\sup_{\tau\ge 0}\left\{\text{Tr}\,\tau-\sum_xP(x)D^{q_x}(\tau\|\rho_x)\right\}. $$ We show that monotone quantum relative entropies define monotone R\'enyi quantities whenever $P$ is a probability measure. With the proper normalization, the negative logarithm of the above quantity gives a quantum extension of the classical R\'enyi $\alpha$-divergence in the 2-variable case ($X=\{0,1\}$, $P(0)=\alpha$). We show that if both $D^{q_0}$ and $D^{q_1}$ are monotone and additive quantum relative entropies, and at least one of them is strictly larger than the Umegaki relative entropy then the resulting barycentric R\'enyi divergences are strictly between the log-Euclidean and the maximal R\'enyi divergences, and hence they are different from any previously studied quantum R\'enyi divergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction strength of an oscillator to a qubit grows with the oscillator's vacuum field fluctuations. The well known degenerate parametric oscillator has revived interest in the regime of strongly detuned squeezing, where its eigenstates are squeezed Fock states. Owing to these amplified field fluctuations, it was recently proposed that squeezing this oscillator would dynamically boost qubit-photon interactions. In a superconducting circuit experiment, we observe a two-fold increase in the dispersive interaction between a qubit and an oscillator at 5.5 dB of squeezing, demonstrating in-situ dynamical control of qubit-photon interactions. This work initiates the experimental coupling of oscillators of squeezed photons to qubits, and cautiously motivates their dissemination in experimental platforms seeking enhanced interactions.</description>

      <title>Remote detectability from entanglement bootstrap I: Kirby's torus trick</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote detectability is often taken as a physical assumption in the study of topologically ordered systems, and it is a central axiom of mathematical frameworks of topological quantum field theories. We show under the entanglement bootstrap approach that remote detectability is a necessary property; that is, we derive it as a theorem. Starting from a single wave function on a topologically-trivial region satisfying the entanglement bootstrap axioms, we can construct states on closed manifolds. The crucial technique is to immerse the punctured manifold into the topologically trivial region and then heal the puncture. This is analogous to Kirby's torus trick. We then analyze a special class of such manifolds, which we call pairing manifolds. For each pairing manifold, which pairs two classes of excitations, we identify an analog of the topological $S$-matrix. This pairing matrix is unitary, which implies remote detectability between two classes of excitations. These matrices are in general not associated with the mapping class group of the manifold. As a by-product, we can count excitation types (e.g., graph excitations in 3+1d). The pairing phenomenon occurs in many physical contexts, including systems in different dimensions, with or without gapped boundaries. We provide a variety of examples to illustrate its scope.</description>

Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transition arises from the competition between a deterministic quantum evolution and a repeated measurement process. We explore the measurement-induced phase transition through the Quantum Fisher Information in two different metrological scenarios. We demonstrate through the scaling behavior of the quantum Fisher information the transition of the multi-partite entanglement across the phases. In analogy with standard quantum phase transition, we reveal signature of a measurement-induced phase transition in the non-analytic behaviour of the quantum Fisher information as the measurement strength approaches the critical value. Our results offer novel insights into the features of a quantum systems undergoing measurement-induced phase transition and indicate potential avenues for further exploration in the field of quantum physics.</description>

Abstract: The study of quantum information processing seeks to characterize the resources that enable quantum information processing to perform tasks that are unfeasible or inefficient for classical information processing. Quantum cryptography is one such task, and researchers have identified entanglement as a sufficient resource for secure key generation. However, quantum discord, another type of quantum correlation beyond entanglement, has been found to be necessary for guaranteeing secure communication due to its direct relation to information leakage. Despite this, it is a long-standing problem how to make use of discord to analyze security in a specific quantum cryptography protocol. Here, based on our proposed quantum discord witness recently, we successfully address this issue by considering a BB84-like quantum key distribution protocol and its equivalent entanglement-based version. Our method is robust against imperfections in qubit sources and qubit measurements as well as basis misalignment due to quantum channels, which results in a better key rate than standard BB84 protocol. Those advantages are experimentally demonstrated via photonic phase encoding systems, which shows the practicality of our results.</description>

      <title>Leakage Benchmarking for Universal Gate Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Errors are common issues in quantum computing platforms, among which leakage is one of the most challenging to address. This is because leakage, i.e., the loss of information stored in the computational subspace to undesired subspaces in a larger Hilbert space, is more difficult to detect and correct than errors that preserve the computational subspace. As a result, leakage presents a significant obstacle to the development of fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate benchmarking framework called leakage randomized benchmarking (LRB) for measuring leakage rates on multi-qubit quantum systems. Our approach is more insensitive to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) noise than existing leakage benchmarking protocols, requires fewer assumptions about the gate set itself, and can be used to benchmark multi-qubit leakages, which was not done previously. We also extend the LRB protocol to an interleaved variant called interleaved LRB (iLRB), which can benchmark the average leakage rate of generic $n$-site quantum gates with reasonable noise assumptions. We demonstrate the iLRB protocol on benchmarking generic two-qubit gates realized using flux tuning, and analyze the behavior of iLRB under corresponding leakage models. Our numerical experiments show good agreement with theoretical estimations, indicating the feasibility of both the LRB and iLRB protocols.

      <title>Wigner and friends, a map is not the territory! Contextuality in multi-agent paradoxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07792v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent scenarios, like Wigner's friend and Frauchiger-Renner scenarios, can show contradictory results when a non-classical formalism must deal with the knowledge between agents. Such paradoxes are described with multi-modal logic as violations of the structure in classical logic. Even if knowledge is treated in a relational way with the concept of trust, contradictory results can still be found in multi-agent scenarios. Contextuality deals with global inconsistencies in empirical models defined on measurement scenarios even when there is local consistency. In the present work, we take a step further to treat the scenarios in full relational language by using knowledge operators, thus showing that trust is equivalent to the Truth Axiom in these cases. A translation of measurement scenarios into multi-agent scenarios by using the topological semantics of multi-modal logic is constructed, demonstrating that logical contextuality can be understood as the violation of soundness by supposing mutual knowledge. To address the contradictions, assuming distributed knowledge is considered, which eliminates such violations but at the cost of lambda-dependence. We conclude by translating the main examples of multi-agent scenarios to their empirical model representation, contextuality is identified as the cause of their contradictory results.</description>

Abstract: According to the pioneering work of Nielsen and collaborators, the length of the minimal geodesic in a geometric realization of a suitable operator space provides a measure of the quantum complexity of an operation. Compared with the original concept of complexity based on the minimal number of gates required to construct the desired operation as a product, this geometrical approach amounts to a more concrete and computable definition, but its evaluation is nontrivial in systems with a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The geometrical formulation can more easily be evaluated by considering the geometry associated with a suitable finite-dimensional group generated by a small number of relevant operators of the system. In this way, the method has been applied in particular to the harmonic oscillator, which is also of interest in the present paper. However, subtle and previously unrecognized issues of group theory can lead to unforeseen complications, motivating a new formulation that remains on the level of the underlying Lie algebras for most of the required steps. Novel insights about complexity can thereby be found in a low-dimensional setting, with the potential of systematic extensions to higher dimensions as well as interactions. Specific examples include the quantum complexity of various target unitary operators associated with a harmonic oscillator, inverted harmonic oscillator, and coupled harmonic oscillators. The generality of this approach is demonstrated by an application to an anharmonic oscillator with a cubic term.</description>

Abstract: Communication scenarios between two parties can be implemented by first encoding messages into some states of a physical system which acts as the physical medium of the communication and then decoding the messages by measuring the state of the system. We show that already in the simplest possible scenarios it is possible to detect a definite, unbounded advantage of quantum systems over classical systems. We do this by constructing a family of operationally meaningful communication tasks each of which on one hand can be implemented by using just a single qubit but which on the other hand require unboundedly larger classical system for classical implementation. Furthemore, we show that even though with the additional resource of shared randomness the proposed communication tasks can be implemented by both quantum and classical systems of the same size, the number of coordinated actions needed for the classical implementation also grows unboundedly. In particular, no finite storage can be used to store all the coordinated actions needed to implement all the possible quantum communication tasks with classical systems. As a consequence, shared randomness cannot be viewed as a free resource.</description>

      <title>Polarization-entangled quantum frequency comb from a silicon nitride microring resonator</title>

Abstract: Integrated microresonator facilitates the realization of quantum frequency comb (QFC), which provides a large number of discrete frequency modes with broadband spectral range and narrow linewidth. However, all previous demonstrations have focused on the generation of energy-time or time-bin entangled photons from QFC. Realizing polarization-entangled quantum frequency comb, which is the important resource for fundamental study of quantum mechanics and quantum information applications, remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, a broadband polarization-entangled quantum frequency comb by combining an integrated silicon nitride micro-resonator with a Sagnac interferometer. With a free spectral range of about 99 GHz and a narrow linewidth of about 190 MHz, our source provides 22 polarization entangled photons pairs with frequency covering the whole telecom C-band. The entanglement fidelities for all 22 pairs are above 81%, including 17 pairs with fidelities higher than 90%. Our demonstration paves the way for employing the polarization-entangled quantum frequency comb in quantum network using CMOS technology as well as standard dense wavelength division multiplexing technology.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds on Pauli channel learning without entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource for learning properties from nature, but a precise characterization of its advantage can be challenging. In this work, we consider learning algorithms without entanglement to be those that only utilize states, measurements, and operations that are separable between the main system of interest and an ancillary system. Interestingly, we show that these algorithms are equivalent to those that apply quantum circuits on the main system interleaved with mid-circuit measurements and classical feedforward. Within this setting, we prove a tight lower bound for Pauli channel learning without entanglement that closes the gap between the best-known upper and lower bound. In particular, we show that $\Theta(2^n\varepsilon^{-2})$ rounds of measurements are required to estimate each eigenvalue of an $n$-qubit Pauli channel to $\varepsilon$ error with high probability when learning without entanglement. In contrast, a learning algorithm with entanglement only needs $\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2})$ copies of the Pauli channel. The tight lower bound strengthens the foundation for an experimental demonstration of entanglement-enhanced advantages for Pauli noise characterization.</description>

      <title>Error-mitigated fermionic classical shadows on noisy quantum devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently estimating fermionic Hamiltonian expectation values is vital for simulating various physical systems. Classical shadow (CS) algorithms offer a solution by reducing the number of quantum state copies needed, but noise in quantum devices poses challenges. We propose an error-mitigated CS algorithm assuming gate-independent, time-stationary, and Markovian (GTM) noise. For $n$-qubit systems, our algorithm, which employs the easily prepared initial state $|0^n\rangle\!\langle 0^n|$ assumed to be noiseless, efficiently estimates $k$-RDMs with $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(kn^k)$ state copies and $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt{n})$ calibration measurements for GTM noise with constant fidelities. We show that our algorithm is robust against noise types like depolarizing, damping, and $X$-rotation noise with constant strengths, showing scalings akin to prior CS algorithms for fermions but with better noise resilience. Numerical simulations confirm our algorithm's efficacy in noisy settings, suggesting its viability for near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>From port-based teleportation to Frobenius reciprocity theorem: partially reduced irreducible representations and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the connection of two concepts as induced representation and partially reduced irreducible representations (PRIR) appear in the context of port-based teleportation protocols. Namely, for a given finite group $G$ with arbitrary subgroup $H$, we consider a particular case of matrix irreducible representations, whose restriction to the subgroup $H$, as a matrix representation of $H$, is completely reduced to diagonal block form with an irreducible representation of $H$ in the blocks. The basic properties of such representations are given. Then as an application of this concept, we show that the spectrum of the port-based teleportation operator acting on $n$ systems is connected in a very simple way with the spectrum of the corresponding Jucys-Murphy operator for the symmetric group $S(n-1)\subset S(n)$. This shows on the technical level relation between teleporation and one of the basic objects from the point of view of the representation theory of the symmetric group. This shows a deep connection between the central object describing properties of deterministic PBT schemes and objects appearing naturally in the abstract representation theory of the symmetric group. In particular, we present a new expression for the eigenvalues of the Jucys-Murphy operators based on the irreducible characters of the symmetric group. As an additional but not trivial result, we give also purely matrix proof of the Frobenius reciprocity theorem for characters with explicit construction of the unitary matrix that realizes the reduction of the natural basis of induced representation to the reduced one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlations between the eigenenergies of a system's spectrum can be a defining feature of quantum chaos. We characterize correlations between energies for all spectral distances by studying the distributions of $k$-th neighbor level spacings ($k$nLS) and compute their associated $k$-th neighbor spectral form factor ($k$nSFF). Specifically, we find analytical expressions for these signatures in paradigmatic models of quantum chaos, namely the three Gaussian ensembles of random matrix theory, and in integrable models, taken as systems with completely uncorrelated spectra (the Poissonian ensemble). The spectral distance decomposition of the SFF allows us to probe the contribution of each individual $k$nLS to the ramp. The latter is a characteristic feature of quantum chaos, and we show how each spectral distance participates in building it -- the linear ramp cannot be formed by short-range energy correlations only. We illustrate our findings in the XXZ spin chain with disorder, which interpolates between chaotic and integrable behavior.</description>

Abstract: Krylov complexity and Nielsen complexity are successful approaches to quantifying quantum evolution complexity that have been actively pursued without much contact between the two lines of research. The two quantities are motivated by quantum chaos and quantum computation, respectively, while the relevant mathematics is as different as matrix diagonalization algorithms and geodesic flows on curved manifolds. We demonstrate that, despite these differences, there is a relation between the two quantities. Namely, the time average of Krylov complexity of state evolution can be expressed as a trace of a certain matrix, which also controls an upper bound on Nielsen complexity with a specific custom-tailored penalty schedule adapted to the Krylov basis.</description>

Abstract: Wave-particle duality is one of the most intriguing counterfactual concepts in quantum theory. In our common sense, the wave and particle properties of a quantum object are inseparable. However, the recent studies based on Quantum Cheshire Cat phenomena showed that separating the physical properties of a quantum object including wave and particle attributes from itself are possible in microscopic system described by two-state vector formalism. In this study, we put forward a feasible scheme to spatially separate the wave and particle attributes of two entangled photons by properly choosing the pre- and post-selection of path states. Our scheme also guarantees that the observation of wave and particle properties of the two entangled photons always obey the Bohr's complementarity principle.</description>

Abstract: We present experimental observations of dilute ion spin ensembles in an undoped low-loss single crystal cylindrical sample of CaWO$_4$ cooled to 30 mK in temperature. Crystal field perturbations were elucidated by constructing a dielectrically loaded microwave cavity resonator from the crystal. The resonator exhibited numerous whispering gallery modes with high Q-factors of up to $3\times 10^7$, equivalent to a low loss tangent of $\sim 3\times 10^{-8}$. The low-loss allowed precision multi-mode spectroscopy of numerous high Q-factor photon\hyp{}spin interactions. Measurements between 7 to 22 GHz revealed the presence of Gd$^{3+}$, Fe$^{3+}$, and another trace species, inferred to be rare\hyp{}earth, at concentrations on the order of parts per billion. These findings motivate further exploration of prospective uses of this low-loss dielectric material for applications regarding precision and quantum metrology, as well as tests for beyond standard model physics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider the description by a general Bell-type non-local hidden variable theory (NLHVT) of bipartite quantum states with two observables per sub-system. We derive Bell inequalities of the Collins-Gisin.-Liden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) type which involve combinations of the probabilities of related outcomes for measurements for the four pairs of sub-system observables. It is shown that the corresponding quantum theory expressions violate the Bell inequalities in the case of the maximally entangled state of the bipartitite system. The CHSH Bell inequality is also derived from this general CGLMP Bell-type non-local hidden variable theory. This shows that quantum theory can not be underpinned by a Bell-type non-local hidden variable theory. So as a general Bell-type local hidden variable theory has already been shown to conflict with quantum theory, it follows that quantum theory can not be understood in terms of any CGLMP Bell-type hidden variable theory - local or non-local.</description>

Abstract: Publicly-verifiable quantum money has been a central and challenging goal in quantum cryptography. To this day, no constructions exist based on standard assumptions. In this study, we propose an alternative notion called quantum cheques (QCs) that is more attainable and technologically feasible. A quantum cheque can be verified using a public-key but only by a single user. Specifically, the payer signs the quantum cheque for a particular recipient using their ID, and the recipient can validate it without the assistance of the bank, ensuring that the payer cannot assign the same cheque to another user with a different ID. Unlike quantum money, QCs only necessitate quantum communication when a cheque is issued by the bank, meaning all payments and deposits are entirely classical!
  We demonstrate how to construct QCs based on the well-studied learning-with-errors (LWE) assumption. In the process, we build two novel primitives which are of independent interest. Firstly, we construct signatures with publicly-verifiable deletion under LWE. This primitive enables the signing of a message $m$ such that the recipient can produce a classical string that publicly proves the inability to reproduce a signature of $m$. We then demonstrate how this primitive can be used to construct 2-message signature tokens. This primitive enables the production of a token that can be used to sign a single bit and then self-destructs. Finally, we show that 2-message signature tokens can be used to construct QCs.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuations can challenge the possibility of improving work extraction from quantum correlations. This uncertainty in the work extraction process can be addressed resorting to the expected utility hypothesis which can provide an optimal method for work extraction. We study a bipartite quantum system and examine the role of quantum correlations in a daemonic work extraction performed by certain local operations and classical communication. Specifically, we demonstrate and explain how, depending on the so-called absolute risk aversion, a non-neutral risk agent, influenced by fluctuations, views quantum correlations differently from a neutral risk agent who is affected solely by the average work.</description>

Abstract: This work uncovers a fundamental connection between doped stabilizer states, a concept from quantum information theory, and the structure of eigenstates in perturbed many-body quantum systems. We prove that for Hamiltonians consisting of a sum of commuting Pauli operators (i.e., stabilizer Hamiltonians) and a perturbation composed of a limited number of arbitrary Pauli terms, the eigenstates can be represented as doped stabilizer states with small stabilizer nullity. This result enables the application of stabilizer techniques to a broad class of many-body systems, even in highly entangled regimes. Building on this, we develop efficient classical algorithms for tasks such as finding low-energy eigenstates, simulating quench dynamics, preparing Gibbs states, and computing entanglement entropies in these systems. Our work opens up new possibilities for understanding the robustness of topological order and the dynamics of many-body systems under perturbations, paving the way for novel insights into the interplay of quantum information, entanglement, and many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we give a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving electronic structure problems of molecules using only linear quantum optical systems. The variational ansatz we proposed is a hybrid of non-interacting Boson dynamics and classical computational chemistry methods, specifically, the Hartree-Fock method and the Configuration Interaction method. The Boson part is built by a linear optical interferometer which is easier to realize compared with the well-known Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz composed of quantum gates in conventional VQE and the classical part is merely classical processing acting on the Hamiltonian. We called such ansatzes Boson Sampling-Classic (BS-C). The appearance of permanents in the Boson part has its physical intuition to provide different kinds of resources from commonly used single-, double-, and higher-excitations in classical methods and the UCC ansatz to exploring chemical quantum states. Such resources can help enhance the accuracy of methods used in the classical parts. We give a scalable hybrid homodyne and photon number measurement procedure for evaluating the energy value which has intrinsic abilities to mitigate photon loss errors and discuss the extra measurement cost induced by the no Pauli exclusion principle for Bosons with its solutions. To demonstrate our proposal, we run numerical experiments on several molecules and obtain their potential energy curves reaching chemical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Maximal Secret Reconstruction, Teleportation and Bell's Inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tripartite state is said to be a potential resource for secret sharing if the state imposes restrictions on the teleportation fidelity of the bipartite dealer--reconstructor and dealer--assistant channels in addition of being useful for the state reconstruction. Given a secret shareable state in a pure three-qubit system, we are able to characterize the set of states with maximum possible reconstruction fidelity (abbreviated as MSR states) for a fixed value of the maximum teleportation fidelity that can be obtained out of both the dealer--receiver channels. Similarly for a value giving the maximum of Bell-CHSH value of both dealer--reconstructor and dealer--assistant channels, we are able to find the maximum achievable reconstruction fidelity. Interestingly, we find that all secret shareable states satisfy Bell's inequality in both dealer--reconstructor and dealer--assistant partitions. This brings out a new mutual exclusivity between secret shareable state and Bell's inequality violations. Our result paves the way in identifying the best candidate among the secret sharing resource states in achieving the maximum reconstruction fidelity thus by setting the practical information transfer limit in a possible resource theoretic extension of secret sharing. It also brings out a new kind of mutual exclusiveness between the bipartite correlation and in the ability of secret sharing in a tripartite setting.</description>

      <title>A case study against QSVT: assessment of quantum phase estimation improved by signal processing techniques</title>

Abstract: In recent years, quantum algorithms have been proposed which use quantum phase estimation (QPE) coherently as a subroutine without measurement. In order to do this effectively, the routine must be able to distinguish eigenstates with success probability close to unity. In this paper, we provide the first systematic comparison between two approaches towards maximizing this success probability, one using the quantum singular value transform and the other leveraging window functions, which have been previously studied as priors of the phase value distribution. We find that the quantum singular value transform is significantly outclassed by the window function approach, with the latter able to achieve between 3 and 5 orders of magnitude improvement in the success probability with approximately 1/4 the query cost. Our circuit simulation results indicate that QPE is not a domain which benefits from the integration of QSVT and we show that the use of the Kaiser window function is currently the most practical choice for realizing QPE with high success probability.</description>

      <title>Temporal quantum eraser: Fusion gates with distinguishable photons</title>

Abstract: Linear-optics gates, the enabling tool of photonic quantum information processing, depend on indistinguishable photons, as they harness quantum interference to achieve nonlinear operations. Traditionally, meeting this criterion involves generating pure identical photons, a task that remains a significant challenge in the field. Yet, the required indistinguishability is linked to the spatial exchange symmetry of the multiphoton wavefunction and does not strictly necessitate identical photons. Here, we show that the ideal operation of two-photon gates, particularly fusion gates, can be recovered from distinguishable photons by ensuring the exchange symmetry of the input photonic state. To this end, we introduce a temporal quantum eraser between a pair of modally-impure single-photon sources, which heralds the symmetry of the generated two-photon state. We demonstrate this mechanism in two relevant platforms: parametric photon pair generation and single-photon extraction by a single quantum emitter. The ability to lift the requirement for identical photons bears considerable potential in linear-optics quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Can we accurately read or write quantum data?</title>

Abstract: Applications of quantum mechanics rely on the accuracy of reading and writing data. This requires accurate measurements and preparations of the quantum states. I show that accurate measurements and preparations are impossible if the total Hamiltonian is bounded from below (as thought to be in our universe). This result invites a reevaluation of the limitations of quantum control, quantum computing, and other quantum technologies dependent on the accuracy of quantum preparations and measurements, and maybe of the assumption that the Hamiltonian is bounded from below.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the ground state energy of quantum $p$-spin Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the ground state energy of quantum $p$-local spin glass random Hamiltonians, the quantum analogues of widely studied classical spin glass models. Our main result shows that the maximum energy achievable by product states has a well-defined limit (for even $p$) as $n\to\infty$ and is $E_{\text{product}}^\ast=\sqrt{2 \log p}$ in the limit of large $p$. This value is interpreted as the maximal energy of a much simpler so-called Random Energy Model, widely studied in the setting of classical spin glasses. The proof of the limit existing follows from an extension of Fekete's Lemma after we demonstrate near super-additivity of the (normalized) quenched free energy. The proof of the value follows from a second moment method on the number of states achieving a given energy when restricting to an $\epsilon$-net of product states.
  Furthermore, we relate the maximal energy achieved over all states to a $p$-dependent constant $\gamma\left(p\right)$, which is defined by the degree of violation of a certain asymptotic independence ansatz over graph matchings. We show that the maximal energy achieved by all states $E^\ast\left(p\right)$ in the limit of large $n$ is at most $\sqrt{\gamma\left(p\right)}E_{\text{product}}^\ast$. We also prove using Lindeberg's interpolation method that the limiting $E^\ast\left(p\right)$ is robust with respect to the choice of the randomness and, for instance, also applies to the case of sparse random Hamiltonians. This robustness in the randomness extends to a wide range of random Hamiltonian models including SYK and random quantum max-cut.</description>

Abstract: In relativistic theories the principle of microscopic causality states that ``information cannot travel faster than the speed of light'' \cite{kaku}. In the present work we show that the time evolution of relativistic wave functions violates this principle. We consider here the wave functions of massless and massive particles. In the case of massless particles the wave functions which violate the microscopic causality have an analytic form while in the case of massive particles we have to rely on numerical calculations. In both cases the wave functions which are strictly localized at $t=0$, at later times do not vanish {\it outside} the future light cone. \end{abstract}</description>

Abstract: For open quantum systems,a short-time evolution is usually well described by the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians,while long-time dynamics requires the Lindblad master equation,in which the Liouvillian superoperators characterize the time evolution. In this paper, we constructed an open system by adding suitable gain and loss operators to the Chen insulator to investigate the time evolution of quantum states at long times by numerical simulations.Finally,we also propose a topolectrical circuits to realize the dissipative system for experimental observation. It is found found that the opening and closing of the Liouvillian gap leads to different damping behaviours of the system and that the presence of non-Hermitian skin effects leads to a phenomenon of chiral damping with sharp wavefronts.Our study deepens the understanding of quantum dynamics of dissipative system.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of bit-flip qubits under random telegraph noise for low and high temperature measurement application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.05493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving small error for qubit gate operations under random telegraph noise (RTN) is of great interest for potential applications in quantum computing and quantum error correction. I calculate the error generated in the qubit driven by $\pi$, CORPSE, SCORPSE, symmetric and asymmetric pulses in presence of RTN. For a special case when pulse acts in x-direction and RTN in z-direction, I find that for small value of noise correlation time, $\pi$-pulse has small error among all the other pulses. For large value of noise correlation time, possibly white noise, symmetric pulse generates small error for small energy amplitudes of noise strength, whereas CORPSE pulse has small error for large energy amplitudes of noise strength. For the pulses acting in all the three directions, several pulse sequences were identified that generate small error in presence of small and large strength of energy amplitudes of RTN. More precisely, when $\pi$ pulse acts in x direction, CORPSE pulse acts in y direction and SCORPSE pulse acts in z-direction then such pulse sequences induces small error and may consider for better candidate in implementing of bit-flip quantum error correction. Error analysis of small energy amplitudes of RTN may be useful for low temperature measurements, whereas error analysis of large energy amplitudes of RTN may be useful for room temperature measurements of quantum error correction codes.</description>

      <title>An introduction to infinite projected entangled-pair state methods for variational ground state simulations using automatic differentiation</title>

Abstract: Tensor networks capture large classes of ground states of phases of quantum matter faithfully and efficiently. Their manipulation and contraction has remained a challenge over the years, however. For most of the history, ground state simulations of two-dimensional quantum lattice systems using (infinite) projected entangled pair states have relied on what is called a time-evolving block decimation. In recent years, multiple proposals for the variational optimization of the quantum state have been put forward, overcoming accuracy and convergence problems of previously known methods. The incorporation of automatic differentiation in tensor networks algorithms has ultimately enabled a new, flexible way for variational simulation of ground states and excited states. In this work we review the state-of-the-art of the variational iPEPS framework, providing a detailed introduction to automatic differentiation, a description of a general foundation into which various two-dimensional lattices can be conveniently incorporated, and demonstrative benchmarking results.</description>

Abstract: The time evolution of a wave packet is a tool to detect topological phase transitions in two-dimensional Dirac materials, such as graphene and silicene. Here we extend the analysis to HgTe/CdTe quantum wells and study the evolution of their electron current wave packet, using 2D effective Dirac Hamiltonians and different layer thicknesses. We show that the two different periodicities that appear in this temporal evolution reach a minimum near the critical thickness, where the system goes from normal to inverted regime. Moreover, the maximum of the electron current amplitude changes with the layer thickness, identifying that current maxima reach their higher value at the critical thickness. Thus, we can characterize the topological phase transitions in terms of the periodicity and amplitude of the electron currents.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution of Bipartite Fluctuations in One-Dimensional Fermions</title>

Abstract: Emergence of hydrodynamics in quantum many-body systems has recently garnered growing interest. The recent experiment of ultracold atoms [J. F. Wienand {\it et al.}, arXiv:2306.11457] studied emergent hydrodynamics in hard-core bosons using a bipartite fluctuation, which quantifies how the particle number fluctuates in a subsystem. In this Letter, we theoretically study the variance of a bipartite fluctuation in one-dimensional noninteracting fermionic dynamics starting from an alternating state, deriving the exact solution of the variance and its asymptotic linear growth law for the long-time dynamics. To compare the theoretical prediction with the experiment, we generalize our exact solution by incorporating the incompleteness of the initial alternating state, deriving the general linear growth law analytically. We find that it shows quantitative agreement with the experimentally observed variance growth without any fitting parameters.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of an optical tweezer phonon laser</title>

Abstract: The creation and manipulation of coherence continues to capture the attention of scientists and engineers. The optical laser is a canonical example of a system that, in principle, exhibits complete coherence. Recent research has focused on the creation of coherent, laser-like states in other physical systems. The phonon laser is one example where it is possible to amplify self-sustained mechanical oscillations. A single mode phonon laser in a levitated optical tweezer has been demonstrated through appropriate balance of active feedback gain and damping. In this work, coherent control of the dynamics of an optical tweezer phonon laser is used to share coherence between its different modes of oscillation, creating a multimode phonon laser. The coupling of the modes is achieved by periodically rotating the asymmetric optical potential in the transverse focal plane of the trapping beam via trap laser polarization rotation. The presented theory and experiment demonstrate that coherence can be transferred across different modes of an optical tweezer phonon laser, and are a step toward using these systems for precision measurement and quantum information processing.</description>
