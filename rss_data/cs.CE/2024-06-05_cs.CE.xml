      <title>A discrete dislocation analysis of size-dependent plasticity in torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for solving three dimensional discrete dislocation plasticity boundary-value problems using a monopole representation of the dislocations is presented. At each time step, the displacement, strain and stress fields in a finite body are obtained by superposition of infinite body dislocation fields and an image field that enforces the boundary conditions. The three dimensional infinite body fields are obtained by representing dislocations as being comprised of points, termed monopoles, that carry dislocation line and Burgers vector information. The image fields are obtained from a three dimensional linear elastic finite element calculation. The implementation of the coupling of the monopole representation with the finite element method, including the interaction of curved dislocations with free surfaces, is presented in some detail because it differs significantly from an implementation with a line based dislocation representation. Numerical convergence and the modeling of dislocation loop nucleation for large scale computations are investigated. The monopole discrete dislocation plasticity framework is used to investigate the effect of size and initial dislocation density on the torsion of wires with diameters varying over three orders of magnitude. Depending on the initial dislocation source density and the wire diameter, three regimes of torsion-twist response are obtained: (i) for wires with a sufficiently small diameter, plastic deformation is nucleation controlled and is strongly size dependent; (ii) for wires with larger diameters dislocation plasticity is dislocation interaction controlled, with the emergence of geometrically necessary dislocations and dislocation pile-ups playing a key role, and is strongly size dependent; and (iii) for wires with sufficiently large diameters plastic deformation becomes less heterogeneous and the dependence on size is greatly diminished.</description>

      <title>Multiphase Flow Simulation of Blow-by and Fuel-in-Oil Dilution via the Piston Ring Pack Using the CFD Level-Set Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern diesel engines temporarily use a very late post-injection in the combustion cycle to either generate heat for a diesel particulate filter regeneration or purge a lean NOx trap. In some configurations, unburned fuel is left at the cylinder walls and is transported via the piston rings toward the lower crankcase region, where fuel may dilute the oil. Reduced oil lubrication shortens the oil service intervals and increases friction. Beside diesel fuel, this problem may also occur for other types of liquid fuels such as alcohols and e-fuels. The exact transport mechanism of the unburned fuel via the piston ring pack grooves and cylinder wall is hard to measure experimentally, motivating numerical flow simulation in early design stages for an in-depth understanding of the involved processes. A new CFD simulation methodology has been developed to investigate the transient, compressible, multiphase flow around the piston ring pack, through the gap between piston and liner, and its impact on fuel or oil transport. The modern level-set approach is used for the multiphase physics, which directly captures the sharp interface between blow-by gas and fuel or oil. Transient blow-by and two-phase flow simulations have been extensively applied to a Ford 2.0L I4 diesel test engine. The results confirm the validity of the flow compressibility assumption and highlight the sensitivity of the fuel leakage regarding piston sealing ring movement and highly resolved meshes for the multiphase flow. Based on the simulation results, design recommendations for piston and piston ring geometry are provided to reduce the fuel transport toward the crankcase.</description>

      <title>Identification of Stone Deterioration Patterns with Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conservation of stone-based cultural heritage sites is a critical concern for preserving cultural and historical landmarks. With the advent of Large Multimodal Models, as GPT-4omni (OpenAI), Claude 3 Opus (Anthropic) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (Google), it is becoming increasingly important to define the operational capabilities of these models. In this work, we systematically evaluate the abilities of the main foundational multimodal models to recognise and classify anomalies and deterioration patterns of the stone elements that are useful in the practice of conservation and restoration of world heritage. After defining a taxonomy of the main stone deterioration patterns and anomalies, we asked the foundational models to identify a curated selection of 354 highly representative images of stone-built heritage, offering them a careful selection of labels to choose from. The result, which varies depending on the type of pattern, allowed us to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these models in the field of heritage conservation and restoration.</description>

      <title>Multi-Patch Isogeometric Convolution Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A seamless integration of neural networks with Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) was first introduced in [1] under the name of Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Network (HiDeNN) and has systematically evolved into Isogeometric Convolution HiDeNN (in short, C-IGA) [2]. C-IGA achieves higher order approximations without increasing the degree of freedom. Due to the Kronecker delta property of C-IGA shape functions, one can refine the mesh in the physical domain like standard finite element method (FEM) while maintaining the exact geometrical mapping of IGA. In this article, C-IGA theory is generalized for multi-CAD-patch systems with a mathematical investigation of the compatibility conditions at patch interfaces and convergence of error estimates. Two compatibility conditions (nodal compatibility and G^0 (i.e., global C^0) compatibility) are presented and validated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Lamination-based efficient treatment of weak discontinuities for non-conforming finite element meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When modelling discontinuities (interfaces) using the finite element method, the standard approach is to use a conforming finite-element mesh in which the mesh matches the interfaces. However, this approach can prove cumbersome if the geometry is complex, in particular in 3D. In this work, we develop an efficient technique for a non-conforming finite-element treatment of weak discontinuities by using laminated microstructures. The approach is inspired by the so-called composite voxel technique that has been developed for FFT-based spectral solvers in computational homogenization. The idea behind the method is rather simple. Each finite element that is cut by an interface is treated as a simple laminate with the volume fraction of the phases and the lamination orientation determined in terms of the actual geometrical arrangement of the interface within the element. The approach is illustrated by several computational examples relevant to the micromechanics of heterogeneous materials. Elastic and elastic-plastic materials at small and finite strain are considered in the examples. The performance of the proposed method is compared to two alternative, simple methods showing that the new approach is in most cases superior to them while maintaining the simplicity.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Power of Neural Operators with Automatically Encoded Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) have emerged as effective tools for modeling complex physical systems in scientific machine learning. In NOs, a central characteristic is to learn the governing physical laws directly from data. In contrast to other machine learning applications, partial knowledge is often known a priori about the physical system at hand whereby quantities such as mass, energy and momentum are exactly conserved. Currently, NOs have to learn these conservation laws from data and can only approximately satisfy them due to finite training data and random noise. In this work, we introduce conservation law-encoded neural operators (clawNOs), a suite of NOs that endow inference with automatic satisfaction of such conservation laws. ClawNOs are built with a divergence-free prediction of the solution field, with which the continuity equation is automatically guaranteed. As a consequence, clawNOs are compliant with the most fundamental and ubiquitous conservation laws essential for correct physical consistency. As demonstrations, we consider a wide variety of scientific applications ranging from constitutive modeling of material deformation, incompressible fluid dynamics, to atmospheric simulation. ClawNOs significantly outperform the state-of-the-art NOs in learning efficacy, especially in small-data regimes.</description>
