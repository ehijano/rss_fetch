      <title>Foam: A Python package for forward asteroseismic modelling of gravity modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology, the study of stellar pulsations, offers insights into the internal structures and evolution of stars. Analysing the variations in a star's brightness allows the determination of fundamental properties such as mass, radius, age, and chemical composition. Asteroseismology heavily relies on computational tools, but a significant number of them are closed-source, thus inaccessible to the broader astronomic community. This manuscript presents Foam, a Python package designed to perform forward asteroseismic modelling of stars exhibiting gravity modes. It automates and streamlines a considerable fraction of the modelling process, comparing grids of theoretical stellar models and their oscillation frequencies to observed frequency sets in stars. Foam offers the flexibility to employ diverse modelling approaches, allowing users to choose different methodologies for matching theoretically predicted oscillations to observations. It provides options to utilise various sets of observables for comparison with their theoretical counterparts, employ different merit functions for assessing goodness of fit, and to incorporate nested subgrids in a statistically rigorous manner. For applications of these methodologies in modelling observed gravity modes, refer to Michielsen et al. (2021) and Michielsen et al. (2023).</description>

      <title>CCAT: Comparisons of 280 GHz TiN and Al Kinetic Inductance Detector Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CCAT Collaboration's six-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope is scheduled to begin observing in the Chilean Atacama in 2025, targeting a variety of science goals throughout cosmic history. Prime-Cam is a 1.8-meter diameter cryostat that will host up to seven independent instrument modules designed for simultaneous spectroscopic and broadband, polarimetric surveys at millimeter to submillimeter wavelengths. The first of these instrument modules, the 280 GHz module, will include ${\sim}$10,000 kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) across three arrays. While the first array was fabricated out of tri-layer TiN/Ti/TiN, the other two arrays were fabricated out of a single layer of Al. This combination of materials within the same instrument provides a unique opportunity to directly compare the performance and noise properties of two different detector materials that are seeing increasing use within the field. We present preliminary comparisons here based on lab testing, along with a discussion of the potential impacts on operation when observing and translating raw data to science-grade maps.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: Photometric Calibration of Narrow Band Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Physics of the Accelerating Universe (PAU) camera is an optical narrow band and broad band imaging instrument mounted at the prime focus of the William Herschel Telescope. We describe the image calibration procedure of the PAU Survey data. We rely on an external photometric catalogue to calibrate our narrow band data using stars that have been observed by both datasets. We fit stellar templates to the stellar broad band photometry of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and synthesise narrow band photometry that we compare to the PAUS narrow band data to determine their calibration. Consequently, the PAUS data are in the AB system as inherited from its reference calibrator. We do several tests to check the performance of the calibration. We find it self-consistent when comparing repeated observations of the same objects, with a good overall accuracy to the AB system which we estimate to be at the 2\% precision level and no significant trends as a function of narrow band filter or wavelength. Repeated observations allow us to build a spatial map of the illumination pattern of the system. We also check the wavelength dependence of the calibration comparing to stellar spectra. We find that using only blue stars reduces the effects of variations in the stellar template fitting to broad-band colours, improving the overall precision of the calibration to around 1\% and its wavelength uniformity. The photometric redshift performance obtained with the PAUS data attests to the validity of our calibration to reach the PAUS science goals.</description>

      <title>Pushing the limits of the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) with an optimized background correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations utilizing the ultraviolet capabilities of the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope are of unique value to the astronomy community. Spectroscopy down to 900 A with COS has enabled new science areas. However, contrary to the situation at longer wavelengths, these observations are limited by detector background noise. The background correction currently applied by the standard calibration pipeline (CalCOS) is not optimized for faint targets, limiting the scientific value of low signal-to-noise observations. In this work we investigate a possible dependence of the variations of the dark rate in both segments of the COS far-ultraviolet (FUV) detector on time, detector high voltage (HV), and solar activity. Through our analysis we identified a number of detector states (on a configuration basis, e.g., HV and segment) characterizing the spatial distribution of dark counts, and created superdarks to be used in an optimized 2-dimensional (2D) background correction. We have developed and tested Another COS Dark Correction (ACDC), a dedicated pipeline to perform a 2D background correction based on statistical methods, producing background-corrected and flux-calibrated spectra. While our testing of ACDC showed an average improvement in S/N values of ~10%, in a few cases the improvements in S/N reached 60% across the whole wavelength range of individual segments.</description>

      <title>Accurate estimate of the ESPRESSO fiber-injection losses inferred from integrated field-stabilization images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based astronomy is unavoidably subject to the adverse effect of atmospheric turbulence, a.k.a. the seeing, which blurs the images and limits the achievable spatial resolution. For spectroscopic observations, it leads to slit or fiber-injection losses, since not all photons distributed over the extended seeing disk can be captured. These losses might have a very substantial impact on the overall efficiency of a spectrograph and are naturally highly variable. Assessing the fiber-injection losses requires accurate information about the image quality (IQ) delivered by the telescope to the instrument over the course of the observations, which, however, is often not directly available. ESPRESSO provides acquisition and field-stabilization images attached to the science data and thus offers the opportunity for a post-processing analysis. Here, we present a novel method to infer the IQ profile and fiber-injection losses from the integrated field-stabilization images, utilizing the spill-over light that does not get injected into the fiber. We validate these measurements against the IQ observed in the acquisition images and determine that our method delivers unbiased estimates with a scatter of 0.11" for the FWHM of the profile and 15% in terms of fiber-injection losses. This compares favorably to the estimates derived from either the differential image motion monitor (DIMM) or the telescope guide probe sensors and therefore represents a valuable tool to characterize the instrument efficiency and to correct raw spectra for fiber-injection losses.</description>

      <title>Revealing Predictive Maintenance Strategies from Comprehensive Data Analysis of ASTRI-Horn Historical Monitoring Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern telescope facilities generate data from various sources, including sensors, weather stations, LiDARs, and FRAMs. Sophisticated software architectures using the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data technologies are required to manage this data. This study explores the potential of sensor data for innovative maintenance techniques, such as predictive maintenance (PdM), to prevent downtime that can affect research. We analyzed historical data from the ASTRI-Horn Cherenkov telescope, spanning seven years, examining data patterns and variable correlations. The findings offer insights for triggering predictive maintenance model development in telescope facilities.</description>

      <title>Optimal Demodulation Domain for Microwave SQUID Multiplexers in Presence of Readout System Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Microwave SQUID Multiplexer ({\mu}MUX) is the device of choice for the readout of a large number of Low-Temperature Detectors in a wide variety of experiments within the fields of astronomy and particle physics. While it offers large multiplexing factors, the system noise performance is highly dependent on the cold and warm-readout electronic systems used to read it out, as well as the demodulation domain and parameters chosen. In order to understand the impact of the readout systems in the overall noise performance, first we extended the available {\mu}MUX simulation frameworks including additive and multiplicative noise sources in the probing tones (i.e. phase and amplitude noise), along with the capability of demodulating the scientific data, either in resonator's phase or amplitude. Then, considering the additive noise as a dominant noise source, the optimum readout parameters to achieve minimum system noise were found for both open-loop and flux-ramp demodulation schemes in the aforementioned domains. Later, we evaluated the system noise sensitivity to multiplicative noise sources under the optimum readout parameters. Finally, as a case study, we evaluated the optimal demodulation domain and expected system noise level for a typical Software-Defined Radio (SDR) readout system. This work leads to an improved system performance prediction and noise engineering based on the available readout electronics and selected demodulation domain.</description>

      <title>Exoplanets in reflected starlight with dual-field interferometry: A case for shorter wavelengths and a fifth Unit Telescope at VLTI/Paranal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct observation of cold and temperate planets within 1 to 10 AU would be extremely valuable for uncovering their atmospheric compositions but remains a formidable challenge with current astronomical methods. Ground-based optical interferometry, capable of high angular-resolution imaging, offers a promising avenue for studying these exoplanets, complementing space-based observations. Our objective is to explore the fundamental limits of dual-field interferometry and assess its potential for characterizing exoplanets in reflected light using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). We developed analytical expressions to describe the performance of dual-field interferometry and integrated these with simulations of atmospheric wavefronts corrected by extreme Adaptive Optics. An analytical solution for optimal phase apodization was formulated to enhance starlight rejection when injected into a single-mode fibre. This framework was applied to determine the detectability of known exoplanets in reflected light across various wavelength bands for both the current VLTI and a proposed extended version. Our results indicate that employing shorter wavelengths improves detectability, enabling at least seven Jupiter-mass exoplanets to be observed in the J band with current VLTI's baselines. Adding new baselines with lengths beyond 200 meters significantly enhances VLTI's capabilities, increasing the number of detectable exoplanets and revealing potential habitable zone candidates such as $\tau$ Ceti e and Proxima Centauri b. To substantially improve the VLTI's exoplanet characterization capabilities, we recommend developing instrumentation at wavelengths shorter than 1$\,\mu$m, as well as the addition of a fifth Unit Telescope (UT5).</description>

      <title>Study of selected mild steels for application in vacuum systems of future gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors (GWDs) like the Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope require extensive vacuum tubing, necessitating cost-effective materials. This study explores the viability of mild steel as an alternative to austenitic stainless steel for UHV beampipes, focusing on outgassing rates and surface chemistry after low-temperature bakeouts. Mild steels exhibit significantly lower hydrogen outgassing rates, below 10$^{-14}$ mbar l s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ after bakeouts at 80{\deg}C for 48 hours. While water vapor is the primary residual gas after such low-temperature bakeouts, repeated treatments reduce its outgassing rate and modify surface conditions so that such benefit is preserved after at least six months of exposure to laboratory air. These findings position mild steel as an economical and efficient material for future GWD beampipes.</description>

      <title>Binary asteroid candidates in Gaia DR3 astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroids with companions constitute an excellent sample for studying the collisional and dynamical evolution of minor planets. The currently known binary population were discovered by different complementary techniques that produce, for the moment, a strongly biased distribution, especially in a range of intermediate asteroid sizes (approximately 20 to 100 km) where both mutual photometric events and high-resolution adaptive optic imaging are poorly efficient. A totally independent technique of binary asteroid discovery, based on astrometry, can help to reveal new binary systems and populate a range of sizes and separations that remain nearly unexplored. In this work, we describe a dedicated period detection method and its results for the Gaia DR3 data set. This method looks for the presence of a periodic signature in the orbit post-fit residuals. After conservative filtering and validation based on statistical and physical criteria, we are able to present a first sample of astrometric binary candidates, to be confirmed by other observation techniques such as photometric light curves and stellar occultations.</description>

      <title>Searching for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes early inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early inspiral from stellar-mass binary black holes can emit milli-Hertz gravitational wave signals, making them detectable sources for space-borne gravitational wave missions like TianQin. However, the traditional matched filtering technique poses a significant challenge for analyzing this kind of signals, as it requires an impractically high number of templates ranging from $10^{31}$ to $10^{40}$. We propose a search strategy that involves two main parts: initially, we reduce the dimensionality of the simulated signals using incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). Subsequently we train the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on the compressed TianQin data obtained from IPCA, aiming to develop both a detection model and a point parameter estimation model. The compression efficiency for the trained IPCA model achieves a cumulative variance ratio of 95.6% when applied to $10^6$ simulated signals. To evaluate the performance of CNN we generate the receiver operating characteristic curve for the detection model which is applied to the test data with varying signal-to-noise ratios. At a false alarm probability of 5% the corresponding true alarm probability for signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 is 86.5%. Subsequently, we introduce the point estimation model to evaluate the value of the chirp mass of corresponding sBBH signals with an error. For signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50, the trained point estimation CNN model can estimate the chirp mass of most test events, with a standard deviation error of 2.48 $M_{\odot}$ and a relative error precision of 0.12.</description>

      <title>Analytical Delta-V Approximation for Nonlinear Programming of Multi-target Rendezvous and Flyby Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an analytical Delta-V approximation of short-time transfers based on the linear relative motion and a gradient-based nonlinear programming model of multi-target rendezvous and flyby trajectories. In previous studies, the Lambert's solution is commonly used to evaluate Delta-V of short-duration transfers. In this study, to avoid the iteration process for obtaining the Lambert's solution and its gradient, the linear relative motion equations are applied to form an analytical two-point boundary value model for the near-circular orbit rendezvous problems. Although the relative motion equations are usually applicable when the two orbits are close enough, and the position and velocity errors would become more significant as the orbital differences increase, the errors of the velocity increments were proved acceptable in our simulations. Moreover, the analytical formula facilitates the calculation of the gradients to the start epoch and flight time, which are used to establish a nonlinear programming model for sequence optimization that gradient-based algorithms can easily solve. Simulation results demonstrated that the analytical Delta-V approximation requires much less calculation than the Lambert's solution, and the proposed gradient-based nonlinear programming algorithms can obtain similar results in less time than previous methods.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results I. Improved data selection and processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder is performing line intensity mapping of CO emission to trace the distribution of unresolved galaxies at redshift $z \sim 3$. We present an improved version of the COMAP data processing pipeline and apply this to the first two seasons of observations. This analysis improves on the COMAP Early Science (ES) results in several key aspects. On the observational side, all second season scans were made in constant-elevation mode, after noting that the previous Lissajous scans were associated with increased systematic errors; those scans accounted for 50% of the total Season 1 data volume. Secondly, all new observations were restricted to an elevation range of 35-65 degrees, to minimize sidelobe ground pickup. On the data processing side, more effective data cleaning in both the time- and map-domain has allowed us to eliminate all data-driven power spectrum-based cuts. This increases the overall data retention and reduces the risk of signal subtraction bias. On the other hand, due to the increased sensitivity, two new pointing-correlated systematic errors have emerged, and we introduce a new map-domain PCA filter to suppress these. Subtracting only 5 out of 256 PCA modes, we find that the standard deviation of the cleaned maps decreases by 67% on large angular scales, and after applying this filter, the maps appear consistent with instrumental noise. Combining all these improvements, we find that each hour of raw Season 2 observations yields on average 3.2 times more cleaned data compared to ES analysis. Combining this with the increase in raw observational hours, the effective amount of data available for high-level analysis is a factor of 8 higher than in ES. The resulting maps have reached an uncertainty of $25$-$50\,\mu K$ per voxel, providing by far the strongest constraints on cosmological CO line emission published to date.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results II. Updated constraints on the CO(1-0) power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on the cosmological 3D power spectrum of carbon monoxide CO(1-0) emission in the redshift range $2.4$-$3.4$. The constraints are derived from the two first seasons of Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder line-intensity mapping observations aiming to trace star-formation during the Epoch of Galaxy Assembly. These results improve on the previous Early Science (ES) results through both increased data volume and improved data processing methodology. On the methodological side, we now perform cross-correlations between groups of detectors (''feed-groups''), as opposed to cross-correlations between single feeds, and this new feed-group pseudo power spectrum (FGPXS) is constructed to be more robust against systematic effects. In terms of data volume, the effective mapping speed is significantly increased due to an improved observational strategy as well as better data selection methodology. The updated spherically- and field-averaged FGPXS, $\tilde{C}(k)$, is consistent with zero, at a probability-to-exceed of around $34\,\%$, with an excess of $2.7\,\sigma$ in the most sensitive bin. Our power spectrum estimate is about an order of magnitude more sensitive in our six deepest bins across ${0.09\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} &lt; k &lt; 0.73\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$, as compared to the feed-feed pseudo power spectrum (FPXS) of COMAP ES. Each of these bins individually constrains the CO power spectrum to ${kP_\mathrm{CO}(k)&lt; 2400-4900\,\mathrm{\mu K^2 Mpc^{2}}}$ at $95\,\%$ confidence. To monitor potential contamination from residual systematic effects, we analyze a set of 312 difference-map null tests and find that these are consistent with the instrumental noise prediction. In sum, these results provide the strongest direct constraints on the cosmological 3D CO(1-0) power spectrum published to date.</description>

      <title>Exploring Time Delay Interferometry Ranging as a Practical Ranging Approach in the Bayesian Framework</title>

Abstract: Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) is an indispensable step in the whole data processing procedure of space-based gravitational wave detection, as it mitigates the overwhelming laser frequency noise, which would otherwise completely bury the gravitational wave signals. Knowledge on the inter-spacecraft optical paths (i.e. delays) is one of the key elements of TDI. Conventional method for inter-spacecraft ranging mainly relies on the pseudo-random noise (PRN) code signal modulated onto the lasers. To ensure the reliability and robustness of this ranging information, it would be highly beneficial to develop other methods which could serve as cross-validations or backups. This paper explores the practical implementation of an alternative data-driven approach - time delay interferometry ranging (TDIR) - as a ranging technique independent of the PRN signal. Distinguished from previous research, our TDIR algorithm significantly relaxes the stringent requirement for clock synchronization imposed by traditional TDI procedure. By framing TDIR as a Bayesian parameter estimation problem and employing a general polynomial parametrization, we demonstrate our algorithm with simulated data based on the numerical orbit of Taiji. In the presence of laser frequency noise and secondary noises, the estimated median values of delays are only 5.28 ns away from the ground truths, capable of suppressing laser frequency noise to the desired level. Additionally, we have also analysed the requirements of mitigating optical bench noise and clock noise on TDIR, and presented an illustrative example for the impact of laser locking.</description>

      <title>Identification of multi-component LOFAR sources with multi-modal deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern high-sensitivity radio telescopes are discovering an increased number of resolved sources with intricate radio structures and fainter radio emissions. These sources often present a challenge because source detectors might identify them as separate radio sources rather than components belonging to the same physically connected radio source. Currently, there are no reliable automatic methods to determine which radio components are single radio sources or part of multi-component sources. We propose a deep learning classifier to identify those sources that are part of a multi-component system and require component association on data from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). We combine different types of input data using multi-modal deep learning to extract spatial and local information about the radio source components: a convolutional neural network component that processes radio images is combined with a neural network component that uses parameters measured from the radio sources and their nearest neighbours. Our model retrieves 94 per cent of the sources with multiple components on a balanced test set with 2,683 sources and achieves almost 97 per cent accuracy in the real imbalanced data (323,103 sources). The approach holds potential for integration into pipelines for automatic radio component association and cross-identification. Our work demonstrates how deep learning can be used to integrate different types of data and create an effective solution for managing modern radio surveys.</description>

      <title>Modeling the refractive index profile n(z) of polar ice for ultra-high energy neutrino experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an in-situ index of refraction profile using the transit time of radio signals broadcast from an englacial transmitter to 2-5 km distant radio-frequency receivers, deployed at depths up to 200 m. Maxwell's equations generally admit two ray propagation solutions from a given transmitter, corresponding to a direct path (D) and a refracted path (R); the measured D vs. R (dt(D,R)) timing differences provide constraints on the index of refraction profile near South Pole, where the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) neutrino observatory is located. We constrain the refractive index profile by simulating D and R ray paths via ray tracing and comparing those to measured dt(D,R) signals. Using previous ice density data as a proxy for n(z), we demonstrate that our data strongly favors a glaciologically-motivated three-phase densification model rather than a single exponential scale height model. Simulations show that the single exponential model overestimates ARA neutrino sensitivity compared to the three-phase model.</description>

      <title>A fast radio burst localized at detection to a galactic disk using very long baseline interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration, luminous radio transients of extragalactic origin. These events have been used to trace the baryonic structure of the Universe using their dispersion measure (DM) assuming that the contribution from host galaxies can be reliably estimated. However, contributions from the immediate environment of an FRB may dominate the observed DM, thus making redshift estimates challenging without a robust host galaxy association. Furthermore, while at least one Galactic burst has been associated with a magnetar, other localized FRBs argue against magnetars as the sole progenitor model. Precise localization within the host galaxy can discriminate between progenitor models, a major goal of the field. Until now, localizations on this spatial scale have only been carried out in follow-up observations of repeating sources. Here we demonstrate the localization of FRB 20210603A with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) on two baselines, using data collected only at the time of detection. We localize the burst to SDSS J004105.82+211331.9, an edge-on galaxy at $z\approx 0.177$, and detect recent star formation in the kiloparsec-scale vicinity of the burst. The edge-on inclination of the host galaxy allows for a unique comparison between the line of sight towards the FRB and lines of sight towards known Galactic pulsars. The DM, Faraday rotation measure (RM), and scattering suggest a progenitor coincident with the host galactic plane, strengthening the link between the environment of FRB 20210603A and the disk of its host galaxy. Single-pulse VLBI localizations of FRBs to within their host galaxies, following the one presented here, will further constrain the origins and host environments of one-off FRBs.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic approach to the radar echo scatter from high-energy particle cascades</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To probe the cosmic particle flux at the highest energies, large volumes of dense material like ice have to be monitored. This can be achieved by exploiting the radio signal. In this work, we provide a macroscopic model to predict the radar echo signatures found when a radio signal is reflected from a cosmic-ray or neutrino-induced particle cascade propagating in a dense medium like ice. Its macroscopic nature allows for an energy independent run-time, taking less than 10 s for simulating a single scatter event. As a first application, we discuss basic signal properties and simulate the expected signal for the T-576 beam-test experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. We find good signal strength agreement with the only observed radar echo from a high-energy particle cascade to date.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$NNA: A Deep Learning Field-level Inference Machine for the Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inference of astrophysical and cosmological properties from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest conventionally relies on summary statistics of the transmission field that carry useful but limited information. We present a deep learning framework for inference from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest at field-level. This framework consists of a 1D residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) that extracts spectral features and performs regression on thermal parameters of the IGM that characterize the power-law temperature-density relation. We train this supervised machinery using a large set of mock absorption spectra from Nyx hydrodynamic simulations at $z=2.2$ with a range of thermal parameter combinations (labels). We employ Bayesian optimization to find an optimal set of hyperparameters for our network, and then employ a committee of 20 neural networks for increased statistical robustness of the network inference. In addition to the parameter point predictions, our machine also provides a self-consistent estimate of their covariance matrix with which we construct a pipeline for inferring the posterior distribution of the parameters. We compare the results of our framework with the traditional summary (PDF and power spectrum of transmission) based approach in terms of the area of the 68% credibility regions as our figure of merit (FoM). In our study of the information content of perfect (noise- and systematics-free) Ly$\alpha$ forest spectral data-sets, we find a significant tightening of the posterior constraints -- factors of 10.92 and 3.30 in FoM over power spectrum only and jointly with PDF, respectively -- that is the consequence of recovering the relevant parts of information that are not carried by the classical summary statistics.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric Radio Imaging of Faint Gyrosynchrotron Emission from a CME : A Possible Indication of the Insufficiency of Homogeneous Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geo-effectiveness of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is determined primarily by their magnetic fields. Modeling of Gyrosynchrotron (GS) emission is a promising remote sensing technique to measure the CME magnetic field at coronal heights. However, faint GS emission from CME flux ropes is hard to detect in the presence of bright solar emission from the solar corona. With high dynamic-range spectropolarimetric meter wavelength solar images provided by the Murchison Widefield Array, we have detected faint GS emission from a CME out to $\sim 8.3\ R_\odot$, the largest heliocentric distance reported to date. High-fidelity polarimetric calibration also allowed us to robustly detect circularly polarized emission from GS emission. For the first time in literature, Stokes V detection has jointly been used with Stokes I spectra to constrain GS models. One expects that the inclusion of polarimetric measurement will provide tighter constraints on GS model parameters. Instead, we found that homogeneous GS models, which have been used in all prior works, are unable to model both the total intensity and circular polarized emission simultaneously. This strongly suggests the need for using inhomogeneous GS models to robustly estimate the CME magnetic field and plasma parameters.</description>
