      <title>Quantum Systems Other Than the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How should we interpret physical theories, and especially quantum theory, if we drop the assumption that we should treat it as an exact description of the whole Universe? I expound and develop the claim that physics is about the study of autonomous, but not necessarily isolated, dynamical systems, and that when applied to quantum mechanics this entails that in general we should take quantum systems as having mixed states and non-unitary dynamics. I argue that nonetheless unitary dynamics continues to have a special place in physics, via the empirically-well-supported reductionist principles that non-unitarity is to be explained by restriction to a subsystem of a larger unitary system and that microscopic physics is governed by unitary and largely known dynamics. I contrast this position with the `Open Systems View' advocated recently by Michael Cuffaro and Stephan Hartmann.</description>

      <title>On Penrose's Analogy between Curved Spacetime Regions and Optical Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of Penrose's gravito-optical analogy between the focusing effects of particular families of Ricci- and Weyl-curved spacetime regions on the one hand, and anastigmatic and astigmatic optical lenses on the other. We put the analogy in its historical context, investigate its underlying assumptions, its range of validity, its proof of concept, and its application in Penrose's study of the notion of energy flux in general relativity. Finally, we examine the analogy within the framework of Norton's material theory of induction.</description>

      <title>Does $E=mc^2$ Require Relativity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is universally believed that with his 1905 paper "Does the inertia of a body depend on its energy content?" Einstein first demonstrated the equivalence of mass and energy by making use of his special theory of relativity. In the final step of that paper, however, Einstein equates the kinetic energy of a body to its Newtonian value, indicating that his result is at best a low-velocity approximation. Today, several characters debate whether a mid-nineteenth century physicist, employing only physics available at the time, could plausibly arrive at the celebrated result. In other words, is Einsteinian relativity necessary to derive ${\mc E}=mc^2$?</description>

      <title>Empirical adequacy of the time operator canonically conjugate to a Hamiltonian generating translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01426v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To admit a canonically conjugate time operator, the Hamiltonian has to be a generator of translations (like the momentum operator generates translations in space), so its spectrum must be unbounded. But the Hamiltonian governing our world is thought to be bounded from below. Also, judging by the number of fields and parameters of the Standard Model, the Hamiltonian seems much more complicated.
  In this article I give examples of worlds governed by Hamiltonians generating translations. They can be expressed as a partial derivative operator just like the momentum operator, but when expressed in function of other observables they can exhibit any level of complexity. The examples include any quantum world realizing a standard ideal measurement, any quantum world containing a clock or a free massless fermion, the quantum representation of any deterministic time-reversible dynamical system without time loops, and any quantum world that cannot return to a past state.
  Such worlds are as sophisticated as our world, but they admit a time operator. I show that, despite having unbounded Hamiltonian, they do not decay to infinite negative energy any more than any quantum or classical world. Since two such quantum systems of the same Hilbert space dimension are unitarily equivalent even if the physical content of their observables is very different, they are concrete counterexamples to Hilbert Space Fundamentalism (HSF). Taking the observables into account removes the ambiguity of HSF and the clock ambiguity problem attributed to the Page-Wootters formalism, also caused by assuming HSF. These results provide additional motivations to restore the spacetime symmetry in the formulation of Quantum Mechanics and for the Page-Wootters formalism.</description>
