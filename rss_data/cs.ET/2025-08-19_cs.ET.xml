      <title>Next-Gen Education: Enhancing AI for Microlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores integrating microlearning strategies into university curricula, particularly in computer science education, to counteract the decline in class attendance and engagement in US universities after COVID. As students increasingly opt for remote learning and recorded lectures, traditional educational approaches struggle to maintain engagement and effectiveness. Microlearning, which breaks complex subjects into manageable units, is proposed to address shorter attention spans and enhance educational outcomes. It uses interactive formats such as videos, quizzes, flashcards, and scenario-based exercises, which are especially beneficial for topics like algorithms and programming logic requiring deep understanding and ongoing practice. Adoption of microlearning is often limited by the effort needed to create such materials. This paper proposes leveraging AI tools, specifically ChatGPT, to reduce the workload for educators by automating the creation of supplementary materials. While AI can automate certain tasks, educators remain essential in guiding and shaping the learning process. This AI-enhanced approach ensures course content is kept current with the latest research and technology, with educators providing context and insights. By examining AI capabilities in microlearning, this study shows the potential to transform educational practices and outcomes in computer science, offering a practical model for combining advanced technology with established teaching methods.</description>

      <title>Training nonlinear optical neural networks with Scattering Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As deep learning applications continue to deploy increasingly large artificial neural networks, the associated high energy demands are creating a need for alternative neuromorphic approaches. Optics and photonics are particularly compelling platforms as they offer high speeds and energy efficiency. Neuromorphic systems based on nonlinear optics promise high expressivity with a minimal number of parameters. However, so far, there is no efficient and generic physics-based training method allowing us to extract gradients for the most general class of nonlinear optical systems. In this work, we present Scattering Backpropagation, an efficient method for experimentally measuring approximated gradients for nonlinear optical neural networks. Remarkably, our approach does not require a mathematical model of the physical nonlinearity, and only involves two scattering experiments to extract all gradient approximations. The estimation precision depends on the deviation from reciprocity. We successfully apply our method to well-known benchmarks such as XOR and MNIST. Scattering Backpropagation is widely applicable to existing state-of-the-art, scalable platforms, such as optics, microwave, and also extends to other physical platforms such as electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness in Distributed Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying adversarial robustness of quantum machine learning (QML) models is essential in order to understand their potential advantages over classical models and build trustworthy systems. Distributing QML models allows leveraging multiple quantum processors to overcome the limitations of individual devices and build scalable systems. However, this distribution can affect their adversarial robustness, potentially making them more vulnerable to new attacks. Key paradigms in distributed QML include federated learning, which, similar to classical models, involves training a shared model on local data and sending only the model updates, as well as circuit distribution methods inherent to quantum computing, such as circuit cutting and teleportation-based techniques. These quantum-specific methods enable the distributed execution of quantum circuits across multiple devices. This work reviews the differences between these distribution methods, summarizes existing approaches on the adversarial robustness of QML models when distributed using each paradigm, and discusses open questions in this area.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of IBM's Quantum Information Software Kit (Qiskit): A Review of its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is being increasingly adopted for solving classically intractable problems across various domains. However, the availability of accessible and scalable software frameworks remains essential for practical experimentation and adoption. IBM's open-source quantum computing toolkit 'Qiskit' has become a key player in this space by offering tools for circuit design, simulation, hardware execution, and domain-specific applications. This survey provides a systematic review of how Qiskit has evolved and what it has contributed to several critical fields including cryptography and cybersecurity, image and signal processing, climate science and energy applications, and finance. We show how Qiskit facilitates hybrid classical-quantum workflows and enables the deployment of algorithms on physical quantum hardware through error mitigation and modular integration approaches. Our exploration covers several key applications, including quantum key distribution, climate simulation, and quantum-enhanced portfolio optimization, while providing practical insights into their implementation. This work also covers the framework's technical structure and current limitations associated with scalability and reproducibility. By bringing together developments that have been scattered across different areas, this work serves as a reference point for researchers and practitioners who want to understand or contribute to Qiskit-enabled quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Fortifying the Agentic Web: A Unified Zero-Trust Architecture Against Logic-layer Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Unified Security Architecture that fortifies the Agentic Web through a Zero-Trust IAM framework. This architecture is built on a foundation of rich, verifiable agent identities using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), with discovery managed by a protocol-agnostic Agent Name Service (ANS). Security is operationalized through a multi-layered Trust Fabric which introduces significant innovations, including Trust-Adaptive Runtime Environments (TARE), Causal Chain Auditing, and Dynamic Identity with Behavioral Attestation. By explicitly linking the LPCI threat to these enhanced architectural countermeasures within a formal security model, we propose a comprehensive and forward-looking blueprint for a secure, resilient, and trustworthy agentic ecosystem. Our formal analysis demonstrates that the proposed architecture provides provable security guarantees against LPCI attacks with bounded probability of success.</description>

      <title>Cyber Risks to Next-Gen Brain-Computer Interfaces: Analysis and Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) show enormous potential for advancing personalized medicine. However, BCIs also introduce new avenues for cyber-attacks or security compromises. In this article, we analyze the problem and make recommendations for device manufacturers to better secure devices and to help regulators understand where more guidance is needed to protect patient safety and data confidentiality. Device manufacturers should implement the prior suggestions in their BCI products. These recommendations help protect BCI users from undue risks, including compromised personal health and genetic information, unintended BCI-mediated movement, and many other cybersecurity breaches. Regulators should mandate non-surgical device update methods, strong authentication and authorization schemes for BCI software modifications, encryption of data moving to and from the brain, and minimize network connectivity where possible. We also design a hypothetical, average-case threat model that identifies possible cybersecurity threats to BCI patients and predicts the likeliness of risk for each category of threat. BCIs are at less risk of physical compromise or attack, but are vulnerable to remote attack; we focus on possible threats via network paths to BCIs and suggest technical controls to limit network connections.</description>

      <title>HOMI: Ultra-Fast EdgeAI platform for Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages for edge robotics applications due to their asynchronous operation and sparse, event-driven output, making them well-suited for tasks requiring fast and efficient closed-loop control, such as gesture-based human-robot interaction. Despite this potential, existing event processing solutions remain limited, often lacking complete end-to-end implementations, exhibiting high latency, and insufficiently exploiting event data sparsity. In this paper, we present HOMI, an ultra-low latency, end-to-end edge AI platform comprising a Prophesee IMX636 event sensor chip with an Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+MPSoC FPGA chip, deploying an in-house developed AI accelerator. We have developed hardware-optimized pre-processing pipelines supporting both constant-time and constant-event modes for histogram accumulation, linear and exponential time surfaces. Our general-purpose implementation caters to both accuracy-driven and low-latency applications. HOMI achieves 94% accuracy on the DVS Gesture dataset as a use case when configured for high accuracy operation and provides a throughput of 1000 fps for low-latency configuration. The hardware-optimised pipeline maintains a compact memory footprint and utilises only 33% of the available LUT resources on the FPGA, leaving ample headroom for further latency reduction, model parallelisation, multi-task deployments, or integration of more complex architectures.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Coverage Model and Recommendation System for UAV Vertiports Location Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As urban aerial mobility (UAM) infrastructure development accelerates globally, cities like Shenzhen are planning large-scale vertiport networks (e.g., 1,200+ facilities by 2026). Existing planning frameworks remain inadequate for this complexity due to historical limitations in data granularity and real-world applicability. This paper addresses these gaps by first proposing the Capacitated Dynamic Maximum Covering Location Problem (CDMCLP), a novel optimization framework that simultaneously models urban-scale spatial-temporal demand, heterogeneous user behaviors, and infrastructure capacity constraints. Building on this foundation, we introduce an Integrated Planning Recommendation System that combines CDMCLP with socio-economic factors and dynamic clustering initialization. This system leverages adaptive parameter tuning based on empirical user behavior to generate practical planning solutions. Validation in a Chinese center city demonstrates the effectiveness of the new optimization framework and recommendation system. Under the evaluation and optimization of CDMCLP, the quantitative performance of traditional location methods are exposed and can be improved by 38\%--52\%, while the recommendation system shows user-friendliness and the effective integration of complex elements. By integrating mathematical rigor with practical implementation considerations, this hybrid approach bridges the gap between theoretical location modeling and real-world UAM infrastructure planning, offering municipalities a pragmatic tool for vertiport network design.</description>

Abstract: Physical reservoir computing is an innovative idea for using physical phenomena as computational resources. Recent research has revealed that information processing techniques can improve the performance, but for practical applications, it is equally important to study the level of performance with a simple design that is easy to construct experimentally. We focus on a reservoir composed of independent hysteretic systems as a model suitable for the practical implementation of physical reservoir computing. In this paper, we discuss the appropriate design of this reservoir, its performance, and its limitations. This research will serve as a practical guideline for constructing hysteresis-based reservoirs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state transferring has been demonstrated using drones via entanglement distribution. Here we demonstrate the first drone-based quantum task, for quantum key distribution (QKD). Compact and polarization-maintaining acquisition, pointing, and tracking system and QKD modules are developed and loaded on a home-made octocopter, within takeoff weight of 30 kg. Real-time QKD is performed over 200 m distance with 8.48 kHz average secret key rate, using polarization-coded decoy-state BB84 protocol. With the capability of secret key distribution using a drone, wireless communication can be expected with enhanced security in the quantum approach, between mobile nodes towards a network.</description>

      <title>V-RoAst: Visual Road Assessment. Can VLM be a Road Safety Assessor Using the iRAP Standard?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10872v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Road safety assessments are critical yet costly, especially in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), where most roads remain unrated. Traditional methods require expert annotation and training data, while supervised learning-based approaches struggle to generalise across regions. In this paper, we introduce \textit{V-RoAst}, a zero-shot Visual Question Answering (VQA) framework using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to classify road safety attributes defined by the iRAP standard. We introduce the first open-source dataset from ThaiRAP, consisting of over 2,000 curated street-level images from Thailand annotated for this task. We evaluate Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o-mini on this dataset and benchmark their performance against VGGNet and ResNet baselines. While VLMs underperform on spatial awareness, they generalise well to unseen classes and offer flexible prompt-based reasoning without retraining. Our results show that VLMs can serve as automatic road assessment tools when integrated with complementary data. This work is the first to explore VLMs for zero-shot infrastructure risk assessment and opens new directions for automatic, low-cost road safety mapping.

      <title>Towards Infant Sleep-Optimized Driving: Synergizing Wearable and Vehicle Sensing in Intelligent Cruise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated driving (AD) has substantially improved vehicle safety and driving comfort, but their impact on passenger well-being, particularly infant sleep, is not sufficiently studied. Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and sharp maneuvers can disrupt infant sleep, compromising both passenger comfort and parental convenience. To solve this problem, this paper explores the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving behavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In particular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to varying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively synergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the relationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse traffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the wearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data from map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving aggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control strategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and overtaking. Simulation experiments conducted in the CARLA environment indicate that the proposed solution significantly improves infant sleep quality compared to baseline methods, while preserving desirable travel efficiency.</description>
