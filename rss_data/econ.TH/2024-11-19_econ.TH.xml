      <title>Competition, Persuasion, and Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11183v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An agent engages in sequential search. He does not directly observe the quality of the goods he samples, but he can purchase signals designed by profit maximizing principal(s). We formulate the principal-agent relationship as a repeated contracting problem within a stopping game and characterize the set of equilibrium payoffs. We show that when the agent's search cost falls below a given threshold, competition does not impact how much surplus is generated in equilibrium nor how the surplus is divided. In contrast, competition benefits the agent at the expense of total surplus when the search cost exceeds that threshold. Our results challenge the view that monopoly decreases market efficiency, and moreover, suggest that it generates the highest value of information for the agent.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Modeler: A Normative Theory of Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an analyst whose goal is to identify a subject's utility function through revealed preference analysis. We argue the analyst's preference about which experiments to run should adhere to three normative principles: The first, Structural Invariance, requires that the value of a choice experiment only depends on what the experiment may potentially reveal. The second, Identification Separability, demands that the value of identification is independent of what would have been counterfactually identified had the subject had a different utility. Finally, Information Monotonicity asks that more informative experiments are preferred. We provide a representation theorem, showing that these three principles characterize Expected Identification Value maximization, a functional form that unifies several theories of experimental design. We also study several special cases and discuss potential applications.</description>

      <title>Reinterpreting Delay and Procrastination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I model a rational agent who spends resources between the current time and some fixed future deadline. Opportunities to spend resources arise randomly according to a Poisson process, and the quality of each opportunity follows a uniform distribution. The agent values their current resource stock at exactly the sum of expected utility from all future spending opportunities. Unlike in traditional discounted expected utility models, the agent exhibits correlation aversion, static (but not dynamic) preference reversals, and monotonicity with respect to payment timing. Connecting the agent's risk and time preference is intuitive, and doing so leads to a new model of procrastination where the agent misperceives their general attitude toward spending resources.</description>

      <title>On Truthful Mechanisms without Pareto-efficiency: Characterizations and Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of allocating heterogeneous and indivisible goods among strategic agents, with preferences over subsets of goods, when there is no medium of exchange. This model captures the well studied problem of fair allocation of indivisible goods. Serial-quota mechanisms are allocation mechanisms where there is a predefined order over agents, and each agent in her turn picks a predefined number of goods from the remaining goods. These mechanisms are clearly strategy-proof, non-bossy, and neutral. Are there other mechanisms with these properties? We show that for important classes of strict ordinal preferences (as lexicographic preferences, and as the class of all strict preferences), these are the only mechanisms with these properties. Importantly, unlike previous work, we can prove the claim even for mechanisms that are not Pareto-efficient. Moreover, we generalize these results to preferences that are cardinal, including any valuation class that contains additive valuations. We then derive strong negative implications of this result on truthful mechanisms for fair allocation of indivisible goods to agents with additive valuations.</description>

      <title>Projection onto the core: An optimal reallocation to correct market failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides formulae and algorithms to compute the projection onto the core of a preimputation outside it. The core of a game is described using an exponential number of linear constraints, and we cannot know beforehand which are redundant or defining the polytope. We apply these new results to market games, a class of games in which every game has a nonempty core. Given an initial state of the game represented by a preimputation, it is not guaranteed that the state of the game evolves toward the core following the dynamics induced by the domination relations. Our results identify and compute the most efficient side payment that acts on a given state of the game and yields its closest core allocation. Using this side payment, we propose a way to evaluate the failure of a market to reach a state of the economy belonging to the core, and we propose a new solution concept consisting of preimputations that minimizes this failure.</description>

      <title>Blackwell-Monotone Updating Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13956v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An updating rule specifies how an agent reacts to information. An updating rule is Blackwell monotone if more information is always better for an agent in a decision problem and strictly Blackwell monotone if, in addition, there is always a decision problem in which more information is strictly better for an agent. Bayes' law is strictly Blackwell monotone, and I show that within a broad class of updating rules--those that distort the Bayesian posteriors in a signal-independent manner--it is the only strictly Blackwell-monotone updating rule. Moreover, when the state is non-binary, I show that Bayes' law and the trivial updating rule in which an agent dogmatically holds a single belief are the only continuous Blackwell-monotone updating rules.</description>

      <title>Feasible Conditional Belief Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agents receive private signals about an unknown state. The resulting joint belief distributions are complex and lack a simple characterization. Our key insight is that, when conditioned on the state, the structure of belief distributions simplifies: feasibility constrains only the marginal distributions of individual agents across states, with no joint constraints within a state. We apply this insight to multi-receiver persuasion, identifying new tractable cases and introducing optimal transportation and duality tools.</description>

      <title>Costly Persuasion by a Partially Informed Sender</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14087v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study a model of costly Bayesian persuasion by a privately and partially informed sender who conducts a public experiment. The cost of running an experiment is the expected reduction of a weighted log-likelihood ratio function of the sender's belief. This is microfounded by a Wald sequential sampling problem where good news and bad news cost differently. I focus on equilibria satisfying the D1 criterion. The equilibrium outcome depends crucially on the relative costs of drawing good and bad news in the experiment. If good news is not too costly compared to bad news, there exists a unique separating equilibrium, and the receiver learns more information thanks to sender private information. If good news is sufficiently costlier than bad news, the single-crossing property fails. There may exist pooling and partial pooling equilibria, and in some equilibria, the receiver learns less information compared to a benchmark with an uninformed sender.</description>

      <title>Shill-Proof Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an auction, a seller may masquerade as one or more bidders in order to manipulate the clearing price. We characterize single-item auction formats that are shill-proof in the sense that a profit-maximizing seller has no incentive to submit shill bids. We distinguish between strong shill-proofness, in which a seller with full knowledge of bidders' valuations can never profit from shilling, and weak shill-proofness, which requires only that the expected equilibrium profit from shilling is nonpositive. The Dutch auction (with a suitable reserve) is the unique (revenue-)optimal and strongly shill-proof auction. Moreover, the Dutch auction (with no reserve) is the unique prior-independent auction that is both efficient and weakly shill-proof. While there are multiple ex-post incentive compatible, weakly shill-proof, and optimal auctions; any optimal auction can satisfy only two properties in the set {static, ex-post incentive compatible, weakly shill-proof}.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed shares of benefits and costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the self-ownership viewpoint to regulate the utilisation of common property resources. Allocating to each agent "the fruit of their own labor" is typically ill-depned, so we look for tight approximations of this decentralised ideal. For each agent i two guarantees limit, from above and below, the impact of other agents on i's allocation. They limit the range of unscripted negotiations, or the choice of a full sharing rule. Our context-free model of the commons is a mapping W from profiles of "types" to a freely transferable amount of benefit or cost. If W is super (resp. sub) modular there is a single tight upper (resp. lower) guarantee, and an infinite menu of tight lower (resp. upper) guarantees, each one conveying a precise normative viewpoint. We describe the menu for essentially all modular two person problems, and familiar examples like the allocation of an indivisible item, cooperative production, and facility location.</description>

      <title>Loss Aversion and State-Dependent Linear Utility Functions for Monetary Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory of expected utility with state-dependent linear utility functions for monetary returns, that incorporates the possibility of loss-aversion. Our results relate to first order stochastic dominance, mean-preserving spread, increasing-concave linear utility profiles and risk aversion. As an application of the expected utility theory developed here, we analyze the contract that a monopolist would offer in an insurance market that allowed for partial coverage of loss.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Envy-Free Permanency in Child Welfare Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Caseworkers in foster care systems seek to place waiting children in the most suitable homes. Furthermore, social work guidelines prioritize heterogeneous attributes of children and homes when deliberating placements. We use insights from market design and dynamic matching to characterize a class of dynamically envy-free mechanisms that incentivize expedient placements when children and homes arrive to the market over time and homes may accept or decline placements. The mechanisms have robustness against justified envy and costly patience. We analyze strategic incentives and efficiency properties of dynamic envy-freeness. Finally, we conduct empirical simulations that affirm that our mechanisms drastically increase placements and reduce waiting costs while maintaining robustness to prediction error versus a naive mechanism that always sequentially runs Deferred Acceptance. Practitioners can implement our mechanisms through assigning priority to child-home matches.</description>

      <title>Dominance between combinations of infinite-mean Pareto random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic dominance between portfolios of independent and identically distributed (iid) extremely heavy-tailed (i.e., infinite-mean) Pareto random variables. With the notion of majorization order, we show that a more diversified portfolio of iid extremely heavy-tailed Pareto random variables is larger in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance. This result is further generalized for Pareto random variables caused by triggering events, random variables with tails being Pareto, bounded Pareto random variables, and positively dependent Pareto random variables. These results provide an important implication in investment: Diversification of extremely heavy-tailed Pareto profits uniformly increases investors' profitability, leading to a diversification benefit. Remarkably, different from the finite-mean setting, such a diversification benefit does not depend on the decision maker's risk aversion.</description>
