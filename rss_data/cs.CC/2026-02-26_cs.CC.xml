      <title>Two NP-hard Extensions of the Spearman Footrule even for a Small Constant Number of Voters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spearman footrule is a voting rule that takes as input voter preferences expressed as rankings. It outputs a ranking that minimizes the sum of the absolute differences between the position of each candidate in the ranking and in the voters' preferences. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of two extensions of the Spearman footrule when the number of voters is a small constant. The first extension, introduced by Pascual et al. (2018), arises from the collective scheduling problem and treats candidates, referred to as tasks in their model, as having associated lengths. The second extension, proposed by Kumar and Vassilvitskii (2010), assigns weights to candidates; these weights serve both as lengths, as in the collective scheduling model, and as coefficients in the objective function to be minimized. Although computing a ranking under the standard Spearman footrule is polynomial-time solvable, we demonstrate that the first extension is NP-hard with as few as 3 voters, and the second extension is NP-hard with as few as 4 voters. Both extensions are polynomial-time solvable for 2 voters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a recent line of research investigating inverse theorems with respect to general k-wise correlations, and explain how such correlations arise in different contexts in mathematics. We outline some of the results that were established and their applications in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science. We also mention some open problems for future research.</description>

      <title>Steiner Forest for $H$-Subgraph-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our main result is a full classification, for every connected graph $H$, of the computational complexity of Steiner Forest on $H$-subgraph-free graphs. To obtain this dichotomy, we establish the following new algorithmic, hardness, and combinatorial results:
  Algorithms: We identify two new classes of graph-theoretical structures that make it possible to solve Steiner Forest in polynomial time. Roughly speaking, our algorithms handle the following cases: (1) a set $X$ of vertices of bounded size that are pairwise connected by subgraphs of treewidth $2$ or bounded size, possibly together with an independent set of arbitrary size that is connected to $X$ in an arbitrary way; (2) a set $X$ of vertices of arbitrary size that are pairwise connected in a cyclic manner by subgraphs of treewidth $2$ or bounded size.
  Hardness results: We show that Steiner Forest remains NP-complete for graphs with 2-deletion set number $3$. (The $c$-deletion set number is the size of a smallest cutset $S$ such that every component of $G-S$ has at most $c$ vertices.)
  Combinatorial results: To establish the dichotomy, we perform a delicate graph-theoretic analysis showing that if $H$ is a path or a subdivided claw, then excluding $H$ as a subgraph either yields one of the two algorithmically favourable structures described above, or yields a graph class for which NP-completeness of Steiner Forest follows from either our new hardness result or a previously known one.
  Along the way to classifying the hardness for excluded subgraphs, we establish a dichotomy for graphs with $c$-deletion set number at most $k$. Specifically, our results together with pre-existing ones show that Steiner Forest is polynomial-time solvable if (1) $c=1$ and $k\geq 0$, or (2) $c=2$ and $k\leq 2$, or (3) $c\geq 3$ and $k=1$, and is NP-complete otherwise.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Maximum Likelihood Learning of DPPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12377v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are a widely used probabilistic model for negatively correlated sets. DPPs have been successfully employed in Machine Learning applications to select a diverse, yet representative subset of data. In these applications, a set of parameters that maximize the likelihood of the data is typically desirable. The algorithms used for this task to date either optimize over a limited family of DPPs, or use local improvement heuristics that do not provide theoretical guarantees of optimality.
  In his seminal work on DPPs in Machine Learning, Kulesza (2011) conjectured that the problem is NP-complete. The lack of a formal proof prompted Brunel et al. (COLT 2017) to suggest that, in opposition to Kulesza's conjecture, there might exist a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a maximum-likelihood DPP. They also presented some preliminary evidence supporting a conjecture that they suggested might lead to such an algorithm.
  In this work we prove Kulesza's conjecture. In fact, we prove the following stronger hardness of approximation result: even computing a $\left(1-O(\frac{1}{\log^9{N}})\right)$-approximation to the maximum log-likelihood of a DPP on a ground set of $N$ elements is NP-complete.
  From a technical perspective, we reduce the problem of approximating the maximum log-likelihood of a DPP to solving a gap instance of a \textsc{$3$-Coloring} problem on a hypergraph. This hypergraph is based on the bounded-degree construction of Bogdanov et al. (FOCS 2002), which we enhance using the strong expanders of Alon and Capalbo (FOCS 2007). We demonstrate that if a rank-$3$ DPP achieves near-optimal log-likelihood, its marginal kernel must encode an almost perfect ``vector-coloring" of the hypergraph. Finally, we show that these continuous vectors can be decoded into a proper $3$-coloring after removing a small fraction of ``noisy" edges.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Finding Subgroups of a Given Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding a subgroup of a given order in a finite group, where the group is represented by its Cayley table. We analyze the complexity of the problem in the special case of abelian groups and present an optimal algorithm for finding a subgroup of a given order when the input is given in the form of a Cayley table. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has addressed the complexity of this problem under the Cayley table representation.</description>

      <title>Determining unit distance graphs with coordinates in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is NP-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of determining whether a graph $G$ can be realized as a unit-distance graph in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is NP-complete. As far as we can tell, a proof of this result has never been written up. We prove NP-completeness of this problem by implementing Eades and Whitesides' logic engine in this setting, and construct a graph that is realizable if and only if an arbitrary NA3SAT formula is satisfiable.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of the block gluing classes of homshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A homshift is a $d$-dimensional shift of finite type which arises as the space of graph homomorphisms from the grid graph $\mathbb Z^d$ to a finite connected undirected graph $G$. While shifts of finite type are known to be mired by the swamp of undecidability, homshifts seem to be better behaved and there was hope that all the properties of homshifts are decidable. In this paper we build on the work by Gangloff, Hellouin de Menibus and Oprocha (arxiv:2211.04075) to show that finer mixing properties are undecidable for reasons completely different than the ones used to prove undecidability for general multidimensional shifts of finite type. Inspired by the work of Gao, Jackson, Krohne and Seward (arxiv:1803.03872) and elementary algebraic topology, we interpret the square cover introduced by Gangloff, Hellouin de Menibus and Oprocha topologically. Using this interpretation, we prove that it is undecidable whether a homshift is $\Theta(n)$-block gluing or not, by relating this problem to the one of finiteness for finitely presented groups.</description>

      <title>Is a LOCAL algorithm computable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Common definitions of the "standard" LOCAL model tend to be sloppy and even self-contradictory on one point: do the nodes update their state using an arbitrary function or a computable function? So far, this distinction has been safe to neglect, since problems where it matters seem contrived and quite different from e.g. typical local graph problems studied in this context.
  We show that this question matters even for locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs), perhaps the most widely studied family of problems in the context of the LOCAL model. Furthermore, we show that assumptions about computability are directly connected to another aspect already recognized as highly relevant: whether we have any knowledge of $n$, the size of the graph. Concretely, we show that there is an LCL problem $\Pi$ with the following properties:
  1. $\Pi$ can be solved in $O(\log n)$ rounds if the LOCAL model is uncomputable.
  2. $\Pi$ can be solved in $O(\log n)$ rounds in the computable model if we know any upper bound on $n$.
  3. $\Pi$ requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ rounds in the computable model if we do not know anything about $n$.
  We also show that the connection between computability and knowledge of $n$ holds in general: for any LCL problem $\Pi$, if you have any bound on $n$, then $\Pi$ has the same round complexity in the computable and uncomputable models.</description>
