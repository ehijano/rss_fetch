      <title>A comparison of continuous and pulsed sideband cooling on an electric quadrupole transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sideband cooling enables preparation of trapped ion motion near the ground state and is essential for many scientific and technological applications of trapped ion devices. Here, we study the efficiency of continuous and pulsed sideband cooling using both first- and second-order sidebands applied to an ion where the motion starts outside the Lamb-Dicke regime. We find that after optimizing these distinct cooling methods, pulsed and continuous cooling achieve similar results based on simulations and experiments with a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion. We consider optimization of both average phonon number $\overline{n}$ and population in the ground state. We also demonstrate the disparity between $\overline{n}$ as measured by the sideband ratio method of trapped ion thermometry and the $\overline{n}$ found by averaging over the ion's motional state distribution.</description>

      <title>Optically-biased Rydberg microwave receiver enabled by hybrid nonlinear interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development in Rydberg-atomic detection of microwave fields has paved the way to a new type of intrinsically calibrated RF measurements. The coupling of Rydberg vapors medium both to microwave and optical fields allows harnessing the merits of all-optical detection, e.g.~weak disruption of the measured field and invulnerability to extremely strong fields, owing to the lack of conventional RF antenna in the detector. The trouble with this approach arises, as the greatest sensitivity is exhibited with the use of additional microwave field acting as a local oscillator, and the measurement can no longer be all-optical. Here we propose a different solution, optical-bias detection, that allows truly all-optical operation, while retaining most of the sensitivity. We tackle the issue of uncorrelated laser phase, emerging in this type of detection, by facilitating separate measurement of the phase spectrum in a nonlinear process and using the results in post-processing. We report the sensitivity of $176\ \mathrm{nV/cm/\sqrt{Hz}}$ and reliable operation up to $3.5\ \mathrm{mV/cm}$ of $13.9\ \mathrm{GHz}$ electric field, while comparing with the state of the art (although not all-optical) method realized in the same setup.</description>

      <title>Optimized detection modality for double resonance alignment based optical magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive and comparative analysis of two detection modalities, i.e., polarization rotation and absorption measurement of light, for a double resonance alignment based optical magnetometer (DRAM). We derive algebraic expressions for magnetometry signals based on multipole moments description. Experiments are carried out using a room-temperature paraffin-coated Caesium vapour cell and measuring either the polarization rotation or absorption of the transmitted laser light. A detailed experimental analysis of the resonance spectra is performed to validate the theoretical findings for various input parameters. The results signify the use of a single isotropic relaxation rate thus simplifying the data analysis for optimization of the DRAM. The sensitivity measurements are performed and reveal that the polarization rotation detection mode yields larger signals and better sensitivity than absorption measurement of light.</description>

      <title>Squeezing, trisqueezing, and quadsqueezing in a spin-oscillator system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum harmonic oscillators model a wide variety of phenomena ranging from electromagnetic fields to vibrations of atoms in molecules. Their excitations can be represented by bosons such as photons, single particles of light, or phonons, the quanta of vibrational energy. Linear interactions that only create and annihilate single bosons can generate coherent states of light or motion. Introducing nth-order nonlinear interactions, that instead involve n bosons, leads to increasingly complex quantum behaviour. For example, second-order interactions enable squeezing, used to enhance the precision of measurements beyond classical limits, while higher-order interactions create non-Gaussian states essential for continuous-variable quantum computation. However, generating nonlinear interactions is challenging, typically requiring higher-order derivatives of the driving field or specialized hardware. Hybrid systems, where linear interactions couple an oscillator to an additional spin, offer a solution and are readily available across many platforms. Here, using the spin of a single trapped ion coupled to its motion, we employ two linear interactions to demonstrate up to fourth-order bosonic interactions; we focus on generalised squeezing interactions and demonstrate squeezing, trisqueezing, and quadsqueezing. We characterise these interactions, including their spin dependence, and reconstruct the Wigner function of the resulting states. We also discuss the scaling of the interaction strength, where we drive the quadsqueezing interaction more than 100 times faster than using conventional techniques. Our method presents no fundamental limit in the interaction order n and applies to any platform supporting spin-dependent linear interactions. Strong higher-order nonlinear interactions unlock the study of fundamental quantum optics, quantum simulation, and computation in a hitherto unexplored regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum phenomena in attosecond science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond science has opened up new frontiers in our understanding of processes happening on the intrinsic timescale of electrons. The ability to manipulate and observe phenomena at the attosecond level has yielded groundbreaking insights into processes such as electron dynamics and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions. This interdisciplinary field bridges various research areas such as quantum optics, quantum chemistry and quantum information science facilitating a cohesive understanding. However, despite many emerging successful applications, the discussion about intrinsic quantum effects has mainly been ignored. In this Perspective, we explore the latest advancements in quantum phenomena within attosecond science, encompassing both experimental and theoretical progress. Specifically, in the context of high-harmonic generation and above-threshold ionization, we focus on discerning genuinely quantum observations and distinguishing them from classical phenomena. Additionally, we illuminate the often overlooked yet significant role of entanglement in attosecond processes, elucidating its influence on experimental outcomes.</description>
