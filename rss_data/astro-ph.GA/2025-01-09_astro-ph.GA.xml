      <title>Milky Way dynamics in light of Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia mission has triggered major developments in the field of Galactic dynamics in recent years, which we discuss in this review. The structure and kinematics of all Galactic components - disc, bar/bulge and halo - are now mapped in great detail not only in the Solar neighbourhood, but across a large part of the Milky Way. The dramatic improvements in the coverage and precision of observations revealed various disequilibrium processes, such as perturbations in the Galactic disc and the deformations of the outer halo, which are partly attributed to the interaction with satellite galaxies. The knowledge of the gravitational potential at all scales has also advanced considerably, but we are still far from having a consistent view on the key properties of the Galaxy, such as the bar pattern speed or the mass profile and shape of the dark halo. The complexity and interplay of several dynamical processes makes the interpretation of observational data challenging, and it is fair to say that more theoretical effort is needed to fully reap the fruit of the Gaia revolution.</description>

      <title>zELDA II: reconstruction of galactic Lyman-alpha spectra attenuated by the intergalactic medium using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed Lyman-Alpha (Lya) line profile is a convolution of the complex Lya radiative transfer taking place in the interstellar, circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (ISM, CGM, and IGM, respectively). Discerning the different components of the Lya line is crucial in order to use it as a probe of galaxy formation or the evolution of the IGM. We present the second version of zELDA (redshift Estimator for Line profiles of Distant Lyman-Alpha emitters), an open-source Python module focused on modeling and fitting observed Lya line profiles. This new version of zELDA focuses on disentangling the galactic from the IGM effects. We build realistic Lya line profiles that include the ISM and IGM contributions, by combining the Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations for the so called "shell model" (ISM) and IGM transmission curves generated from IllustrisTNG100. We use these mock line profiles to train different artificial neural networks. These use as input the observed spectrum and output the outflow parameters of the best fitting "shell model" along with the redshift and Lya emission IGM escape fraction of the source. We measure the accuracy of zELDA on mock Lya line profiles. We find that zELDA is capable of reconstructing the ISM emerging Lya line profile with high accuracy (Kolmogorov-Smirnov&lt;0.1) for 95% of the cases for HST COS-like observations and 80% for MUSE-WIDE-like. zELDA is able to measure the IGM transmission with the typical uncertainties below 10% for HST-COS and MUSE-WIDE data. This work represents a step forward in the high-precision reconstruction of IGM attenuated Lya line profiles. zELDA allows the disentanglement of the galactic and IGM contribution shaping the Lya line shape, and thus allows us to use Lya as a tool to study galaxy and ISM evolution.</description>

      <title>Structural Parameters of the Thin Disk Population from Evolved Stars in Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the structural parameters of the thin-disk population by analyzing the spatial distribution of evolved stars in the solar neighbourhood. From the $\it Gaia$ Data Release 3 database, about 39.1 million stars within 1 kpc and with relative parallax errors $\sigma_{\varpi}/\varpi\leq 0.10$ were selected. The photometric data was corrected for extinction using a Galactic dust map. The sample was refined by considering the color-magnitude region $M_{\rm G}\times (G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP})_0$ associated with evolved stars, applying a stricter parallax error limit of $\sigma_{\varpi}/\varpi\leq 0.02$, and yielding 671,600 stars. The star sample was divided into 36 regions based on their Galactic coordinates, with evolved stars in the absolute magnitude range of $-1&lt; M_{\rm G}~{\rm (mag)}\leq 4$ further split into five one-unit magnitude intervals. This led to 180 subgroups whose space density profiles were modelled using a single-component Galaxy model. The analysis shows that the space densities are in agreement with the literature and that the scale heights vary with $200&lt;H~{\rm (pc)}&lt;600$ interval to their absolute magnitudes. Red clump stars in the solar neighbourhood were also estimated to have a scale height of $295\pm10$ pc. These findings indicate that evolved stars with bright absolute magnitudes originate from the evolution of the early spectral-type stars with short scale height, while fainter ones come from the evolution of the intermediate spectral-type stars with large scale height, suggesting variations in scale height reflect the contribution of Galactic evolution processes.</description>

      <title>Galaxy cluster characterization with machine learning techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the X-ray properties of the galaxy cluster population in the z=0 snapshot of the IllustrisTNG simulations, utilizing machine learning techniques to perform clustering and regression tasks. We examine five properties of the hot gas (the central cooling time, the central electron density, the central entropy excess, the concentration parameter, and the cuspiness) which are commonly used as classification metrics to identify cool core (CC), weak cool core (WCC) and non cool core (NCC) clusters of galaxies. Using mock Chandra X-ray images as inputs, we first explore an unsupervised clustering scheme to see how the resulting groups correlate with the CC/WCC/NCC classification based on the different criteria. We observe that the groups replicate almost exactly the separation of the galaxy cluster images when classifying them based on the concentration parameter. We then move on to a regression task, utilizing a ResNet model to predict the value of all five properties. The network is able to achieve a mean percentage error of 1.8% for the central cooling time, and a balanced accuracy of 0.83 on the concentration parameter, making them the best-performing metrics. Finally, we use simulation-based inference (SBI) to extract posterior distributions for the network predictions. Our neural network simultaneously predicts all five classification metrics using only mock Chandra X-ray images.
  This study demonstrates that machine learning is a viable approach for analyzing and classifying the large galaxy cluster datasets that will soon become available through current and upcoming X-ray surveys, such as eROSITA.</description>

      <title>Effects of galactic environment on size and dark matter content in low-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the cosmological volume simulation, FIREbox, to investigate how a galaxy's environment influences its size and dark matter content. Our study focuses on approximately 1,200 galaxies (886 central and 332 satellite halos) in the low-mass regime, with stellar masses between $10^6$ to $10^9$ $M_{\odot}$. We analyze the size-mass relation ($r_{50} - M_{\star}$), inner dark matter mass-stellar mass ($M^{50}_{\rm DM} - M_{\star}$) relation, and the halo mass-stellar mass ($M_{\rm halo} - M_{\star}$) relation. At fixed stellar mass, we find the galaxies experiencing stronger tidal influences, indicated by higher Perturbation Indices (PI $&gt;$ 1) are generally larger and have lower masses relative to their counterparts with lower Perturbation Indices (PI $&lt;$ 1). Applying a Random Forest regression model, we show that both the environment (PI) and halo mass ($M_{rm halo}$) are significant predictors of a galaxy's relative size and dark matter content. Notably, because $M_{\rm halo}$ is also strongly affected by the environment, our findings indicate that environmental conditions not only influence galactic sizes and relative inner dark matter content directly, but also indirectly through their impact on halo mass. Our results highlight a critical interplay between environmental factors and halo mass in shaping galaxy properties, affirming the environment as a fundamental driver in galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey, a 77.2 hour Director's Discretionary Early Release Science Program. CEERS demonstrates, tests, and validates efficient extragalactic surveys using coordinated, overlapping parallel observations with the JWST instrument suite, including NIRCam and MIRI imaging, NIRSpec low (R~100) and medium (R~1000) resolution spectroscopy, and NIRCam slitless grism (R~1500) spectroscopy. CEERS targets the Hubble Space Telescope-observed region of the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) field, supported by a rich set of multiwavelength data. CEERS facilitated immediate community science in both of the extragalactic core JWST science drivers ``First Light" and ``Galaxy Assembly," including: 1) The discovery and characterization of large samples of galaxies at z &gt;~ 10 from ~90 arcmin^2 of NIRCam imaging, constraining their abundance and physical nature; 2) Deep spectra of &gt;1000 galaxies, including dozens of galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;10, enabling redshift measurements and constraints on the physical conditions of star-formation and black hole growth via line diagnostics; 3) Quantifying the first bulge, bar and disk structures at z&gt;3; and 4) Characterizing galaxy mid-IR emission with MIRI to study dust-obscured star-formation and supermassive black hole growth at z~1-3. As a legacy product for the community, the CEERS team has provided several data releases, accompanied by detailed notes on the data reduction procedures and notebooks to aid in reproducibility. In addition to an overview of the survey and quality of the data, we provide science highlights from the first two years with CEERS data.</description>

      <title>Signs of `Everything Everywhere All At Once' formation in low surface brightness globular cluster-rich dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Only two ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) have spatially resolved stellar population properties, both showing radially flat-to-rising metallicity profiles, indicative of a different formation pathway to most dwarf galaxies. The scarcity of other low surface brightness (LSB) dwarfs with a similar analysis prevents a deeper understanding on this behaviour. We investigate the radial profiles of the ages, metallicities and star formation histories of four globular cluster (GC) rich LSB dwarfs, newly observed within the 'Analysis of Galaxies At The Extremes' (AGATE) collaboration. DFX1 and DF07 are bona-fide UDGs, while PUDG-R27 and VCC1448 are nearly UDGs (NUDGes). Comparing their and DF44's results to simulations, we aim to reveal their formation pathways. We use pPXF to fit different spectra extracted in annular apertures to recover the stellar population properties and compute their gradients. We compare those with a sample of literature classical dwarfs and simulations, in particular with simulated UDGs. Our five LSB dwarfs present flat age and flat-to-rising metallicity profiles. The flat age gradients are compatible with those of classical dwarfs (both observed and from cosmological simulations), but the metallicity gradient diverges. All of our LSB dwarfs (except for PUDG-R27, showing a pronounced increasing metallicity profile) are compatible with being the extreme tail of the age-metallicity gradient relation, with a preference to co-eval formation forming the galaxy all at once. This sample of GC-rich LSB dwarfs with spatially resolved properties confirms that they seem to follow a different formation path than classical dwarfs. However, larger samples with higher S/N spectra and varying amounts of GC richness are required to set robust constraints on the formation pathways of LSB dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Streams, Shells, and Substructures in the Accretion-Built Stellar Halo of NGC 300</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep optical observations of the stellar halo of NGC 300, an LMC-mass galaxy, acquired with the DEEP sub-component of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE) using the 4 m Blanco Telescope. Our resolved star analysis reveals a large, low surface brightness stellar stream ($M_{V}\sim-8.5$; [Fe/H] $= -1.4\pm0.15$) extending more than 40 kpc north from the galaxy's center. We also find other halo structures, including potentially an additional stream wrap to the south, which may be associated with the main stream. The morphology and derived low metallicities of the streams and shells discovered surrounding NGC 300 are highly suggestive of a past accretion event. Assuming a single progenitor, the accreted system is approximately Fornax-like in luminosity, with an inferred mass ratio to NGC 300 of approximately $1:15$. We also present the discovery of a metal-poor globular cluster ($R_{\rm{proj}}=23.3$~kpc; $M_{V}=-8.99\pm0.16$; [Fe/H] $\approx-1.6\pm0.6$) in the halo of NGC 300, the furthest identified globular cluster associated with NGC 300. The stellar structures around NGC 300 represent the richest features observed in a Magellanic Cloud analog to date, strongly supporting the idea that accretion and subsequent disruption is an important mechanism in the assembly of dwarf galaxy stellar halos.</description>

      <title>The angular momentum spiral of the Milky Way disc in Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data from the Gaia mission shows prominent phase-space spirals that are the signatures of disequilibrium in the Milky Way (MW) disc. In this work, we present a novel perspective on the phase-space spiral in angular momentum (AM) space. Using Gaia DR3, we detect a prominent AM spiral in the solar neighbourhood. We demonstrate the relation of AM to the $z-v_z$ spiral and show that we can map to this space from angular momentum through simplifying assumptions. By modelling the orbit of stars in AM, we develop a generative model for the spiral where the disc is perturbed by a bulk tilt at an earlier time. Our model successfully describes the salient features of the AM spiral in the data. Modelling the phase spiral in AM is a promising method to constrain both perturbation and MW potential parameters. Our AM framework simplifies the interpretation of the spiral and offers a robust approach to modelling disequilibrium in the MW disc using all six dimensions of phase space simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Non-stop Variability of Sgr A* using JWST at 2.1 and 4.8 micron Wavelengths: Evidence for Distinct Populations of Faint and Bright Variable Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first results of JWST Cycle 1 and 2 observations of Sgr A* using NIRCam taken simultaneously at 2.1 and 4.8 micron for a total of ~48 hours over seven different epochs in 2023 and 2024. We find correlated variability at 2.1 and 4.8 micron in all epochs, continual short-time scale (a few seconds) variability and epoch-to-epoch variable emission implying long-term ( ~days to months) variability of Sgr A*. A highlight of this analysis is the evidence for sub-minute, horizon-scale time variability of Sgr A*, probing inner accretion disk size scales. The power spectra of the light curves in each observing epoch also indicate long-term variable emission. With continuous observations, JWST data suggest that the flux of Sgr A* is fluctuating constantly. The flux density correlation exhibits a distinct break in the slope at ~3 mJy at 2.1 micron. The analysis indicates two different processes contributing to the variability of Sgr A*. Brighter emission trends towards shallower spectral indices than the fainter emission. Cross correlation of the light curves indicates for the first time, a time delay of 3 - 40 sec in the 4.8 micron variability with respect to 2.1 micron. This phase shift leads to loops in plots of flux density vs spectral index as the emission rises and falls. Modeling suggests that the synchrotron emission from the evolving, age-stratified electron population reproduces the shape of the observed light curves with a direct estimate of the magnetic field strengths in the range between 40-90 G, and upper cutoff energy, E_c, between 420 and 720 MeV.</description>

      <title>\texttt{Pz Cats}: Photometric redshift catalogs based on DES Y3 BAO sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photometric redshift estimation (photo-z) has been developed over the years with various methods. In this work, we analyse four different photo-z estimators using the Dark Energy Survey Y3 BAO Sample: \texttt{ANNz2}, \texttt{BPZ}, \texttt{ENF}, and \texttt{DNF}. Unlike what is usually found in the literature, we investigate the possibility of selecting the best galaxies according to their redshift Probability Distribution Function (PDF). We selected 25,760 galaxies from four different spectroscopic surveys and cross-matched them with the photo-z sample. These galaxies served to understand the redshift bias and its 68th percentile $\sigma_{68}$. We found that within a range of $0.79&lt;z_p&lt;0.85$ there is the lowest $\sigma$ for all the estimators we analysed. \texttt{DNF} has the biggest absolute value of the bias ($\sigma$), while \texttt{ENF}, \texttt{ANNz2} and \texttt{BPZ} lose precision for a redshift range below 0.7 and higher than 0.9. If one wants to pick the best galaxies by removing the bins with the worst bias, one will find that \texttt{ANNz2} is the most robust algorithm for all chosen criteria. When selecting the best PDFs, the resulting sub-samples gave \texttt{BPZ} with more selected objects. \texttt{ANNz2} shows better precision, \texttt{ENF} has the worst selection of Gaussian PDFs, with very few galaxies left for an LSS study. We also showed that even though the PDFs are smooth, there are catastrophic redshift results. Lastly, \texttt{DNF} is the worst in precision but with sufficient galaxies for cosmological analysis. We also selected galaxies whose PDFs have only secondary peaks not bigger than 30\% of the main peak height, called Small Peaks. For these sub-samples, \texttt{ANNz2} outperformed the other algorithms. We will make all catalogs publicly available through the package \texttt{Pz Cats}.</description>

      <title>Research on the Interstellar Medium and Star Formation in the Galaxy: An Indian Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the star formation process has been studied for decades, many important aspects of the physics involved remain unsolved. Recent advancement of instrumentation in the infrared, far-infrared and sub-millimetre wavelength regimes have contributed to a significantly improved understanding of processes in the interstellar medium (ISM) leading to star formation. The future of research on the ISM and star formation looks exciting with instruments like the JWST, ALMA, etc., already contributing to the topic by gathering high-resolution high-sensitivity data and with several larger ground- and space-bound facilities either being planned or constructed. India has a sizable number of astronomers engaged in research on topics related to the ISM and star formation. In this white paper invited by the Astronomical Society of India to prepare a vision document for Indian astronomy, we review the Indian contributions to the global understanding of the star formation process and suggest areas that require focused efforts both in creating observing facilities and in theoretical front in India, in order to improve the impact of our research in the coming decades.</description>

      <title>LAMOST Reveals Long-lived Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While both observations and theories demonstrate that protoplanetary disks are not expected to live much longer than $\sim$10 Myr, several examples of prolonged disks have been observed in the past. In this work, we perform a systematic search for aged YSOs still surrounded by protoplanetary disks in the M star catalog from the LAMOST archive. We identify 14 sources older than 10 Myr, still surrounded by protoplanetary disks and with ongoing accretion activities, significantly improving the census of the category known as the Peter Pan disks. The stellar parameters, variability and accretion properties of these objects, as well as their spatial distribution, are investigated. Nearly all of these objects are distributed far away from nearby associations and star forming regions, but show evidence of being members of open clusters. Investigating the correlation between mass accretion rates and stellar masses, we find these long-lived disks accrete at systematically lower levels, compared to their younger counterparts with similar stellar masses. Studying the evolution of mass accretion rates with stellar ages, we find these aged disks follow similar trend as young ones.</description>

      <title>The Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments: CASCADE. IV. Unveiling the hidden structures in DR18</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cygnus-X complex is a massive, nearby (1.4 kpc) star-forming region with several OB associations. As part of the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE) program, we carried out 3.6 millimeter (mm) continuum and spectral line high-resolution observations ($\sim$ 3 - 4$''$) toward DR18, covering several molecular species with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) and the Institut de Radioastronomie Millim\'etrique (IRAM) 30m telescope. In addition, multi-wavelength archival datasets were used to provide a comprehensive analysis of the region. A comparison of the 3.6mm and 6 cm continuum emission confirms that a B2 star (DR18-05) shapes the cometary HII region in the DR18 cavity, with ionized gas escaping toward the OB2 association. On the other hand, the extended 3.6mm and 6 cm continuum emission are likely to trace photoevaporating ionized gas from ultraviolet radiation from the Cyg OB2 association, not from DR18-05. The shell structure around DR18-05 indicates photodissociation regions (PDRs) formed by the expanding HII region and photo-erosion from DR18-05 and OB2 stars. We also identified 18 compact cores with N$_2$H$^+$ emission, half of which are gravitationally bound and mostly located in colder regions behind the PDRs. The SiO emission is found only in PDRs, with narrow-line widths ( 0.8 - 2.0 km s$^{-1}$) and lower abundances (X(SiO) $\sim$ 5$\times$10$^{-11}$ - 1$\times$10$^{-10}$). Comparing with the UV irradiated shock models, we suggest that the SiO emission partially encompassing the HII region arises from the molecular gas region, marginally compressed by low-velocity shocks with $\sim$ 5 km s$^{-1}$, irradiated by external UV radiation (G$_{\rm 0} \sim 10^{2} - 10^{3}$), as they traverse through a medium with $n_{\rm H} \sim 10^{4}$ to 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Vertical structure and kinematics of the LMC disc from SDSS/Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abbreviated] Context: Studies of the LMC's internal kinematics have provided a detailed view of its structure, largely by the exquisite proper motion data supplied by Gaia. However, LoS velocities are only available for a small subset of Gaia data, limiting studies of the kinematics perpendicular to the LMC disc plane. Aims: We synergise new SDSS-IV/V LoS velocity measurements with Gaia data, increasing the 5D phase-space sample by almost a factor of three. We interpret and model the vertical structure and kinematics of the LMC disc. Methods: Split our sample into different stellar types. Then examine maps of vertical velocity moments perpendicular to the LMC disc. We interpret our results within three possible scenarios: 1) time-variability in the orientation of the disc symmetry axis; 2) use of an incorrect LMC disc plane orientation; or 3) the presence of warps or twists in the LMC disc. We also present a new method to construct a continuous 3D representation of the disc from spatially-resolved measurements of its viewing angles. Results: Using young stellar populations, we identify a region in the LMC arm with highly negative v_z'; this overlaps spatially with the supershell LMC 4. Our results indicate that: 1) the LMC viewing angles may vary with time, but this cannot explain most of the structure in v_z' maps; 2) when re-deriving the LMC disc plane by minimising the RMS vertical velocity v_z' across the disc, the inclination and line-of-nodes position angle are i ~ 24 degr and \Omega ~ 327 degr, respectively; 3) we obtain different inclinations for the inner and outer disc regions, and a quadrupolar variation with azimuth in outer the disc. We provide 3D models of the LMC disc shape. Conclusions: The combination of SDSS-IV/V and Gaia data reveal that the LMC disc is not a flat plane in equilibrium, but that the central bar region is tilted relative to a warped outer disc.</description>

      <title>Toward early-type eclipsing binaries as extragalactic milestones: IV. Physical properties of three detached O/B-type systems in the LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete set of physical parameters for three early-type eclipsing binary systems in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC): OGLE LMC-ECL-17660, OGLE LMC-ECL-18794, and HV 2274, together with the orbital solutions. The first and third systems comprise B-type stars, while the second has O-type components and exhibits a total eclipse. We performed a complex analysis that included modeling light and radial velocity curves, O-C analysis, and additional non-LTE spectroscopic analysis for the O-type system. We found that OGLE LMC-ECL-17660 is at least a triple and, tentatively, a quadruple. A significant non-linear period decrease was determined for HV 2274. Its origin is unclear, possibly due to a faint, low-mass companion on a wide orbit. The analyzed components have masses ranging from 11.7 M$_\odot$ to 22.1 M$_\odot$, radii from 7.0 R$_\odot$ to 14.2 R$_\odot$, and temperatures between 22500 K and 36000 K. For HV 2274, the precision of our masses and radii is about six times higher than in previous studies. The position of the components of all six systems analyzed in this series on the mass-luminosity and mass-radius diagrams indicates they are evolutionarily advanced on the main sequence. Our sample contributes significantly to the knowledge of physical parameters of early-type stars in the mass range of 11 M$_\odot$ to 23 M$_\odot$. A new mass-luminosity relation for O and B-type stars in the LMC is provided. Additionally, we used the measured apsidal motion of the systems to compare the observational and theoretical internal structure constant.</description>

      <title>Detecting Exomoons in Free-Floating-Planet Events from Space-based Microlensing Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a planet is ejected from its star-planet system due to dynamical interactions, its satellite may remain gravitationally bound to the planet. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will be capable of detecting a large number of low-mass free-floating planet events (FFPs) from a bulge microlensing survey. We assess the feasibility of detecting satellites (a.k.a., exomoons) orbiting FFPs by simulating CSST light curves and calculating the detection efficiency as a function of satellite-to-planet mass ratios (q) and projected separations (s) in units of the Einstein radius. For a Neptune-class FFP in the Galactic disk with a Sun-like star as the microlensed source, CSST can detect Earth-mass satellites over a decade of separations (from ~0.01 to ~0.1 AU) and has sensitivity down to Moon-mass satellites (q~1e-3) at s~1. CSST also has some sensitivity to detect Moon-mass satellites at s~2 (~0.02 AU) orbiting an Earth-mass FFP in the disk. CSST has substantially reduced sensitivity for detecting satellites when the source star is an M dwarf, compared to a Sun-like source. We also calculate the satellite detection efficiency for the dedicated microlensing survey of the Roman Space Telescope (Roman), which demonstrates greater sensitivity than CSST, particularly for M-dwarf sources. Notably, some of the Neptune-Earth systems detectable by CSST and Roman may exhibit significant tidal heating.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Classics: On the Statistics of Dust Formation in Novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While nova eruptions produce some of the most common and dramatic dust formation episodes among astrophysical transients, the demographics of dust-forming novae remain poorly understood. Here, we present a statistical study of dust formation in 40 novae with high-quality optical/IR light curves, quantitatively distinguishing dust-forming from non-dust-forming novae while exploring the properties of the dust events. We find that 50-70% of novae produce dust, significantly higher than previous estimates. Dust-forming novae can be separated from those that do not show dust formation by using the largest redward ($V-K$) colour change from peak visible brightness; ($V-J$) or ($V-H$) offer useful but less sensitive constraints. This makes optical+IR photometry a powerful tool to quantify dust formation in novae. We find that novae detected in GeV $\gamma$-rays by \emph{Fermi}-LAT appear to form dust more often than novae not detected by \emph{Fermi}, implying a possible connection between $\gamma$-ray producing shocks and dust production. We also find that novae that evolve very quickly ($t_2 &lt; 10$ days) are much less likely to form dust, in agreement with previous findings. We confirm a correlation between $t_2$ and the time of the onset of dust formation (which occurs $\sim$1 week--3 months after maximum light), but conclude that it is primarily an observational artifact driven by dust formation determining when a nova drops 2 mag below peak. The significant fraction of novae that form dust make them ideal laboratories in our Galactic backyard to tackle the puzzle of dust formation around explosive transients.</description>

      <title>Galaxy dynamics, gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system, Landau damping, and scattering theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system linearized around steady states that are extensively used in galaxy dynamics. Namely, polytropes and King steady states. We develop a complete stationary scattering theory for the selfadjoint, strictly positive, Antonov operator that governs the plane-symmetric linearized dynamics. We identify the absolutely continuous spectrum of the Antonov operator. Namely, we prove that the absolutely continuous spectrum of the Antonov operator coincides with its essential spectrum and with the spectrum of the unperturbed Antonov operator. Moreover, we prove that the part of the singular spectrum of the Antonov operator that is embedded in its absolutely continuous spectrum is contained in a closed set of measure zero, that we characterize. We construct the generalized Fourier maps and we prove that they are partially isometric with initial subspace the absolutely continuous subspace of the Antonov operator and that they are onto the Hilbert space where the Antonov operator is defined. Furthermore, we prove that the wave operators exist, are isometric, and are complete. Moreover, we obtain stationary formulae for the wave operators and we prove that Birman's invariance principle holds.Further, we prove that the gravitational Landau damping holds for the solutions to the linearized gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system with initial data in the absolutely continuous subspace of the Antonov operator. Namely, we prove that the gravitational force and its time derivative, as well as the gravitational potential and its time derivative, tend to zero as time tends to $\pm \infty.$ Furthermore, for these initial states the solutions to the linearized gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system are asymptotic, for large times, to the orbits of the gravitational potential of the steady state, in the sense that they are transported along these orbits.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and their gravitational wave radiations around the Schwarzschild MOG black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the motion of massive particles in the gravitational field of a modified gravity (MOG) black hole (BH), characterized by the parameter $\alpha$. Using the Hamiltonian formalism, the geodesic equations and the effective potential governing particle trajectories are derived. Key features, including the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the innermost bound circular orbit (IBCO), are analyzed, revealing their dependence on the particle's energy, angular momentum, and the MOG parameter. In the extremal case, where $\alpha=-1$, the event horizon merges with the Cauchy horizon, forming a distinctive BH configuration. Numerical methods are employed to compute periodic orbits in this spacetime, with a comparison drawn to the Schwarzschild BH. The findings indicate that for $\alpha&gt;0$, periodic orbits around Schwarzschild-MOG BH exhibit lower energy requirements than those in Schwarzschild spacetime, whereas for $-1&lt;\alpha&lt;0$, the energy requirements are higher. Precessing orbits near periodic trajectories are also examined, offering insights into their complex dynamical behavior. Finally, the gravitational wave (GW) radiation from the periodic orbits of a test particle around the Schwarzschild-MOG BH is examined, generating intricate waveforms that provide insights into the gravitational structure of the system.</description>

      <title>JWST photometry and astrometry of 47 Tucanae. Discontinuity in the stellar sequence at the star/brown dwarf transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) images of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (or NGC 104), taken at two epochs just 7 months apart, we derived proper-motion membership down to $m_{\rm F322W2} \sim 27$. We identified an intriguing feature at the very low-mass end of the main sequence, around $\sim$ 0.08 solar masses, at magnitudes $m_{\rm F322W2} \sim 24$ and $m_{\rm F150W2} \sim 25$. This feature, dubbed "kink", is characterized by a prominent discontinuity in the slope of the main sequence. A similar discontinuity is seen in theoretical isochrones with oxygen-poor chemistries, related to the rapid onset of CH$_4$ absorption. We therefore hypothesize that the cluster hosts disproportionately more oxygen-poor stars near the bottom of the main sequence compared to the upper main sequence and the red giant branch. Our results show no strong or conclusive evidence of a rise in the brown dwarf luminosity function at faint magnitudes, in contrast to previous findings likely affected by faint red background galaxies. In our analysis, we accounted for this contamination by using proper motion membership.</description>

      <title>ALMA observations of CO isotopologues towards six obscured post-AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low- and intermediate-mass stars evolve through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), when an efficient mass-loss process removes a significant fraction of their initial mass. A substantial increase in the mass-loss rate at the end of the AGB is observed for at least some stars for unknown reasons. This creates post-AGB objects that are completely enshrouded in thick dusty envelopes and might be associated with binary interactions. We observed the $J=2-1$ line of $^{13}$CO, C$^{17}$O, and C$^{18}$O with the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array (ALMA) towards six obscured post-AGB stars (four C-rich and two O-rich sources) to constrain the properties of their circumstellar envelopes, recent mass-loss histories, and initial mass of the central stars. Based on the inferred $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O isotopic ratios, we find all stars to have relatively low initial masses ($&lt; 2~M_\odot$) contrary to suggestions in the literature of higher masses for some sources. We infer a mass for HD~187885 $\sim 1.15~M_\odot$, which is relatively low for a carbon star. For all but one source (GLMP~950), we observe kinematic components with velocities $\gtrsim 30$~km~s$^{-1}$, which are faster than typical AGB wind expansion velocities. For most sources, these higher-velocity outflows display point-symmetric morphologies. The case of Hen~3-1475 is particularly spectacular, with the high-velocity molecular outflow interleaved with the high-velocity outflow of ionised gas observed at optical wavelengths. Based on the size of the emission regions of the slow components of the outflows, we derive typical kinematic ages associated with the C$^{18}$O~$J=2-1$ emission $\lesssim 1500$~years and obtain relatively high associated mass-loss rates ($\gtrsim10^{-4}~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$). The sources with known spectral types are found to have evolved faster than expected based on stellar evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>The distribution of misalignment angles in multipolar planetary nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the projected angle on the plane of the sky between adjacent symmetry axes of tens of multipolar planetary nebulae and find that the distribution of these misalignment angles implies a random three-dimensional angle distribution limited to &lt;60 degrees. We identify a symmetry axis as a line connecting two opposite lobes (bubbles) or clumps. We build a cumulative distribution function of the projected angles (alpha) and find that an entirely random distribution of the three-dimensional angles (delta) between adjacent symmetry axes, namely, uncorrelated directions, does not fit the observed one. A good fit to the observed distribution is a limited random distribution of the three-dimensional angle between adjacent symmetry axes, i.e., random distribution in the range of 20&lt;delta&lt;60 degrees. We assume that a pair of jets along the angular momentum axis of an accretion disk around the companion shape each symmetry axis. The limited random distribution might result from two sources of angular momentum to the accretion disks with comparable magnitude: one with a fixed direction and one with a stochastic direction variation. We discuss a scenario where the fixed-axis angular momentum source is the binary orbital angular momentum, while the stochastic source of angular momentum is due to the vigorous envelope convection of the mass-losing giant progenitor.</description>

      <title>Searching for dark matter annihilating into light-long-lived mediators from stars inside dwarf spheroidal galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several astrophysical and cosmological observations suggest the existence of dark matter (DM) through its gravitational effects, yet its nature remains elusive. Despite the lack of DM signals from direct detection experiments, efforts continue to focus on the indirect detection of DM from DM-rich astrophysical objects. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are among the most promising targets for such searches. In this work, we aim to investigate the expected DM capture rate from the stellar component of 10 nearby DM-rich dSphs, assuming that the accumulated DM eventually annihilates into light, long-lived mediators (LLLMs) which decay into gamma rays outside the dSphs. We analyze nearly 16 years of {\it Fermi}-LAT data to search for DM annihilation through LLLMs, and, from the observed stacked flux upper limits, set limits on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section using model-independent methods. Additionally, we incorporate the Sommerfeld Enhancement (SE) effect into the DM annihilation process, obtaining bounds on the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section of $\sim~10^{-36} {\rm cm}^2$ for DM masses around 100 GeV. This allows us to explore an alternative avenue for exploring DM phenomena from dSphs and compare our results with the bounds reported by direct DM detection experiments and other celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>Kerr black hole parameters and its distance from the Earth in terms of directly measurable quantities of accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extract elegant and concise analytic formulae for the mass and rotation parameters of the Kerr black hole as well as its distance from the Earth only in terms of directly measurable quantities of the accretion disk revolving in the black hole spacetime background. To this end, we consider massive geodesic particles circularly orbiting the Kerr black hole in the equatorial plane and emitting frequency-shifted photons toward a distant observer. We calculate the frequency shift and redshift rapidity at the detector location, and by solving an inverse problem, we express the Kerr black hole parameters and its distance from a distant observer in terms of a handful of observable elements, such as frequency shift, aperture angle of the telescope, and redshift rapidity, a newly introduced concept in [1]. The aperture angle of the telescope (angular distance) characterizes the emitter position on the sky, and the redshift rapidity is an observable relativistic invariant representing the proper time evolution of the frequency shift. The relations presented in this article allow us to disentangle mass, spin, and distance to the black holes in the Kerr spacetime background and obtain these parameters separately. Our analytic formulae are valid on the midline and close to the line of sight, and they can be directly applied to supermassive black holes hosted at the core of active galactic nuclei orbited by water vapor clouds within their accretion disks. The generic exact relations are valid for an arbitrary point of the emitter's orbit, and they can be employed in black hole parameter estimation studies.</description>

      <title>A study of the frequency and characteristics of stellar companions and Jupiter-like planets in nearby open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of companions of solar-type stars in nearby young moving groups (NYMGs) show that they split into two groups: stellar and brown dwarf companions (mass ratio $q&gt;0.05$) and Jupiter-like (JL) planets ($q&lt;0.02$). The frequency of JL planets in NYMGs appears to be higher than that obtained from radial velocity (RV) surveys. We extended the search for companions to three nearby clusters of intermediate age: Hyades, Coma Berenices, and Ursa Major. They are older and formed in more massive events than the NYMGs. The sample of host stars is complete for the core of the clusters, while we considered only a fraction of the tidal tails. We used the same methods considered for the members of NYMGs. We obtained a fairly complete sample of stellar companions and detected six massive JL planets. We found a lower frequency of equal-mass companions than in the NYMGs; this might be related to how binaries form in these environments. We also observed a concentration of stellar binaries in the cores of Ursa Major and Coma Berenices; we attribute this to the selective loss of low-mass systems. The observed scarcity of wide companions in Hyades can be due to the destruction of binaries in close encounters. The frequency of JL planets is lower than in the NYMGs but similar to that obtained from RV surveys. This extends the correlation with age and mass previously found for NYMGs. Results of this study alone do not indicate whether age or mass are the factors driving the observed correlation. A comparison of the frequencies of free-floating planets from microlenses and in young associations favours mass as the main driving parameter. Once the initial cluster mass function is considered, the frequency of JL planets in NYMGs is consistent with the results obtained using RVs.</description>

      <title>Testing Lyman Alpha Emitters and Lyman-Break Galaxies as Tracers of Large-Scale Structures at High Redshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We test whether Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) and Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) can be good tracers of high-z large-scale structures, using the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We identify LAEs using the Ly{\alpha} emission line luminosity and its equivalent width, and LBGs using the broad-band magnitudes at z~2.4, 3.1, and 4.5. We first compare the spatial distributions of LAEs, LBGs, all galaxies, and dark matter around the filamentary structures defined by dark matter. The comparison shows that both LAEs and LBGs are more concentrated toward the dark matter filaments than dark matter. We also find an empirical fitting formula for the vertical density profile of filaments as a binomial power-law relation of the distance to the filaments. We then compare the spatial distributions of the samples around the filaments defined by themselves. LAEs and LBGs are again more concentrated toward their filaments than dark matter. We also find the overall consistency between filamentary structures defined by LAEs, LBGs, and dark matter, with the median spatial offsets that are smaller than the mean separation of the sample. These results support the idea that the LAEs and LBGs could be good tracers of large-scale structures of dark matter at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Flattening of Galaxy Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly inclined (edge-on) disk galaxies offer the unique perspective to constrain their intrinsic flattening, $c/a$, where $c$ and $a$ are respectively the vertical and long radial axes of the disk measured at suitable stellar densities. The ratio $c/a$ is a necessary quantity in the assessment of galaxy inclinations, three-dimensional structural reconstructions, total masses, as well as a constraint to galaxy formation models. 3.6 micron maps of 133 edge-on spiral galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G) and its early-type galaxy extension are used to revisit the assessment of $c/a$ free from dust extinction and away from the influence of a stellar bulge. We present a simple definition of $c/a$ and explore trends with other galactic physical parameters: total stellar mass, concentration index, total HI mass, mass of the central mass concentration, circular velocity, model-dependent scales, as well as Hubble type. Other than a dependence on early/late Hubble types, and a related trend with light concentration, no other parameters were found to correlate with the intrinsic flattening of spiral galaxies. The latter is mostly constant with $\langle c/a \rangle$ = 0.124 $\pm$ 0.001 (stat) $\pm$ 0.033 (intrinsic/systematic) and greater for earlier types.</description>

      <title>The infrared luminosity of retired and post-starburst galaxies: A cautionary tale for star formation rate measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In galaxies with significant ongoing star formation there is an impressively tight correlation between total infrared luminosity (L$_{TIR}$) and H$\alpha$ luminosity (L$_{H\alpha}$), when H$\alpha$ is properly corrected for stellar absorption and dust attenuation. This long-standing result gives confidence that both measurements provide accurate estimates of a galaxy's star formation rate (SFR), despite their differing origins. To test the extent to which this holds in galaxies with lower specific SFR (sSFR=SFR/M$_{gal}$), we combine optical spectroscopy from the SDSS with multi-wavelength (FUV to FIR) photometric observations from GAMA. We find that L$_{TIR}$/L$_{H\alpha}$ increases steadily with decreasing H$\alpha$ equivalent width (W$_{H\alpha}$, a proxy for sSFR), indicating that both luminosities cannot provide a valid measurement of SFR in galaxies below the canonical star-forming sequence. For both `retired galaxies' and `post-starburst galaxies', L$_{TIR}$/L$_{H\alpha}$ can be up to a factor of 30 larger than for star-forming galaxies. The smooth change in L$_{TIR}$/L$_{H\alpha}$, irrespective of star formation history, ionisation or heating source, dust temperature or other properties, suggests that the value of L$_{TIR}$/L$_{H\alpha}$ is determined by the balance between star-forming regions and ambient interstellar medium contributing to both L$_{TIR}$ and H$\alpha$. It is not a result of the differing timescales of star formation that these luminosities probe. While L$_{H\alpha}$ can only be used to estimate the SFR for galaxies with $W_{H\alpha}$ &gt; 3A (sSFR $\gtrsim 10^{-11.5}$/yr), we argue that the mid- and far-infrared can only be used to estimate the SFR of galaxies on the star-forming sequence with W$_{H\alpha}$ &gt;10A (sSFR $\gtrsim 10^{-10.5}$/yr). We find no evidence for dust obscured star-formation in local post-starburst galaxies.</description>

      <title>Exploring Magnetic Fields in Molecular Clouds through Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately measuring magnetic field strength in the interstellar medium, including giant molecular clouds (GMCs), remains a significant challenge. We present a machine learning approach using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to estimate magnetic field strength from synthetic observables such as column density, dust continuum polarization vector orientation angles, and line-of-sight (LOS) nonthermal velocity dispersion. We trained three versions of the DDPM model: the 1-channel DDPM (using only column density), the 2-channel DDPM (incorporating both column density and polarization angles), and the 3-channel DDPM (which combines column density, polarization angles, and LOS nonthermal velocity dispersion). We assessed the models on both synthetic test samples and new simulation data that were outside the training set's distribution. The 3-channel DDPM consistently outperformed both the other DDPM variants and the power-law fitting approach based on column density alone, demonstrating its robustness in handling previously unseen data. Additionally, we compared the performance of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) methods, both classical and modified, to the DDPM predictions. The classical DCF method overestimated the magnetic field strength by approximately an order of magnitude. Although the modified DCF method showed improvement over the classical version, it still fell short of the precision achieved by the 3-channel DDPM.</description>

      <title>The cooler past of the intracluster medium in TNG-Cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intracluster medium (ICM) today is comprised largely of hot gas with clouds of cooler gas of unknown origin and lifespan. We analyze the evolution of cool gas (temperatures $\lesssim10^{4.5}$ K) in the ICM of 352 galaxy clusters from the TNG-Cluster simulations, with present-day mass $\sim10^{14.3-15.4}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. We follow the main progenitors of these clusters over the past $\sim13$ billion years (since $z\lesssim7$) and find that, according to TNG-Cluster, the cool ICM mass increases with redshift at fixed cluster mass, implying that this cooler past of the ICM is due to more than just halo growth. The cool cluster gas at $z\lesssim0.5$ is mostly located in and around satellite galaxies, while at $z\gtrsim2$ cool gas can also accrete via filaments from the intergalactic medium. Lower-mass and higher-redshift clusters are more susceptible to cooling. The cool ICM mass correlates with the number of gaseous satellites and inversely with the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass. The average number of gaseous satellites decreases since $z=2$, correlating with the decline in the cool ICM mass over cosmic time, suggesting a link between the two. Concurrently, kinetic SMBH feedback shifts the ICM temperature distribution, decreasing the cool ICM mass inside-out. At $z\approx0.5$, the predicted \ion{Mg}{ii} column densities are in the ballpark of recent observations, where satellites and other halos contribute significantly to the total \ion{Mg}{ii} column density. Suggestively, a non-negligible amount of the ICM cool gas forms stars in-situ at early times, reaching $\sim10^{2}\,{\rm M_\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ and an H$\alpha$ surface brightness of $\sim10^{-17}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,arcsec^{-2}}$ at $z\approx2$, detectable with Euclid and JWST.</description>

      <title>The S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey: Photometric Re-calibration with the BEst STar Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an independent validation and comprehensive re-calibration of S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey (USS) DR1 12-band photometry using about 30,000--70,000 standard stars from the BEst STar (BEST) database. We identify spatial variation of zero-point offsets, up to 30--40\,mmag for blue filters ($u$, $J0378$, $J0395$) and 10\,mmag for others, predominantly due to the higher uncertainties of the technique employed in the original USS calibration. Moreover, we detect large- and medium-scale CCD position-dependent systematic errors, up to 50\,mmag, primarily caused by different aperture and flat-field corrections. We then re-calibrate the USS DR1 photometry by correcting the systematic shifts for each tile using second-order two-dimensional polynomial fitting combined with a numerical stellar flat-field correction method. The re-calibrated results from the XPSP and the SCR standards are consistent within 6\,mmag in the USS zero-points, demonstrating both the typical precision of re-calibrated USS photometry and a sixfold improvement in USS zero-point precision. Further validation using SDSS and Pan-STARRS1, as well as LAMOST DR10 and Gaia photometry, also confirms this precision for the re-calibrated USS photometry. Our results clearly demonstrate the capability and the efficiency of the BEST database in improving calibration precision to the milli-magnitude level for wide-field photometric surveys. The re-calibrated USS DR1 photometry is publicly available: doi: 10.12149/101503 (https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/r101504/).</description>
