      <title>The evolution of nanoparticles due to Brownian coagulation in the temporal mixing layer with AK-iDNS over a long time</title>

Abstract: In this article, the evolution of nanoparticles in a two-dimensional temporal mixing layer over a long time is investigated. the flow field is calculated with direct numerical simulation (DNS), while the particle field is simulated using the average kernel method coupled with iterative direct numerical simulation (AK-iDNS). Under moderate Reynolds number, the flow field undergoes processes of vortex emergence, entrainment, rolling and pairing, merging, and dissipation. Due to the small Stokes number of nanoparticles, and the particles moves closely following the flow field. Meanwhile, the particle undergoes coagulation under the influence of Brownian motion. This article discusses the evolution nanoparticle under the combined effect of advection, diffusion and coagulation. Under the influence of vortices or large-scale coherent structures, the spatial distribution of particle moments is similar to the structure of the flow field. And diffusion and coagulation have a significant impact on the amplitude of the distribution of particle moments. However, diffusion has little impact on the mean distribution, while coagulation has a much greater impact on the mean distribution. As the flow field evolves, the temporal mixing layer degenerates into Couette flow. The particles exhibit similar asymptotic behavior as that of 0-dimensional problem.</description>

      <title>Emergence and maintenance of modularity in neural networks with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian inhibitory STDP</title>

Abstract: The modular and hierarchical organization of the brain is believed to support the coexistence of segregated (specialization) and integrated (binding) information processes. A relevant question is yet to understand how such architecture naturally emerges and is sustained over time, given the plastic nature of the brain's wiring. Following evidences that the sensory cortices organize into assemblies under selective stimuli, it has been shown that stable neuronal assemblies can emerge due to targeted stimulation, embedding various forms of synaptic plasticity in presence of homeostatic and/or control mechanisms. Here, we show that simple spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules, based only on pre- and post-synaptic spike times, can also lead to the stable encoding of memories in the absence of any control mechanism. We develop a model of spiking neurons, trained by stimuli targeting different subpopulations. The model satisfies some biologically plausible features: (i) it contains excitatory and inhibitory neurons with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian STDP; (ii) neither the neuronal activity nor the synaptic weights are frozen after the learning phase. Instead, the neurons are allowed to fire spontaneously while synaptic plasticity remains active. We find that only the combination of two inhibitory STDP subpopulations allows for the formation of stable modules in the network, with each subpopulation playing a distinctive role. The Hebbian subpopulation controls for the firing activity, while the anti-Hebbian neurons promote pattern selectivity. After the learning phase, the network settles into an asynchronous irregular resting-state. This post-learning activity is associated with spontaneous memory recalls which turn out to be fundamental for the long-term consolidation of the learned memories.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation in a bimodal mixture of conditional cooperators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07537</link>

Abstract: Extensive behavioral experiments reveal that conditional cooperation is a prevalent phenomenon. Previous game-theoretical studies have predominantly relied on hard-manner models, where cooperation is triggered only upon reaching a specific threshold. However, this approach contrasts with the observed flexibility of human behaviors, where individuals adapt their strategies dynamically based on their surroundings. To capture this adaptability, we introduce a soft form of conditional cooperation by integrating the Q-learning algorithm from reinforcement learning. In this form, players not only reciprocate mutual cooperation but may also defect in highly cooperative environments or cooperate in less cooperative settings to maximize rewards. To explore the effects of hard and soft conditional cooperators, we examine their interactions in two scenarios: structural mixture (SM) and probabilistic mixture (PM), where the two behavioral modes are fixed and probabilistically adopted, respectively. In SM, hard conditional cooperators enhance cooperation when the threshold is low but hinder it otherwise. Surprisingly, in PM, the cooperation prevalence exhibits two first-order phase transitions as the probability is varied, leading to high, low, and vanishing levels of cooperation. Analysis of Q-tables offers insights into the "psychological shifts" of soft conditional cooperators and the overall evolutionary dynamics. Model extensions confirm the robustness of our findings. These results highlight the novel complexities arising from the diversity of conditional cooperators.</description>
