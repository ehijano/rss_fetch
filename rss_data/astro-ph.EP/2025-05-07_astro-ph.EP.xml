      <title>The Disks In Scorpius-Centaurus Survey (DISCS) I: Four Newly-Resolved Debris Disks in Polarized Intensity Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of infrared excesses around stars directly correlates to spatially-resolved imaging detections of circumstellar disks at both mm and optical/near-infrared wavelengths. High contrast imagers have resolved dozens of circumstellar disks with scattered light polarimetric imaging. Many of these detections are members of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, demonstrating it to be a rich sample for investigating planetary system architectures and planet-disk interactions. With the goal of expanding the sample of directly imaged debris disks in Scorpius-Centaurus, we conducted the Disks In Scorpius-Centaurus Survey (DISCS) leveraging knowledge of high-IR excesses and the power of high contrast polarimetric differential imaging. In combination with the GPIES polarimetric disk survey, we observe seven new Scorpius-Centaurus targets to achieve a 60% complete survey of debris disks with IR excesses exceeding $2.5\times10^{-4}$, resolving four new debris disks. HD 98363, HD 109832, and HD 146181 are resolved for the first time, and HD 112810 is resolved for the first time in polarized intensity. We identify morphological structures that may be indications of planet-disk interactions. We place the systems in the greater context of resolved debris disks, identifying factors of ten differences in scattered light contrast for a given IR excess and implying gaps in our understanding of the smallest and largest dust grains of a system. We conclude that while thermal emission measurements are correlated with scattered light detection, they poorly predict the magnitude of scattered light brightness. We also establish Scorpius-Centaurus debris disks as critical benchmarks in understanding the properties of disks in the scattering regime.</description>

      <title>ASIACO: Asiago Spectroscopy and Imaging Atlas of COmets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ASIACO project is an atlas of cometary imaging and spectroscopy obtained from the Asiago Astrophysical Observatory between 2012 and 2024, still ongoing. Up to now, we monitored 41 comets, acquiring broad-band images using the INAF-OAPd 1.82m Copernico and the 0.67/0.92m Schmidt telescopes, as well as low-to-medium resolution spectra with the DFA-UniPd 1.22m Galileo Telescope. Our dataset offers significant scientific potential, enabling studies on the true extent of cometary tails, orientation of nuclei spin axes, retrieval of compositional data, and determination of production rates for key molecular and atomic species. The Atlas will become publicly available for scientific research, and the project remains active, continuously adding monitored comets.</description>

      <title>On the spin-orbit problem for highly elliptical orbits and recursive excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Examining the spin-orbit coupling effects for highly elliptical orbits is relevant to the mission design and operation of cislunar space assets, such as the Lunar Gateway. In high-eccentricity orbits, the gravity-gradient moment is here modelled as an instantaneous excitation at each periapsis passage. By approximating the gravity-gradient moment through Dirac pulses, we derive a recursive discrete map describing the rotational state of the satellite at the periapsis passage. Thanks to the recursive map, we are able to find the initial attitude corresponding to an unbounded growth of angular velocity, and to identify initial conditions whose evolution is such that the pulses have the same sign (in-phase condition) or the alternate sign (counterphase condition) at successive periapsis passages. In the recursive map, we perform the numerical analysis up to ten periapsis passages. In order to justify the introduction of the discrete map, we compare the results of the discrete map with those found in the spin-orbit problem. Because of numerical errors due to the high eccentricity, we restrict the investigation up to three periapsis passages in the spin-orbit problem. Moreover, we apply the Fast Lyapunov Indicators method to draw the phase portrait and detect the initial conditions fulfilling the counterphase condition.</description>

      <title>Multi-parameter constraints on empirical infrasound period-yield relations for bolides and implications for planetary defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How effective are methods for estimating bolide energies from infrasound signal period-yield relationships? A single global period-energy relation can obscure significant variability introduced by parameters such as the atmospheric Doppler wind profile and the bolide's energy deposition profile as a function of altitude. Bolide speed, entry angle, burst altitude, and multi-episode fragmentation all may play a role in defining the detected period of the shockwave. By leveraging bolide light curve data from the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), we re-examined the period-energy relation as a function of these parameters. Through a bootstrap approach, we show that various event subsets can deviate from widely cited period-energy models and we identify which specific conditions most strongly reshape the period-energy scaling. The results define both the fidelity and reliability of period-energy relations when no additional data beyond the infrasound record is available and improve the outcome when supporting data from bolide trajectories and light curves are included. Ultimately, these findings expand the scope of earlier models, providing a nuanced and robust framework for infrasound-only yield estimation under a range of bolide scenarios.</description>

      <title>Monosilane Worlds: Sub-Neptunes with Atmospheres Shaped by Reduced Magma Oceans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision infrared spectroscopic measurements now enable detailed characterization of sub-Neptune atmospheres, potentially providing constraints on their interiors. Motivated by this, atmospheric models have been developed to explore chemical interactions between hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and possibly underlying magma oceans with various redox states. Recent models have predicted monosilane (SiH$_4$) as a potential atmospheric species derived from magma oceans in sub-Neptunes, but suggested that it is highly depleted in the observable atmospheric layers. Here, we propose that SiH$_4$ can persist throughout the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes with FeO-free reduced magma oceans by considering the dissolution of H$_2$O into the magma oceans, a factor not accounted for in previous models. We construct a one-dimensional atmospheric model to simulate the chemical equilibrium composition of hydrogen-dominated atmospheres overlying FeO-free magma oceans, incorporating H-O-Si chemistry. Our results show that the dissolution of H$_2$O enhances the SiH$_4$ molar fraction to levels of 0.1--10~\%, preventing it from reverting to silicates in the upper atmospheric layers. We find that SiH$_4$-rich atmospheres can exist across a broad parameter space with ground temperatures of 2000--6000~K and hydrogen pressures of 10$^2$--10$^5$~bar. We discuss that SiH$_4$-rich atmospheres could contain the other silanes but lack C-/N-/O-bearing species. The detection of SiH$_4$ in future observations of sub-Neptunes would provide compelling evidence for the presence of a rocky core with a reduced magma ocean. However, the accuracy of our model is limited by the lack of data on the non-ideal behavior and radiative properties of SiH$_4$, highlighting the need for further numerical and laboratory investigations.</description>

      <title>Satellite formation around the largest asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellites around large asteroids are preferentially found among those with the most rapid rotation and elongated shape. The taxonomic statistics are similarly skewed; in total, 13 asteroids larger than 100 km are known to have satellites, but none have been discovered among S-type asteroids. Previous modeling suggests that satellites could be generated by impacts, but spin and shape have never been tracked in models to relate collisional circumstances with those two observed properties concerning the primary. Here we show, by combining simulations of impacts into porous low-density asteroids, their subsequent disruption, reaccumulation and long-term satellite stability, a direct pathway for the formation of satellites. The immediate distortion and elongation of a rotating target body provides a launching point for some debris distinct from simple ballistic ejecta trajectories. The debris that are found to originate from the distorted long-axis is sourced primarily from 10-20 km below the surface and can be placed directly onto eccentric orbits with sufficiently large pericenter distances that avoid rapid re-impact. The specific energy and resultant total mass loss in satellite-forming collisions are not constraining, which explains the observed lack of correlation between asteroids with satellites and those that are part of large asteroid families.</description>

      <title>Self-limited tidal heating and prolonged magma oceans in the L 98-59 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rocky exoplanets accessible to characterisation often lie on close-in orbits where tidal heating within their interiors is significant, with the L 98-59 planetary system being a prime example. As a long-term energy source for ongoing mantle melting and outgassing, tidal heating has been considered as a way to replenish lost atmospheres on rocky planets around active M-dwarfs. We simulate the early evolution of L 98-59 b, c and d using a time-evolved interior-atmosphere modelling framework, with a self-consistent implementation of tidal heating and redox-controlled outgassing. Emerging from our calculations is a novel self-limiting mechanism between radiative cooling, tidal heating, and mantle rheology, which we term the 'radiation-tide-rheology feedback'. Our coupled modelling yields self-limiting tidal heating estimates that are up to two orders of magnitude lower than previous calculations, and yet are still large enough to enable the extension of primordial magma oceans to Gyr timescales. Comparisons with a semi-analytic model demonstrate that this negative feedback is a robust mechanism which can probe a given planet's initial conditions, atmospheric composition, and interior structure. The orbit and instellation of the sub-Venus L 98-59 b likely place it in a regime where tidal heating has kept the planet molten up to the present day, even if it were to have lost its atmosphere. For c and d, a long-lived magma ocean can be induced by tides only with additional atmospheric regulation of energy transport.</description>

      <title>The True Stellar Obliquity of a Sub-Saturn Planet from the Tierras Observatory and KPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the true obliquity of TOI-2364, a K dwarf with a sub-Saturn-mass ($M_p = 0.18\,M_J$) transiting planet on the upper edge of the hot Neptune desert. We used new Rossiter-McLaughlin observations gathered with the Keck Planet Finder to measure the sky-projected obliquity $\lambda = 7$$^\circ$$^{+10^\circ}_{-11^\circ}$. Combined with a stellar rotation period of $23.47\pm0.29$ days measured with photometry from the Tierras Observatory, this yields a stellar inclination of $90^{\circ} \pm 13^{\circ}$ and a true obliquity $\psi = 15.6$$^\circ$$^{+7.7^\circ}_{-7.3^\circ}$, indicating that the planet's orbit is well aligned with the rotation axis of its host star. The determination of $\psi$ is important for investigating a potential bimodality in the orbits of short-period sub-Saturns around cool stars, which tend to be either aligned with or perpendicular to their host stars' spin axes.</description>

      <title>Statistical geochemical constraints on present-day water outgassing as a source of secondary atmospheres on the TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TRAPPIST-1 planetary system is observationally favorable for studying if planets orbiting M stars can retain atmospheres and host habitable conditions. Recent JWST secondary eclipse observations of TRAPPIST-1 c rule out a thick \ch{CO2} atmosphere but do not rule out atmospheric water vapor or its photochemical product, oxygen. Given the high expected escape rate, maintenance of atmospheric water vapor would require a present-day water source, such as volcanic outgassing. Here, we simulate water outgassing on the TRAPPIST-1 planets over a broad phase space based on solar system terrestrial bodies. We then apply two filters based on observation and geochemistry that narrow this phase space and constrain the plausible outgassing scenarios. For all seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, we find that the water outgassing rate is most likely $\sim$0.03x Earth's but has upper limits of $\sim$8x Earth's. The allowed range also implies low, Mars-like magma emplacement rates and relatively dry, Earth-like mantles, although mantle water mass fractions up to 1 wt\% are possible. We also present scenarios with magma emplacement rates similar to Mars, Earth, and Io, resulting in different preferred mantle water content and outgassing rates. We find that water outgassing rates are potentially high enough to balance water escape rates, providing a theoretical pathway for the TRAPPIST-1 planets to maintain surface water or water-vapor-containing atmospheres over long timescales. The bounds on outgassing rates and interior properties can be used in atmospheric chemistry and escape models to contextualize future observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and may be applicable to other terrestrial exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Young Planets around Young Accreting Stars: I. Migration and Inner Stalling Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet migration within inner protoplanetary disks significantly influences exoplanet architectures. We investigate various migration mechanisms for young planets close to young stars. To quantify the stochastic migration driven by turbulent disks, we incorporate planets into existing 3-D MHD disk simulations of magnetospheric accretion. Besides the stochastic torque, we identify periodic torques from slowly evolving disk substructures farther out. We quantify these turbulent torques analytically using a modified Gaussian process. Then, using the disk structure in our simulation, we calculate migration timescales of various processes, including the smooth Type I/II migration, planet-star tidal interaction, magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, unipolar induction, and aerodynamical drag with the magnetosphere. Since our inner MHD turbulent disk reveals a very low surface density ($\sim 0.01$ g/cm$^{2}$), the resulting disk migration is significantly slower than previously estimated. Earth-mass planets have the migration timescale in the inner MHD turbulent disk exceeding the Hubble time, effectively stalling at the deadzone inner boundary ($R_{\mathrm{DZIB}}$). Only giant planets could migrate inward within the turbulent disk, and may stall at the magnetospheric truncation radius ($R_T$). A simplified planet population synthesis demonstrates that, at the end of the disk phase, all planets around solar-mass stars typically stall at $\lesssim$0.1 au since $R_T\sim R_{\mathrm{DZIB}}$. However, around 2 $M_{\odot}$ stars, higher-mass planets stall significantly closer to the star compared to low-mass planets, due to $R_T\ll R_{\mathrm{DZIB}}$. These results are consistent with recent observations on exoplanet demographics around different types of stars. Finally, turbulence in the low-density disk is unable to break the resonant planets, and thus young planets in resonances may be abundant.</description>

      <title>Effects of transient stellar emissions on planetary climates of tidally-locked exo-earths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space weather events in planetary environments sourced from transient host star emissions, including stellar flares, coronal mass ejections, and stellar proton events, can substantially influence an exoplanet's climate and atmospheric evolution history. These time-dependent events may also affect our ability to measure and interpret its properties by modulating reservoirs of key chemical compounds and changing the atmosphere's brightness temperature. The majority of previous work focusing on photochemical effects used single-column models. Here, using three-dimensional (3D) general circulation models with interactive photochemistry, we simulate the climate and chemical impacts of stellar flare-sourced energetic particle precipitation. We examine their effects on synchronously rotating TRAPPIST-1e-like planets on a range of spatiotemporal scales. We find that sudden thermospheric cooling is associated with radiative cooling of NO and CO$_2$, and middle-to-lower atmospheric warming is associated with transient increases in infrared absorbers such as N$_2$O and H$_2$O. In certain regimes, these temperature changes are strongly affected by O$_3$ variability depending on the flare's spectral shape and energy. However, the role of O$_3$ in temperature change is reduced in the most extreme flaring scenarios explored in our simulations. In addition to effects on planetary climate and atmospheric chemistry, we also find that intense flares can energize the middle atmosphere, causing enhancements in wind velocities up to 40 m s$^{-1}$ in sub-stellar night-sides between 30 and 50 km in altitude. Our results suggest that successive, energetic eruptive events from younger stars may be pivotal factors in determining the atmosphere dynamics of their planets.</description>

      <title>First JWST spectrum of distant activity in Long Period Comet C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observed the new Long Period Comet C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos), inbound at 7 au from the Sun, using the NIRSpec integral field unit on JWST. The spectrum shows absorption features due to water ice in the coma and evidence for CO$_2$ driven activity, with a production rate of $Q(CO_2) = 2.546 \pm 0.019 \times 10^{25}$ molecules s$^{-1}$, and no emission features of water or CO. The latter is surprising, given that CO is more volatile than CO$_2$, and suggests that this comet may have lost its near-surface CO during its early evolution, before implantation in the Oort cloud.</description>

Abstract: The origin and evolution of the sub-Neptune population is a highly debated topic in the exoplanet community. With the advent of JWST, atmospheric studies can now put unprecedented constraints on the internal composition of this population. In this context, the THIRSTEE project aims to investigate the population properties of sub-Neptunes with a comprehensive and demographic approach, providing a homogeneous sample of precisely characterised sub-Neptunes across stellar spectral types. We present here the precise characterisation of the planetary system orbiting one of the THIRSTEE M-dwarf targets, TOI-771 (V = 14.9 mag), known to host one planet, TOI-771 b, which has been statistically validated using TESS observations. We use TESS, SPECULOOS, TRAPPIST and M-Earth photometry together with 31 high-precision ESPRESSO radial velocities to derive the orbital parameters and investigate the internal composition of TOI-771 b, as well as exploring the presence of additional companions in the system. We derive precise mass and radius for TOI-771 b, a super-Earth with R_b = 1.36 +/- 0.10 R_e and M_b = 2.47 +/- 0.32 M_e orbiting at 2.3 d. Its composition is consistent with an Earth-like planet, and it adds up to the rocky population of sub-Neptunes lying below the density gap identified around M dwarfs. With a 13% precision in mass, a 7% radius precision, and a warm equilibrium temperature of T_eq= 543 K, TOI-771 b is a particularly interesting target for atmospheric characterisation, and it is indeed one of the targets under consideration for the Rocky World DDT program. Additionally, we discover the presence of a second, non-transiting planet, TOI-771 c, with a period of 7.6 d and a minimum mass of Mp sin(i) = 2.9 +/- 0.4 M_e. Even though the inclination is not directly constrained, the planet likely belongs to the temperate sub-Neptune population, with an equilibrium temperature of 365 K.</description>

      <title>ESPRESSO observations of the debris-accreting white dwarf WD\,0141--675</title>

Abstract: WD\,0141--675 was reported as the first astrometrically detected white dwarf planet host candidate as part of the third data release from \textit{Gaia}, just to be later retracted via a news item on the \textit{Gaia} web site$^1$. We present time-resolved, high-resolution optical ESPRESSO spectroscopy of \obj. A radial velocity analysis of the \Ion{Ca}~K absorption line reveals a tentative periodic signal of $15.6\pm0.9$\,d. Phase-folding the ESPRESSO spectroscopy on this signal exhibits weak variability in the morphology of \Ion{Ca}~K close to the core of the line. A violet-to-red ratio analysis of the Ca~K line shows a periodic signal of $16.1\pm0.9$\,d. The periods from both methods agree, within their uncertainties, with half the period of the astrometric planet candidate, however, both measurements are of low statistical significance. Nonetheless, our results imply possible solutions to the mass function within the planetary regime. And when combined with existing infrared photometry, which rules out a brown dwarf companion, yield a lower limit on the orbital inclination of $\sim7^\circ$. Our study demonstrates that ESPRESSO observations are well capable of detecting short-period (days to weeks) giant planets orbiting white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Toward A General Theory of Grain Alignment and Disruption by Radiative Torques and Magnetic Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory for general astrophysical environments described by a dimensionless parameter $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$ with $U$ local radiation strength, $n_{1}=n_{\rm H}/(10{\rm cm}^{-3})$ the hydrogen density, and $T_{2}=T_{\rm gas}/100{\rm K}$ the gas temperature. We first derive the critical magnetic relaxation $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ required to produce high-J attractors for different RAT models and local conditions and find that $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ must be larger for stronger radiation fields. We then numerically study the grain alignment and rotational disruption by the MRAT mechanism taking into account gas collisions and magnetic fluctuations. We find that, for the collision-dominated (CD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})\leq 1$), collisional and magnetic excitations can slowly transport large grains from low-J rotation to high-J attractors, leading to the perfect {\it slow alignment} within $\sim 10-100$ damping times due to MRATs. However, for the radiation-dominated (RD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;1$), only a fraction of grains can be fast aligned at high-J attractors by MRATs, and the majority of grains are trapped at low-J rotation due to strong radiative torques, a new effect we term {\it radiative torque (RAT) trapping}. For extreme radiation fields of $U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;10^{4}$, the efficiency of magnetic relaxation on grain alignment is suppressed, and grains only have fast alignment and disruption purely determined by RATs. We quantified the fraction of grains with fast alignment at high-J attractors, $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$, for different RAT models, magnetic relaxation, and $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$, and found that the maximum $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$ can reach $45\%$ by MRATs and $22\%$ by RATs.</description>

      <title>Earths composition: origin, evolution and energy budget</title>

Abstract: One in every two atoms in the Earth, Mars, and the Moon is oxygen; it is the third most abundant element in the solar system. The oxygen isotopic compositions of the terrestrial planets are different from those of the Sun and demonstrate that these planets are not direct compositional analogs of the solar photosphere. Likewise, the Suns O/Fe, Fe/Mg and Mg/Si values are distinct from those of inner solar system chondrites and terrestrial planets. These four elements (O, Fe, Mg, Si) make up about 94% by mass of the rocky planets and their abundances are determined uniquely using geophysical, geochemical and cosmochemical constraints. The rocky planets grew rapidly from planetesimals, most of which were differentiated, having a core and a mantle, before being accreted. Planetary growth in the early stages of protoplanetary disk evolution was rapid and was only partially recorded by the meteoritic record. The noncarbonaceous meteorites (NC) provide insights into the early history of the inner solar system and are used to construct a framework for how the rocky planets were assembled. NC chondrites have chondrule ages that are two to three million years younger than t_zero (the age of calcium-aluminum inclusions, CAI), documenting that chondrites are middle- to late-stage products of solar system evolution. The composition of the Earth, its current form of mantle convection, and the amount of radiogenic power that drives its engine remain controversial topics. Earths dynamics are driven by primordial and radiogenic heat sources. Measurement of the Earths geoneutrino flux defines its radiogenic power and restricts its bulk composition. Using the latest data from the KamLAND and Borexino geoneutrino experiments affirms that the Earth has 20 TW of radiogenic power and sets the proportions of refractory lithophile elements in the bulk silicate Earth at 2.5 to 2.7 times that in CI chondrites.</description>
