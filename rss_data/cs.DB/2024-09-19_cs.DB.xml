      <title>Multilevel Verification on a Single Digital Decentralized Distributed (DDD) Ledger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to using decentralized distributed digital (DDD) ledgers like blockchain with multi-level verification. In regular DDD ledgers like Blockchain, only a single level of verification is available, which makes it not useful for those systems where there is a hierarchy and verification is required on each level. In systems where hierarchy emerges naturally, the inclusion of hierarchy in the solution for the problem of the system enables us to come up with a better solution. Introduction to hierarchy means there could be several verification within a level in the hierarchy and more than one level of verification, which implies other challenges induced by an interaction between the various levels of hierarchies that also need to be addressed, like verification of the work of the previous level of hierarchy by given level in the hierarchy. The paper will address all these issues, and provide a road map to trace the state of the system at any given time and probability of failure of the system.</description>

      <title>Scalable Private Search with Wally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06761v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Wally, a private search system that supports efficient semantic and keyword search queries against large databases. When sufficiently many clients are making queries, Wally's performance is significantly better than previous systems. In previous private search systems, for each client query, the server must perform at least one expensive cryptographic operation per database entry. As a result, performance degraded proportionally with the number of entries in the database. In Wally, we get rid of this limitation. Specifically, for each query the server performs cryptographic operations only against a few database entries. We achieve these results by requiring each client to add a few fake queries and send each query via an anonymous network to the server at independently chosen random instants. Additionally, each client also uses somewhat homomorphic encryption (SHE) to hide whether a query is real or fake. Wally provides $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy guarantee, which is an accepted standard for strong privacy. The number of fake queries each client makes depends inversely on the number of clients making queries. Therefore, the fake queries' overhead vanishes as the number of clients increases, enabling scalability to millions of queries and large databases. Concretely, Wally can process eight million queries in just 117 mins. That is around four orders of magnitude less than the state of the art.</description>
