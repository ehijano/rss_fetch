      <title>Strategic Bid Shading in Real-Time Bidding Auctions in Ad Exchange Using Minority Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional auction theory posits that bid value exhibits a positive correlation with the probability of securing the auctioned object in ascending auctions. However, under uncertainty and incomplete information, as is characteristic in real-time advertising markets, truthful bidding may not always represent a dominant strategy or yield a Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium. Real-Time Bidding (RTB) platforms operationalize impression-level auctions via programmatic interfaces, where advertisers compete in first-price auction settings and often resort to bid shading, i.e., strategically submitting bids below their private valuations to optimize payoff. 
This paper empirically investigates bid shading behaviors and strategic adaptation using large-scale RTB auction data from the Yahoo Webscope dataset. Integrating Minority Game Theory with clustering algorithms and variance-scaling diagnostics, we analyze equilibrium bidding behavior across temporally segmented impression markets. Our results reveal the emergence of minority-based bidding strategies, wherein agents partition hourly ad slots into submarkets and place bids strategically where they anticipate being in the numerical minority. This strategic heterogeneity facilitates reduced expenditure while enhancing win probability, functioning as an endogenous bid shading mechanism. The analysis highlights the computational and economic implications of minority strategies in shaping bidder dynamics and pricing outcomes in decentralized, high-frequency auction environments.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of catch-up paths by an uncertain dynamic game model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To model the interaction of fiscal and monetary policy, a novel discrete-time, uncertain, infinite time horizon, dynamic game model is developed, where the uncertainties of expectations are modeled by unknown nonlinear but quadratically constrained deterministic functions. Cost-guaranteeing Nash strategies are defined for fiscal and monetary policy as two players. The model is suitable for comparative analysis of the development paths of catching-up economies. Specifically, we evaluate nine possible development paths for the Hungarian economy, where each path is characterised by a proxy for the debt-to-GDP ratio.</description>

      <title>Reservation of Judgment and Robust Collective Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies preference aggregation under ambiguity when agents have incomplete preference relations due to imprecise beliefs. We introduce the "dual" of the Pareto principle, which respects unanimity among individuals, including those with unexpressed opinions. Our first theorem shows that, in most cases, this principle leads to a dictatorial rule in taste aggregation. We argue that this stems from the problem of spurious unanimity, even when the individuals have the same prior set. By weakening the above principle to avoid respecting spurious unanimity, the second theorem characterizes novel belief-aggregation rules, under which society does not discard any combination of plausible priors.</description>

      <title>Occupational Tasks, Automation, and Economic Growth: A Modeling and Simulation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fourth Industrial Revolution commonly refers to the accelerating technological transformation that has been taking place in the 21st century. Economic growth theories which treat the accumulation of knowledge and its effect on production endogenously remain relevant, yet they have been evolving to explain how the current wave of advancements in automation and artificial intelligence (AI) technology will affect productivity and different occupations. The work contributes to current economic discourse by developing an analytical task-based framework that endogenously integrates knowledge accumulation with frictions that describe technological lock-in and the burden of knowledge generation and validation. The interaction between production (or automation) and growth (or knowledge accumulation) is also described explicitly. To study how automation and AI shape economic outcomes, I rely on high-throughput calculations of the developed model. The effect of the model's structural parameters on key variables such as the production output, wages, and labor shares of output is quantified, and possible intervention strategies are briefly discussed. An important result is that wages and labor shares are not directly linked, instead they can be influenced independently through distinct policy levers.</description>

      <title>Best Garbling is No Garbling: Persuasion in Real Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study continuous-time persuasion where a sender controls both how informative a signal is over time and when to stop providing information to a receiver. Given an exogenous signal process, the sender can both garble the evolving signal path and delay the receiver's decision at a convex, increasing cost of time. We show that, although both instruments are available, any optimal persuasion scheme is fully transparent: the sender keeps the signal fully informative and persuades solely by choosing when to stop.</description>

      <title>Managing Persuasion Robustly: The Optimality of Quota Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a sender-receiver model in which the receiver can commit to a decision rule before the sender determines the information policy. The decision rule can depend on the information structure chosen by the sender and the realized signals. This framework captures applications where a decision-maker (the receiver) seeks advice from an interested party (the sender). In these applications, the receiver frequently faces uncertainty regarding the sender's preferences and the set of feasible information structures. Consequently, we adopt a unified robust analysis framework that includes the max-min utility, the min-max regret, and the min-max competitive ratio as special cases. We show that the optimal decision rule is always a quota rule.</description>

      <title>The Coarse Nash Bargaining Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the axiomatic bargaining problem and proposes a new class of bargaining solutions, called coarse Nash solutions. These solutions assign to each problem a set of outcomes coarser than that chosen by the classical Nash solution (Nash, 1950). Our main result shows that these solutions can be characterized by new rationality axioms for choice correspondences, which are modifications of Nash's independence of irrelevant alternatives (or more precisely, Arrow's (1959) choice axiom), when combined with standard axioms.</description>
