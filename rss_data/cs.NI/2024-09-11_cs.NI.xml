      <title>MA-CDMR: An Intelligent Cross-domain Multicast Routing Method based on Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning in Multi-domain SDWN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05888v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cross-domain multicast routing problem in a software-defined wireless network with multiple controllers is a classic NP-hard optimization problem. As the network size increases, designing and implementing cross-domain multicast routing paths in the network requires not only designing efficient solution algorithms to obtain the optimal cross-domain multicast tree but also ensuring the timely and flexible acquisition and maintenance of global network state information. However, existing solutions have a limited ability to sense the network traffic state, affecting the quality of service of multicast services. In addition, these methods have difficulty adapting to the highly dynamically changing network states and have slow convergence speeds. To this end, this paper aims to design and implement a multiagent deep reinforcement learning based cross-domain multicast routing method for SDWN with multicontroller domains. First, a multicontroller communication mechanism and a multicast group management module are designed to transfer and synchronize network information between different control domains of the SDWN, thus effectively managing the joining and classification of members in the cross-domain multicast group. Second, a theoretical analysis and proof show that the optimal cross-domain multicast tree includes an interdomain multicast tree and an intradomain multicast tree. An agent is established for each controller, and a cooperation mechanism between multiple agents is designed to effectively optimize cross-domain multicast routing and ensure consistency and validity in the representation of network state information for cross-domain multicast routing decisions. Third, a multiagent reinforcement learning-based method that combines online and offline training is designed to reduce the dependence on the real-time environment and increase the convergence speed of multiple agents.</description>

      <title>A Centralized Discovery-Based Method for Integrating Data Distribution Service and Time-Sensitive Networking in In-Vehicle Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the electronic and electrical architecture (E/EA) of intelligent and connected vehicles (ICVs) evolves, traditional distributed and signal-oriented architectures are being replaced by centralized, service-oriented architectures (SOA). This new generation of E/EA demands in-vehicle networks (IVNs) that offer high bandwidth, real-time, reliability, and service-oriented. data distribution service (DDS) and time-sensitive networking (TSN) are increasingly adopted to address these requirements. However, research on the integrated deployment of DDS and TSN in automotive applications is still in its infancy. This paper presents a DDS over TSN (DoT) communication architecture based on the centralized discovery architecture (CDA). First, a lightweight DDS implementation (FastDDS-lw) is developed for resource-constrained in-vehicle devices. Next, a DDS flow identification algorithm (DFIA) based on the CDA is introduced to identify potential DDS flows during the discovery phase automatically. Finally, the DoT communication architecture is designed, incorporating FastDDS-lw and DFIA. Experimental results show that the DoT architecture significantly reduces end-to-end latency and jitter for critical DDS flows compared to traditional Ethernet. Additionally, DoT provides an automated network configuration method that completes within a few tens of milliseconds.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Sampling in SDNs with Dynamic Flow Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic sampling has become an indispensable tool in network management. While there exists a plethora of sampling systems, they generally assume flow rates are stable and predictable over a sampling period. Consequently, when deployed in networks with dynamic flow rates, some flows may be missed or under-sampled, while others are over-sampled. This paper presents the design and evaluation of dSamp, a network-wide sampling system capable of handling dynamic flow rates in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). The key idea in dSamp is to consider flow rate fluctuations when deciding on which network switches and at what rate to sample each flow. To this end, we develop a general model for sampling allocation with dynamic flow rates, and then design an efficient approximate integer linear program called APX that can be used to compute sampling allocations even in large-scale networks. To show the efficacy of dSamp for network monitoring, we have implemented APX and several existing solutions in ns-3 and conducted extensive experiments using model-driven as well as trace-driven simulations. Our results indicate that, by considering dynamic flow rates, APX outperforms the existing solutions by up to 10% in sampling more flows at a given sampling rate.</description>

      <title>When Learning Meets Dynamics: Distributed User Connectivity Maximization in UAV-Based Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed management over Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based communication networks (UCNs) has attracted increasing research attention. In this work, we study a distributed user connectivity maximization problem in a UCN. The work features a horizontal study over different levels of information exchange during the distributed iteration and a consideration of dynamics in UAV set and user distribution, which are not well addressed in the existing works. Specifically, the studied problem is first formulated into a time-coupled mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. A heuristic two-stage UAV-user association policy is proposed to faster determine the user connectivity. To tackle the NP-hard problem in scalable manner, the distributed user connectivity maximization algorithm 1 (DUCM-1) is proposed under the multi-agent deep Q learning (MA-DQL) framework. DUCM-1 emphasizes on designing different information exchange levels and evaluating how they impact the learning convergence with stationary and dynamic user distribution. To comply with the UAV dynamics, DUCM-2 algorithm is developed which is devoted to autonomously handling arbitrary quit's and join-in's of UAVs in a considered time horizon. Extensive simulations are conducted i) to conclude that exchanging state information with a deliberated task-specific reward function design yields the best convergence performance, and ii) to show the efficacy and robustness of DUCM-2 against the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Positioning of a Next Generation Mobile Cell to Maximise Aggregate Network Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wireless communications, the need to cover operation areas, such as seaports, is at the forefront of discussion, especially regarding network capacity provisioning. Radio network planning typically involves determining the number of fixed cells, considering link budgets and deploying them geometrically centered across targeted areas. This paper proposes a solution to determine the optimal position for a mobile cell, considering 3GPP path loss models. The optimal position for the mobile cell maximises the aggregate network capacity offered to a set of User Equipments (UEs), with gains up to 187% compared to the positioning of the mobile cell at the UEs geometrical center. The proposed solution can be used by network planners and integrated into network optimisation tools. This has the potential to reduce costs associated with the Radio Access Network (RAN) planning by enhancing flexibility for on-demand deployments.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of Online Live Streaming System Using A 3D Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand for live video streaming, there is an increasing need for low-latency and high-quality transmission, especially with the advent of 5G networks. While 5G offers hardware-level improvements, effective software solutions for minimizing latency remain essential. Current methods, such as multi-channel streaming, fail to address latency issues fundamentally, often only adding new channels without optimizing overall performance. This thesis proposes a novel approach using a 3D engine (e.g., Unity 3D) to stream multi-input video data through a single channel with reduced latency. By leveraging 3D engine capabilities, such as World/Screen Space Cameras, 3D Canvases, and Webcam Textures, the proposed system consolidates video streams from multiple external cameras into a unified, low-latency output. The affiliated project of this thesis demonstrates the implementation of a low-latency multi-channel live video streaming system. It employs the RTSP protocol and examines video encoding techniques, alongside a client-side application based on Unity 3D. The system architecture includes a WebSocket server for persistent connections, an HTTP server for communication, a MySQL database for storage, Redis for caching, and Nginx for load balancing. Each module operates independently, ensuring flexibility and scalability in the system's design. A key innovation of this system is its use of a 3D scene to map multiple video inputs onto a virtual canvas, recorded by an in-engine camera for transmission. This design minimizes redundant data, enabling an efficient and director-guided live streaming network. The thesis concludes by discussing challenges encountered during the project and provides solutions for future improvement.</description>

      <title>Comparing One- and Two-way Quantum Repeater Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum repeaters are an essential building block for realizing long-distance quantum communications. However, due to the fragile nature of quantum information, these repeaters suffer from loss and operational errors. Prior works have classified repeaters into three broad categories based on their use of probabilistic or near-deterministic methods to mitigate these errors. Besides differences in classical communication times, these approaches also vary in technological complexity, with near-deterministic methods requiring more advanced technology. Recent increases in the number of available memories, and introduction of entanglement generation through multiplexing motivate a re-comparison of one-way and two-way repeater architectures. In this work, we propose a novel protocol that optimizes multiplexed elementary link generation and distillation in memory-unconstrained 'connection-oriented' two-way repeaters to boost the entanglement generation rates. We introduce a recursive formulation to derive the probability distribution of the number of Bell pairs in multiplexed two-way repeater architectures, compatible with probabilistic $n$-to-$k$ distillation protocols. We then compare the performance of this new protocol with one-way schemes in the parameter regime where one-way schemes have previously been shown to be advantageous, and find that the multiplexed two-way protocol provides better performance with lower resource and technology requirements.</description>

      <title>Watching TV with the Second-Party: A First Look at Automatic Content Recognition Tracking in Smart TVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart TVs implement a unique tracking approach called Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) to profile viewing activity of their users. ACR is a Shazam-like technology that works by periodically capturing the content displayed on a TV's screen and matching it against a content library to detect what content is being displayed at any given point in time. While prior research has investigated third-party tracking in the smart TV ecosystem, it has not looked into second-party ACR tracking that is directly conducted by the smart TV platform. In this work, we conduct a black-box audit of ACR network traffic between ACR clients on the smart TV and ACR servers. We use our auditing approach to systematically investigate whether (1) ACR tracking is agnostic to how a user watches TV (e.g., linear vs. streaming vs. HDMI), (2) privacy controls offered by smart TVs have an impact on ACR tracking, and (3) there are any differences in ACR tracking between the UK and the US. We perform a series of experiments on two major smart TV platforms: Samsung and LG. Our results show that ACR works even when the smart TV is used as a "dumb" external display, opting-out stops network traffic to ACR servers, and there are differences in how ACR works across the UK and the US.</description>

      <title>SoK: Evaluating 5G Protocols Against Legacy and Emerging Privacy and Security Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring user privacy remains a critical concern within mobile cellular networks, particularly given the proliferation of interconnected devices and services. In fact, a lot of user privacy issues have been raised in 2G, 3G, 4G/LTE networks. Recognizing this general concern, 3GPP has prioritized addressing these issues in the development of 5G, implementing numerous modifications to enhance user privacy since 5G Release 15. In this systematization of knowledge paper, we first provide a framework for studying privacy and security related attacks in cellular networks, setting as privacy objective the User Identity Confidentiality defined in 3GPP standards. Using this framework, we discuss existing privacy and security attacks in pre-5G networks, analyzing the weaknesses that lead to these attacks. Furthermore, we thoroughly study the security characteristics of 5G up to the new Release 19, and examine mitigation mechanisms of 5G to the identified pre-5G attacks. Afterwards, we analyze how recent 5G attacks try to overcome these mitigation mechanisms. Finally, we identify current limitations and open problems in security of 5G, and propose directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Open-Source Framework for Assessing QoE in Multimedia Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Internet is integral to modern life, influencing communication, business, and lifestyles globally. As dependence on Internet services grows, the demand for high-quality service delivery increases. Service providers must maintain high standards of quality of service and quality of experience (QoE) to ensure user satisfaction. QoE, which reflects user satisfaction with service quality, is a key metric for multimedia services, yet it is challenging to measure due to its subjective nature and the complexities of real-time feedback. This paper introduces a machine learning-based framework for objectively assessing QoE in multimedia networks. The open-source framework complies with the ITU-T P.1203 standard. It automates data collection and user satisfaction prediction using key network parameters such as delay, jitter, packet loss, bitrate, and throughput. Using a dataset of over 20,000 records from various network conditions, the Random Forest model predicts the mean opinion score with 95.8% accuracy. Our framework addresses the limitations of existing QoE models by integrating real-time data collection, machine learning predictions, and adherence to international standards. This approach enhances QoE evaluation accuracy and allows dynamic network resource management, optimizing performance and cost-efficiency. Its open-source nature encourages adaptation and extension for various multimedia services. The findings significantly affect the telecommunications industry in managing and optimizing multimedia services. The network centric QoE prediction of the framework offers a scalable solution to improve user satisfaction without the need for content-specific data. Future enhancements could include advanced machine learning models and broader applicability to digital services. This research contributes a practical, standardized tool for QoE assessment across diverse networks and platforms.</description>
