      <title>Topological Kondo semimetal and insulator in AB-stacked heterobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments reported the realization of a heavy Fermi liquid in AB-stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. In this paper we show that the AB-stacked heterobilayer configuration is particularly suited to realize topological Kondo semimetal and topological Kondo insulator ground states at a doping of two holes per moir\'e unit cell. The small lattice mismatch between the MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers and the different bandwidths of their highest lying moir\'e valence bands means that, in the experimentally relevant range of hole dopings, the MoTe$_2$ layer is effectively a Mott insulator with only low-lying magnetic excitations Kondo-coupled to more itinerant electrons in the WSe$_2$. The crucial consequence of the AB-stacking configuration is that the interlayer tunnelling connects orbitals of opposite parity in the two layers, leading to a chiral Kondo coupling. We show that the chiral Kondo coupling favors a topological Kondo semimetal at filling $\nu=1+1$, with a non-quantized spin Hall conductance arising from edge modes, whose spectrum and overlap with bulk states we determine. We further show that a spatially random strain field that locally breaks the rotation symmetry can convert the Kondo semimetal to a narrow gap topological Kondo insulator featuring a quantized spin Hall conductance.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the magnetic ground-state in alkali-metal lanthanide oxide Na$_2$PrO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive set of muon spin spectroscopy and neutron scattering measurements supported by ab-initio and model Hamiltonian simulations have been used to investigate the magnetic ground state of Na$_2$PrO$_3$. $\mu$SR reveals N\'eel antiferromagnetic order below $T_{\rm N}\! \sim\! 4.9$ K, with a small static magnetic moment $m_{\rm static}\!\leq \! 0.22$~$\mu_{\rm B}/{\rm Pr}$ collinearly aligned along the $c-$axis. Inelastic neutron measurements reveal the full spectrum of crystal field excitations and confirm that the Pr$^{4+}$ ground state wave function deviates significantly from the $\Gamma_7$ limit relevant to the Kitaev model. Single and two magnon excitations are observed in the ordered state below $T_N=4.6$ K and are well described by non-linear spin wave theory from the N\'eel state using a magnetic Hamiltonian with Heisenberg exchange $J=1$ meV and symmetric anisotropic exchange $\Gamma/J=0.1$, corresponding to an XY model. Intense two magnon excitations are accounted for by $g$-factor anisotropy $g_\mathrm{z}/g_\pm = 1.29$. A fluctuating moment $\delta m^2 = 0.57(22)$ $\mu_{\rm B}^2/{\rm Pr}$ extracted from the energy and momentum integrated inelastic neutron signal is reduced from expectations for a local $J=1/2$ moment with average $g$-factor $g_{\rm avg}\approx 1.1$. Together, the results demonstrate that the small moment in Na$_2$PrO$_3$ arises from crystal field and covalency effects and that the material does not exhibit significant quantum fluctuations..</description>

      <title>Majorana braiding in superconductors with fixed total number of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional topological superconductors treated at the mean-field level host zero-energy edge Majorana modes, which encode topological degeneracy of their ground states. Geometric manipulations (braiding) of multiple wires can be used to induce topologically robust transformations within the ground state subspace. The mean-field ground states do not have a definite number of particles and thus cannot describe an isolated system. Projecting such states onto fixed particle number gives a very good approximation to the true ground state of an isolated superconductor. In previous work, we showed that so projecting the prototypical Kitaev wave function of a single wire retains key features of the mean-field description, such as the zero-energy single-particle spectral peaks near the wire edges. Here we consider the case of multiple wires with conserved total charge. Again, using the projected Kitaev wave functions as the template, we identify the many-body counterparts of the mean-field topologically degenerate ground states. We then demonstrate how the quantum gates equivalent to braiding of Majorana zero modes can be implemented, albeit with reduced protection from noise and disorder.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous magnetic ordered state and evolution of magnetic fluctuations in Sr(Co1-xNix)2P2 revealed by 31P NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SrCo$_2$P$_2$ with a tetragonal structure is known to be a Stoner-enhanced Pauli paramagnetic metal being nearly ferromagnetic. Recently Schmidt et al. [Phys. Rev. B 108, 174415 (2023)] reported that a ferromagnetic ordered state is actually induced by a small Ni substitution for Co of $x$ = 0.02 in Sr(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$P$_2$ where antiferromagnetic ordered phase also appears by further Ni-substitution with $x = 0.06-0.35$. Here, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on $^{31}$P nuclei, we have investigated how the magnetic properties change by the Ni substitution in Sr(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$P$_2$ from a microscopic point of view, especially focusing on the evolution of magnetic fluctuations with the Ni substitution and the characterization of the magnetically ordered states. The temperature dependences of $^{31}$P spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature ($1/T_1T$) and Knight shift ($K$) for SrCo$_2$P$_2$ are reasonably explained by a model where a double-peak structure for the density of states near the Fermi energy is assumed. Based on a Korringa ratio analysis using the $T_1$ and $K$ data, ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are found to dominate in the ferromagnetic Sr(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$P$_2$ as well as the antiferromagnets where no clear antiferromagnetic fluctuations are observed. We also found the distribution of the ordered Co moments in the magnetically ordered states from the analysis of the $^{31}$P NMR spectra exhibiting a characteristic rectangular-like shape.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional Magnetic Excitonic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionality significantly affects exciton production and condensation. Despite the report of excitonic instability in one-dimensional materials, it remains unclear whether these spontaneously produced excitons can form Bose-Einstein condensates. In this work, we first prove statistically that one-dimensional condensation exists when the spontaneously generated excitons are thought of as an ideal neutral Bose gas, which is quite different from the inability of free bosons to condense. We then derive a general expression for the critical temperature in different dimensions and find that the critical temperature increases with decreasing dimension. We finally predict by first-principles $GW$-BSE calculations that experimentally accessible single-chain staircase Scandocene and Chromocene wires are an antiferromagnetic spin-triplet excitonic insulator and a ferromagnetic half-excitonic insulator, respectively.</description>

      <title>Nematic Ising superconductivity with hidden magnetism in few-layer 6R-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs), the manipulation of interlayer stacking/coupling allows for the construction of customizable quantum systems exhibiting exotic physics. An illustrative example is the diverse range of states of matter achieved through varying the proximity coupling between two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin liquid (QSL) and superconductors within the TaS2 family. This study presents a demonstration of the intertwined physics of spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking, hidden magnetism, and Ising superconductivity in the three-fold rotationally symmetric, non-magnetic natural vdWHs 6R-TaS2. A distinctive phase emerges in 6R-TaS2 below a characteristic temperature (T*) of approximately 30 K, which is characterized by a remarkable set of features, including a giant extrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE), Kondo screening, magnetic field-tunable thermal hysteresis, and nematic magneto-resistance. At lower temperatures, a coexistence of nematicity and Kondo screening with Ising superconductivity is observed, providing compelling evidence of hidden magnetism within a superconductor. This research not only sheds light on unexpected emergent physics resulting from the coupling of itinerant electrons and localized/correlated electrons in natural vdWHs but also emphasizes the potential for tailoring exotic quantum states through the manipulation of interlayer interactions.</description>

      <title>The single-particle spectral function of the extended Peierls-Hubbard model at half-filling and quarter-filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By utilizing the twisted boundary conditions in the exact diagonalization method, we investigate the single-particle spectral function of the extended Peierls-Hubbard model at both half-filling and quarter filling. In one-dimensional (1D) interacting systems, the spin-charge separation can typically be identified in the single-particle spectral function by observing the distinct spinon and holon bands. At half filling, starting from the pure 1D Hubbard model with the on-site interaction $U=10$, we observe that the band structure indicative of the spin-charge separation gradually transitions to four individual bands as the Peierls instability $\delta$ increases. At $U=10$ and $\delta=0.2$ where the spin-charge separation is still observable, increasing the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ can drive the system to a charge-density-wave (CDW) state when $V\gtrsim U/2$, without the obeservation of spinon and holon bands. At quarter-filling, on the other hand, the ground state of Peierls-Hubbard model manifests an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator in units of dimers. Increasing $U$ results in only a very small gap in the single-particle spectrum because even for $U=+\infty$, with the model transforming into a noninteracting half-filled dimerized tight-binding model, its gap determined by the Peierls instability $\delta$ remains small. Conversely, increasing $V$ can effectively open the single-particle gap and make the spinon and holon bands more prominent.</description>

      <title>Chemical Potential Shift in Doped Mott-insulators for Energy Storage Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the unique character of strongly correlated systems, specifically Mott-insulators, in the context of battery electrode materials. The study investigates the correlation between the proposed chemical potential evolution and charge storage performance in transition metal oxide-based electrodes. The hypothesis suggests that doping a Mott insulator reduces the Hubbard Coulomb interaction, which could slow down the chemical shift and result in enhanced charge storage capabilities compared to classic band insulators. The results support the hypothesis through a systematic comparison of selected transition metal oxide-based electrodes (Cu, Mn, Co, and Fe oxide electrodes). Furthermore, a toy model is employed to investigate the shift in chemical potential with doping-dependent U using DFT+U calculation, aiming to visualize the chemical potential evolution in Mott-insulators relevant to their application as battery electrodes. This study provides valuable insights into how strongly correlated materials, especially Mott-insulators, contribute to the advancement of energy storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Minimum tracking linear response Hubbard and Hund corrected Density Functional Theory in CP2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the implementation of the Hubbard ($U$) and Hund ($J$) corrected Density Functional Theory (DFT+$U$+$J$) functionality in the Quickstep program, which is part of the CP2K suite. The tensorial and L\"owdin subspace representations are implemented and compared. Full analytical DFT+$U$+$J$ forces are implemented and benchmarked for the tensorial and L\"owdin representations. We also present the implementation of the recently proposed minimum-tracking linear-response method that enables the $U$ and $J$ parameters to be calculated on first principles basis without reference to the Kohn-Sham eigensystem. These implementations are benchmarked against recent results for different materials properties including DFT+$U$ band gap opening in NiO, the relative stability of various polaron distributions in TiO$_2$, the dependence of the calculated TiO$_2$ band gap on +$J$ corrections, and, finally, the role of the +$U$ and +$J$ corrections for the computed properties of a series of the hexahydrated transition metals. Our implementation provides results consistent with those already reported in the literature from comparable methods. We conclude the contribution with tests on the influence of the L\"owdin orthonormalization on the occupancies, calculated parameters, and derived properties.</description>

      <title>A tensorial approach to 'altermagnetism'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a tensorial approach to the description of $\textbf{k}/-\textbf{k}$-symmetric, non-relativistic splitting of electronic bands in magnetic materials, which was recently given the name of 'altermagnetism'. I demonstrate that tensors provide a general framework to discuss magnetic symmetry using both spin groups and magnetic point groups, which have often been contrasted in recent literature. I also provide a natural classification of altermagnets in terms of the lowest-order tensorial forms that are permitted in each of the 69 altermagnetic point groups. This approach clarifies the connection between altermagnetism and well-known bulk properties, establishing that the vast majority of altermagnetic materials must also be piezomagnetic and MOKE-active, and provides a rational criterion to search for potential altermagnets among known materials and to test them when the magnetic structure is unknown or ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Slow Spin Relaxation and Low-Temperature Spin Freezing in Disordered Fluorite Ho$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the origin of spin freezing in the disordered fluorite Ho$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. The system is investigated by low-temperature heat capacity as well as by DC and AC magnetization. While the system does not show a long-range magnetic order down to at least $T = 280$~mK, we observe signatures of slow spin dynamics, magnetic field induced relaxation processes at relatively high temperatures, and a spin-frozen state below $T = 0.6$~K. Our results suggest that similar to the canonical spin ice systems Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ [Ehlers 2004] and Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ [Snyder 2001], spin freezing in Ho$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ is preceded by two slow spin relaxation processes; the first forms a field-induced region extending to at least 18~K and the second is rather field-independent and appears at $T_{\mathrm g2} = 1$~K [Ramon 2020].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body systems which saturate the quantum bound on chaos are attracting interest across a wide range of fields. Notable examples include the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and its variations, all characterised by some form or randomness and all to all couplings. Here we study many-body quantum chaos in a quantum impurity model showing Non-Fermi-Liquid physics, the overscreened multichannel $SU(N)$ Kondo model. We compute exactly the low-temperature behavior of the out-of time order correlator in the limit of large $N$ and large number of channels $K$, at fixed ratio $\gamma=K/N$. Due to strong correlations at the impurity site the spin fractionalizes in auxiliary fermions and bosons. We show that all the degrees of freedom of our theory acquire a Lyapunov exponent which is linear in temperature as $T\rightarrow 0$, with a prefactor that depends on $\gamma$. Remarkably, for $N=K$ the impurity spin displays maximal chaos, while bosons and fermions only get up to half of the maximal Lyapunov exponent. Our results highlights two new features: a non-disordered model which is maximally chaotic due to strong correlations at its boundary and a fractionalization of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid and antiferromagnetic correlations with hole doping in the bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-$T_c$ superconductivity (SC) was recently found in the bilayer material La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (La327) under high pressures. We study the bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model derived from the band structure of the La327. The model is solved by cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) with natural orbitals renormalization group (NORG) as impurity solver at zero temperature, considering only normal states. With hole doping, we have observed sequentially the Mott insulator (Mott), pseudogap (PG), non-Fermi liquid (NFL), and Fermi liquid (FL) phases, with quantum correlations decreasing. The ground state of the La327 is in the NFL phase with Hund spin correlation, which transmits the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ ($z$) orbital inter-layer AFM correlation to the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. When the $\sigma$-bonding state of the $z$ orbitals ($z+$) is no longer fully filled, the inter-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations weaken rapidly. At low pressures, the fully filled $z+$ band supports a strong inter-layer AFM correlations, potentially favoring short-range spin density wave (SDW) and suppressing SC. Hole doping at low pressures may achieve a similar effect to high pressures, under which the $z+$ band intersects with the Fermi level, and consequently the spin correlations weaken remarkably, potentially suppressing the possible short-range SDW and favoring SC.</description>

      <title>Isospin Pomeranchuk effect and finite temperature resistivity minimum in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism typically arises from the effect of exchange interactions on highly localized fermionic wave functions in f- and d-atomic orbitals. In rhombohedral graphene multilayers, in contrast, magnetism -- manifesting as spontaneous polarization into one or more spin and valley flavors[1-7]-originates from fully itinerant electrons near a Van Hove singularity. Here, we show that despite the absence of localized electronic orbitals on the scale of the interparticle separation, rhombohedral graphene bi- and trilayers show thermodynamic signatures typically associated with disordered local magnetic moments. Specifically, while long range valley order vanishes at temperatures of a few Kelvin, thermodynamic characteristics of fluctuating moments, probed via both electronic compressibility[2-4] and exciton sensing measurements[8], survive to temperatures an order of magnitude higher. Measurements of the electronic entropy in this regime reveal a contribution of $\Delta S \approx 1k_B$/charge carrier, onsetting at the Curie temperature, while first order phase transitions show an isospin "Pomeranchuk effect" in which the fluctuating moment phase is entropically favored over the nearby symmetric Fermi liquid[9, 10]. Our results imply that despite the itinerant nature of the electron wave functions, the spin- and valley polarization of individual electrons are decoupled, a phenomenon typically associated with localized moments, as happens, for example, in solid 3He[11]. Transport measurements, surprisingly, show a finite temperature resistance minimum within the fluctuating moment regime, which we attribute to the interplay of fluctuating magnetic moments and electron phonon scattering. Our results highlight the universality of soft isospin modes to two dimensional flat band systems and their possible relevance both to low-temperature ground states and high temperature transport anomalies.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e Fractional Chern Insulators IV: Fluctuation-Driven Collapse of FCIs in Multi-Band Exact Diagonalization Calculations on Rhombohedral Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) observed in pentalayer rhombohedral graphene/hexagonal boron nitride superlattices have a unique origin contrary to theoretical expectations: their non-interacting band structure is gapless, unlike standard FCIs and the Landau level. Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations at filling $\nu=1$ yield a gapped ground state with Chern number 1 through band mixing, identifying a possible parent state. However, many-body calculations restricted to the occupied HF band predispose the system towards FCIs and are essentially uncontrolled. In this work, we use unbiased multi-band exact diagonalization (ED) to allow fluctuations into the gapless bands for two normal-ordering schemes. In the "charge neutrality" scheme, the weak moir\'e potential leads to theoretical proposals based on Wigner crystal-like states. However, we find that FCIs seen in 1-band ED calculations are destroyed by band mixing, becoming gapless as fluctuations are included. In the "average" scheme, the Coulomb interaction with the periodic valence charge background sets up a stronger moir\'e potential. On small systems, FCIs at $\nu=1/3$ are destroyed in multi-band calculations, while those at $\nu=2/3$ are initially strengthened. However we do not converge to a stable FCI at $\nu=2/3$ even on the largest accessible systems. These findings question prior results obtained within projection to a single HF band. They suggest that current models do not support FCIs with correlation length small enough to be converged in accessible, unbiased ED calculations, or do not support FCIs at all.</description>

      <title>A theorem in relation to quantum Ising models and some exactly solvable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06236v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of the paradigmatic one-dimensional transverse field quantum Ising model $H= J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + h \sum_i \sigma^z_i$ is well-known. Instead, let us imagine "applying" the transverse field via a transverse Ising coupling of the spins to partner auxiliary spins, i.e. $H= J_x \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + J_z \sum_i \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{\text{partner of }i}$. If each spin of the chain has a unique auxiliary partner, then the theorem states that the resultant eigenspectrum is still the same as that of the quantum Ising model with $h = J_z$ and the degeneracy of the entire spectrum is $2^{\text{number of auxiliary spins}}$. This follows from the existence of extensively large and mutually anticommuting sets of conserved quantities for $H$. We can interpret this as the auxiliary spins remaining paramagnetic down to zero temperature with an extensive ground state degeneracy. This is lost upon the loss of the unique partner condition for the full spin chain. Other cases where such extensive degeneracy survives or gets lost are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Drag conductance induced by neutral-mode localization in fractional quantum Hall junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A junction of two 2/3 fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edges, with no charge tunneling between them, may exhibit Anderson localization of neutral modes. Manifestations of such localization in transport properties of the junction are explored. There are two competing localization channels, ``neutral-mode superconductivity'' and ``neutral-mode backscattering''. Localization in any of these channels leads to an effective theory of the junction that is characteristic for FQH effect of bosons, with a minimal integer excitation charge equal to two, and with elementary quasiparticle charge equal to 2/3. These values can be measured by studying shot noise in tunneling experiments. Under the assumption of ballistic transport in the arms connecting the junction to contacts, the two-terminal conductance of the junction is found to be 4/3 for the former localization channel and 1/3 for the latter. The four-terminal conductance matrix reveals in this regime a strong quantized drag between the edges induced by neutral-mode localization. The two localization channels lead to opposite signs of the drag conductance, equal to $\pm 1/4$, which can also be interpreted as a special type of Andreev scattering. Coherent random tunneling in arms of the device (which are segments of 2/3 edges) leads to strong mesoscopic fluctuations of the conductance matrix. In the case of fully equilibrated arms, transport via the junction is insensitive to neutral-mode localization: The two-terminal conductance is quantized to 2/3 and the drag is absent.</description>

      <title>Exact projected entangled pair ground states with topological Euler invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a class of gapped projected entangled pair states (PEPS) with non-trivial Euler topology motivated by recent progress in band geometry. In the non-interacting limit, these systems have optimal conditions relating to saturation of quantum geometrical bounds, allowing for parent Hamiltonians whose lowest bands are completely flat and which have the PEPS as unique ground states. Protected by crystalline symmetries, these states evade restrictions on capturing tenfold-way topological features with gapped PEPS. These PEPS thus form the first tensor network representative of a non-interacting, gapped two-dimensional topological phase, similar to the Kitaev chain in one dimension. Using unitary circuits, we then formulate interacting variants of these PEPS and corresponding gapped parent Hamiltonians. We reveal characteristic entanglement features shared between the free-fermionc and interacting states with Euler topology. Our results hence provide a rich platform of PEPS models that have, unexpectedly, a finite topological invariant, providing a platform for new spin liquids, quantum Hall physics, and quantum information pursuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, tree tensor network methods have proven capable of simulating quantum many-body and other high-dimensional systems. This work is a user guide to our Python library PyTreeNet. It includes code examples and exercises to introduce the library's functions and familiarise the reader with the concepts and methods surrounding tree tensor networks. PyTreeNet implements all the tools required to implement general tree tensor network methods, such as tensor decompositions and arbitrary tree structures. The main focus is on the time evolution of quantum systems. This includes an introduction to tree tensor network states and operators and the time-evolving block decimation and time-dependent variational principle. The library's capabilities are showcased with the example of a modified transverse field Ising model on tree structures that go far beyond the ability of common state vector methods.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of fermion chain in double-scaled SYK and power spectrum perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Krylov complexity of the fermion chain operator which consists of multiple Majorana fermions in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model with finite temperature. Using the fact that Krylov complexity is computable from two-point functions, the analysis is performed in the limit where the two-point function becomes simple and we compare the results with those of other previous studies. We confirm the exponential growth of Krylov complexity in the very low temperature regime. In general, Krylov complexity grows at most linearly at very late times in any system with a bounded energy spectrum. Therefore, we have to focus on the initial growth to see differences in the behaviors of systems or operators. Since the DSSYK model is such a bounded system, its chaotic nature can be expected to appear as the initial exponential growth of the Krylov complexity. In particular, the time at which the initial exponential growth of Krylov complexity terminates is independent of the number of degrees of freedom. Based on the above, we systematically and specifically study the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov complexity using a toy power spectrum and deepen our understanding of those initial behaviors. In particular, we confirm that the overall sech-like behavior of the power spectrum shows the initial linear growth of the Lanczos coefficient, even when the energy spectrum is bounded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent magnetic fields exerted by topological spin textures of magnets lead to an additional Hall response of itinerant carriers called the topological Hall effect (THE). While THE as a bulk effect has been widely studied, THE driven by magnetic domain boundaries (DBs) has been elusive. Here, we report rich Hall responses characterized by multiple peak structures and a hysteresis loop in films of EuCd$_2$, where Eu layers form a geometrically frustrated lattice of Heisenberg spins. We uncover a THE component sharply enhanced at magnetic transition fields, indicating a giant contribution from non-trivial spin textures possibly formed at the DBs.</description>

      <title>Measuring Phonon Dispersion and Electron-Phason Coupling in Twisted Bilayer Graphene with a Cryogenic Quantum Twisting Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between electrons and phonons is one of the fundamental interactions in solids, underpinning a wide range of phenomena such as resistivity, heat conductivity, and superconductivity. However, direct measurements of this coupling for individual phonon modes remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel technique for mapping phonon dispersions and electron phonon coupling (EPC) in van der Waals materials. By generalizing the quantum twisting microscope to cryogenic temperatures, we demonstrate its capability to map not only electronic dispersions via elastic momentum-conserving tunnelling, but also phononic dispersions through inelastic momentum-conserving tunnelling. Crucially, the inelastic tunnelling strength provides a direct and quantitative measure of the momentum and mode resolved EPC. We use this technique to measure the phonon spectrum and EPC of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Surprisingly, we find that unlike standard acoustic phonons, whose coupling to electrons diminishes as their momentum goes to zero, TBG exhibits a low energy mode whose coupling increases with decreasing twist angle. We show that this unusual coupling arises from the modulation of the inter-layer tunnelling by a layer-antisymmetric 'phason' mode of the moir\'e system. The technique demonstrated here opens the way for probing a large variety of other neutral collective modes that couple to electronic tunnelling, including plasmons, magnons and spinons in quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion is a dissipative transport phenomenon ubiquitously present in nature. Its details can now be analysed with modern effective field theory (EFT) techniques that use the closed-time-path (or Schwinger-Keldysh) formalism. We discuss the structure of the diffusive effective action appropriate for the analysis of stochastic or thermal loop effects, responsible for the so-called long-time tails, to all orders. We also elucidate and prove a number of properties of the EFT and use the theory to establish the analytic structure of the $n$-loop contributions to diffusive retarded two-point functions. Our analysis confirms a previously proposed result by Delacr\'{e}taz that used microscopic conformal field theory arguments. Then, we analyse a number of implications of these loop corrections to the dispersion relations of the diffusive mode and new, gapped modes that appear when the EFT is treated as exact. Finally, we discuss certain features of an all-loop model of diffusion that only retains a special subset of $n$-loop `banana' diagrams.</description>

Abstract: We propose a simple and efficient method to calculate the electronic self-energy in dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), addressing a numerical instability often encountered when solving the Dyson equation. Our approach formulates the Dyson equation as a constrained optimization problem with a simple quadratic objective. The constraints on the self-energy are obtained via direct measurement of the leading order terms of its asymptotic expansion within a continuous time quantum Monte Carlo framework, and the use of the compact discrete Lehmann representation of the self-energy yields an optimization problem in a modest number of unknowns. We benchmark our method for the non-interacting Bethe lattice, as well as DMFT calculations for both model systems and ab-initio applications.</description>

Abstract: We examine the orbital-selective Mott transition in the non-hybridized two-band Hubbard model using the dynamical mean-field theory. We find that the orbital-selective Mott transition could be quantitatively depicted by the {local two-qubit fidelity}. Furthermore, within the orbital-selective Mott phase, the combined characteristics of the two orbitals lead to the presence of quantum entanglement, which is characterized by the non-semi-integer values of local two-qubit fidelity. It is demonstrated that the Hund's coupling results in the ground states of both wide and narrow bands exhibiting the specific superposition states, indicating the existence of quantum entanglement within orbital-selective Mott phase. Without Hund's coupling, there are no specific superposition states, nor does quantum entanglement occur within the orbital-selective Mott phase. The mechanisms underlying the orbital-selective Mott transition show prominent variations depending on the presence or absence of Hund's coupling and its transverse terms.</description>

Abstract: We propose the representation principle to study physical systems with a given symmetry. In the context of symmetry enriched topological orders, we give the appropriate representation category, the category of SET orders. For fusion n-category symmetries, we show that the category of SET orders encodes almost all information about the interplay between symmetry and topological orders, in a natural and canonical way. These information include defects and boundaries of SET orders, symmetry charges, explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, stacking of SET orders, gauging of generalized symmetry, as well as quantum currents (SymTFT or symmetry TO). We also provide a detailed categorical algorithm to compute the generalized gauging. In particular, we proved that gauging is always reversible, as a special type of Morita-equivalence. The explicit data for ungauging, the inverse to gauging, is given.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the problem of adsorption of a single He-4 layer on graphene, focusing on the commensurate C1/3 crystalline phase, specifically on whether it may possess a nonzero superfluid response, and on the existence of superfluid phases, either (metastable) liquid or vacancy-doped crystalline. We make use of canonical Quantum Monte Carlo simulations at zero and finite temperature, based on a realistic microscopic model of the system. Our results confirm the absence of any superfluid response in the commensurate crystal, and that no thermodynamically stable uniform phase exists at lower coverage. No evidence of a possibly long-lived, metastable superfluid phase at C1/3 coverage is found. Altogether, the results of ground-state projection methods and finite-temperature simulations are entirely consistent.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic many-body states featured with long-range entanglement and fractional anyon quasiparticles. Quantum phase transitions of spin liquids are particularly interesting problems related with novel phenomena of anyon condensation and anyon confinement. Here we study a quantum dimer model which implements a transition between a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid ($\mathbb{Z}_2$SL) and a valence bond solid (VBS) on the kagome lattice. The transition is driven by the condensation of vison excitation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, which impacts on other anyon excitations especially leading to the confinement of spinon excitations. By numerical exact diagonalization of the dimer model, we directly measure the vison condensation using vison string operators, and explicitly check a confining potential acting on spinon excitations in the VBS state. It is observed that topological degeneracy of the spin-liquid state is lifted concomitantly with the vison condensation. The dimer ordering pattern of the VBS state is identified by investigating dimer structure factor. Furthermore, we find an interesting state that exhibits features of spin liquid and VBS simultaneously. We discuss the origin of the mixed behaviors and possible scenarios expected in thermodynamic limit. This work complements the previous analytical studies on the dimer model [Phys. Rev. B 87, 104408 (2013) and Phys. Rev. B 92, 205131 (2015)] by providing numerical evidences on the vison condensation and the spinon confinement in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$SL-to-VBS transition.</description>

      <title>Validity of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Theorem in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem asserts that microscopic details of the system can impose non-trivial constraints on the system's low-energy properties. While traditionally applied to short-range interaction systems, where locality ensures a vanishing spectral gap in large system size limit, the impact of long-range interactions on the LSM theorem remains an open question. Long-range interactions are prevalent in experimental platforms such as Rydberg atoms, dipolar quantum gases, polar molecules, optical cavities, and trapped ions, where the interaction decay exponent can be experimentally tuned. We extend the LSM theorem in one dimension to long-range interacting systems and find that the LSM theorem holds for exponentially or power-law two-body interactions with a decay exponent $\alpha &gt; 2$. However, for power-law interactions with $\alpha &lt; 2$, the constraints of the LSM theorem on the ground state do not apply. Numerical simulations of long-range versions of the Heisenberg and Majumdar-Ghosh models, both satisfying the LSM symmetry requirements, are also provided. Our results suggest promising directions for experimental validation of the LSM theorem in systems with tunable long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Van-Hove annihilation and nematic instability on a Kagome lattice</title>

Abstract: Novel states of matter arise in quantum materials due to strong interactions among electrons. A nematic phase breaks the point group symmetry of the crystal lattice and is known to emerge in correlated materials. Here we report the observation of an intra-unit-cell nematic order and signatures of Pomeranchuk instability in the Kagome metal ScV6Sn6. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we reveal a stripe-like nematic order breaking the crystal rotational symmetry within the Kagome lattice itself. Moreover, we identify a set of van Hove singularities adhering to the Kagome layer electrons, which appear along one direction of the Brillouin zone while being annihilated along other high-symmetry directions, revealing a rotational symmetry breaking. Via detailed spectroscopic maps, we further observe an elliptical deformation of Fermi surface, which provides direct evidence for an electronically mediated nematic order. Our work not only bridges the gap between electronic nematicity and Kagome physics, but also sheds light on the potential mechanism for realizing symmetry-broken phases in correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Absence of barren plateaus and scaling of gradients in the energy optimization of isometric tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vanishing gradients can pose substantial obstacles for high-dimensional optimization problems. Here we consider energy minimization problems for quantum many-body systems with extensive Hamiltonians and finite-range interactions, which can be studied on classical computers or in the form of variational quantum eigensolvers on quantum computers. Barren plateaus correspond to scenarios where the average amplitude of the energy gradient decreases exponentially with increasing system size. This occurs, for example, for quantum neural networks and for brickwall quantum circuits when the depth increases polynomially in the system size. Here we prove that the variational optimization problems for matrix product states, tree tensor networks, and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz are free of barren plateaus. The derived scaling properties for the gradient variance provide an analytical guarantee for the trainability of randomly initialized tensor network states (TNS) and motivate certain initialization schemes. In a suitable representation, unitary tensors that parametrize the TNS are sampled according to the uniform Haar measure. We employ a Riemannian formulation of the gradient based optimizations which simplifies the analytical evaluation.</description>

      <title>Integrability from categorification and the 2-Kac-Moody Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of Poisson-Lie groups and Lie bialgebras plays a major role in the study of one dimensional integrable systems; many families of integrable systems can be recovered from a Lax pair which is constructed from a Lie bialgebra associated to a Poisson-Lie group. A higher homotopy notion of Poisson-Lie groups and Lie bialgebras has been studied using Lie algebra crossed-modules and $L_2$-algebras, which gave rise to the notion of (strict) Lie 2-bialgebras and Poisson-Lie 2-groups . In this paper, we use these structures to generalize the construction of a Lax pairs and introduce an appropriate notion of {higher homotopy integrability}. Within this framework, we introduce a higher homotopy version of the Kac-Moody algebra, with which the 2-Lax equation can be rewritten as a zero 2-curvature condition in 2+1d. An explicit characterization of our higher Kac-Moody algebra will be given, and we also demonstrate how it governs the 2-Lax pairs and the symmetries of a 3d topological-holomorphic field theory studied recently. This 3d theory thus serves as an example of a physical system that exhibits the sort of 2-graded integrability that we have defined here.</description>

      <title>Frustrated extended Bose-Hubbard model and deconfined quantum critical points with optical lattices at the anti-magic wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of geometrically frustrated many-body quantum systems is of central importance to uncover novel quantum mechanical effects. We design a scheme where ultracold bosons trapped in a one-dimensional state-dependent optical lattice are modeled by a frustrated Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. A derivation of the Hamiltonian parameters based on Cesium atoms, further show large tunability of contact and nearest-neighbour interactions. For pure contact repulsion, we discover the presence of two phases peculiar to frustrated quantum magnets: the bond-order-wave insulator with broken inversion symmetry and a chiral superfluid. When the nearest-neighbour repulsion becomes sizeable, a further density-wave insulator with broken translational symmetry can appear. We show that the phase transition between the two spontaneously-symmetry-broken phases is continuous, thus representing a one-dimensional deconfined quantum critical point not captured by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry-breaking paradigm. Our results provide a solid ground to unveil the novel quantum physics induced by the interplay of non-local interactions, geometrical frustration, and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Hayden-Preskill recovery in chaotic and integrable unitary circuit dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hayden-Preskill protocol probes the capability of information recovery from local subsystems after unitary dynamics. As such it resolves the capability of quantum many-body systems to dynamically implement a quantum error-correcting code. The transition to coding behavior has been mostly discussed using effective approaches, such as entanglement membrane theory. Here, we present exact results on the use of Hayden-Preskill recovery as a dynamical probe of scrambling in local quantum many-body systems. We investigate certain classes of unitary circuit models, both structured Floquet (dual-unitary) and Haar-random circuits. We discuss different dynamical signatures corresponding to information transport or scrambling, respectively, that go beyond effective approaches. Surprisingly, certain chaotic circuits transport information with perfect fidelity. In integrable dual-unitary circuits, we relate the information transmission to the propagation and scattering of quasiparticles. Using numerical and analytical insights, we argue that the qualitative features of information recovery extend away from these solvable points. Our results suggest that information recovery protocols can serve to distinguish chaotic and integrable behavior, and that they are sensitive to characteristic dynamical features, such as long-lived quasiparticles or dual-unitarity.</description>

      <title>An example of the convergence of hydrodynamics in strong external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The anti-de-Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence is used to provide an estimate of the radius of convergence of the linearized gradient expansion of the hydrodynamic description of $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory minimally coupled to $U(1)$ gauge theory subjected to strong magnetic fields. The results of this work demonstrate that the dispersion relations of hydrodynamic modes continue to converge for magnetic field strengths far beyond those values for which a hydrodynamic description is expected. For magnetic field strengths much larger then the temperature scale the bulk dual interpolates between AdS$_{4+1}$ and the product of a Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole and a two dimensional manifold (BTZ$_{2+1}\times \mathbb{R}^2$), and may be regarded as a renormalization group flow of the $3+1$ dimensional CFT to a $1+1$ dimensional CFT. In this regime, we clarify past literature on the quasi-normal mode (QNM) spectrum of bulk scalar fields by introducing a new way to classify the behavior of QNM collisions in the complex frequency and momentum plane.</description>
