      <title>The phenomenology of Quantum Bounce in the Klein-Gordon, Wheeler-DeWitt and Dirac formalisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the different meanings that the concept of Quantum Bounce acquires in various formalisms. The original idea refers to the phenomenology that appears in the Klein-Gordon framework when homogeneous cosmologies are considered. In that case, the Quantum Bounce describes the quantum scattering between a collapsing and an expanding Universe branch, and therefore provides a quantum description of the semiclassical Big Bounce mechanism. Here, we show that the proposal of the Quantum Big Bounce is well-grounded, thanks to the computation of the volume operator mean values and its standard deviation in the Wheeler-DeWitt framework for the isotropic case. Then, we analyze the Bianchi models in the Dirac approach, now showing that the Quantum Bounce concept can be implemented to describe the Kasner transitions of the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz map at a quantum level. In summary, the quantum scattering framework borrowed from particle physics can serve as a good model for different cosmological scenarios, which can exhibit scalar-like or fermionic-like behaviours depending on how the anisotropies are described in the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical or Terrestrial: Machine learning classification of gravitational-wave candidates using multiple-search information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-latency gravitational-wave alerts provide the greater multi-messenger community with information about the candidate events detected by the International Gravitational-Wave Network (IGWN). Prompt release of data products such as the sky localization, false alarm rate (FAR), and $p_\mathrm{astro}$ values allow astronomers to make informed decisions on which candidate gravitational-wave events merit target of opportunity (ToO) follow-up. However, false alarms, often referred to as "glitches", where a gravitational-wave candidate, or trigger, is the result of terrestrial noise, are an inherent part of gravitational-wave searches. In addition, with the presence of multiple gravitational-wave searches, different searches may have varying assessments of the significance of a given trigger. As a complement to quantities such as $p_\mathrm{astro}$, we provide a Machine Learning (ML) based approach to determining whether candidate events are astrophysical or terrestrial in nature, specifically a classifier that utilizes information provided by multiple low-latency search pipelines in its feature space. This classifier has a performance an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.96 and accuracy of 0.90 on the Mock Data Challenge training set and an AUC of 0.93 and accuracy of 0.86 on events from the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO)'s and Advanced Virgo (AdVirgo)'s third observing run (O3).</description>

      <title>Inflationary Slow-Roll Parameters in the Jordan Frame for Cosmological F(R) Gravity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $F(R)$ inflationary models are analyzed without the Weyl transformation to the Einstein frame. Sufficient conditions for existence of global inflationary attractors in $F(R)$ models are provided. Following that, the procedure for calculating inflationary observables completely in the original, Jordan, frame is given. The described procedure is used to analyze a new $F(R)$ inflationary model (a one-parameter deformation of the Starobinsky model), which is shown to provide predictions in good agreement with the recent ACT data.</description>

      <title>The Chapman-Enskog approximation for a relativistic charged gas in the trace-fixed particle frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we provide a thorough discussion of the first-order Chapman-Enskog approximation for a relativistic simple charged gas propagating in an arbitrary fixed background spacetime and electromagnetic field. Motivated by a rigorous study of the linearized collision operator, we argue that the most natural thermodynamic frame to describe dissipative relativistic fluids is the trace-fixed particle frame. This frame determines the state variables by requiring compatibility of the first few moments of the one-particle distribution function with those of the J\"uttner distribution. The resulting constitutive relations are derived, and it is shown that the corresponding transport coefficients are, in fact, frame-independent if suitably defined. Moreover, we discuss the representation freedom for these relations within the microscopic approach. As shown in previous work, when this freedom is suitably exploited, the resulting fluid theory gives rise to strongly hyperbolic and causal evolution equations for which global equilibria are stable.</description>

      <title>Can Effects of a Generalized Uncertainty Principle Appear in Compact Stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present contribution, a preliminary analysis of the effects of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) with a minimum length, in the context of compact stars, is performed. On basis of a deformed Poisson canonical algebra with a parametrized minimum length scale that induces deviations from conventional Quantum Mechanics, fundamental questions involving the consistence, evidences and proofs of this approach as a possible cure for unbounded energy divergence are outlined. The incorporation of GUP effects into semiclassical 2N-dimensional systems is made by means of a time-invariant distortion transformation applied to their non-deformed counterparts. Assuming the quantum hadrodynamics $\sigma-\omega$ approach as a toy-model, due to its simplicity and structured description of neutron stars, we perform a preliminary analysis of GUP effects with a minimum spacetime length on these compact objects. The corresponding results for the equation of state and the mass-radius relation for neutron stars are in tune with recent observations with a maximum mass around $2.5 M_{\odot}$ and radius close to $12$ km. Our results also indicate the smallness of the noncommutative scale.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction and Evolution of Regular Black Holes: The Case of Bardeen Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines regular black holes, in particular the Bardeen spacetime where singularities are replaced by non-singular cores. It explores the energy extraction through the charged Penrose process and shows that magnetic charge evaporation can drive a regular black hole towards a singularity. Two evaporation models are proposed, dealing with charge loss and combined charge evaporation with mass accretion, providing insights into the evolution and stability of regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Scalar induced gravitational waves in PV symmetric teleparallel gravity with non-minimally coupled boundary term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of whether the parity violation occurs in gravitational interaction has recently attracted much attention. In this paper, we investigate the scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in symmetric teleparallel gravity incorporating a parity-violating (PV) term and a non-minimally coupled boundary term. The presence of this non-minimally coupled boundary term help to avoid the strong coupling problem inherent in PV symmetric teleparallel gravity, thereby enabling our study of the SIGWs in this PV symmetric teleparallel gravity. We calculate the SIGWs generated during the radiation-dominated era and compute the corresponding energy density spectrum with a monochromatic primordial power spectrum, numerically. The resulting energy density spectrum of SIGWs exhibits significant deviations from that is predicted by general relativity, particularly at high frequencies. This different feature is detectable by future space-based GW detectors like LISA, TianQin and Taiji.</description>

      <title>Co-existence of alternative Generalized Chaplygin Gas and other Dark Energies in the Framework of Fractal Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have explored the possibility of the co-existence of two forms of dark energy in the form of an alternative Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) along with a scalar field of field theoretic or extra dimensional origin in the background of a fractal universe. The essential physical model parameters have been computed and their variations have been plotted. Fractal cosmology in an universe dominated by the alternative GCG (overcoming the drawbacks of the conventional form of GCG) has also been studied by computing the equation of state, deceleration and statefinder parameters. Their variations with the redshift have also been studied. We have tried to construct alternative cosmological models deviating from standard cosmology that can be put to observational testing.</description>

      <title>Apparent horizon and causal structure of spacetime singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major issue in general relativity and blackhole physics today is to determine the conditions when the spacetime singularities forming as end-states of gravitational collapse are visible to external observers, and when these are hidden within the event horizon of a black-hole. We show here that such a causal structure of singularity, in terms of its visibility or otherwise, is determined by the dynamics of the apparent horizon and trapped surfaces forming during collapse of massive matter clouds. It turns out that the relative timing of formation of trapped surfaces and the singularity plays a crucial role here. The dynamics of apparent horizon governs the visibility of singularity, and we characterize precise conditions here for spherically symmetric collapse with a general type-I matter field. This is done in terms of the existence of outgoing null geodesic families from the central singularity. These results hold under generic initial data satisfying $\mathcal{C}^2$ regularity and the weak energy condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the backreaction of a quantum scalar field on anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. The renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor operator (RSET) for a quantum scalar field acts as a source term on the right-hand-side of the Einstein equations for the quantum-corrected metric. We find the RSET for a nonrotating thermal state on global AdS in three dimensions and compare this with results from relativistic kinetic theory. We then solve the linearized quantum-corrected Einstein equations. We interpret these quantum-corrected metrics as asymptotically-AdS solitons.</description>

      <title>EECT: an Eccentricity Evolution Consistency Test to distinguish eccentric gravitational-wave signals from eccentricity mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eccentric compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are expected to be observed in current and future gravitational-wave (GW) detector networks. However, it has been recently pointed out that a number of other physical and beyond-GR effects, could imitate, or be mimicked by, eccentric CBCs. In this work, we propose a conceptually simple but powerful method to directly confirm or reject the eccentric hypothesis, without needing to compare the hypothesis with the plethora of other possible hypotheses. The key idea is that while spurious non-zero values of eccentricity, at some reference frequency, could be acquired when a non-eccentric CBC with additional physical/beyond-GR effects is recovered with an eccentric CBC waveform model, the {\it evolution} of eccentricity with frequency will in general not be mimicked. We accordingly formulate an eccentricity evolution consistency test (EECT). The method compares the eccentricity recovered at some low frequency value (e.g, $10$ Hz), evolved to higher frequencies assuming GR, with eccentricities recovered at those same higher frequencies. Discrepancy between the two eccentricities at any reference frequency would violate EECT and indicate the presence of a mimicker. As a proof of concept, assuming a few eccentric CBC systems, quasi-circular CBCs with additional physics mimicking eccentricity, and an O4-like three-detector-network configuration, we demonstrate that our proposed method is indeed able to reject mimickers at $\geq 68\%$ confidence, while ensuring that truly eccentric CBCs satisfy EECT.</description>

      <title>Fermionic greybody factors and strong gravitational lensing by Lorentz-violating global monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the greybody factors (GFs) of spin 1/2 and spin 3/2 fermions for a black hole with global monopole in self-interacting Kalb-Ramond gravity with Lorentz symmetry violation. For our purpose, we consider the Dirac and Rarita-Schwinger equations in curved spacetime by proceeding with separating these equations into sets of radial and angular equations. Using the analytical solution of the angular equation, the Schr\"{o}dinger-like wave equations with potentials are derived by decoupling the radial wave equations using the tortoise coordinate. Moreover, we calculate the angular deflection of light in the strong field limit. With the expression for angular deflection in the strong field limit, we compute the positions as well as magnification of the respective relativistic images. We compute the shadows cast by the Lorentz-violating (LV) black hole with a global monopole and analyze how the LV parameter and the monopole charge affect the shadows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the behavior of a rotating relativistic kinetic gas surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole is studied. We are interested in the description and the analysis of the morphology of the resulting configurations for a kinetic gas cloud with and without total angular momentum, and we also compare the macroscopic observables with configurations of finite total mass. A collisionless gas in the Schwarzschild spacetime background is analyzed, considering models of the one-particle distribution function depending on the polytropic ansatz and the inclination angle of the orbits of the particles in the kinetic gas. Profiles of the macroscopic observables of the gas configurations are presented, which are derived from the density current vector field and energy-momentum-stress tensor.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Mass/Charge Relation and Weak No-hair Theorem Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Einstein gravity minimally coupled to two Maxwell fields and one dilaton scalar. We study the electrically-charged spherically-symmetric and static solutions that are asymptotic to Minkowski spacetime. General solutions are described by four independent parameters: mass $M$, two electric charges $(Q_1,Q_2)$ and the scalar charge $\Sigma$. For black holes, the scalar charge is not independent, but a function of $(M,Q_1,Q_2)$. We provide a set of formulae relating the mass to the charges, which allows us to determine $\Sigma(M,Q_1,Q_2)$ without having to solve the black hole equations. Our results confirm the weaker version of the no-hair theorem conjecture: scalars can be turned on in a black hole, but they do not have continuous independent hairy parameters.</description>

      <title>Can Big Black Holes Merge with the Smallest Black Holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave measurements of the binary black hole population provide insights into the evolution of merging binaries. We explore potential correlation between mass and mass ratio with phenomenological population models where the minimum mass of the smaller (secondary) black hole can change with the mass of the bigger (primary) black hole. We use binary black hole signals from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog with and without the relatively extreme mass-ratio GW190814. When excluding GW190814, models with a variable minimum mass are disfavoured compared to one with a constant minimum mass, with log Bayes factors of -2.49 to -0.98, indicating that the biggest black holes can merge with the smallest. When including GW190814, a parabola model that allows the minimum mass to decrease with increasing primary mass is favoured over a constant minimum-mass model with a log Bayes factor of 4.44. When allowing the minimum mass to decrease, the overall population distributions remain similar whether or not GW190814 is included. This shows that with added model flexibility, we can reconcile potential outlier observations within our population. These investigations motivate further explorations of correlations between mass ratio and component masses in order to understand how evolutionary processes may leave an imprint on these distributions.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Wormholes and Gravitational States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Euclidean wormholes are known to encode important non-perturbative effects in the physics of quantum black holes. In this paper, we discuss the slicing of Euclidean wormholes along a time-reflection symmetric slice which treats half of the Euclidean geometry as a gravitational machinery to produce a semi-classical state. This type of state preparation is different from Hartle-Hawking states prepared with the CFT path integral, such as the thermofield-double state. Nevertheless, the two different types of states have order one overlaps provided the gravitational data agrees on the initial data slice. This raises an interesting puzzle: one can easily construct an infinite family of semi-classical states that have order one overlap with the thermofield double state, while having a very different Euclidean preparation. We provide a microscopic description of wormhole states in the dual CFT and reformulate the factorization puzzle in the language of entanglement and the Hilbert space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric Metric-Affine Gravity is a theory of gravity with an independent non-metric connection, and zero torsion. It can be thought of as ordinary metric gravity coupled to a rank-three tensor Q, symmetric in one pair of indices. This field carries a spin-three degree of freedom. We find that, in contrast to the totally symmetric case, it is possible to arrange the parameters in the Lagrangian, so that, at the linearized level, the spin-three state, either alone or in combination with a spin-0 state, has a healthy propagation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy effective theories provide the natural description of four-dimensional physics in higher-dimensional geometries, where the imprint of the bulk appears as parameters of the lower dimensional theory. Motivated by the recent progress in the first-order thermodynamic formulation of modified gravity theories, we investigate the thermodynamics of effective theories in braneworld scenarios and thereby the attractor mechanism towards general relativity in such theories. We consider the two-brane Randall-Sundrum model where the low-energy theory on either brane is of scalar-tensor nature with the extra-dimensional radion playing the role of the scalar. We study the thermodynamic implications of a non-vanishing gravitational contribution to the radion potential, and further explore the dynamics in the presence of a bulk stabilizing field.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by Carrollian geometry, we define super-Carrollian manifolds as a supermanifold with an even degenerate metric such that the kernel is generated by a non-singular odd vector field that is a supersymmetry generator. Alongside other results, we show that compatible affine connections always exist, albeit they must carry torsion.</description>

      <title>Strong Confinement of a Nanoparticle in a Needle Paul Trap: Towards Matter-Wave Interferometry with Nanodiamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle, can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely new regimes, as well as the interface between QM and GR, e.g., testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds as our particle, and a spin embedded in the nanodiamond together with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. In this work, we achieve strong confinement of a levitated particle, which is crucial for angular confinement, precise positioning, and perhaps also advantageous for deep cooling. We designed a needle Paul trap with a controllable distance between the electrodes, giving rise to a strong electric gradient. By combining it with an effective charging method - electrospray - we reach a trap frequency of up to 40 kHz, which is more than twice the state of the art. We believe that the designed trap could become a significant tool in the hands of the community working towards massive matter-wave interferometry. We would be happy to make more details available upon request.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is now widely established that globular clusters host robust populations of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes throughout their lifetimes. Within clusters, dynamical processes enabled by stellar densities thousands to millions of times larger than typical galactic environments facilitate interactions involving these stellar remnants that give rise to an array of astrophysical phenomena. In particular, stellar clusters have emerged as an important formation site for X-ray sources, radio pulsars, and merging black hole binaries similar to those recently detected as gravitational wave sources by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA detectors. This article reviews our current understanding of compact objects in globular clusters, discussing current observational evidence, ways these objects influence the dynamical evolution of their hosts, and future prospects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14312v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper argues that the common identification of time with entropy is a category error. Entropy accounts for the arrow of time but not for time itself. Even in a maximally entropic universe the so called heat death temporal structure persists, grounded in the correlations of the quantum vacuum and the geometry of spacetime. The twilight of time is not its disappearance but its loss of directionality.</description>

      <title>Machine learning classification of black holes in the mass--spin diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the mass--spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying their formation pathways, providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time (i.e., Cosmic Accretion) or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Free-Particle State Realized via Optimal Filtering in Optomechanics: Implications for Gravity-Induced Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the conditional quantum state of a mechanical mirror in an optomechanical system under continuous measurement, feedback control, and quantum filtering. Our study identifies a regime in which the mirror's momentum is squeezed beyond the standard quantum limit achievable through appropriate tuning of the homodyne detection angle. We show that in this regime, optimal filtering effectively realizes a free-particle-like state. Notably, when applied to a setup involving two optomechanical systems, this phenomenon significantly boosts the signal of gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) because the momentum squeezing not only accentuates the difference between the common mode and the differential mode but, when the purity is high, also increases the position uncertainty due to the uncertainty principle, thereby enlarging the spatial extent of the superposition. Our results provide new insights into strategies for verifying the quantum nature of gravity using optomechanical platforms.</description>

      <title>CPL-parametrized cosmic expansion in Galileon gravity: Constraints from recent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the cosmic expansion history within the framework of Galileon gravity by employing a redshift-based expression for the Hubble rate, $H(z)$, derived from the CPL parametrization $\omega_{DE}(z)=\omega_{0}+\omega_{a}\frac{z}{1+z}$. This parametrization allows for a time-dependent expansion history consistent with the non-linear Galileon field equations. To constrain the model parameters, we perform a MCMC analysis using $46$ Hubble parameter measurements, DESI DR2 BAO data and $1701$ Pantheon+ datasets. The best fit values obtained are $H_0 = 67.7043^{+1.4354}_{-1.4102}$ km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_{m0} = 0.2668^{+0.0212}_{-0.0217}$, $\omega_0 = -0.8827^{+0.1076}_{-0.0967}$ and $\omega_a = 0.0011^{+0.0660}_{-0.0622}$. Model comparison using information criteria yields $\Delta AIC=1.46$ and $\Delta BIC = 11.5$ indicating that the Galileon model is a strong contender to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The deceleration parameter shows a transition at $z_{tr} = 0.7873$, with $q_0 = -0.598$. Energy density and pressure remain physically viable with $\rho_{de}(z)&gt;0$ and $p_{de}(z)&lt;0$ with the present day equation of state $\omega(z)$ value of $-0.2915$, which suggests mild dynamical dark energy. NEC and DECare satisfied, while SEC is violated. The model yields $r_{0}=0.657$, $s_{0}=0.1173$ and Om diagnostic shows a peak value of $-0.45$ at $z = 0.377$, converging to $-1$ at late times.These results demonstrate that Galileon gravity remains a viable and flexible alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in describing late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of the thermodynamic topology for a broad class of asymptotically charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theories, examining how scalar coupling parameters and spacetime dimensions influence black hole thermodynamics. Employing a topological approach that utilizes the torsion number of vector fields constructed from the generalized free energy, we characterize black hole states as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space. Through analytical solutions spanning dimensions $d = 4$, $d=5$, and $d=6$, including the Gubser-Rocha model, we demonstrate that variations in the dilaton coupling constant $\delta$, particularly near its critical value $\delta_c$, induce transitions between distinct thermodynamic topological phases. Our analysis reveals that certain black hole solutions constitute a novel class designated as $W^{0-\leftrightarrow 1+}$, characterized by a torsion number $W = 1$ that corresponds to a unique stability structure. We establish that Gubser-Rocha models belong to this topological classification. These results significantly expand the existing classification framework while reinforcing thermodynamic topology as a robust analytical tool for probing the universal properties of black holes in both gravitational and holographic contexts. The findings provide new insights into the relationship between microscopic couplings and macroscopic thermodynamic behavior in extended gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a new definition of holographic entanglement entropy in the framework of static patch holography for de Sitter space. Using the replica trick and twist operator formalism, we derive an entropy functional in three-dimensional de Sitter space expressed through de Sitter Green's functions. Since the naive Ryu-Takayanagi prescription in de Sitter spacetime fails to satisfy strong subadditivity, we demand that our proposed formula be consistent with the fundamental entropic inequalities. The resulting conditions place nontrivial constraints on the undetermined parameter space of static patch holography. Our results demonstrate that entanglement inequalities provide a sharp diagnostic for candidate definitions of entanglement entropy in de Sitter holography and offer quantitative evidence in support of static patch holography as a consistent framework.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting Vanilla Power Law Inflation with the aid of Continuous Spontaneous Localization in the ACT era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vanilla Power Law Inflation is plagued with two severe drawbacks, the one being the issue of graceful exit, and the other being its compatibility with the existing data. There's yet another daunting problem generic to any inflationary model, and not particular to the Power Law Inflation, is the issue of classicalization of the primordial quantum perturbation. This issue is often treated as an isolated problem primarily because decoherence is often invoked to tackle such problems and decoherence, in principle, doesn't leaves any observational imprints. However, that's not the case if one invokes the collapse models of quantum mechanics to resolve such a problem, because the collapse models do modify the Schr\"{o}dinger evolution of the quantum system and the modified dynamics is bound to leave imprints. We show that collapsed modified Power Law Inflation can indeed circumvent the issue with observations and can be made compatible with all the current data coming from {\it Planck}, {\it ACT}, DESI and BAO while resolving the classicalization issue associated with the quantum primordial fluctuations. Such an inflationary model also produces a more red-tilted tensor spectrum and no running for both the scalar and tensor spectral indices, which can be a litmus test for this model.</description>

      <title>Identifying Monochromatic Signals in LISA and Taiji via Spectral Split: Gravitational Waves versus Ultralight Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new window to explore the dark Universe. Ultralight dark matter (ULDM), an attractive candidate for dark matter, might induce monochromatic signals in gravitational-wave (GW) laser interferometers. However it is not clear how such signals are disentangled from the GWs emitted by galactic compact binaries. Here we initiate the investigation on the spectral split of monochromatic signals caused by detector's heliocentric motion in space and show the annual modulation can induce distinct structures in the spectral harmonics for GWs and ULDM, which would enable to clearly identify the nature of the signal. We show the physical parameters can be inferred with high precision using the Fisher matrix formalism. Our results provide a practical algorithm for probing ULDM and broaden the scientific objectives of future GW detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji.</description>

There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. In this work, we review current methods for loading nanodiamonds into a Paul trap, and their capabilities and limitations regarding our application. We also present our experiments on loading and launching nanodiamonds using a vibrating piezoelectric element and by electrical forces. Finally, we present our design of a novel nanodiamond loading method for ultra-high-vacuum experiments. As the production of highly accurate, high-purity nanodiamonds with a single NV required for interferometric measurements is expected to be expensive, we put emphasis on achieving high loading efficiency, while loading the charged ND into a Paul trap in ultra-high vacuum.</description>

      <title>Holographic Extended Thermodynamics of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase structure of a deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, generated via the gravitational decoupling (GD) method as a minimal geometric deformation. In the bulk canonical ensemble, our results exhibit a van der Waals-type first-order phase transition in addition to the Hawking-Page transition, in the suitable parameter regime. Further, we compute the critical exponents characterising the bulk transition, confirming their consistency with mean-field theory predictions. Exploiting the exact holographic dictionary between extended black hole thermodynamics and the dual conformal field theory (CFT), we extend this analysis to the boundary and uncover a rich array of phase transitions and critical phenomena across three distinct thermodynamic ensembles. In particular, for an ensemble of fixed volume and central charge, the dual CFT displays a van der Waals-like phase structure. Throughout, we emphasise the pivotal influence of the GD deformation parameter on the thermodynamic behaviour, and we elucidate its role in the confinement-deconfinement transitions characteristic of the deformed AdS-Schwarzschild geometry.</description>

      <title>Proof of a Generalized Ryu-Takayanagi Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalized version of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the entanglement entropy in arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant field theories. We use a recent framework which expresses the measurable quantities of a quantum theory as a weighted sum over paths in the theory's phase space. If this framework is applied to a field theory on a spacetime foliated by a hypersurface $\Sigma,$ the choice of a codimension-2 surface $B$ without boundary contained in $\Sigma$ specifies a submanifold in the phase space. For diffeomorphism invariant field theories, a functional integral expression for their density matrices was recently given and then used to derive bounds on phase space volumes in the considered submanifold associated to $B.$ These bounds formalize the gravitational entropy bound. Here, we present an implication of this derivation in that we show the obtained functional integral expression for density matrices to be naturally suited for the replica trick. Correspondingly, we prove a functional integral expression for the associated entanglement entropies and derive a practical prescription for their evaluation to leading order and beyond. An important novelty of our approach is the contact to phase space. This allows us both to obtain a prescription for entanglement entropies in arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant field theories not necessarily possessing a holographic dual as well as to use entanglement entropies to study their phase space structure. In the case of the bulk-boundary correspondence, our prescription consistently reproduces and hence provides a natural and independent proof of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula as well as its various generalizations. These include the covariant holographic entanglement entropy proposal, Dong's proposal for higher-derivative gravity as well as the quantum extremal surface prescription.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the $1+1+2$ covariant formalism in the presence of nonmetricity. Focusing on Locally Rotationally Symmetric spacetimes, we show how nonmetricity affects all the kinematic quantities involved in the covariant $1+1+2$ decomposition. We apply the resulting geometrical framework to study both homogeneous solutions and static spherically symmetric solutions in the context of $f(\mathcal{Q})$ gravity. We obtain sufficient conditions for homogeneous solutions with flat spatial hypersurfaces and Schwarzschild-de Sitter type solutions in the $1+1+2$ formalism. We also explore an elementary gravastar solution utilizing covariant junction conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend well-known results on the Newtonian limit of Lorentzian metrics to orthonormal frames. Concretely, we prove that, given a one-parameter family of Lorentzian metrics that in the Newtonian limit converges to a Galilei structure, any family of orthonormal frames for these metrics converges pointwise to a Galilei frame, assuming that the two obvious necessary conditions are satisfied: the spatial frame must not rotate indefinitely as the limit is approached, and the frame's boost velocity with respect to some fixed reference observer needs to converge.</description>

Abstract: General relativity contains 16 variables in the framework of ADM-Vielbein formalism which are 6 more than metric formalism. These variables emerge due to additional symmetry of Local Lorentz Transformations. In the framework of the Hamiltonian approach, it is expected to find first class constraints which generate this gauge symmetry. We introduce the complete form of such constraints and show that they exactly obey the algebra of the Lorentz group.</description>

      <title>A neural network for estimating compact binary coalescence parameters of gravitational-wave events in real time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-latency pipelines analyzing gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence events rely on matched filter techniques. Limitations in template banks and waveform modeling, as well as non-stationary detector noise cause errors in signal parameter recovery, especially for events with high chirp masses. We present a quantile regression neural network model that provides dynamic bounds on key parameters such as chirp mass, mass ratio, and total mass. We test the model on various synthetic datasets and real events from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave transient GTWC-3 catalog. We find that the model accuracy is consistently over 90% across all the datasets. We explore the possibility of employing the neural network bounds as priors in online parameter estimation. We find that they reduce by 9% the number of likelihood evaluations. This approach may shorten parameter estimation run times without affecting sky localizations.</description>

      <title>Inverse Mobius Spacetime in 1+1D Quantum Gravity: Functional Analytic Structures, Dirac Spectrum, and Pin Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we formulate a (1+1)-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity toy model whose Euclidean spacetime manifold is the M\"obius band $M$. Since $M$ is non-orientable, the relevant spin-statistics structure is Pin rather than Spin. To emphasize the role of orientation reversal, we refer to the universal orientable cover $\widetilde{M}$ as the inverse M\"obius band, which resolves the M\"obius twist into an infinite ribbon equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}$ deck action. We compute the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1$, $w_2$, classify all $\mathrm{Pin}^\pm$ structures, construct the associated pinor bundles, and analyze the Dirac operator under the twisted equivariance condition \[ \psi(x+1, w) = \gamma^w \psi(x, -w). \] Half-integer momentum quantization, spectral symmetry, vanishing mod-2 index, and $\eta_D(0) = 0$ follow. In JT gravity, the two inequivalent Pin lifts in each parity double the non-perturbative saddle-point sum, yet leave the leading Bekenstein-Hawking entropy unchanged. Full proofs and heat-kernel calculations are provided for completeness.</description>

      <title>Modeling of non-rotating neutron stars in 5D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the modeling of anisotropic magnetized static neutron stars within the framework of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (5D EGB) gravity. While Einstein's gravity has traditionally been employed to examine neutron stars, recent observational advancements have revealed its limitations in accurately describing high-mass astronomical objects-particularly in predicting or explaining certain observed neutron star masses. In response, this research seeks to address the limitations of Einstein's gravity in characterizing high-mass neutron stars by modifying the gravitational action and incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. This term holds significant dynamical relevance in higher dimensions, particularly within the context of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity explored in this study, thereby providing a more realistic description of gravitational phenomena under extreme conditions. By deriving the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and utilizing the AV18 potential, we analyze the profiles of metric functions, density and pressure, gradients of density and pressure, the anisotropic function and its trace, mass-function and compactness, the mass-radius curve, surface redshift function, equation of state parameters, and radial and tangential sound speeds. Additionally, stability factors, adiabatic indices, and energy conditions are examined. The results indicate that all conditions are satisfied for specific values of the coupling constant, confirming the physical stability of the model. Furthermore, higher dimensions enhance resistance to gravitational collapse, resulting in an increase in the maximum mass predicted by the proposed model. Ultimately, calculations show that the modified Buchdahl inequality is satisfied as well.</description>

Abstract: We study the supersymmetric structure of the spin current in four dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theories. By coupling the stress tensor multiplet to a vierbein multiplet we identify a spin current with the Hodge dual of the bottom component of the stress tensor multiplet in a wide range of theories. This implies that in holographic theories the Hodge dual of the $R$ current may serve as a spin current, paving the way for holographic studies of theories with background torsion.</description>

      <title>Test for LISA foreground Gaussianity and stationarity: galactic white-dwarf binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upcoming space-based gravitational-wave detectors will be sensitive to millions and resolve tens of thousands of stellar-mass binary systems at mHz frequencies. The vast majority of these will be double white dwarfs in our Galaxy. The greatest part will remain unresolved, forming an incoherent stochastic foreground signal. Using state-of-the-art Galactic models for the formation and evolution of binary white dwarfs and accurate LISA simulated signals, we introduce a test for foreground Gaussianity and stationarity, building on methods available for ground-based detectors. We explain the observed non-stationarity with a new analytical modulation induced by the LISA constellation motion and the intrinsic anisotropy of the source distribution. By demodulating the foreground signal, we reveal a deviation from Gaussianity in the 2-10 mHz frequency band. Our finding is crucial to design faithful data models: the proposed method serves as a diagnostic and estimation tool to flag and model deviations, respectively. Neglecting them would introduce systematic biases on individual sources and astrophysical foregrounds parameter estimation, ultimately leading to inaccurate interpretation of the LISA data.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the feasibility of realizing the Dark Dimension Scenario through T-fold compactifications on $T^5 \times S^1$, where the base of the internal space $S^1$ naturally acts as the requisite mesoscopic extra dimension. Utilizing Scherk--Schwarz reduction from 5D to 4D, and applying duality twists from both elliptic and parabolic conjugacy classes of subgroups of the T-duality group associated with $T^5$, we stabilize the volume of $T^5$ and several other moduli. This approach generates a potential characterized by two runaway directions, one aligned with the Scherk--Schwarz radion. Further stabilization efforts yield a decreasing potential trajectory demanded by the Dark Dimension Scenario.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Resonant Transitions of Tidally Perturbed Gravitational Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light bosons can form a gravitational atom (GA) around a spinning black hole through the superradiance process. Considering the black hole to be part of a binary system, the tidal potential of the companion periodically perturbs the GA such that an ``atomic'' transition occurs between two of its energy eigenstates. The resonant transition is modeled by the Landau-Zener system, where the orbital frequency of the companion determines the relevant transition. In this work, we study a novel gravitational wave signal originating directly from the level transition of the GA in a binary system. We derive the analytical formulae of both the strain waveform and frequency spectrum of the signal. We further investigate the GA-binary systems that can have a large signal-to-noise ratio in the milli-Hz to deci-Hz frequency band. Using the future space-based gravitational wave observatory DECIGO, we find the signal-to-noise ratio is $\mathcal{O}(10-200)$ for the fine-structure constant $\alpha\simeq 0.3$, host black hole mass $M= 150M_\odot$ and boson mass $\mu \simeq 10^{-13} \rm eV$ at a distance within 100 kpc.</description>

Abstract: We compute a holographic entanglement entropy via Ryu--Takayanagi prescription in the three-dimensional Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker universe. We consider two types of holographic scenarios analogous to the static patch holography and the half de Sitter holography, in which the holographic boundary is timelike and placed in the bulk. We find in general that the strong subadditivity can be satisfied only in the former type and in addition the holographic boundary has to fit inside the apparent horizon. Also, for the universe filled with an ideal fluid of constant equation of state $w&lt;-1$, the condition is sharpened as that the holographic boundary has to fit inside the event horizon instead. These conditions provide a necessary condition for the dual quantum field theory to be standard and compatible with the strong subadditivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String theory naturally leads to the expectation that dark energy is not stable, and may be evolving as captured by the Swampland de Sitter conjectures. Moreover, motivated by the distance conjecture, a unification of dark sector has been proposed, where the smallness of dark energy leads to one extra dimension of micron size with dark matter being the Kaluza--Klein graviton excitations in this extra dimension. We consider the natural possibility that the radius of the dark dimension varies as the dark energy decreases, leading to the variation of the dark matter mass. This correlates the decrease of the dark energy with the variation of the dark matter mass as they depend on the variations of a scalar field $\phi$ controlling the radius of the extra dimension. A simple realization of this idea for small range of $\phi$ is adequately captured by choosing a potential which is locally of the form $V=V_0\ {\rm exp}(-c\phi)$ and dark matter mass $m_{\rm DM}=m_0\ {\rm exp}(-c' \phi)$ where the sign of $\phi$ is chosen such that $c'\geq 0$ while we have two choices for the sign of $c$ depending on whether the dark dimension expands or shrinks when the dark energy dominates. We find excellent agreement with recent experimental data from DESI DR2 combined with SN measurements (from DES, Union3 or Pantheon+) and reproduces the same significance as CPL parametrization with the added benefit of providing a natural explanation for the apparent phantom behavior ($w&lt;-1$) reported by DESI and DES based on a physical model. DESI and SN datasets independently favor non-zero values of $c'$ and $c$, respectively, both lying within the expected $\mathcal{O}(1)$ range suggested by the Swampland criteria. Moreover, our best fit value $c'\simeq 0.05 \pm 0.01$ is remarkably consistent with the experimental upper bound of $c'\lesssim 0.2$ demanded by the lack of detection of fifth force in the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Testing Planck 2020 and DESI data on wCDM Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work delves into the dynamical dark energy models of the wCDM parameterisation that are defined by their equation of state by comparing different, well-known parameterisation models, in an attempt to lessen the tensions of {H_0} and {\sigma_8} by using the latest observational data. This research also tested the newer Planck likelihood and compared it to the previously released dataset of Planck 2018 and the newer BAO data of DESI. The data that was used were: the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data of Planck 2018 and Planck 2020 data; Cosmic Chronometers (CC), a sample of Supernovae Type Ia; and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). A Bayesian analysis was performed to produce the results needed for the analysis. From the analyses, the best-fit values of the parameters show that almost all models are in favour of a phantom Universe when early-time data was used and favours a quintessence Universe when combinations of early-time and late-time data was considered. This study also showed that the new tested data constrained the models better than the previous ones, while also showing that the observation data supports the {\Lambda}CDM model over the dynamical dark energy models</description>

      <title>QCD-Gravity double copy in Regge asymptotics: from $2\rightarrow n$ amplitudes to radiation in shockwave collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lectures discuss multi-particle production in QCD and in gravity at ultrarelativistic energies, their double copy relations, and strong parallels in emergent shockwave dynamics. Dispersive techniques are applied to derive the BFKL equation for multi-gluon production in Regge asymptotics. Identical methods apply in gravity and are captured by a gravitational Lipatov equation. The building blocks in both cases are Lipatov vertices and reggeized propagators satisfying double copy relations; in gravity, Weinberg's soft theorem is recovered as a limit of the Lipatov framework. BFKL evolution in QCD generates wee parton states of maximal occupancy characterized by an emergent semi-hard saturation scale. Renormalization group equations in the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) EFT describe wee parton correlations and their rapidity evolution. A shockwave picture of deeply inelastic scattering and hadron-hadron collisions follows, with multi-particle production described by Cutkosky's rules in strong time-dependent fields. Gluon radiation in the CGC EFT has a double copy in gravitational shockwave collisions, with a similar correspondence applicable between gluon and graviton shockwave propagators. Possible extensions of this semi-classical double copy are outlined for computing multi-particle production in gravitational shockwave collisions, self-force and tidal contributions, and classical and quantum noise in the focusing of geodesics.</description>

      <title>Love beyond Einstein: Metric reconstruction and Love number in quadratic gravity using WEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study tidal Love numbers of static black holes in four-dimensional quadratic theory of gravity, extending the result of GR. We use worldline effective field theory (WEFT) methods to compute metric perturbations from one-point functions, treating the higher-derivative terms perturbatively. We show that insertions of scalar fields on the worldline induce non-zero tidal tails, and the corresponding Love number displays no RG running. The same conclusion holds for the insertions of tensor fields. Furthermore, for scalar dipole perturbations, we derive a Yukawa-deformed Frobenius solution and match the asymptotic behavior to fix the UV charge, finding agreement with EFT predictions of Wilson coefficients. Our work demonstrates that quadratic higher-curvature corrections induce non-zero but scale-independent tidal responses, offering a robust EFT framework to test deviations from GR in gravitational wave observations.</description>
