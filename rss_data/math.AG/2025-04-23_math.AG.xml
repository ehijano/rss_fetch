      <title>Birational properties of word varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the subvariety of $SL(2)\times SL(2)$ given by the matrix equation $w(X,Y)=\alpha$, where $w$ is a word in two letters, is closely related to an explicit smooth conic bundle over the associated `trace surface' in the 3-dimensional affine space. When $w$ is the commutator word, we show that this variety can be irrational if the ground field $k$ is not algebraically closed, answering a question of Rapinchuk, Benyash-Krivetz, and Chernousov. When $k$ is a number field, it satisfies weak approximation with the Brauer--Manin obstruction.</description>

      <title>Centers of perfectoid purity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a mixed characteristic analog of log canonical centers in characteristic $0$ and centers of $F$-purity in positive characteristic, which we call centers of perfectoid purity. We show that their existence detects (the failure of) normality of the ring. We also show the existence of a special center of perfectoid purity that detects the perfectoid purity of $R$, analogously to the splitting prime of Aberbach and Enescu, and investigate its behavior under \'etale morphisms.</description>

      <title>Remodeling Conjecture with Descendants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate and prove the Remodeling Conjecture with descendants, which is a version of all-genus equivariant descendant mirror symmetry for semi-projective toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifolds. We consider the $K$-group of equivariant coherent sheaves on the toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifold with support bounded in a direction, and prove that it is isomorphic to a certain integral relative first homology group of the equivariant mirror curve. We establish a correspondence between all-genus equivariant descendant Gromov-Witten invariants with $K$-theoretic framings and oscillatory integrals (Laplace transforms) of the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion invariants along relative 1-cycles on the equivariant mirror curve. Our genus-zero correspondence is an equivariant Hodge-theoretic mirror symmetry with integral structures. In the non-equivariant setting, we prove a conjecture of Hosono which equates central charges of compactly supported coherent sheaves with period integrals of integral 3-cycles on the Hori-Vafa mirror 3-fold.</description>

      <title>Integral Artin motives II: Perverse motives and Artin Vanishing Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this text, we are mainly interested in the existence of the perverse motivic t-structures on the category of Artin \'etale motives with integral coefficients. We construct the perverse homotopy t-structure which is the best possible approximation to a perverse t-structure on Artin motives with rational coefficients. The heart of this t-structure has properties similar to those of the category of perverse sheaves and contains the Ayoub-Zucker motive. With integral coefficients, we construct the perverse motivic t-structure on Artin motives when the base scheme is of dimension at most $2$ and show that it cannot exist in dimension $4$. This construction relies notably on a an analogue for Artin motives of the Artin Vanishing Theorem.</description>

      <title>Geometry of regular semisimple Lusztig varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lusztig varieties are subvarieties in flag manifolds $G/B$ associated to an element $w$ in the Weyl group $W$ and an element $x$ in $G$, introduced in Lusztig's papers on character sheaves. We study the geometry of these varieties when $x$ is regular semisimple.
  In the first part, we establish that they are normal, Cohen-Macaulay, of pure expected dimension and have rational singularities. We then show that the cohomology of ample line bundles vanishes in positive degrees, in arbitrary characteristic. This extends to nef line bundles when the base field has characteristic zero or sufficiently large characteristic. Along the way, we prove that Lusztig varieties are Frobenius split in positive characteristic and that their open cells are affine. We also prove that the open cells in Deligne-Lusztig varieties are affine, settling a question that has been open since the foundational paper of Deligne and Lusztig.
  In the second part, we explore their relationship with regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties. Both varieties admit Tymoczko's dot action of $W$ on their (intersection) cohomology. We associate to each element $w$ in $W$ a Hessenberg space using the tangent cone of the Schubert variety associated with $w$, and show that the cohomology of the associated regular semisimple Lusztig varieties and Hessenberg varieties is isomorphic as graded $W$-representations when they are smooth.
  This relationship extends to the level of varieties: we construct a flat degeneration of regular semisimple Lusztig varieties to regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties. In particular, this proves a conjecture of Abreu and Nigro on the homeomorphism types of regular semisimple Lusztig varieties in type $A$, and generalizes it to arbitrary Lie types.</description>

      <title>Engineered complete intersections: eliminating variables and understanding topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of engineered complete intersections (ECI) -- an umbrella generality for a number of important objects in combinatoiral and applied algebraic geometry (such as nondegenerate toric complete intersections, critical loci of their projections, hyperplane arrangements, generalized Calabi--Yau complete intersections, incidence varieties in algebraic optimization, reaction networks).
  In this paper, we work on extending to ECIs several classical results about toric complete intersections. This includes elimination theory, patchworking over ${\mathbb R}$, and computing basic geometric invariants over ${\mathbb C}$.
  Our results apply e.g. to eliminating variables in systems of ODEs, such as reaction networks, computing Newton polytopes of discriminants, constructing real polynomial maps and reaction networks with prescribed topology.
  Along the way, we assign a cohomology ring to an arbitrary tropical fan, and relate reducible ECIs to arrangements of pairwise intersecting planes.</description>

Abstract: We provide an axiomatic definition of an Igusa stack associated to an arbitrary Shimura datum. We then prove that Igusa stacks are unique and automatically functorial with respect to morphisms of Shimura data, assuming their existence. Using the same techniques, we also prove that the existence of the Igusa stack passes to a Shimura subdatum.</description>

Abstract: We prove the thin set version of Manin's conjecture for the chordal (or: determinantal) cubic fourfold, which is the secant variety of the Veronese surface. We reduce this counting problem to a result of Schmidt for quadratic points in the projective plane by showing that the chordal cubic fourfold is isomorphic to the symmetric square of the projective plane over the rational numbers.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler-Ricci solitons on Fano threefolds with non-trivial moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14212v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find Fano threefolds $X$ admitting K\"ahler-Ricci solitons (KRS) with non-trivial moduli, which are $\mathbb{T}$-varieties of complexity two. More precisely, we show that the weighted K-stability of $(X,\xi_0)$ (where $\xi_0$ is the soliton candidate) is equivalent to certain GIT-stability. In particular, this provides the first examples of strictly weighted K-semistable Fano varieties. On the other hand, we generalize Koiso's theorem to the log Fano setting. Indeed, we show that the K-stability of a log Fano pair $(V,\Delta_V)$ is equivalent to the weighted K-stability of a cone $(Y, \Delta_Y, \xi_0)$ over it. This also leads to new examples of KRS Fano varieties with non-trivial moduli and small automorphism groups. To achieve these, we establish the weighted Abban-Zhuang estimate generalizing the work of \cite{AZ22}, which gives a lower bound of the weighted stability threshold $\delta^g_{\mathbb{T}}(X,\Delta)$. This is an effective way to check the weighted K-semistablity of a log Fano triple $(X,\Delta,\xi_0)$. This estimate is also useful in testing (weighted) K-polystability based on the work of \cite{BLXZ23}.</description>

Abstract: We provide new, improved lower bounds for the Hodge and Frobenius colevels of algebraic varieties (over $\mathbf{C}$ or over a finite field) in all cohomological degrees. These bounds are expressed in terms of the dimension of the variety and multi-degrees of its defining equations. Our results lead to an enhanced positive answer to a question raised by Esnault and the first author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To, say, a proper algebraic or holomorphic space $X/S$, and a coherent sheaf ${\mathcal F}$ on $X$ we identify a functorial ideal, the fitted flatifier, blowing up sequentially in which leads to a flattening of the proper transform of ${\mathcal F}$. As such, this is a variant on theorems of Raynaud \&amp; Hironaka, but it's functorial nature allows its application to a flattening theorem for formal algebraic spaces or Artin champs, where we apply it to prove close to optimal algebraisation theorems for formal deformations. En passant, contrary to what is asserted in EGA-3 Remarque 5.4.6, we give an example of an adic Noetherian formal scheme whose nil radical is not coherent and establish the equivalence conjectured therein between arbitrary algebraisability and that of the reduction.</description>

      <title>Minimal Energy Local Systems on Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_{g,d}$ an orientable topological surface of genus $g$ with $d$ punctures. When $g = 0$, Deroin and Tholozan studied the class of supra-maximal representations $\pi_1(\Sigma_{0,d})\to \mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$, and they showed that the supra-maximal representations form a compact component of a real relative character variety. We study a collection of rank $n$ local systems on $\Sigma_{g,d}$ which we call of minimal energy. These are generalizations of supra-maximal representations, and underlie polarizable complex variations of Hodge structure for any choice of complex structure on $\Sigma_{g,d}$. Like the supra-maximal representations, the minimal energy local systems form a compact connected component of a real relative character variety.
  We show that when the local monodromy data around the punctures is chosen to be unitary and generic, and the relative character variety is nonempty, these minimal energy local systems always exist. When $g &gt; 0$ we show that the minimal energy local systems come from unitary representations of $\pi_1(\Sigma_{g,d})$. If $g = 0$ we show that they do not always come from unitary representations, and we study their structure in general.</description>

      <title>Completion of motivic sheaves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24033v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the process of $\ell$-adic completion of motivic sheaves. We observe that, in equal characteristic, when restricted to constructible objets, it is compatible with the six operations. This implies that one can reconstruct $\ell$-adic sheaves of geometric origin over a scheme of finite type over a field from $\ell$-adic cohomology of smooth schemes. In the case of finite fields, this includes perverse $\ell$-adic sheaves of geometric orgin. However, the analogous behaviour fails systematically in mixed characteristic: the reason is that it would imply strong independence of $\ell$ results that can be proven to be too optimistic.</description>

      <title>Counting aCM Toric Bundles of Rank Two on the Veronese Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the isomorphism classes of torus-equivariant rank 2 arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (aCM) vector bundles on the Veronese surface, up to a twist by the hyperplane class, and count them. Our approach makes use of Klyachko's description of toric vector bundles via filtrations and the associated cohomology computation. We also describe several representative bundles.</description>

      <title>Interlacing triangles, Schubert puzzles, and graph colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that interlacing triangular arrays, introduced by Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler to study certain probability measures, can be used to compute structure constants for multiplying Schubert classes in the $K$-theory of Grassmannians, in the cohomology of their cotangent bundles, and in the cohomology of partial flag varieties. Our results are achieved by establishing a splitting lemma, allowing for interlacing triangular arrays of high rank to be decomposed into arrays of lower rank, and by constructing a bijection between interlacing triangular arrays of rank 3 with certain proper vertex colorings of the triangular grid graph that factors through generalizations of Knutson-Tao puzzles. Along the way, we prove one enumerative conjecture of Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler and disprove another.</description>

      <title>A generalized Schmidt's subspace theorem for algebraic points of bounded degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08049v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schmidt's subspace theorem in terms of Seshadri constants for closed subschemes in subgeneral position has been already developed sharply. We derive our theorem for numerically equivalent ample divisors by dint of the above theory step by step, providing a joint generalization of Schmidt's theorem for algebraic points of bounded degree.</description>

      <title>On SYZ mirrors of Hirzebruch surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Strominger-Yau-Zaslow (SYZ) approach to mirror symmetry constructs a mirror space and a superpotential from the data of a Lagrangian torus fibration on a K\"ahler manifold with effective first Chern class. For K\"ahler manifolds whose first Chern class is not nef, the SYZ construction is further complicated by the presence of additional holomorphic discs with non-positive Maslov index.
  In this paper, we study SYZ mirror symmetry for two of the simplest toric examples: the non-Fano Hirzebruch surfaces F_3 and F_4. For F_3, we determine the SYZ mirror associated to generic perturbations of the complex structure, and demonstrate that the SYZ mirror depends on the choice of perturbation. For F_4, we determine the SYZ mirror for a specific perturbation of complex structure, where the mirror superpotential is an explicit infinite Laurent series. Finally, we relate this superpotential to those arising from other perturbations of F_4 via a scattering diagram.</description>
