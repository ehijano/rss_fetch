      <title>Flux-driven charge and spin transport in a dimerized Hubbard ring with Fibonacci modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum transport in a one-dimensional Hubbard ring with dimerized nearest-neighbor hoppings and a Fibonacci-modulated onsite potential. For non-interacting case our analysis reveals that at half-filling, the charge current along with the Drude weight decreases with increasing onsite potential when inter-cell hopping dominates over the intra-cell hopping, while for dominating intra-cell hopping it shows non-monotonic behavior with sharp peak at certain critical modulation strength, indicating enhanced transport. Moving away from half-filling gives rise to re-entrant features in both quantities at fillings associated with Fibonacci numbers. On the other hand, in spin-imbalanced systems, both spin and charge current shows multiple peaks and re-entrant behavior, tunable via hopping dimerization and filling. Including the on-site Hubbard interaction preserves the re-entrant behavior in current and moreover favors finite transport which is absent in the non-interacting ring. These results reveal rich interplay among Fibonacci modulated potential, electron fillings, hopping dimerization and interaction.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of topological quantum systems is the robust quantization of particle transport, which is the origin of the integer-valued Quantum Hall conductivity. In the presence of interactions the topological transport can also become fractional. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by arrays of photonic waveguides have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. Here a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound composites, called lattice solitons. Upon increasing the interaction strength of these solitons a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a full quantum description of topological pumps of solitons. This approach allows us to identify a topological invariant, a many-body Chern number, determined by the band structure of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the solitons, which fully governs their transport. Increasing the interaction leads to a successive merging of COM bands which explains the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential for a breakdown of topological quantization for intermediate interaction strength.</description>
