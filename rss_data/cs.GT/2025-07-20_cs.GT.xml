      <title>Resource-Splitting Games with Tullock-Based Lossy Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel class of multi-stage resource allocation games that model real-world scenarios in which profitability depends on the balance between supply and demand, and where higher resource investment leads to greater returns. Our proposed framework, which incorporates the notion of profit loss due to insufficient player participation, gives rise to a Tullock-like functional form of the stage payoff structure when weighted fair proportional resource allocation is applied. We explore both centralized and Nash equilibrium strategies, establish sufficient conditions for their existence and uniqueness, and provide an iterative, semi-decentralized method to compute the Nash equilibrium in games with arbitrarily many players. Additionally, we demonstrate that the framework generalizes instances of several existing models, including Receding Horizon and Blotto games, and present a semi-analytical method for computing the unique Nash equilibrium within the Blotto setup. Our findings are validated through a numerical case study in smart mobility, highlighting the practical relevance and applicability of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Online MMS Allocation for Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fair division of indivisible chores among $n$ agents in an online setting, where items arrive sequentially and must be allocated irrevocably upon arrival. The goal is to produce an $\alpha$-MMS allocation at the end. Several recent works have investigated this model, but have only succeeded in obtaining non-trivial algorithms under restrictive assumptions, such as the two-agent bi-valued special case (Wang and Wei, 2025), or by assuming knowledge of the total disutility of each agent (Zhou, Bai, and Wu, 2023). For the general case, the trivial $n$-MMS guarantee remains the best known, while the strongest lower bound is still only $2$.
  We close this gap on the negative side by proving that for any fixed $n$ and $\varepsilon$, no algorithm can guarantee an $(n - \varepsilon)$-MMS allocation. Notably, this lower bound holds precisely for every $n$, without hiding constants in big-$O$ notation, thereby exactly matching the trivial upper bound.
  Despite this strong impossibility result, we also present positive results. We provide an online algorithm that applies in the general case, guaranteeing a $\min\{n, O(k), O(\log D)\}$-MMS allocation, where $k$ is the maximum number of distinct disutilities across all agents and $D$ is the maximum ratio between the largest and smallest disutilities for any agent. This bound is reasonable across a broad range of scenarios and, for example, implies that we can achieve an $O(1)$-MMS allocation whenever $k$ is constant. Moreover, to optimize the constant in the important personalized bi-valued case, we show that if each agent has at most two distinct disutilities, our algorithm guarantees a $(2 + \sqrt{3}) \approx 3.7$-MMS allocation.</description>

      <title>Fair distribution of bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of splitting fairly bundles of items. We show that given $n$ bundles with $m$ kinds of items in them, it is possible to distribute the value of each kind of item fairly among $r$ persons by breaking apart at most $(r-1)m$ bundles. Moreover, we can guarantee that each participant will receive roughly $n/r - mr/2$ full bundles. The proof methods are topological and use a modified form of the configuration space/test map scheme. We obtain optimal results when $r$ is a power of two.</description>

      <title>More Efforts Towards Fixed-Parameter Approximability of Multiwinner Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiwinner Elections have emerged as a prominent area of research with numerous practical applications. We contribute to this area by designing parameterized approximation algorithms and also resolving an open question by Yang and Wang [AAMAS'18]. More formally, given a set of candidates, \mathcal{C}, a set of voters,\mathcal{V}, approving a subset of candidates (called approval set of a voter), and an integer $k$, we consider the problem of selecting a ``good'' committee using Thiele rules. This problem is computationally challenging for most Thiele rules with monotone submodular satisfaction functions, as there is no (1-\frac{1}{e}-\epsilon)\footnote{Here, $e$ denotes the base of the natural logarithm.}-approximation algorithm in f(k)(|\mathcal{C}| + |\mathcal{V}|)^{o(k)} time for any fixed $\epsilon &gt; 0$ and any computable function $f$, and no {\sf PTAS} even when the length of approval set is two. Skowron [WINE'16] designed an approximation scheme running in FPT time parameterized by the combined parameter, size of the approval set and $k$. In this paper, we consider a parameter $d+k$ (no $d$ voters approve the same set of $d$ candidates), where $d$ is upper bounded by the size of the approval set (thus, can be much smaller).
  With respect to this parameter, we design parameterized approximation schemes, a lossy polynomial-time preprocessing method, and show that an extra committee member suffices to achieve the desired score (i.e., $1$-additive approximation). Additionally, we resolve an open question by Yang and Wang~[AAMAS'18] regarding the fixed-parameter tractability of the problem under the PAV rule with the total score as the parameter, demonstrating that it admits an FPT algorithm.</description>

      <title>Improved Approximate EFX Guarantees for Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, a new line of work in fair allocation has focused on EFX allocations for \((p, q)\)-bounded valuations, where each good is relevant to at most \(p\) agents, and any pair of agents share at most \(q\) relevant goods. For the case \(p = 2\) and \(q = \infty\), such instances can be equivalently represented as multigraphs whose vertices are the agents and whose edges represent goods, each edge incident to exactly the one or two agents for whom the good is relevant. A recent result of \citet{amanatidis2024pushing} shows that for additive $(2,\infty)$ bounded valuations, a \((\nicefrac{2}{3})\)-EFX allocation always exists. In this paper, we improve this bound by proving the existence of a \((\nicefrac{1}{\sqrt{2}})\)-\(\efx\) allocation for additive \((2,\infty)\)-bounded valuations.</description>
