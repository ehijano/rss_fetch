      <title>Threshold-based impulsive biocontrol for coffee leaf rust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coffee leaf rust (CLR) severely affects coffee production worldwide, leading to reduced yields and economic losses. To reduce the cost of control, small-scale farmers often only apply control measures once a noticeable level of infection is reached. In this work, we develop mathematical models to better understand CLR dynamics and impulsive biocontrol with threshold-based interventions. We first use ordinary and impulsive differential equations to describe disease spread and the application of control measures once a certain infection level is detected. These models help determine when and how often interventions should occur. To capture the early stages of the disease and the chance that it might die out by itself, we then use a continuous-time Markov chain approach. This stochastic model allows us to estimate the probability that the pathogen fails to establish, thereby avoiding serious outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Factors Influencing Farmers' Motivation to Adopt Smart Farm Technology in South Korea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart farming technologies have recently become a major focus because they promise improved agricultural productivity together with sustainability benefits. The rate at which farmers adopt new technologies differs because of various socio-economic and technological factors. This research investigates the main factors affecting smart farm adoption through an evaluation of farmer age, education attainment, land size, government banking, technological hurdles and financial limitations. Statistical analysis of survey responses reveals that farmers under thirty years old and possessing advanced education along with operating expansive farms demonstrate greater willingness to adopt smart farming solutions. Government policies that offer financial assistance and training programs drive farmers to adopt new systems yet technical and financial difficulties prevent broad adoption. The research results demonstrate the requirement for targeted policies that should help farmers by providing specific financial help and digital education programs. This study delivers important knowledge which helps government officials together with agricultural leaders to accelerate the adaptation speed of smart farming technology.</description>

      <title>Spatial Dynamics of Synchronized Ants: A Mobile Oscillator Model Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronized short-term activity cycles are a prominent feature in the nests of certain ant species, but their functional significance remains controversial. This study investigates whether synchronization enhances spatial accessibility within ant nests, a factor critical for efficient task performance and colony fitness. We use the mobile oscillator model, a computational framework that simulates ant movement and synchronous activity, to examine the effect of synchronization on the spatial distribution of inactive ants, which act as obstacles to the movement of active ants. Our analysis reveals no significant effect of synchronization on the size of inactive ant clusters or on direct measures of spatial accessibility, such as the number of steps and net displacement during ant activity periods. These findings suggest that within the mobile oscillator model, synchronization does not directly enhance spatial accessibility, highlighting the need for more complex models to elucidate the intricate relationship between synchronization and spatial dynamics in ant colonies.</description>
