      <title>Second register production on the clarinet: nonlinear losses in the register hole as the decisive physical phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the role of localized nonlinear losses in the register hole on the production of second-register notes. First, an experiment is conducted to study the ability of a register hole to produce second register. A cylindrical tube is drilled with holes of increasing diameter. Five are at the same level as the register hole of a B-flat clarinet, and five are at the same level as the thumb hole. Participant clarinetists  are then asked to play with constant control parameters. At the beginning of each measurement, all holes are closed. The operator then opens randomly one of the ten holes.The resulting register is noted. The experiment is replicated numerically by time integration of two different models. The first is the state-of-the-art model based on the modal decomposition of the input impedance of the resonator. The second accounts for localized nonlinear losses in the register hole, through the model from Dalmont and Nederveen (2002). These losses are handled through a variable modal coefficients method. For the first model, simulations never produce second register, for any of the open holes. For the second, the proportion of second-register production is close to the experiment for upstream holes, but remains at zero for downstream holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the regions forbidden to classical scattering trajectories by repulsive potentials. We give explicit results for the asymptotic form of these regions, far from the scattering center, in terms of the scattering angle function.</description>

      <title>Seashell-inspired polarization-sensitive tonotopic metasensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bioinspiration has widely been demonstrated to be a powerful approach for the design of innovative structures and devices. Recently, this concept has been extended to the field of elasticity, dynamics, and metamaterials. In this paper, we propose a seashell-inspired metasensor that can simultaneously perform spatial frequency mapping and act as a polarizer. The structure emerges from a universal parametric design that encompasses diverse spiral geometries with varying circular cross sections and curvature radii, all leading to tonotopic behavior. Adoption of an optimization process leads to a planar geometry that enables us to simultaneously achieve tonotopy for orthogonally polarized modes, leading to the possibility to control polarization as well as the spatial distribution of frequency maxima along the spiral axis. We demonstrate the versatility of the device and discuss the possible applications in the field of acoustics and sensing.</description>
