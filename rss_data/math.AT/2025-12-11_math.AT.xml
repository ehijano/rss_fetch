      <title>Persistent Cycle Representatives and Generalized Landscapes for Codimension 1 Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a filtered simplicial complex $K$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, the merge tree of the complement of $K$ induces a forest structure on the persistent homology $H_d(K)$ via Alexander duality. We prove that the connected components of $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}\setminus K_r$ correspond to representative cycles for a basis of $H_d(K_r)$ which are volume-optimal. By keeping track of how these representatives evolve with the filtration of $K$, we can equip each interval $I$ in the barcode of $H_d(K)$ with a sequence of canonical representative cycles. We develop and implement an efficient algorithm to compute the progression of cycles in time $\mathcal{O}((\#K)^2)$. We apply functionals to these representatives, such as path length, enclosed volume, or total curvature. This way, we obtain a real-valued function for each interval, which captures geometric information about~$K$. Deriving from this construction, we introduce the \emph{generalized persistence landscapes}. Using the constant one-function as the functional, this construction gives back the standard persistence landscapes. Generalized landscapes can distinguish point clouds with similar persistent homology but distinct shape, which we demonstrate by concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Topological Obstructions to Shared Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite collection of probability measures defined on subsets of a measurable space, how can we determine if they are compatible, in the sense that they can be realized as conditional distributions of a single probability measure on the full space? This formulation of the consistency problem for conditional probabilities is significant in Bayesian epistemology and probabilistic reasoning, as it describes the conditions under which a collection of agents can reach agreement by sharing information. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition under which joint compatibility is equivalent to pairwise compatibility. This condition is stated in terms of the cohomology of a simplicial complex constructed from the given probability measures, exposing a novel application of algebraic topology to Bayesian reasoning.</description>

      <title>Homological Milnor-Witt modules and Chow-Witt groups over general bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general theory of homological Milnor-Witt cycle modules over an excellent base scheme equipped with a dimension function, extending both Rost's cycle modules and Feld's theory over fields. To any such module we associate a Rost-Schmid type complex whose homology defines a Borel-Moore intersection theory with quadratic coefficients, satisfying homotopy invariance, localization, proper pushforwards, smooth pullbacks, and Gysin morphisms for essentially smoothable lci morphisms.
  Using duality data induced by pinning structures, we define cohomological Milnor-Witt modules and establish a duality equivalence between homological and cohomological theories. As applications, we extend Chow-Witt groups to schemes over general (possibly singular or arithmetic) bases, prove generalized Bloch formulas and representability results, and compute graded Chow-Witt groups over Dedekind schemes of finite type over the integers. In particular, we obtain finiteness results for Chow-Witt and related Milnor-Witt invariants in dimension at most one.</description>

      <title>The multiple points of maps from sphere to Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.11575v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain some sufficient conditions to guarantee the existence of multiple points of maps from $S^m$ to $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our main tool is the ideal-valued index of $G$-space defined by E. Fadell and S. Husseini. We obtain more detailed relative positional relationship of multiple points. It is proved that for a continuous real value function $f: S^m\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(-p)=-f(p)$, if $m+1$ is a power of $2$, then there are $m+1$ points $p_1, \ldots, p_{m+1}$ in $S^m$ such that $f(p_1)=\cdots=f(p_{m+1})$, where $p_1, \ldots, p_{m+1}$ are linearly dependent and any $m$ points of $p_1, \ldots, p_{m+1}$ are linearly independent. As a generalization of Hopf's theorem, we also prove that for any continuous map $f: S^m\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$, if $m&gt; d$, then there exists a pair of mutually orthogonal points having the same image in addition to the antipodal points.</description>

      <title>Semiadditive Alternating Powers and Twisted Power Operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of representations of symmetric groups in higher semiadditive categories. For these representations in $\mathrm{Mod}^{\wedge}_{E_n}$, the transchromatic character of Hopkins--Kuhn--Ravenel and Stapleton is recovered as a sequence of monoidal characters on suitable categorifications, giving an explicit algorithm for its computation, and relating it to the iterated monoidal character in $(\infty,n)$-categories. These representations also give rise to notions of alternating powers and power operations in semiadditive categories, extending the classical alternating powers and $\lambda$-operations in $\mathrm{K}$-theory. We provide explicit computations in both the chromatic and higher categorical settings at low heights.</description>

      <title>String topology and graph cobordisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathrm{GrCob}$ of graph cobordisms between spaces, and use the homology of its morphism spaces to define string operations. Precisely, for an $E_\infty$-ring spectrum $R$ and an oriented $d$-dimensional $R$-Poincar\'e duality space $M$, we construct a "graph field theory" $\mathrm{GFT}_M$, i.e. a symmetric monoidal functor from a suitable $R$-linearisation of $\mathrm{GrCob}^\mathrm{op}$ to the category $\mathrm{Mod}_R$ of $R$-modules in spectra; the graph field theory takes an object $X\in\mathrm{GrCob}^\mathrm{op}$, i.e. a space, to the $R$-module $\Sigma_+^\infty\mathrm{map}(X,M)\otimes R$ of $R$-chains on the mapping space from $X$ to $M$; by selecting suitable graph cobordisms we recover the basic string operations given by restriction, cross product with the fundamental class, and the Chas-Sullivan operations.
  The construction is natural with respect to oriented homotopy equivalences of $R$-Poincar\'e duality spaces; in particular, restricting to the endomorphisms of $\emptyset\in\mathrm{GrCob}^\mathrm{op}$, we obtain characteristic classes of $R$-oriented $M$-fibrations parametrised by the suitably twisted homology of $\mathbf{B}\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$, recovering results of Berglund and Barkan-Steinebrunner.
  Finally, we describe explicitly the morphism spaces in $\mathrm{GrCob}$, answering along the way a question by Hatcher. This allows us to construct a symmetric monoidal functor from the open-closed cobordism $\infty$-category $\mathcal{OC}$ to $\mathrm{GrCob}$. Composing with $\mathrm{GFT}_M$, we obtain an open-closed field theory with values in $\mathrm{Mod}_R$, attaining values $\Sigma^\infty_+LM\otimes R$ and $\Sigma^\infty_+M\otimes R$ at the circle and at the interval, respectively. We expect this to recover and extend constructions of Cohen, Godin and others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.14830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the notions of a multiplier category and the $W^{*}$-envelope of a $C^{*}$-category. We then consider the notion of an orthogonal sum of a (possibly infinite) family of objects in a $C^{*}$-category. Furthermore, we construct reduced crossed products of $C^{*}$-categories with groups. We axiomatize the basic properties of the $K$-theory for $C^{*}$-categories in the notion of a homological functor. We then study various rigidity properties of homological functors in general, and special additional features of the $K$-theory of $C^{*}$-categories. As an application we construct and study interesting functors on the orbit category of a group from $C^{*}$-categorical data.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of natural directed paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02792v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the abstract setting of presheaf category on a thick category of cubes. Precubical sets, symmetric transverse sets, symmetric precubical sets and the new category of (non-symmetric) transverse sets are examples of this structure. All these presheaf categories share the same metric and homotopical properties from a directed homotopy point of view. This enables us to extend Raussen's notion of natural $d$-path for each of them. Finally, we adapt Ziemia\'{n}ski's notion of cube chain to this abstract setting and we prove that it has the expected behavior on precubical sets. As an application, we verify that the formalization of the parallel composition with synchronization of process algebra using the coskeleton functor of the category of symmetric transverse sets has a category of cube chains with the correct homotopy type.</description>
