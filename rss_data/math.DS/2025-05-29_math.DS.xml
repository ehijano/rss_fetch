      <title>Constrained Hamiltonian Systems on Observation-Induced Fiber Bundles: Theory of Symmetry and Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical constrained Hamiltonian theory assumes complete observability of system states, but in reality only partial state information is often available. This paper establishes a complete geometric theoretical framework for handling such incompletely observed systems. By introducing the concept of observation-induced fiber bundles, we naturally extend Dirac constraint theory to the fiber bundle setting, unifying the treatment of state constraints and observation constraints. Main results include: (1) Classification of existence conditions for observation fiber bundles based on characteristic class theory; (2) Complete characterization of Poisson structures on fiber bundles and corresponding symplectic reduction theory; (3) Geometric necessary and sufficient conditions for integrability and Lax pair construction; (4) Extension of Noether's theorem under symmetry group actions. The theoretical framework naturally encompasses a wide range of applications from classical mechanics to modern safety-critical control systems, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for dynamical analysis under incomplete information.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of stationary measures for stochastic systems with almost surely invariant manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for establishing non-uniqueness of stationary measures for stochastically forced dynamical systems possessing an almost surely invariant submanifold. Our main abstract result provides sufficient conditions for the existence of multiple stationary measures on compact manifolds, though the underlying methodology extends to non-compact settings. The key insight is to construct additional stationary measures by exploiting the linear instability of the invariant submanifold, as quantified by a positive transverse Lyapunov exponent.
  To demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework, we apply it to the Lorenz 96 model with degenerate stochastic forcing, which serves as an example of both non-compact and high-dimensional dynamics. We prove that as the damping parameter becomes sufficiently small, the unique stationary measure bifurcates, giving rise to exactly two distinct stationary measures. The proof combines our general theory with computer-assisted verification of certain Lie algebra generation properties that ensure the required hypoellipticity and irreducibility conditions.</description>

      <title>Categorical Lyapunov Theory II: Stability of Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyapunov's theorem provides a foundational characterization of stable equilibrium points in dynamical systems. In this paper, we develop a framework for stability for F-coalgebras. We give two definitions for a categorical setting in which we can study the stability of a coalgebra for an endofunctor F. One is minimal and better suited for concrete settings, while the other is more intricate and provides a richer theory. We prove a Lyapunov theorem for both notions of setting for stability, and a converse Lyapunov theorem for the second.</description>

      <title>Jumping for diffusion in random metastable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random metastability occurs when an externally forced or noisy system possesses more than one state of apparent equilibrium. This work investigates fluctuations in a class of random dynamical systems, arising from randomly perturbing a piecewise smooth expanding interval map with more than one invariant subinterval. Upon perturbation, this invariance is destroyed, allowing trajectories to switch between subintervals, giving rise to metastable behaviour. We show that the distributions of jumps of a time-homogeneous Markov chain approximate the distributions of jumps for random metastable systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that this approximation extends to the diffusion coefficient for (random) observables of such systems. As an example, our results are applied to Horan's random paired tent maps.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A CR-dynamical system is a pair $(X, G)$, where $X$ is a non-empty compact Hausdorff space with uniformity $\mathscr{U}$ and $G$ is a closed relation on $X$. In this paper we introduce the $(i, j)$-shadowing properties in CR-dynamical systems, which generalises the shadowing property from topological dynamical systems $(X, f)$. This extends previous work on shadowing in set-valued dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Locating Extremal Periodic Orbits for the Planar Circular Restricted Three Body Problem using Polynomial Sum-of-Squares Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an increasing interest in the design of long and complex space missions, the search for orbits that require the least amount of fuel is of fundamental interest. This paper develops existing computational models for locating Unstable Periodic Orbits (UPOs) in polynomial dynamical systems using Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization technique and proposes a numerical framework to converge UPOs for the Planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (PCR3BP) in astrodynamics. This is done by developing the polynomial SOS optimization technique with extension to systems with non-polynomial and Hamiltonian dynamics. First, we demonstrate and exploit the dependency of convergence of tight bounds on an observable of interest with varying scaling factors for large polynomial degrees. SOS optimization is then used to compute nonnegative polynomials, the minimization sublevel sets of which, approximately localise parts of the corresponding UPO. Improvements in current non-linear optimization techniques are suggested to compute a large number of points inside the relevant sublevel sets. Such points provide good initial conditions for UPO computations with existing algorithms. The distinguishing feature of such UPOs is that they optimize the long-time average of an input observable of interest which is a function of state variables. For the PCR3BP this means that such orbits in space can be traversed indefinitely in time without continuous fuel expenditure. As practical applications to space mission designs, we converge UPOs that minimise transmitted power required by satellites for the Earth-Moon system in a communication relay problem by minimizing the infinite-time average of sum of squares of distances of a satellite from Earth and the Moon.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Pseudo-Goodwin Cycles in a Wage-Led Minsky Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of these notes is to make the concept of "pseudo goodwin cycles" mathematically more precise. At first the title seems like a contradiction to have a wage-led model and still find goodwin cycles in it, but the point we try to make in the paper is that those are only `pseudo-goodwin' cycles, and not real goodwin cycles.</description>

      <title>Parametric Instability in Discrete Models of Spatiotemporally Modulated Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of parametric instability in discrete models of spatiotemporally modulated materials. These materials are celebrated in part because they exhibit nonreciprocal transmission characteristics. However, parametric instability may occur for strong modulations, or occasionally even at very small modulation amplitudes, and prevent the safe operation of spatiotemporally modulated devices due to an exponential growth in the response amplitude. We use Floquet theory to conduct a detailed computational investigation of parametric instability. We explore the roles of modulation parameters (frequency, amplitude, wavenumber), the number of modulated units, and damping on the stability of the system. We highlight the pivotal role of spatial modulation in parametric instability, a feature that is predominantly overlooked in this context. We use the perturbation method to obtain analytical expressions for modulation frequencies at which the response becomes unstable. We hope that our findings enable and inspire new applications of spatiotemporally modulated materials that operate at higher amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Size of exceptional sets in weakly mixing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any weakly mixing system $(X,\mathscr{B},\mu,T)$ and any $A,B\in\mathscr{B}$, it is well known that there exists a density-zero exceptional set $J_{A,B}\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ along which $\mu(A\cap T^{-n}B)\to\mu(A)\mu(B)$ for $n\notin J_{A,B}$. In this paper, we investigate finer quantitative properties of the exceptional set. First, assuming a given rate of weak mixing, we derive an explicit upper bound on $|J_{A,B}\cap[0,n]|$ in terms of that rate. We apply this result to interval exchange transformations and to a class of substitution dynamical systems. Next, we analyze a broad family of cutting and stacking transformations (of which the Chacon map is a special case): we construct a universal exceptional set $J$ and show that for any increasing function $h\colon\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}\to\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ diverging to infinity, one can choose $J\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ satisfying $|J\cap[0,n]|\le(\log n)^{h(n)}$ for all $n$, uniformly over all Lebesgue-measurable $A,B\subseteq[0,1]$. We prove that this is optimal, in the sense that for any $t&gt;0$, there exist measurable sets $A,B\subseteq[0,1]$ and a constant $N&gt;0$ such that $|J_{A,B}\cap[0,n]|\ge(\log n)^{t}$ for all $n&gt;N$.</description>

      <title>Random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms (complex generalized H\'{e}non maps and their conjugate maps) of $\Bbb{C}^{2}.$ We show that a generic random dynamical system of polynomial automorphisms has ``mean stablity'' on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$. Further, we show that if a system has mean stability, then (1) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma =(\gamma _{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }$ of maps, the maximal Lyapunov exponents of $\gamma $ at $z$ is negative, (2) there are only finitely many minimal sets of the system, (3) each minimal set is attracting, (4) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma $ of maps, the orbit $\{ \gamma _{n}\cdots \gamma _{1}(z) \} _{n=1}^{\infty }$ tends to one of the minimal sets of the system, and (5) the transition operator of the system has the spectrum gap property on the space of Hoelder continuous functions with some exponent. Note that none of (1)--(5) can hold for any deterministic iteration dynamical system of a single complex generalized H\'{e}non map. We observe many new phenomena in random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms of $\Bbb{C}^{2}$ and observe the mechanisms. We provide new strategies and methods to study higher-dimensional random holomorphic dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01666v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article establishes cutoff convergence or abrupt convergence of three statistical quantities for multivariate (Hurwitz) stable geometric Brownian motion: the autocorrelation function, the Wasserstein distance between the current state and its degenerate limiting measure, and, finally, anti-concentration probabilities, which yield a fine-tuned trade-off between almost sure rates and the respective integrability of the random modulus of convergence using a quantitative Borel--Cantelli Lemma. We obtain in case of simultaneous diagonalizable drift and volatility matrices a complete representation of the mean square and derive nontrivial, sufficient and necessary mean square stability conditions, which include all real and imaginary parts of the volatility matrices' spectra.</description>

      <title>The prime number theorem over integers of power-free polynomial values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f(x)\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree $d\ge 1$. Let $k\ge2$ be an integer. The number of integers $n$ such that $f(n)$ is $k$-free is widely studied in the literature. In principle, one expects that $f(n)$ is $k$-free infinitely often, if $f$ has no fixed $k$-th power divisor. In 2022, Bergelson and Richter established a new dynamical generalization of the prime number theorem (PNT). Inspired by their work, one may expect that this generalization of the PNT also holds over integers of power-free polynomial values. In this note, we establish such variant of Bergelson and Richter's theorem for several polynomials studied by Estermann, Hooley, Heath-Brown, Booker and Browning.</description>
