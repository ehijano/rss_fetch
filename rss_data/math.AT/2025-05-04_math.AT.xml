      <title>Cellularity of Chromatic Synthetic Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $\infty$-category of synthetic spectra based on Morava E-theory is generated by the bigraded spheres and identify it with the $\infty$-category of modules over a filtered ring spectrum. The latter we show using a general method for constructing filtered deformations from t-structures on symmetric monoidal stable $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>The Morse complex is an $\infty$-functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide two versions of the statement in the title. First, when the source is the category of smooth manifolds, we construct a simplicial map to a weak Kan complex whose objects are A-infinity coalgebras. Second, when the source is the category of compact Lie groups (or more generally, compact Lie monoids), the target is a weak Kan complex whose objects consist in $f$-bialgebras, as defined in [CHM24]. We also establish a statement describing module structures induced by group actions, as conjectured in [CHM24].</description>

      <title>Lie structures in homotopy and isotopy calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish compatibility of Lie structures that appear in homotopy calculus of functors and isotopy calculus of embeddings. On one hand, we give a new proof of the Johnson--Arone--Mahowald result describing the layers of the Goodwillie tower of the identity functor, and we directly compare the spectral Lie bracket with the classical Whitehead bracket on spaces. On the other hand, we geometrically define a bracket on the layers of the embedding calculus tower for embeddings of arcs. These results are unified through the same technical tool, a newly defined bracket on total homotopy fibres of collapsing cubes of wedge sums.</description>

      <title>Gray products of diagrammatic $(\infty, n)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each $n \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$, diagrammatic sets admit a model structure whose fibrant objects are the diagrammatic $(\infty, n)$- categories. They also support a notion of Gray product given by the Day convolution of a monoidal structure on their base category. The goal of this article is to show that the model structures are monoidal with respect to the Gray product. On the way to the result, we also prove that the Gray product of any cell and an equivalence is again an equivalence. Finally, we show that tensoring on the left or the right with the walking equivalence is a functorial cylinder for the model structures, and that the functor sending a diagrammatic set to its opposite is a Quillen self-equivalence.</description>

      <title>Dynamical System Parameter Path Optimization using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems are complex and typically only simple systems can be analytically studied. In applications, these systems are usually defined with a set of tunable parameters and as the parameters are varied the system response undergoes significant topological changes or bifurcations. In a high dimensional parameter space, it is difficult to determine which direction to vary the system parameters to achieve a desired system response or state. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for optimally navigating a dynamical system parameter space that is rooted in topological data analysis. Specifically we use the differentiability of persistence diagrams to define a topological language for intuitively promoting or deterring different topological features in the state space response of a dynamical system and use gradient descent to optimally move from one point in the parameter space to another. The end result is a path in this space that guides the system to a set of parameters that yield the desired topological features defined by the loss function. We show a number of examples by applying the methods to different dynamical systems and scenarios to demonstrate how to promote different features and how to choose the hyperparameters to achieve different outcomes.</description>

      <title>Extended Persistent Homology Distinguishes Simple and Complex Contagions with High Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The social contagion literature makes a distinction between simple (independent cascade or bond percolation processes that pass infections through edges) and complex contagions (bootstrap percolation or threshold processes that require local reinforcement to spread). However, distinguishing simple and complex contagions using observational data poses a significant challenge in practice. Estimating population-level activation functions from observed contagion dynamics is hindered by confounding factors that influence adoptions (other than neighborhood interactions), as well as heterogeneity in individual behaviors and modeling variations that make it difficult to design appropriate null models for inferring contagion types. Here, we show that a new tool from topological data analysis (TDA), called extended persistent homology (EPH), when applied to contagion processes over networks, can effectively detect simple and complex contagion processes, as well as predict their parameters. We train classification and regression models using EPH-based topological summaries computed on simulated simple and complex contagion dynamics on three real-world network datasets and obtain high predictive performance over a wide range of contagion parameters and under a variety of informational constraints, including uncertainty in model parameters, noise, and partial observability of contagion dynamics. EPH captures the role of cycles of varying lengths in the observed contagion dynamics and offers a useful metric to classify contagion models and predict their parameters. Analyzing geometrical features of network contagion using TDA tools such as EPH can find applications in other network problems such as seeding, vaccination, and quarantine optimization, as well as network inference and reconstruction problems.</description>
