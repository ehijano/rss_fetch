      <title>Exact Analytical Solutions of the Dunkl-Schr\"odinger Equation for the Deng-Fan Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present exact analytical solutions for the radial Dunkl-Schr\"odinger equation (DSE) confined by the Deng-Fan molecular potential. By employing the Pekeris approximation to resolve the centrifugal singularity and applying the parametric Nikiforov-Uvarov method, we derive closed-form expressions for the energy eigenspectrum and the corresponding radial wavefunctions expressed in terms of Jacobi polynomials. Our investigation reveals that the Dunkl reflection parameter $\mu$ fundamentally alters the system's topology by breaking spatial symmetry and introducing a parity-dependent repulsive force. Numerical analysis demonstrates a monotonic increase in energy eigenvalues with increasing $\mu$, confirming an effective "hard core" behavior at the origin. The results are shown to be consistent with standard quantum mechanics in the limit $\mu \to 0$. This study establishes the Dunkl formalism as a robust tool for modeling quantum systems characterized by parity-dependent exclusion effects and strong short-range correlations.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic mean curvature flow computed by physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the evolution of plane curves and surfaces governed by the hyperbolic mean curvature flow. We propose a mesh-free approach based on the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which eliminates the need for discretization and meshing of computational domains, and is efficient in solving partial differential equations involving high dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the numerical analysis by employing the PINNs for the hyperbolic geometric evolution equations in the literature. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through several numerical simulations by selecting diverse initial curves and surfaces, as well as both constant and non-constant initial velocities.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue degeneracy in sparse random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In random matrices with independent and continuous matrix entries, the degeneracy probability of the eigenvalues is known to be zero. In this paper, random matrices including discontinuous matrix entries are analyzed in order to observe how degeneracy is generated. Using Erd\"os-R\'enyi matching probability theory of random bipartite graphs, we asymptotically evaluate the degeneracy probability of such random matrices. As a result, due to accumulation of the eigenvalues to the origin, a positive degeneracy probability is found for eigenvalues of a sparse random matrix model.</description>

      <title>Degeneration limits of Virasoro vertex operators and Painlev\'e tau functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct degeneration limits of vertex operators for the Virasoro algebra. Our method relies on the rearranged expansion of compositions of vertex operators together with their integral representations. Using this framework, we obtain a vertex operator between Verma modules of rank $r+1$ as a degeneration of a composition of two vertex operators between Verma modules of rank $r$ ($r\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$). Furthermore, we apply these degeneration limits to prove the conjectural expansions of the $\tau$ functions of the fifth and fourth Painlev\'e equations in terms of irregular conformal blocks [H. Nagoya, J. Math. Phys. 56, 123505 (2015)].</description>

      <title>Fredholm Theory on Twisted Hilbert Scales: A Frame-Theoretic Approach to Half-Integer Fourier Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a Hilbert scale on $L^2([0,1])$ via a unitary twist operator that maps the standard Fourier basis to half-integer frequency exponentials. The resulting weighted spaces, equipped with norms indexed by $(1+|k+\tfrac{1}{2}|^2)^s$, admit a canonical diagonal operator with the compact resolvent and spectrum $\{k+\tfrac{1}{2}\}_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}$. We prove that this operator defines a Fredholm mapping between adjacent scale levels with index zero, provide an explicit solution to an antiperiodic boundary value problem illustrating the framework, and compute the zeta-regularized determinant $\det_\zeta(|\widetilde{A}|) = 2$ using the Hurwitz zeta function. We establish stability under bounded perturbations and verify the well-definedness of spectral flow. The framework is developed entirely through functional-analytic methods without differential operators or boundary value problems. The construction is motivated by twisted spinor boundary conditions on non-orientable manifolds, though the present work is formulated abstractly in operator-theoretic language.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory for Markov chains with transition matrix admitting a stochastic bidiagonal factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently established spectral Favard theorem for bounded banded matrices admitting a positive bidiagonal factorization is applied to a broader class of Markov chains with bounded banded transition matrices, extending beyond the classical birth-and-death setting, to those that allow a positive stochastic bidiagonal factorization. In the finite case, the Karlin-McGregor spectral representation is derived. The recurrence of the Markov chain is established, and explicit formulas for the stationary distributions are provided in terms of orthogonal polynomials. Analogous results are obtained for the countably infinite case. In this setting, the chain is not necessarily recurrent, and its behavior is characterized in terms of the associated spectral measure. Finally, ergodicity is examined through the presence of a mass at $1$ in the spectral measure, corresponding to the eigenvalue $1$ with both right and left eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>The Hilbert-Schmidt norms of quantum channels and matrix integrals over the unit sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems are generally described by a family of quantum channels (linear, completely positive and trace preserving maps). In this note, we mainly study the range of all possible values of $\|\mathcal{E}\|_2^2+\|\widetilde{\mathcal{E}}\|_2^2$ for quantum channels $\mathcal{E}$ and give the equivalent characterizations for quantum channels that achieve these maximum and minimum values, respectively, where $\|\mathcal{E}\|_2$ is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of $\mathcal{E}$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{E}}$ is a complementary channel of $\mathcal{E}.$ Also, we get a concrete description of completely positive maps on infinite dimensional systems preserving pure states. Moreover, the equivalency of several matrix integrals over the unit sphere is demonstrated and some extensions of these matrix integrals are obtained.</description>

      <title>A model order reduction based adaptive parareal method for time-dependent partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a model order reduction based adaptive parareal method for time-dependent partial differential equations. By using the data obtained by the fine propagator in each iteration of the plain parareal method together with some model order reduction technique, we construct the coarse propagator adaptively in each parareal iteration, and then obtain our adaptive parareal method. We apply this new method to solve some 3D time-dependent advection-diffusion equations with the Kolmogorov flow and the ABC flow. Numerical results show the good performance of our method in simulating long-term evolution problems.</description>

      <title>Positive Genus Pairs from Amplituhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A main conjecture in the field of Positive Geometry states that amplituhedra are positive geometries. It is motivated by examples showing that the canonical forms of certain amplituhedra compute scattering amplitudes in particle physics. In recent work, Brown and Dupont introduced a new framework, based on mixed Hodge theory, connecting canonical forms and de Rham cohomology. In this paper, we show that this framework is consistent with the known results for amplituhedra but does not apply beyond those families. We provide an explicit example showing that the central assumption of the Brown-Dupont framework (namely to have a pair of genus zero) is not a necessary condition to be a positive geometry in the original sense of Arkani-Hamed, Bai, and Lam. This underscores the fact that our results do not immediately disqualify the amplituhedron from being a positive geometry.</description>

      <title>Study on Light Propagation through Space-Time Random Media via Stochastic Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, the theory of stochastic partial differential equations is applied to the propagation of light fields in space-time random media. By modeling the fluctuation of refractive index's square of the media as a random field, we demonstrate that the hyperbolic Anderson model is applicable to describing the propagation of light fields in such media. Additionally, several new quantitative characterizations of the stochastic properties that govern the light fields are derived. Furthermore, the validity of the theoretical framework and corresponding results is experimentally verified by analyzing the statistical properties of the propagated light fields after determining the spatial and temporal stochastic features of the random media. The results presented here provide a more accurate theoretical basis for better understanding random phenomena in emerging domains such as free-space optical communication, detection, and imaging in transparent random media. The study could also have practical guiding significance for experimental system design in these fields.</description>

Abstract: Let $F$ be a Parseval frame in a Hilbert space
  and let $E$ be a set of real numbers. From these data, we construct an operator $H_{E,e}$ and a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) $F_{E,e}$. This paper investigates in detail the relationship between the operator $H_{E, e}$ and the POVM $F_{E,e}$. Our results extend the classical correspondence between a self-adjoint operator generated by an orthonormal basis and its associated projection-valued (spectral) measure.</description>

      <title>Elastic Calder\'on Problem via Resonant Hard Inclusions: Linearisation of the N-D Map and Density Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an elastic Calderon-type inverse problem: recover the mass density $\rho(x)$ in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ from the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map associated with the isotropic Lam\'e system $\mathcal{L}_{\lambda,\mu}u+\omega^2\rho(x)u=0$. We introduce a constructive strategy that embeds a subwavelength periodic array of resonant high-density (hard) inclusions to create an effective medium with a uniform negative density shift. Specifically, we place a periodic cluster of inclusions of size $a$ and density $\rho_1\asymp a^{-2}$ strictly inside $\Omega$. For frequencies $\omega$ tuned to an eigenvalue of the elastic Newton (Kelvin) operator of a single inclusion, we show that as $a\to0$ and the number of inclusions $M\to\infty$, the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map $\Lambda_D$ converges to an effective map $\Lambda_{\mathcal{P}}$ corresponding to a background density shift $-\mathcal{P}^2$, with the operator norm estimate $\|\Lambda_D-\Lambda_{\mathcal{P}}\|\le Ca^{\alpha}\mathcal{P}^6$ for some $\alpha&gt;0$ determined by the geometric scaling. Around this negative background we derive a first-order linearization of $\Lambda_{\mathcal{P}}$ in terms of $\rho$ and the Newton volume potential for the shifted Lam\'e operator. Testing the linearized relation with complex geometric optics solutions yields an explicit reconstruction formula for the Fourier transform of $\rho$, and hence a global density recovery scheme. The results provide a metamaterial-inspired analytic framework for inverse coefficient problems in linear elasticity and a concrete paradigm for leveraging nanoscale resonators in reconstruction algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an algebraic description of the Page transition, a key feature in black hole evaporation where the entropy of Hawking radiation follows a unitary Page curve instead of monotonically increasing. By applying concepts from approximate quantum error correction with complementary recovery, we characterize the Page transition as a phase transition in channel recovery. We then generalize the description to infinite-dimensional settings using algebraic relative entropy, which remains valid even in type III factors. For type I/II factors, explicit probes based on relative entropy differences are derived, serving as indicators for the transition at the Page time.</description>

      <title>No quantum solutions to linear constraint systems from monomial measurement-based quantum computation in odd prime dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the study of resources in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) with that of quantum solutions to linear constraint systems (LCS). Contextuality of the input state in MBQC has been identified as a key resource for quantum advantage, and in a stronger form, underlies algebraic relations between (measurement) operators which obey classically unsatisfiable (linear) constraints. Here, we compare these two perspectives on contextuality, and study to what extent they are related. More precisely, we associate a LCS to certain MBQC which exhibit strong forms of state-dependent contextuality, and ask if the measurement operators in such MBQC give rise to state-independent contextuality in the form of quantum solutions of its associated LCS. Our main result rules out such quantum solutions for a large class of MBQC. This both sharpens the distinction between state-dependent and state-independent forms of contextuality, and further generalises results on the non-existence of quantum solutions to LCS in finite odd (prime) dimension.</description>

      <title>Differential geometry of particle motion in Stokesian regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a differential geometric framework for the motion of a non-Brownian particle in the presence of fixed obstacles in a quiescent fluid, in the deterministic Stokesian regime. While the Helmholtz Minimum Dissipation Theorem suggests that the hydrodynamic resistance tensor $R_{ij}$ acts as the natural Riemannian metric of the fluid domain, we demonstrate that particle trajectories driven by constant external forces are \emph{not} geodesics of this pure resistance metric. Instead, they experience a geometric drift perpendicular to the geodesic path due to the manifold's curvature. To reconcile this, we introduce a unified geometric formalism, proving that physical trajectories are geodesics of a conformally scaled metric, $\tilde{g}_{ij} = \mathcal{D}(\mathbf{x})R_{ij}$, where $\mathcal{D}$ is the local power dissipation. This framework establishes that the affine parameter along the trajectory corresponds to the cumulative energy dissipated. We apply this theory to the scattering of a spherical particle by a fixed obstacle, showing that the previously derived trajectory of the particle is recovered as a direct consequence of the curvature of this dissipation-scaled manifold.</description>

      <title>Wigner picture of partially coherent accelerating beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advance a phase-space theory of partially coherent accelerating, non-diffracting beams employing the Wigner distribution function (WDF). We derive a general expression for the WDF of any accelerating, diffraction-free beam of arbitrary degree of spatial coherence and find an elegant closed-form expression for the WDF of such beam with a Gaussian energy spectrum of noise. We also show how partially coherent accelerating beams of finite power can be constructed within the Wigner picture.</description>

      <title>Frame eversion and contextual geometric rigidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove rigidity results describing contextually-constrained maps defined on Grassmannians and manifolds of ordered independent line tuples in finite-dimensional vector or Hilbert spaces. One statement in the spirit of the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry classifies maps between full Grassmannians of two $n$-dimensional Hilbert spaces, $n\ge 3$, preserving dimension and lattice operations for pairs with commuting orthogonal projections, as precisely those induced by semilinear injections unique up to scaling.
  In a different but related direction, denote the manifolds of ordered orthogonal (linearly-independent) $n$-tuples of lines in an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space $V$ by $\mathbb{F}^{\perp}(V)$ (respectively $\mathbb{F}(V)$) and, for partitions $\pi$ of the set $\{1..n\}$, call two tuples $\pi$-linked if the spans along $\pi$-blocks agree. A Wigner-style rigidity theorem proves that the symmetric maps $\mathbb{F}^{\perp}(\mathbb{C}^n)\to \mathbb{F}(\mathbb{C}^n)$, $n\ge 3$ respecting $\pi$-linkage are precisely those induced by semilinear injections, hence by linear or conjugate-linear maps if also assumed measurable. On the other hand, in the $\mathbb{F}(\mathbb{C}^n)$-defined analogue the only other possibility is a qualitatively new type of purely-contextual-global symmetry transforming a tuple $(\ell_i)_i$ of lines into $\left(\left(\bigoplus_{j\ne i}\ell_j\right)^{\perp}\right)_i$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of the ground state energy of a Fermionic Fr\"ohlich multipolaron in the strong coupling limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:1601.05272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the ground state energy of the Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian for a fermionic multipolaron in the strong coupling limit. We prove that it is given, to leading order, by the ground state energy of the Pekar-Tomasevich functional with fermionic statistics, a much simpler model. Our analysis builds upon \cite{wellig}, which itself used and generalized methods developed in \cite{liebthomas}, \cite{frank-lieb-seiringer-thomas-stability-absence} and \cite{griesemer-wellig-strong-polaron-static-fields}. Our main new contribution is two-fold. First, we take into account the fermionic statistics of the multipolaron, by employing a localization method used in \cite{liebloss}. Second, we relax an assumption on the external electric and magnetic fields, which is not easily verifiable, unless the fields are periodic. Instead, we allow for general fields that only ensure self-adjointness of the Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: We construct a thermodynamic limit for the grand canonical Bose gas in dimension $d\geqslant1$ (in its Feynman-Kac representation) with superstable interaction at any inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and any chemical potential $\mu\in\mathbb{R}$. Our infinite volume model is naturally a distribution over configurations of finite loops and possibly interlacements. We prove the limiting process to solve a new class of DLR equations involving random permutations and Brownian paths.</description>

      <title>The 3d mixed BF Lagrangian 1-form: a variational formulation of Hitchin's integrable system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of gauged Lagrangian $1$-forms, extending the notion of Lagrangian $1$-forms to the setting of gauge theories. This general formalism is applied to a natural geometric Lagrangian $1$-form on the cotangent bundle of the space of holomorphic structures on a smooth principal $G$-bundle $\mathcal{P}$ over a compact Riemann surface $C$ of arbitrary genus $g$, with or without marked points, in order to gauge the symmetry group of smooth bundle automorphisms of $\mathcal{P}$. The resulting construction yields a multiform version of the $3$d mixed BF action with so-called type A and B defects, providing a variational formulation of Hitchin's completely integrable system over $C$. By passing to holomorphic local trivialisations and going partially on-shell, we obtain a unifying action for a hierarchy of Lax equations describing the Hitchin system in terms of meromorphic Lax matrices. The cases of genus $0$ and $1$ with marked points are treated in greater detail, producing explicit Lagrangian $1$-forms for the rational Gaudin hierarchy and the elliptic Gaudin hierarchy, respectively, with the elliptic spin Calogero-Moser hierarchy arising as a special subcase.</description>

Abstract: We prove existence and finite degeneracy of ground states of energy forms satisfying logarithmic Sobolev inequalities with respect to non vacuum states of Clifford algebras. We then derive the stability of the ground state with respect to certain unbounded perturbations of the energy form. Finally, we show how this provides an infinitesimal approach to existence and uniqueness of the ground state of Hamiltonians considered by L.

      <description>arXiv:2306.13936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider spread-out models of the self-avoiding walk and its finite-memory version, known as the memory-$\tau$ walk, which prohibits loops whose length is at most $\tau$, in dimensions $d&gt;4$. The critical point is defined as the radius of convergence of the generating function for each model. It is known that the critical point of the memory-$\tau$ walk is non-decreasing in $\tau$ and converges to that of the self-avoiding walk as $\tau$ tends to infinity. In this paper, we study the rate at which the critical point of the memory-$\tau$ walk converges to that of the self-avoiding walk and show that the order is $\tau^{-(d-2)/2}$. The proof relies on the lace expansion, introduced by Brydges and Spencer.</description>

      <title>A radial scalar product for Kerr quasinormal modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17678v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A scalar product for quasinormal mode solutions to Teukolsky's homogeneous radial equation is presented. Evaluation of this scalar product can be performed either by direct integration, or by evaluation of a confluent hypergeometric functions. The related scalar product will be useful for better understanding analytic solutions to Teukolsky's radial equation, particularly the quasi-normal modes, their potential spatial completeness, and whether the quasi-normal mode overtone excitations may be estimated by spectral decomposition, rather than fitting. With that motivation, the scalar product is applied to confluent Heun polynomials where it is used to derive their peculiar orthogonality and eigenvalue properties. A potentially new relationship is derived between the confluent Heun polynomials' scalar products and eigenvalues. Using these results, it is shown for the first time that Teukolsky's radial equation (and perhaps similar confluent Heun equations) are, in principle, exactly tri-diagonalizable. To this end, "canonical" confluent Heun polynomials are conjectured.</description>

      <title>Natural polynomials for Kerr quasi-normal modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a polynomial basis that exactly tridiagonalizes Teukolsky's radial equation for quasi-normal modes. These polynomials naturally emerge from the radial problem, and they are canonical in that they possess key features of classical polynomials. Our canonical polynomials may be constructed using various methods, the simplest of which is the Gram-Schmidt process. In contrast with other polynomial bases, our polynomials allow for Teukolsky's radial equation to be represented as a simple matrix eigenvalue equation. We expect that our polynomials will be useful for better understanding the Kerr quasinormal modes' properties, particularly their prospective spatial completeness and orthogonality. We show that our polynomials are closely related to the confluent Heun and Pollaczek-Jacobi type polynomials. Consequently, our construction of polynomials may be used to tridiagonalize other instances of the confluent Heun equation. We apply our polynomials to a series of simple examples, including: (1) the high accuracy numerical computation of radial eigenvalues, (2) the evaluation and validation of quasinormal mode solutions to Teukolsky's radial equation, and (3) the use of Schwarzschild radial functions to represent those of Kerr. Along the way, a potentially new concept, polynomial/non-polynomial duality, is encountered and applied to show that some quasinormal mode separation constants are well approximated by confluent Heun polynomial eigenvalues. We briefly discuss the implications of our results on various topics, including the prospective spatial completeness of Kerr quasinormal modes.</description>

      <title>Low-Regularity Solutions of the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation on the Spatial Quarter-Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hadamard well-posedness of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with power nonlinearity formulated on the spatial quarter-plane is established in a low-regularity setting with Sobolev initial data and Dirichlet boundary data in appropriate Bourgain-type spaces. As both of the spatial variables are restricted to the half-line, a different approach is needed than the one previously used for the well-posedness of other initial-boundary value problems. In particular, now the solution of the forced linear initial-boundary problem is estimated \textit{directly}, both in Sobolev spaces and in Strichartz-type spaces, i.e. without a linear decomposition that would require estimates for the associated homogeneous and nonhomogeneous initial value problems. In the process of deriving the linear estimates, the function spaces for the boundary data are identified as the intersections of certain modified Bourgain-type spaces that involve spatial half-line Fourier transforms instead of the usual whole-line Fourier transform found in the definition of the standard Bourgain space associated with the one-dimensional initial value problem. The fact that the quarter-plane has a corner at the origin poses an additional challenge, as it requires one to expand the validity of certain Sobolev extension results to the case of a domain with a non-smooth (Lipschitz) and non-compact boundary.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the higher-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a finite interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the local Hadamard well-posedness of a certain third-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a multi-term linear part and a general power nonlinearity known as the higher-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, formulated on a finite interval with a combination of nonzero Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Specifically, for initial and boundary data in suitable Sobolev spaces that are related to one another through the time regularity induced by the equation, we prove the existence of a unique solution as well as the continuous dependence of that solution on the data. The precise choice of solution space depends on the value of the Sobolev exponent and is dictated both by the linear estimates associated with the forced linear counterpart of the nonlinear initial-boundary value problem and, in the low-regularity setting below the Sobolev algebra property threshold, by certain nonlinear estimates that control the Sobolev norm of the power nonlinearity. In particular, as usual in Schr\"odinger-type equations, in the case of low regularity it is necessary to derive Strichartz estimates in suitable Lebesgue/Bessel potential spaces. The proof of well-posedness is based on a contraction mapping argument combined with the linear estimates, which are established by employing the explicit solution formula for the forced linear problem derived via the unified transform of Fokas. Due to the nature of the finite interval problem, this formula involves contour integrals in the complex Fourier plane with corresponding integrands that contain differences of exponentials in their denominators, thus requiring delicate handling through appropriate contour deformations. It is worth noting that, in addition to the various linear and nonlinear results obtained for the finite interval problem, novel time regularity results are established here also for the relevant half-line problem.</description>

      <title>Symmetry topological field theory and non-abelian Kramers-Wannier dualities of generalised Ising models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a class of two-dimensional Euclidean lattice field theories admitting topological lines encoded into a spherical fusion category, we explore aspects of their realisations as boundary theories of a three-dimensional topological quantum field theory. After providing a general framework for explicitly constructing such realisations, we specialise to non-abelian generalisations of the Ising model and consider two operations: gauging an arbitrary subsymmetry and performing Fourier transforms of the local weights encoding the dynamics of the theory. These are carried out both in a traditional way and in terms of the three-dimensional topological quantum field theory. Whenever the whole symmetry is gauged, combining both operations recovers the non-abelian Kramers-Wannier duals \`a la Freed and Teleman of the generalised Ising models. Moreover, we discuss the interplay between renormalisation group fixed points of gapped symmetric phases and these generalised Kramers-Wannier dualities.</description>

Abstract: The Critical $2d$ Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF) is a measure valued stochastic process on $\mathbb{R}^2$ that defines a non-trivial solution to the two-dimensional stochastic heat equation with multiplicative space-time noise. Its one-time marginals are a.s. singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure, meaning that the mass they assign to shrinking balls decays to zero faster than their Lebesgue volume. In this work we explore the intermittency properties of the Critical 2d SHF by studying the asymptotics of the $h$-th moment of the mass that it assigns to shrinking balls of radius $\epsilon$ and we determine that its ratio to the Lebesgue volume is of order $(\log\tfrac{1}{\epsilon})^{{h\choose 2}}$ up to possible lower order corrections.</description>

      <title>Planar Novikov-Shubin invariant for adjacency matrices of structured directed dense random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Novikov-Shubin invariant associated to a graph provides information about the accumulation of eigenvalues of the corresponding adjacency matrix close to the origin. For a directed graph these eigenvalues lie in the complex plane and having a finite value for the planar Novikov-Shubin invariant indicates a polynomial behaviour of the eigenvalue density as a function of the distance to zero. We provide a complete description of these invariants for dense random digraphs with constant batch sizes, i.e. for the directed stochastic block model. The invariants depend only on which batches in the graph are connected by non-zero edge densities. We present an explicit finite step algorithm for their computation. For the proof we identify the asymptotic spectral density with the distribution of a $\mathbb{C}^K$-valued circular element in operator-valued free probability theory. We determine the spectral density in the bulk regime by solving the associated Dyson equation and infer the singular behaviour of this density close to the origin by determining the exponents associated to the power law with which the resolvent entries of the adjacency matrix that corresponds to the individual batches diverge to infinity or converge to zero.</description>

Abstract: Real abstract Wiener spaces (AWS) were originally defined by Gross using measurable norms, as a generalisation of the theory of advanced integral calculus in infinite dimensions as introduced by Cameron and Martin. In this paper we present a rigorous, complete and self-contained general framework for $\mathbb{K}$-AWS, where $\mathbb{K} \in \{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}$ using the language of characteristic functions instead of measurable norms. In particular, we will prove that $X$ is a centred resp. proper $H$-valued Gaussian field over $\mathbb{K}$ iff the covariance function can be written in terms of some non-negative, self-adjoint trace class operator, and that the existence and uniqueness of $X$ is equivalent to the $\mathbb{K}$-AWS. Finally we will relate the $\mathbb{C}$-AWS to the $\mathbb{R}$-AWS by way of a real structure, which is a real linear, complex anti-linear involution on a complex vector space. This allows for a commutative relation between the real and complex Gaussian fields and the real and complex abstract Wiener spaces. We will construct specific examples which fall under this framework like the complex Brownian motion, complex Feynman-Kac formula and complex fractional Gaussian fields.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$ manifolds for any $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <title>On Integrable Structure of Null String in (Anti-)de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Presently integrability turned out to be the key property in the study of duality between superconformal gauge theories and strings in anti-de Sitter superspaces. Complexity of the study of integrable structure in string theory is caused by complicated dependence of background fields of the Type II supergravity multiplets, with which strings interact, on the superspace coordinates. This explains an interest to study of limiting cases, in which superstring equations simplify. In the present work, we considered the limiting case of zero tension corresponding to null string. The representation in the form of the Lax equation of null-string equations in (anti-)de Sitter space realized as a coset manifold is obtained. Proposed is twistor interpretation of the Lagrangian of (null) string in anti-de Sitter space expressed in terms of group variables.</description>

      <title>Scalar-tensor theories in the Lyra geometry: Invariance under local transformations of length units and the Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lyra geometry provides an interesting approach to develop purely geometrical scalar-tensor theories. Here we present a theory on Lyra manifolds which contains generalizations of both Brans-Dicke gravity and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory. It is shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry comprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of length units, so that the Lyra function is a conformal factor which locally fixes the unit of length. The Lyra geometry is thus a generalization of Riemannian geometry which includes spacetime-dependent length units. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in which the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity (GR) is obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same procedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from their Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the Mach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is controlled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known scalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular Lyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls the unit of length. The Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum is also assessed from the perspective of Lyra transformations, it is shown that the Lyra geometry makes explicit that the two frames are only different representations of the same theory, so that in the Einstein frame the unit of length varies locally. The Lyra formalism is then shown to be better suited for exploring scalar-tensor gravity, since in its well-defined structure the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor and geodesic motion are assured in the Einstein frame.</description>

      <title>Transversal Clifford-Hierarchy Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an entirely 2D transversal realization of phase gates at any level of the Clifford hierarchy, and beyond, using non-Abelian surface codes. Our construction encodes a logical qubit in the quantum double $D(G)$ of a non-Abelian group $G$ on a triangular spatial patch. The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--K\"onig theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this limitation, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \mathrm{diag}(1, e^{i\pi/(4N)})$ in the logical $\overline{Z}$ basis. In this context we propose a non-abelian stabilizer group formalism, which we work out for dihedral groups. For $8N = 2^n$, the logical gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice. We also discuss code-switching to the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface-codes, which can be utilized for the quantum error correction in this setup.</description>

      <title>Phase-Textured Complex Viscosity in Linear Viscous Flows: Non-Normality Without Advection, Corner Defects, and 3D Mode Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider time-harmonic incompressible flow with a spatially resolved complex viscosity field $\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)$ and, at fixed forcing frequency $\omega&gt;0$, its constitutive phase texture $\varphi(\mathbf{x})=\arg\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)$. In three-dimensional domains periodic in a spanwise direction $z$, $z$-dependence of $\mu^*$ converts coefficient multiplication into convolution in spanwise Fourier index, yielding an operator-valued Toeplitz/Laurent coupling of modes. Consequently, even spanwise-uniform forcing generically produces $\kappa\neq 0$ sidebands in the harmonic response as a \emph{linear, constitutive} effect.
  We place $\mu^*$ at the closure level $\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}=2\,\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)\mathbf{D}(\hat{\mathbf{v}})$, as the boundary value of the Laplace transform of a causal stress-memory kernel. Under the passivity condition $\Re\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)\ge \mu_{\min}&gt;0$, the oscillatory Stokes/Oseen operators are realized as m-sectorial operators associated with coercive sectorial forms on bounded Lipschitz (including cornered) domains, yielding existence, uniqueness, and frequency-dependent stability bounds.
  Spatial variation of $\varphi$ renders the viscous operator intrinsically non-normal even in the absence of advection, so amplification is governed by resolvent geometry (and associated pseudospectra), not by eigenvalues alone. In the pure-phase class $\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)=\mu_0(\omega)e^{i\varphi(\mathbf{x})}$, the texture strength is quantified by $\mu_0(\omega)\|\nabla\varphi\|_{L^\infty}$.</description>
