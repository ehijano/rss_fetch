      <title>Number of Edges in 3-Connected Graphs with Cyclic Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chernyshev, Rauch and Rautenbach [Discrete Math., 2025] introduce forest cuts, i.e., vertex separators that induce a forest. They conjecture that, similar to a result by Chen and Yu [Discrete Math., 2002], every $n$-vertex graph with less than $3n-6$ edges has a forest cut. As an intermediate goal they ask how many edges an $n$-vertex $3$-connected graph must have such that the neighborhood of every vertex contains a cycle. Li, Tang and Zhan [arXiv, 2024] resolve this problem by showing that every such graph has at least $15n/8$ edges, while there are examples of such graphs with exactly $15n/8$ edges. We give a much shorter proof for this.</description>

      <title>Effective Resistance in Simplicial Complexes as Bilinear Forms: Generalizations and Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of effective resistance, originally introduced in electrical circuit theory, has been extended to the setting of graphs by interpreting each edge as a resistor. In this context, the effective resistance between two vertices quantifies the total opposition to current flow when a unit current is injected at one vertex and extracted at the other. Beyond its physical interpretation, the effective resistance encodes rich structural and geometric information about the underlying graph: it defines a metric on the vertex set, relates to the topology of the graph through Foster's theorem, and determines the probability of an edge appearing in a random spanning tree. Generalizations of effective resistance to simplicial complexes have been proposed in several forms, often formulated as matrix products of standard operators associated with the complex.
  In this paper, we present a twofold generalization of the effective resistance. First, we introduce a novel, basis-independent bilinear form, derived from an algebraic reinterpretation of circuit theory, that extends the classical effective resistance from graphs. Second, we extend this bilinear form to simplices, chains, and cochains within simplicial complexes. This framework subsumes and unifies all existing matrix-based formulations of effective resistance. Moreover, we establish higher-order analogues of several fundamental properties known in the graph case: (i) we prove that effective resistance induces a pseudometric on the space of chains and a metric on the space of cycles, and (ii) we provide a generalization of Foster's Theorem to simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Support Recovery in One-bit Compressed Sensing with Near-Optimal Measurements and Sublinear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of support recovery in one-bit compressed sensing (1bCS) aim to recover the support of a signal $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$, denoted as supp$(x)$, from the observation $y=\text{sign}(Ax)$, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is a sensing matrix and $|\text{supp}(x)|\leq k, k \ll n$. Under this setting, most preexisting works have a recovery runtime $\Omega(n)$. In this paper, we propose two schemes that have sublinear $o(n)$ runtime. (1.i): For the universal exact support recovery, a scheme of $m=O(k^2\log(n/k)\log n)$ measurements and runtime $D=O(km)$. (1.ii): For the universal $\epsilon$-approximate support recovery, the same scheme with $m=O(k\epsilon^{-1}\log(n/k)\log n)$ and runtime $D=O(\epsilon^{-1}m)$, improving the runtime significantly with an extra $O(\log n)$ factor in the number of measurements compared to the current optimal (Matsumoto et al., 2023). (2): For the probabilistic exact support recovery in the sublinear regime, a scheme of $m:=O(k\frac{\log k}{\log\log k}\log n)$ measurements and runtime $O(m)$, with vanishing error probability, improving the recent result of Yang et al., 2025.</description>

      <title>Subexponential upper bound on the number of rich words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R(n)$ denote the number of rich words of length $n$ over a given finite alphabet. In 2017 it was proved that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \sqrt[n]{R(n)}=1$; it means the number of rich words has a subexponential growth. However, up to now, no subexponential upper bound on $R(n)$ has been presented. The current paper fills this gap. Let $\frac{1}{2}&lt;\lambda&lt;1$ and $\gamma&gt;1$ be real constants, let $q$ be the size of the alphabet, and let $\phi$ be a positive function with $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\phi(n)=\infty$ and $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{n}{\phi(n)}=\infty$. Let $\ln^*(x)$ denote the iterated logarithm of $x&gt;0$. We prove that there are $n_0$ and $c&gt;0$ such that if $n&gt;n_0$, \[f(n)=\sqrt[\gamma]{c\ln^*{(\frac{n}{\phi(n)}}\ln{q})}\quad\mbox{ and }\quad B(n)=q^{\frac{n}{\phi(n)}+\frac{n}{(2\lambda)^{f(n)-1}}}\mbox{}\] then $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sqrt[n]{B(n)}=1$ and $R(n)\leq B(n)$.</description>
