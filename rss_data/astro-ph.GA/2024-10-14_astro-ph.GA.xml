      <title>CAVITY: Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY. I. First public data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY) is a legacy project aimed at characterising the population of galaxies inhabiting voids, which are the most under-dense regions of the cosmic web, located in the Local Universe. This paper describes the first public data release (DR1) of CAVITY, comprising science-grade optical data cubes for the initial 100 out of a total of $\sim$300 galaxies in the Local Universe ($0.005 &lt; z &lt; 0.050$). These data were acquired using the integral-field spectrograph PMAS/PPak mounted on the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto observatory. The DR1 galaxy sample encompasses diverse characteristics in the color-magnitude space, morphological type, stellar mass, and gas ionisation conditions, providing a rich resource for addressing key questions in galaxy evolution through spatially resolved spectroscopy. The galaxies in this study were observed with the low-resolution V500 set-up, spanning the wavelength range 3745-7500 \AA, with a spectral resolution of 6.0 \AA (FWHM). Here, we describe the data reduction and characteristics and data structure of the CAVITY datasets essential for their scientific utilisation, highlighting such concerns as vignetting effects, as well as the identification of bad pixels and management of spatially correlated noise. We also provide instructions for accessing the CAVITY datasets and associated ancillary data through the project's dedicated database.</description>

      <title>Cosmic evolution of the star formation efficiency in Milky Way-like galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current star formation models are based on the local structure of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet the details on how the small-scale physics propagates up to global galactic-scale properties are still under debate. To investigate this we use {\small VINTERGATAN}, a high-resolution (20 pc) cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We study how the velocity dispersion and density structure of the ISM on 50-100 pc scales evolve with redshift, and quantify their impact on the star formation efficiency per free-fall timescale, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$. During starbursts the ISM can reach velocity dispersions as high as $\sim 50$ km s$^{-1}$ for the densest and coldest gas, most noticeable during the last major merger event ($1.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$). After a merger-dominated phase ($1&lt;z&lt;5$), {\small VINTERGATAN} transitions into evolving secularly, with the cold neutral ISM typically featuring velocity dispersion levels of $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$. Despite strongly evolving density and turbulence distributions over cosmic time, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ at the resolution limit is found to change by only a factor of a few: from median efficiencies of 0.8\% at $z&gt;1$ to 0.3\% at $z&lt;1$. The mass-weighted average shows a universal $\langle \epsilon_{\rm ff} \rangle \approx 1\%$, caused by an almost invariant virial parameter distribution in star forming clouds. Changes in their density and turbulence levels are coupled so the kinetic-to-gravitational energy ratio remains close to constant. Finally, we show that a \textit{theoretically} motivated instantaneous $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ is intrinsically different to its \textit{observational} estimates adopting tracers of star formation e.g. H$\alpha$. Since the physics underlying star formation can be lost on short ($\sim$ 10 Myr) timescales, caution must be taken when constraining star formation models from observational estimates of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$.</description>

      <title>Cyclostationary signals in LISA: a practical application to Milky Way satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) anticipated to be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are Galactic double white dwarf binaries (DWDs). However, most of these binaries will be unresolved, and their GWs will overlap incoherently, creating a stochastic noise known as the Galactic foreground. Similarly, the population of unresolved systems in the Milky Way's (MW) satellites is expected to contribute to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Due to their anisotropy and the annual motion of the LISA constellation, both the Galactic foreground and the satellite SGWB fall into the category of cyclostationary processes. Leveraging this property, we develop a purely frequency-based method to study LISA's capability to detect the MW foreground and SGWBs from the most promising MW satellites. We analyze both mock data generated by an astrophysically motivated SGWB spectrum, and realistic ones from a DWD population generated via binary population synthesis. We are able to recover or put constrains on the candidate foregrounds, reconstructing -- in the presence of noise uncertainties -- their sky distribution and spectrum. Our findings highlight the significance of the interplay between the astrophysical spectrum and LISA's sensitivity to detect the satellites' SGWB. Considering an astrophysically motivated prior on the satellite positions improves their detectability, which becomes otherwise challenging in the presence of the Galactic foreground. Furthermore, we explore the potential to observe a hypothetical satellite located behind the Galactic disk. Our results suggest that a Large Magellanic Cloud-like satellite could indeed be observable by LISA.</description>

      <title>Eridanus III and DELVE 1: Carbon-rich Primordial Star Clusters or the Smallest Dwarf Galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectroscopy of the ultra-faint Milky Way satellites Eridanus III (Eri III) and DELVE 1. We identify eight member stars in each satellite and place non-constraining upper limits on their velocity and metallicity dispersions. The brightest star in each object is very metal-poor, at [Fe/H] = -3.1 for Eri III and [Fe/H] = -2.8 for DELVE 1. Both of these stars exhibit large overabundances of carbon and very low abundances of the neutron-capture elements Ba and Sr, and we classify them as CEMP-no stars. Because their metallicities are well below those of the Milky Way globular cluster population, and because no CEMP-no stars have been identified in globular clusters, these chemical abundances could suggest that Eri III and DELVE 1 are dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, the two systems have half-light radii of 8 pc and 6 pc, respectively, which is more compact than any known ultra-faint dwarfs. We conclude that Eri III and DELVE 1 are either the smallest dwarf galaxies yet discovered, or they are representatives of a new class of star clusters that underwent chemical evolution distinct from that of ordinary globular clusters. In the latter scenario, such objects are likely the most primordial star clusters surviving today. These possibilities can be distinguished by future measurements of carbon and/or iron abundances for larger samples of stars or improved stellar kinematics for the two systems.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Classical Bulges on Stellar Bars and Box-Peanut-X-Features in Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic bars and their associated resonances play a significant role in shaping galaxy evolution. Resulting resonance-driven structures, like the vertically extended Boxy/Peanut X-Feature (BPX), then serve as a useful probe of the host galaxy's history. In this study, we quantify the impact of a classical bulge on the evolution of the bar and the growth of bar resonance structures. This is accomplished with a suite of isolated N-body disk galaxy simulations with bulge mass fractions ranging from 0% to 16% of the disk mass. We apply frequency analysis to the stellar orbits to analyze the variations in resonance structure evolution. Our findings indicate that a more massive initial bulge leads to the formation of a stronger and more extended bar and that each bar drives the formation of a prominent associated BPX through resonance passage. In this work, we present evidence that the formation of a BPX is driven by planar, bar-supporting orbits evolving through interaction with horizontal and vertical bar-resonances. More orbits become vertically extended when these resonances overlap, and the rate of the orbits passing through resonance is moderated by the overall fraction of vertically extended orbits. A significant bulge stabilizes the fraction of vertically extended orbits, preventing sudden resonance-induced changes. Crucially, neither sudden resonance overlap nor prolonged resonance trapping is required for BPX formation.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-Web: stellar mass assembly in relation to dark matter halos across $0.2&lt;z&lt;12$ of cosmic history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stellar mass function (SMF) and the co-evolution with dark matter halos via abundance matching in the largest redshift range to date $0.2&lt;z&lt;12$ in $0.53 \, {\rm deg}^2$ imaged by JWST from the COSMOS-Web survey. At $z&gt;5$, we find increased abundances of massive (log$\, M_{\star}/M_{\odot}&gt;10.5$) implying integrated star formation efficiencies (SFE) $\epsilon_{\star}\equiv M_{\star}\, f_{\rm b}^{-1} M_{\rm halo}^{-1} \gtrsim 0.5$. We find a flattening of the SMF at the high-mass end that is better described by a double power law at $z&gt;5.5$. At $z \lesssim 5.5$ it transitions to a Schechter law which coincides with the emergence of the first massive quiescent galaxies in the Universe. We trace the cosmic stellar mass density (SMD) and infer the star formation rate density (SFRD), which at $z&gt;7.5$ agrees remarkably with recent \JWST{} UV luminosity function-derived estimates. However, at $z \lesssim 3.5$, we find significant tension ($\sim 0.3$ dex) with the cosmic star formation (SF) history from instantaneous SF measures, the causes of which remain poorly understood. We infer the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) and the SFE from abundance matching out to $z=12$, finding a non-monotonic evolution. The SFE has the characteristic strong dependence with mass in the range of $0.02 - 0.2$, and mildly decreases at the low mass end out to $z\sim3.5$. At $z\sim3.5$ the SFE increases sharply from $\sim 0.1$ to approach high SFE of $0.8-1$ by $z\sim 10$ for log$(M_{\rm h}/M_{\odot})\approx11.5$, albeit with large uncertainties. Finally, we use the SHMR to track the SFE and stellar mass growth throughout the halo history and find that they do not grow at the same rate -- from the earliest times up until $z\sim3.5$ the halo growth rate outpaces galaxy assembly, but at $z&gt;3.5$ halo growth stagnates and accumulated gas reservoirs keep the SF going and galaxies outpace halos.</description>

      <title>RUBIES: JWST/NIRSpec resolves evolutionary phases of dusty star-forming galaxies at $z\sim2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dearth of high quality spectroscopy of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) -- the main drivers of the assembly of dust and stellar mass at the peak of activity in the Universe -- greatly hinders our ability to interpret their physical processes and evolutionary pathways. We present JWST/NIRSpec observations from RUBIES of four submillimeter-selected, ALMA-detected DSFGs at cosmic noon, $z\sim2.3-2.7$. While photometry uniformly suggests vigorous ongoing star formation for the entire sample in line with canonical DSFGs, the spectra differ: one source has spectroscopic evidence of an evolved stellar population, indicating a recent transition to a post-starburst phase, while the remainder show strong spectroscopic signatures of ongoing starbursts. All four galaxies are infrared-luminous (log$_{10}$$L_{\rm{IR}}$/L$_{\rm \odot}$ $&gt;12.4$), massive (log$_{10}\,M_\star$/M$_{\rm \odot}$ $&gt;11$), and very dust-obscured ($A_V\sim3-4$ ABmag). Leveraging detections of multiple Balmer and Paschen lines, we derive an optical attenuation curve consistent with Calzetti overall, yet an optical extinction ratio $R_V\sim2.5$, potentially indicating smaller dust grains or differences in star-dust geometry. This case study provides some of the first detailed spectroscopic evidence that the DSFGs encompass a heterogeneous sample spanning a range of star formation properties and evolutionary stages, and illustrates the advantages of synergistic JWST and ALMA analysis of DSFGs.</description>

      <title>Galaxy populations in protoclusters at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties and redshift evolution of simulated galaxies residing in protoclusters at cosmic noon, to understand the influence of the environment on galaxy formation. This work is to build clear expectations for the ongoing ODIN survey, devoted to mapping large-scale structures at z=2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 using Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) as tracers. From the IllustrisTNG simulations, we define subregions centered on the most massive clusters ranked by total stellar mass at z=0 and study the properties of galaxies within, including LAEs. To model the LAE population, we take a semi-analytical approach that assigns Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and equivalent width based on the UV luminosities to galaxies in a probabilistic manner. We investigate stellar mass, star formation rate, major mergers, and specific star formation rate of the population of star-forming galaxies and LAEs in the field and protocluster environment and trace their evolution. We find that the overall shape of the UV luminosity function (LF) in simulated protocluster environments is characterized by a shallower faint-end slope and an excess on the bright end, signaling different formation histories for galaxies therein. The difference is milder for the Ly$\alpha$ LF. While protocluster galaxies follow the same SFR-$M_{\odot}$ scaling relation as average field galaxies, a larger fraction appears to have experienced major mergers in the last 200 Myr and as a result shows enhanced star formation at a ~60% level, leading to a flatter distribution in both SFR and $M_{\odot}$ relative to galaxies in the average field. We find that protocluster galaxies, including LAEs, begin to quench much earlier (z~0.8-1.6) than field galaxies (z~0.5-0.9); our result is in agreement with recent observational results and highlights the importance of large-scale environment on the overall formation history of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Compact [OIII] emission-line regions ("Green Seeds") in $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ emitters at Cosmic Noon from JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rest-frame optical, spatially resolved analysis of more than 100 $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ emitters (HAEs) at $z\sim2.2$ in the ZFOURGE-CDFS field using NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The ultra-deep, high-resolution data gives us maps of the resolved emission line regions of HAEs with stellar mass ranging from $10^{8}\,M_{\odot}$ to $10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$. An [OIII] emission-line map of each HAE is created from the flux excess in the F150W filter, leading to the discovery of a population of kiloparsec-scale compact emission line regions (``Green Seeds") with high equivalent widths ($\mathrm{EW}$). We obtain a sample of 128 Green Seeds from 68 HAEs with rest-frame $\mathrm{EW_{[OIII]}}&gt;200\r{A}$. Moreover, 17 of them have extremely large $\mathrm{EW_{[OIII]}}&gt;1000\r{A}$, suggesting the possible Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage from these emission line regions. Embedded within the host galaxy, many Green Seeds correspond to UV star-forming clumps and H{\sc ii} regions, indicating elevated starburst activity in them, with specific star formation rates (sSFR) several times higher than that of the host galaxy. Based on theoretical frameworks, Green Seeds are expected to be formed through gravitational disk instability and/or galaxy mergers. Considering the stellar masses of Green Seeds, we speculate that high-mass Green Seeds may migrate toward the galactic center to build the central bulge, while low-mass Green Seeds are easily disrupted and short-lived. Besides, we propose that some Green Seeds could be the progenitors of globular clusters or ultracompact dwarf galaxies observed in the local universe.</description>

      <title>Broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei in the 6dF Galaxy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Six-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) is a spectroscopic redshift survey of the Southern hemisphere completed in 2006. While it provides 136,304 spectra of mostly low-redshift galaxies, a large and reliable catalogue of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) that are selected based on spectral signatures is still lacking. In this work, we present an extensive list of verified broad emission-line AGN in the 6dFGS sample. We visually confirm the AGN nature of all spectra, and disentangle fibre cross-talk to remove bogus AGN. The final catalogue contains 2,515 unique broad-line AGN with a median redshift of 0.207, of which 891 are identified for the first time. A flux-limited subsample contains 665 AGN to a K-band magnitude of 13. This new sample adds to the list of known low-luminosity AGN in the Southern hemisphere and thus provides a basis for investigations of low-redshift AGN with the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</description>

We employ CIGALE to decompose the spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies into SF and AGN components to investigate the co-evolution of these processes at higher redshifts and fainter luminosities. Our CIGALE-derived SF and AGN LFs are generally consistent with previous studies, with an enhancement at the faint end of the AGN LFs. We attribute this to CIGALE's capability to recover low-luminosity AGN more accurately, which may be underrepresented in other works. As anticipated, the CIGALE SF LFs are best fit with a Schechter function, whereas the AGN LFs align more closely with a Saunders function. We find evidence for a significant evolutionary epoch for AGN activity at $z \approx 1$, comparable to the peak of cosmic star formation at $z \approx 2$, which we also recover well. Based on our results, the gas supply in the early universe favoured the formation of brighter star-forming galaxies until $z=2$, below which the gas for SF becomes increasingly exhausted. Conversely, AGN activity peaked earlier and declined more slowly until $z \approx 1$, suggesting a possible feedback scenario in which $2.5-3$ Gyrs offset the evolution of SF and AGN activity.</description>

      <title>The nature of low-luminosity AGNs discovered by JWST at $5&lt;z&lt;6$ based on clustering analysis: ancestors of quasars at $z\lesssim3$?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered many faint AGNs at high-$z$ by detecting their broad Balmer lines. However, their high number density, lack of X-ray emission, and overly high black hole masses with respect to their host stellar masses suggest that they are a distinct population from general type-1 quasars. Here, we present clustering analysis of 28 low-luminosity broad-line AGNs found by JWST (JWST AGNs) at $5&lt;z&lt;6$ based on cross-correlation analysis with 679 photometrically-selected galaxies to characterize their host dark matter halo (DMH) masses. From angular and projected cross-correlation functions, we find that their typical DMH mass is $\log (M_\mathrm{halo}/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot) = 11.61_{-0.24}^{+0.19},$ and $ 11.72_{-0.20}^{+0.17}$, respectively. This result implies that the host DMHs of these AGNs are $\sim1$ dex smaller than that of luminous quasars. The DMHs of JWST AGNs at $5&lt;z&lt;6$ are predicted to grow to $10^{12\unicode{x2013}13}\,h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot$, a typical mass of quasar at $z\lesssim3$. Applying the empirical stellar-to-halo mass ratio to the measured DMH mass, their host stellar mass is evaluated as $\log(M_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot)=9.72_{-0.39}^{+0.31},$ and $ 9.90_{-0.33}^{+0.27}$, which are higher than some of those estimated by the SED fitting. We also evaluate their duty cycle as $f_\mathrm{duty}=0.36_{-0.14}^{+0.18}$ per cent, namely $\sim7\times10^6$ yr as the lifetime of JWST AGNs. While we cannot exclude the possibility that JWST AGNs are simply low-mass type-1 quasars, these results suggest that JWST AGNs are a different population from type-1 quasars, and may be the ancestors of quasars at $z\lesssim3$.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies at $z \sim 3-4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of three intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies (QGs) with stellar masses of $\sim10^{10}M_{\rm \odot}$ at redshifts $z\sim 3 - 4$ using NIRSpec low-resolution spectroscopy. Utilising the SED fitting code BAGPIPES, we confirm these target galaxies are consistent with quiescent population, with their specific star formation rates (sSFR) falling below 2-dex the star-forming main sequence at the same redshifts. Additionally, we identify these QGs to be less massive than those discovered in previous works, particularly prior to the JWST era. Two of our target galaxies exhibit the potentially-blended H${\alpha}$+[NII] emission line within their spectra with $S/N&gt;5$. We discuss whether this feature comes from an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) or star formation although future high-resolution spectroscopy is required to reach a conclusion. One of the target galaxies is covered by JWST/NIRCam imaging of the PRIMER survey. Using the 2D profile fitting code Galfit, we examine its morphology, revealing a disc-like profile with a S\'{e}rsic index of $n=1.1 \pm 0.1$. On the size-mass relation, we find a potential distinction between less-massive ($\log_{10}{(M_*/M_\odot)}&lt;10.3$) and massive ($\log_{10}{(M_*/M_\odot)}&gt;10.3$) QGs in their evolutionary pathways. The derived quenching timescales for our targets are less than 1 Gyr. This may result from these galaxies being quenched by AGN feedback, supporting the AGN scenario of the emission line features.</description>

      <title>Exploring the properties of the obscured hyperluminous quasar COS-87259 at z=6.853</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the properties of the z=6.853 obscured hyperluminous quasar COS-87259, discovered in the Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field, with our recently developed Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code SMART (Spectral energy distributions Markov chain Analysis with Radiative Transfer models). SMART fits SEDs exclusively with multicomponent radiative transfer models that constitute four different types of pre-computed libraries for the active galactic nucleus (AGN) torus, the starburst and the spheroidal or disc host. We explore two smooth radiative transfer models for the AGN torus and two two-phase models, in order to put constraints on the AGN fraction of the galaxy, the black hole mass and its star formation rate (SFR). We find that either of the smooth tapered disc or the two-phase flared disc models provide a good fit to the SED of COS-87259. The best-fitting models predict an AGN fraction in the range 86-92 per cent, a bolometric AGN luminosity of 5.8-10.3 x 10^13 Lo, a black hole mass of 1.8-3.2 x 10^9 Mo (assuming the quasar is accreting at the Eddington limit) and an SFR in the range 1985-2001 Mo/yr. The predicted space density of such objects in the redshift range 4-7 is about 20 times more than that of co-eval unobscured quasars.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT Observations of Herschel Protocluster Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift protoclusters consisting of dusty starbursts are thought to play an important role in galaxy evolution. Their dusty nature makes them bright in the FIR/submm but difficult to find in optical/NIR surveys. Radio observations are an excellent way to study these dusty starbursts, as dust is transparent in the radio and there is a tight correlation between the FIR and radio emission of a galaxy. Here, we present MeerKAT 1.28 GHz radio imaging of 3 Herschel candidate protoclusters, with a synthesised beam size of ~$7.5'' \times 6.6''$ and a central thermal noise down to $4.35~\mu$Jy/beam. Our source counts are consistent with other radio counts with no evidence of overdensities. Around 95% of the Herschel sources have 1.28 GHz IDs. Using the Herschel 250 micron primary beam size as the searching radius, we find 54.2% Herschel sources have multiple 1.28 GHz IDs. Our average FIR-radio correlation coefficient $q_{250\mu m}$ is $2.33\pm 0.26$. Adding $q_{250\mu m}$ as a new constraint, the probability of finding chance-aligned sources is reduced by a factor of ~6, but with the risk of discarding true identifications of radio-loud/quiet sources. With accurate MeerKAT positions, we cross-match our Herschel sources to optical/NIR data followed by photometric redshift estimations. By removing $z&lt;1$ sources, the density contrasts of two of the candidate protoclusters increase, suggestive of them being real protoclusters at $z&gt;1$. There is also potentially a $0.9&lt;z&lt;1.2$ overdensity associated with one candidate protocluster. In summary, photometric redshifts from radio-optical cross-identifications have provided some tentative evidence of overdensities aligning with two of the candidate protoclusters.</description>

      <title>The JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS): Extending rest-optical narrow-band emission line selection into the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS), a Cycle 1 JWST imaging programme exploiting the wavelength coverage and sensitivity of NIRCam to extend narrow-band rest-optical emission line selection into the epoch of reionization (EoR) for the first time, and to enable unique studies of the resolved ionised gas morphology in individual galaxies across cosmic history. The primary JELS observations comprise $\sim4.7\mu$m narrow-band imaging over $\sim63$ arcmin$^{2}$ designed to enable selection of H$\alpha$ emitters at $z\sim6.1$, as well as the selection of a host of novel emission-line samples including [OIII] at $z\sim8.3$ and Pa $\alpha/\beta$ at $z\sim1.5/2.8$. For the prime F466N and F470N narrow-band observations, the emission-line sensitivities achieved are up to $\sim2\times$ more sensitive than current slitless spectroscopy surveys (5$\sigma$ limits of 1.1-1.6$\times10^{-18}\text{erg s}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-2}$), corresponding to unobscured H$\alpha$ star-formation rates (SFRs) of 1-1.6 $\text{M}_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ at $z\sim6.1$ and extending emission-line selections in the EoR to fainter populations. Simultaneously, JELS also obtained F200W broadband and F212N narrow-band imaging (H$\alpha$ at $z\sim2.23$) that probes SFRs $\gtrsim5\times$ fainter than previous ground-based narrow-band studies ($\sim0.2 \text{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$), offering an unprecedented resolved view of star formation at cosmic noon. In this paper we describe the detailed JELS survey design, key data processing steps specific to the survey observations, and demonstrate the exceptional data quality and imaging sensitivity achieved. We then summarise the key scientific goals of JELS and present some early science results, including examples of spectroscopically confirmed H$\alpha$ and [OIII] emitters discovered by JELS that illustrate the novel parameter space probed.</description>

      <title>A JWST/MIRI View of the ISM in M83: I. Resolved Molecular Hydrogen Properties, Star Formation, and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spatially-resolved (~3 pc pix$^{-1}$) analysis of the distribution, kinematics, and excitation of warm H2 gas in the nuclear starburst region of M83. Our JWST/MIRI IFU spectroscopy reveals a clumpy reservoir of warm H2 (&gt; 200 K) with a mass of ~2.3 x 10$^{5}$ Msun in the area covered by all four MRS channels. We additionally use the [Ne II] 12.8 ${\mu}$m and [Ne III] 15.5 ${\mu}$m lines as tracers of the star formation rate, ionizing radiation hardness, and kinematics of the ionized ISM, finding tantalizing connections to the H2 properties and to the ages of the underlying stellar populations. Finally, qualitative comparisons to the trove of public, high-spatial-resolution multiwavelength data available on M83 shows that our MRS spectroscopy potentially traces all stages of the process of creating massive star clusters, from the embedded proto-cluster phase through the dispersion of ISM from stellar feedback.</description>

      <title>Filaments in and between galaxy clusters at low and mid-frequency with the SKA telescope</title>

Abstract: Understanding the magnetised Universe is a major challenge in modern astrophysics, and cosmic magnetism has been acknowledged as one of the science key drivers of the most ambitious radio instrument ever planned, the SKA telescope. With this work, we aim to investigate the potential of the SKA telescope and its precursors and pathfinders in the study of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters and filaments through diffuse synchrotron radio emission. Galaxy clusters and filaments of the cosmic web are indeed unique laboratories to investigate turbulent fluid motions and large-scale magnetic fields in action and much of what is known about magnetic fields in galaxy clusters comes from sensitive radio observations. Based on cosmological MHD simulations, we predict radio properties (total intensity and polarisation) of a pair of galaxy clusters connected by a cosmic-web filament. We use our theoretical expectations to explore the potential of polarimetric observations to study large-scale structure magnetic fields in the frequency ranges 50-350MHz and 950-1760MHz. We also present predictions for galaxy cluster polarimetric observations with the SKA precursors and pathfinders (LOFAR2.0 and MeerKAT+). Our findings point out that polarisation observations are particularly powerful for the study of large-scale magnetic fields, since they are not significantly affected by confusion noise. The unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution of the intermediate frequency radio telescopes make them the favourite instruments for the study of these sources through polarimetric data, potentially allowing us to understand if the energy density of relativistic electrons is in equipartition with the magnetic field or coupled with the thermal gas density. Our results show that low frequency instruments represent as well a precious tool to study diffuse synchrotron emission in total intensity and polarisation.</description>

Abstract: We used TESS observations to search for pulsations in six known Of?p stars in the Magellanic Clouds. We find evidence for pulsational variability in three Of?p stars: UCAC4 115-008604, OGLE SMC-SC6 237339, and AzV 220. Two of them, UCAC4 115-008604 and OGLE SMC-SC6 237339, have been reported to possess kG-order magnetic fields. The obtained results are important to constrain and improve stellar evolution models.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signal Denoising and Merger Time Prediction By Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mergers of massive black hole binaries could generate rich electromagnetic emissions, which allow us to probe the environments surrounding these massive black holes and gain deeper insights into the high energy astrophysics. However, due to the short timescale of binary mergers, it is crucial to predict the time of the merger in advance to devise detailed observational plans. The significant noise and the slow accumulation of signal-to-noise ratio in the inspiral phase make this task particularly challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep neural denoising network in this study, capable of denoising continuous inspiral phase signals lasting up to 30 days. Following the denoising process, we perform the detection and merger time prediction based on the denoised signals. Our results demonstrate that for inspiral phase data with a signal-to-noise ratio between 10 and 50 occurring no more than 10 days before the merger, our prediction error for the merger time is generally within 24 hours.</description>

      <title>BD+44 493: Chemo-Dynamical Analysis and Constraints on Companion Planetary Masses from WIYN/NEID Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present high-resolution (R~100,000), high signal-to-noise (S/N~800) spectroscopic observations for the well-known, bright, extremely metal-poor, carbon-enhanced star BD+44 493. We determined chemical abundances and upper limits for 17 elements from WIYN/NEID data, complemented with 11 abundances re-determined from Subaru and Hubble data, using the new, more accurate, stellar atmospheric parameters calculated in this work. Our analysis suggests that BD+44 493 is a low-mass (0.83Msun) old (12.1-13.2Gyr) second-generation star likely formed from a gas cloud enriched by a single metal-free 20.5Msun Population III star in the early Universe. With a disk-like orbit, BD+44 493 does not appear to be associated with any major merger event in the early history of the Milky Way. From the precision radial-velocity NEID measurements (median absolute deviation - MAD=16m/s), we were able to constrain companion planetary masses around BD+44 493 and rule out the presence of planets as small as msin(i)=2MJ out to periods of 100 days. This study opens a new avenue of exploration for the intersection between stellar archaeology and exoplanet science using NEID.</description>

      <title>Varstrometry Selected Radio-Loud Candidates of Dual and Off-Nucleus Quasars at Sub-kpc Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual super massive black holes at sub-kpc to kpc scales, the product of galaxy mergers, are progenitors of eventually coalescing binary SMBHs. If both or one of the dual SMBHs are accreting, they may appear as dual AGNs or off-nucleus AGNs. Studying such systems is essential to learn the dynamical evolution of binary SMBHs as well as the process of galaxy merging. Recently a novel astrometry-based method named varstrometry has been put forward to search for dual SMBHs at high redshift, as the unsynchronized flux variability of dual AGNs (or off-nucleus AGNs) will cause astrometric jitters detectable by Gaia without spatially resolving them. Based on Gaia varstrometry we select a rare sample of 5 radio loud quasars with clear Gaia astrometric jitters. With e-MERLIN observations we have revealed a single compact radio source for each of them. Remarkably all but one exhibit clear Gaia-radio offsets of ~ 7 -- 40 mas. The observed Gaia jitters appear consistent with the expected values. These detected Gaia-radio offsets suggest these candidate dual SMBHs may have projected separations as small as ~ 0.01 -- 0.1'' (~ 0.1 kpc, depending on the optical flux ratio of two SMBHs). Meanwhile, this work highlights the remarkably high efficiency of Gaia varstrometry selection of jittering sources.</description>

      <title>Open Cluster Dynamics under the Influence of Outflow-Ambient Interactions</title>

Abstract: Outflowing stars impinging upon ambient gas experience accelerations due to the gravitational feedback from the interaction morphology between the outflow and the ambient gas. Such ``negative dynamical friction'' (NDF), in contrast to the conventional ``dynamical friction'' (DF), is studied for its impact on the dynamics of open clusters (OCs) immersed in a uniform ambient gas. We modify the $N$-body integration code \texttt{REBOUND} with both NDF and DF implemented according to the outflow conditions of each star in a consistently constructed OC. The evolution of stars is also involved in determining the gas-star interactions throughout their stellar lives. Compared to DF-only and gas-free models with identical initial conditions, the NDF-affected cluster is puffier and evaporates faster, as indicated by various diagnostics, including lower velocity dispersions and larger half-mass and half-light radii. Neutron stars with fast winds are expelled from the cluster due to their intensive NDF effect, even without the ``kicks'' by asymmetric supernovae. Exploration of parameter space confirms that the NDF effect is generally enhanced with higher ambient gas densities, in qualitative agreement with the expression of acceleration. Outflow-ambient interactions should be considered for the proper interpretation of the stellar dynamics evolution in clusters.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Spheroid Formation in Distant Submillimeter-Bright Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The majority of stars in today's Universe reside within spheroids, which are bulges of spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies. Their formation is still an unsolved problem. Infrared/submm-bright galaxies at high redshifts have long been suspected to be related to spheroids formation. Proving this connection has been hampered so far by heavy dust obscuration when focusing on their stellar emission or by methodologies and limited signal-to-noise ratios when looking at submm wavelengths. Here we show that spheroids are directly generated by star formation within the cores of highly luminous starburst galaxies in the distant Universe. This follows from the ALMA submillimeter surface brightness profiles which deviate significantly from those of exponential disks, and from the skewed-high axis-ratio distribution. The majority of these galaxies are fully triaxial rather than flat disks: the ratio of the shortest to the longest of their three axes is half, on average, and increases with spatial compactness. These observations, supported by simulations, reveal a cosmologically relevant pathway for in-situ spheroid formation through starbursts likely preferentially triggered by interactions (and mergers) acting on galaxies fed by non-co-planar gas accretion streams.</description>

      <title>MSA-3D: dissecting galaxies at z~1 with high spatial and spectral resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) is a powerful tool for understanding the formation of galaxies across cosmic history. We present the observing strategy and first results of MSA-3D, a novel JWST program using multi-object spectroscopy in a slit-stepping strategy to produce IFS data cubes. The program observed 43 normal star-forming galaxies at redshifts $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.5$, corresponding to the epoch when spiral thin-disk galaxies of the modern Hubble sequence are thought to emerge, obtaining kpc-scale maps of rest-frame optical nebular emission lines with spectral resolution $R\simeq2700$. Here we describe the multiplexed slit-stepping method which is $&gt;15$ times more efficient than the NIRSpec IFS mode for our program. As an example of the data quality, we present a case study of an individual galaxy at $z=1.104$ (stellar mass $M_{*} = 10^{10.3}~M_{\odot}$, star formation rate~$=3~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) with prominent face-on spiral structure. We show that the galaxy exhibits a rotationally supported disk with moderate velocity dispersion ($\sigma = 36^{+5}_{-4}$~\kms), a negative radial metallicity gradient ($-0.020\pm0.002$~dex\,kpc$^{-1}$), a dust attenuation gradient, and an exponential star formation rate density profile which closely matches the stellar continuum. These properties are characteristic of local spirals, indicating that mature galaxies are in place at $z\sim1$. We also describe the customized data reduction and original cube-building software pipelines which we have developed to exploit the powerful slit-stepping technique. Our results demonstrate the ability of JWST slit-stepping to study galaxy populations at intermediate to high redshifts, with data quality similar to current surveys of the $z\sim0.1$ universe.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Origin of the Vertical Metallicity Gradient of the Milky Way Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vertical metallicity gradient in the Milky Way bulge is well-established. Yet, its origin has not been fully understood under the Galactic secular evolution scenario. We construct single-disk and triple-disk $N$-body models with an initial radial metallicity gradient for each disk. These models generate a vertical metallicity gradient through a ``two-step heating" mechanism: first the outer, metal-poor particles move inward via the bar instability and subsequently undergo more significant vertical heating during the buckling instability, so they end up at greater vertical height. The ``two-step heating" mechanism nearly linearly transforms the radial metallicity gradients in precursor disks into vertical metallicity gradients. Comparing the models with a triple-disk model tagged with radially independent Gaussian metallicity, we find that, despite certain limitations, the ``two-step heating" mechanism is still important in shaping the Galactic vertical metallicity gradient. If the bar and buckling instabilities contributed to the formation of boxy/peanut-shaped bulges, then the ``two-step heating" mechanism is inevitable in the secular evolution of a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge.</description>

      <title>Accretion mediated spin-eccentricity correlations in LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine expected effective spin ($\chi_{{\rm eff},1\rm yr}$) and orbital eccentricity ($e_{1\rm yr}$) correlations for a population of observable equal-mass massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4.5},10^{7.5}]~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a circumbinary disc (CBD), one-year before merging in the LISA band. We find a strong correlation between measurable eccentricity and negative effective spin for MBHBs that are carried to merger by retrograde accretion. This is due to the well-established eccentricity pumping of retrograde accretion and the formation of retrograde CBD-aligned mini-discs, as observed in hydrodynamical simulations. Conversely, prograde accretion channels result in positive $\chi_{{\rm eff},1\rm yr}$ and non-measurable $e_{1\rm yr}$. This clear contrast between the two CBD orientations - and particularly the unique signature of retrograde configurations - provides a promising way to unlock the mysteries of MBHB formation channels in the LISA era.</description>

      <title>Chemo-dynamical abundance analysis of the very metal-poor halo star HE 2315-4240</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning about the chemical evolution of the universe is crucial to understanding the formation of the first stars and structure formation in the early universe. To find out how elements are produced via nucleosynthesis and how their relative amounts have evolved with time, abundance trends of stars with different metallicities can be established and compared. In this study, we present a spectrum of a very metal-poor star, HE 2315$-$4240, with [Fe/H] = $-$2.89 based on a Magellan/MIKE high-resolution visual light spectrum. The star has a radial velocity of +41.9 km s$^{-1}$, an effective temperature of 5181 K, a surface gravity of 2.24 dex, and a microturbulence of 1.61 km s$^{-1}$. The $\alpha$-elements and the iron peak elements agree well with the abundance trend. The low abundance of [Sr/Ba] and [C/Fe] suggests that HE 2315$-$4240 is accreted and formed in a dwarf galaxy. The value of [Ba/Eu] suggests the operation of a limited r-process. The abundance pattern of [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe] in HE 2315$-$4240 and its metallicity indicated that the star is formed from the gas enriched by a Type II supernova of a massive Pop III star. The abundance pattern fits Population III supernova yields moderately. The star's kinematic behavior shows that the star has a retrograde orbit and is moving away from the galactic center and out of the galactic disk to the south, and although the star is located in the halo of the Milky Way, it didn't form in the Milky Way but was rather formed in a small dwarf galaxy that was later absorbed by the Milky Way.</description>
