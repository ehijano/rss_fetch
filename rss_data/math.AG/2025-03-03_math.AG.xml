      <title>Intrinsic Donaldson-Thomas theory. II. Stability measures and invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a series on intrinsic Donaldson-Thomas theory, a framework for studying the enumerative geometry of general algebraic stacks.
  In this paper, we present the construction of Donaldson-Thomas invariants for general $(-1)$-shifted symplectic derived Artin stacks, generalizing the constructions of Joyce-Song and Kontsevich-Soibelman for moduli stacks of objects in $3$-Calabi-Yau abelian categories. Our invariants are defined using rings of motives, and depend intrinsically on the stack, together with a set of combinatorial data similar to a stability condition, called a stability measure on the component lattice of the stack. For our invariants to be well-defined, we prove a generalization of Joyce's no-pole theorem to general stacks, using a simpler and more conceptual argument than the original proof in the abelian category case.
  Further properties and applications of these invariants, such as wall-crossing formulae, will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.</description>

      <title>Fundamental algebraic sets and locally unit-additive rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra can be thought of as a statement about the real numbers as a space, considered as an algebraic set over the real numbers as a field. In this paper, I introduce what it means for an algebraic set or affine variety over a field to be fundamental, in a way that encompasses the classical case. I also introduce the related concept of local fundamentality and develop its behavior. On the algebraic side, I introduce the notions of locally, geometrically, and generically unit-additive rings, thus complementing unit-additivity as previously defined by myself and Jay Shapiro. I extend a number of results from the previous joint paper to local unit-additivity. I show that an affine variety is (locally) fundamental if and only if its coordinate ring is (locally) unit-additive. To do so, I first prove a theorem showing that there are many equivalent definitions of local unit-additivity. Illustrative examples are sprinkled throughout.</description>

      <title>Chow groups with twisted coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rost defined the Chow group of algebraic cycles with coefficients in a locally constant torsion etale sheaf. We generalize the definition to allow non-torsion coefficients. Chow groups with twisted coefficients are related to Serre's notion of "negligible cohomology" for finite groups. We generalize a computation by Merkurjev and Scavia of negligible cohomology, in terms of twisted Chow groups.
  We compute the Chow groups of the classifying space BG with coefficients in an arbitrary G-module, for several finite groups G (cyclic, quaternion, ${\bf Z}/2\times {\bf Z}/2$). There are connections with the theory of algebraic tori, notably the concept of coflasque resolutions. We compare twisted Chow groups with twisted motivic cohomology as defined by Heller-Voineagu-Ostvaer. Surprisingly, there is a surjection from twisted motivic cohomology to twisted Chow groups, but it is not always an isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Real and bi-Lipschitz versions of the Theorem of Nobile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Theorem of Nobile says that a pure dimensional complex analytic set $X$ is analytically smooth if, and only if, its Nash transformation $\eta\colon \mathcal{N}(X)\to X$ is an analytic isomorphism. This result was proven in 1975 and since then, as far as the author knows, no answer has been given to the real case, even more so when one only asks for $C^{k}$ smoothness. In this paper, we prove the real version of the Theorem of Nobile asking only $C^{k}$ smoothness, i.e., we prove that for a pure dimensional real analytic set $X$ the following statements are equivalent:
  (1) $X$ is a real analytic (resp. $C^{k+1,1}$) submanifold;
  (2) the mapping $\eta\colon\mathcal{N}(X)\to X$ is a real analytic (resp. $C^{k,1}$) diffeomorphism;
  (3) the mapping $\eta\colon\mathcal{N}(X)\to X$ is a $C^{\infty}$ (resp. $C^{k,1}$) diffeomorphism;
  (4) $X$ is a $C^{\infty}$ (resp. $C^{k+1,1}$) submanifold.
  In this paper, we also prove the bi-Lipschitz version of the Theorem of Nobile. More precisely, we prove that $X$ is analytically smooth if and only if its Nash transformation $\eta\colon \mathcal{N}(X)\to X$ is a homeomorphism that locally bi-Lipschitz.</description>

      <title>Degree 2 del Pezzo surface bundles and stable rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the arithmetic of del Pezzo surfaces $Y$ of degree 2 over a function field, and in particular, the cokernel of the homomorphism from the Picard group to the Galois-invariants of the geometric Picard group $\operatorname{Pic} Y \rightarrow(\operatorname{Pic} \bar{Y})^{G}$. Applying this to a fibration $\pi:X\to S$ in del Pezzo surfaces of degree 2 over a rational surface $S$, we construct examples with nontrivial relative unramified cohomology group $H^2_{nr,\pi}(k(X)/k)$. A specialization argument implies the failure of stable rationality of varieties specializing to $X$.</description>

      <title>Euler characteristics of moduli of twisted sheaves on Enriques surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Y$ be an Enriques surface and let $\mathcal{A}$ be an Azumaya algebra corresponding to the non-trivial Brauer class. Let $M$ be the moduli space of stable twisted sheaves on Enriques surfaces with twisted Chern character $M^H_{\mathcal{A}/Y}(2,c_1,\operatorname{ch}_2)$ with virtual dimension $N$. We show that the virtual Euler characteristic $e^\mathrm{vir}(M)$ only depends on $N$, more precisely, $e^\mathrm{vir}(M)=0$ when $N$ is odd and $e^\mathrm{vir}(M)=2\cdot e(Y^{[\frac{N}{2}]})$ when $N$ is even.</description>

      <title>Complexes of stable birational invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new stable birational invariant, which takes the form of a functor sending a degenerating variety to the homotopy type of a chain complex. Our invariant is a categorification of the motivic volume of Nicaise and Shinder. From the class of the chain complex in a Grothendieck group, we obtain a motivic obstruction to retract rationality, valued in a quotient of the Grothendieck ring of varieties. In addition, we construct a general class of stable birational invariants, with the invariant above as the universal example, given by applying any chosen stable birational invariant (e.g., unramified cohomology) to the strata of a semistable degeneration.</description>

      <title>The Generalised Mukai Conjecture for spherical varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Associated to every spherical variety $X$, is a rational number $\tilde{\wp}(X)$ which may be computed purely combinatorially. When $X$ is complete, we prove that $\tilde{\wp}(X)\ge0$, with equality if and only if $X$ is isomorphic to a toric variety, if and only if $\tilde{\wp}(X)&lt;1$. This yields a proof of the generalised Mukai conjecture for spherical varieties, as well as a proof of a combinatorial smoothness criterion for spherical varieties, conjectured by Gagliardi and Hofscheier, whereby smoothness along each $G$-orbit of a spherical variety can be checked by solving a linear program defined purely by spherical combinatorial data.</description>

      <title>Truncated factorized perverse sheaves on Sym(C)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kapranov and Schechtman defined the category FP of factorized perverse sheaves on Sym(C) smooth along the stratification given by multiplicities and with values in a braided monoidal category V. We define for each d\in N the category FP^{\leq d} of factorized perverse sheaves on the disjoint union of Sym^n(C) for n\leq d and the category FP_{\leq d} of factorized perverse sheaves on the open subset of Sym(C) consisting of multi-sets with multiplicities bounded by d. We show that the families (FP^{\leq d})_{d in N} and (FP_{\leq d})_{d in N} fit into systems of categories whose inverse limit is FP, and that for each d the natural restriction functor from FP_{\leq d} to FP^{\leq d} is faithful and compatible with taking the limit. For d=1 we prove that the natural restriction functor is an equivalence and that FP^{\leq 1} and FP_{\leq 1} are equivalent to V.</description>

      <title>Conformal Block Divisors for Discrete Series Virasoro VOA $\text{Vir}_{2k+1,2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a family of vector bundles on the moduli space of curves constructed from representations of $\text{Vir}_{2k+1,2}$, a family of vertex operator algebras derived from the Virasoro Lie algebra. Using the relationship between rank and degree, we characterize their asymptotic behavior, demonstrating that their first Chern classes are nef on $\overline{\rm{M}}_{g,n}$ in many cases. This is the first nontrivial example of divisors arising from vertex operator algebras that are uniformly positive for all genera. Furthermore, for $g = 1$, these divisors form a $\mathbb{Q}$-basis of the Picard group of $\overline{\rm{M}}_{1,n}$, with several desirable functorial properties. Using this basis, we characterize line bundles on certain contractions of $\overline{\rm{M}}_{1,n}$. We also propose conjectures regarding the conformal blocks of Virasoro VOAs and potential generalizations. In particular, by introducing a generalization of conformal block divisors, we provide a nonlinear nef interpolation between affine and Virasoro conformal block divisors.</description>

      <title>Relative compactified Prym and Picard fibrations associated to very good cubic fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A very good cubic fourfold is a smooth cubic fourfold that does not contain a plane, a cubic scroll, or a hyperplane section with a corank 3 singularity. We prove that the normalization of the relative compactified Prym variety associated to the universal family of hyperplanes of a very good cubic fourfold is in fact smooth, thereby extending prior results of Laza, Sacc\`a and Voisin. Using a similar argument, we also prove the smoothness of the normalization of the relative compactified Picard of the associated relative Fano variety of relative lines.</description>

Abstract: Using Galois-Stiefel-Whitney classes of theta characteristics we show that over a totally real base field the moduli stack of smooth genus $g$ curves and the moduli stack of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $g$ have nontrivial cohomological invariants and \'etale cohomology classes in degree respectively $2^{g-2}, 2^{g-1}$ and $2^{g-1}$. We also compute the pullback from the Brauer group of $\mathcal{M}_3$ to that of $\mathcal{H}_3$ over a general field of characteristic different from $2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positive geometries are semialgebraic sets equipped with a canonical differential form whose residues mirror the boundary structure of the geometry. Every full-dimensional projective polytope is a positive geometry. Motivated by the canonical forms of polytopes, we construct a canonical form for any tope of an oriented matroid, inside the Orlik--Solomon algebra of the underlying matroid. Using these canonical forms, we construct bases for the Orlik--Solomon algebra of a matroid, and for the Aomoto cohomology. These bases of canonical forms are a foundational input in the theory of matroid amplitudes introduced by the second author.</description>

      <title>Hyodo-Kato theory with syntomic coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.05694v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to establish theories concerning $p$-adic analogues of Hodge cohomology and Deligne-Beilinson cohomology with coefficients in variations of mixed Hodge structures. We first study log overconvergent $F$-isocrystals as coefficients of Hyodo-Kato cohomology. In particular, we prove a rigidity property of Hain-Zucker type for mixed log overconvergent $F$-isocrystals. In the latter half of the article, we give a new definition of syntomic coefficients as coefficients of $p$-adic Hodge cohomology and syntomic cohomology, and prove some fundamental properties concerning base change and admissibility. In particular, we see that our framework of syntomic coefficients depends only on the choice of a branch of the $p$-adic logarithm, but not on the choice of a uniformizer of the base ring. The rigid analytic reconstruction of Hyodo-Kato map studied by Ertl and the author plays a key role throughout this article.</description>

      <title>Deformation Theory for Finite Cluster Complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.02566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the deformation theory of the Stanley-Reisner rings associated to cluster complexes for skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras of geometric and finite cluster type. In particular, we show that in the skew-symmetric case, these cluster complexes are unobstructed, generalizing a result of Ilten and Christophersen in the $A_n$ case.
  We also study the connection between cluster algebras with universal coefficients and cluster complexes. We show that for a full rank positively graded cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}$ of geometric and finite cluster type, the cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{univ}}$ with universal coefficients may be recovered as the universal family over a partial closure of a torus orbit in a multigraded Hilbert scheme. Likewise, we show that under suitable hypotheses, the cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{univ}}$ may be recovered as the coordinate ring for a certain torus-invariant semiuniversal deformation of the Stanley-Reisner ring of the cluster complex.
  We apply these results to show that for any cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}$ of geometric and finite cluster type, $\mathcal{A}$ is Gorenstein, and $\mathcal{A}$ is unobstructed if it is skew-symmetric. Moreover, if $\mathcal{A}$ has enough frozen variables then it has no non-trivial torus-invariant deformations. We also study the Gr\"obner theory of the ideal of relations among cluster and frozen variables of $\mathcal{A}$. As a byproduct we generalize previous results in this setting obtained by Bossinger, Mohammadi and N\'ajera Ch\'avez for Grassmannians of planes and $\text{Gr}(3,6)$.</description>

      <title>Jumps of Jacobians via orthogonal canonical forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth, proper curve $C$ over a discretely valued field $k$, we equip the $k$-vector space $H^{0}(C,\omega_{C/k})$ with a canonical discrete valuation $v_{\mathrm{can}}$ which measures how canonical forms degenerate on regular integral models of $C$. More precisely, $v_{\mathrm{can}}$ maps a canonical form to the minimal value of its associated weight function, as introduced by Musta\c{t}\u{a}--Nicaise. Our main result states that $v_{\mathrm{can}}$ computes Edixhoven's jumps of the Jacobian of $C$ when evaluated in an orthogonal basis. As a byproduct, we deduce a short proof for the rationality of the jumps of Jacobians. We also show how $v_{\mathrm{can}}$ and the jumps can be computed efficiently for the class of $\Delta_v$-regular curves introduced by Dokchitser.</description>

      <title>Bordifications of the moduli spaces of tropical curves and abelian varieties, and unstable cohomology of $\mathrm{GL}_g(\mathbb{Z})$ and $\mathrm{SL}_g(\mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct bordifications of the moduli spaces of tropical curves and of tropical abelian varieties, and show that the tropical Torelli map extends to their bordifications. We prove that the classical bi-invariant differential forms studied by Cartan and others extend to these bordifications by studying their behaviour at infinity, and consequently deduce infinitely many new non-zero unstable cohomology classes in the cohomology of the general and special linear groups $\mathrm{GL}_g(\mathbb{Z})$ and $\mathrm{SL}_g(\mathbb{Z})$. In particular, we obtain a new and geometric proof of Borel's theorem on the stable cohomology of these groups.
  In addition, we completely determine the cohomology of the link of the moduli space of tropical abelian varieties within a certain range, and show that it contains the stable cohomology of the general linear group.
  In the process, we define new transcendental invariants associated to the minimal vectors of quadratic forms, and also show that a certain part of the cohomology of the general linear group $\mathrm{GL}_g(\mathbb{Z})$ admits the structure of a motive.
  In an appendix, we give an algebraic construction of the Borel-Serre compactification by embedding it in the real points of an iterated blow-up of a projective space along linear subspaces, which may have independent applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15362v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a lower bound for the essential dimension of isogenies of complex abelian varieties. The bound is sharp in many cases. In particular, the multiplication-by-$m$ map is incompressible for every $m\geq 2$, confirming a conjecture of Brosnan.</description>

      <title>Group schemes over LG-rings and applications to cancellation theorems and Azumaya algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several results on reductive group schemes over LG-rings, e.g., existence of maximal tori and conjugacy of parabolic subgroups. These were  proven in SGA3 for the special case of semilocal rings. We apply these results to establish cancellation theorems for hermitian and quadratic forms over LG-rings and show that the Brauer classes of Azumaya algebras over connected LG-rings have a unique representative and allow Brauer decomposition.</description>

      <title>Irrationality of the general smooth quartic $3$-fold using intermediate Jacobians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the intermediate Jacobian of the Klein quartic $3$-fold $X$ is not isomorphic, as a principally polarized abelian variety, to a product of Jacobians of curves. As corollaries we deduce (using a criterion of Clemens-Griffiths) that $X$, as well as the general smooth quartic $3$-fold, is irrational. These corollaries were known: Iskovskih-Manin \cite{IM} proved that every smooth quartic $3$-fold is irrational. However, the method of proof here is different than that of \cite{IM} and is significantly simpler.</description>

      <title>Schwartz $\kappa$-densities on the moduli stack of rank $2$ bundles near stable bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a curve over a non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero. We formulate algebro-geometric statements that imply boundedness of functions on the moduli space of stable bundles of rank $2$ and fixed odd degree determinant over $C$, coming from the Schwartz space of $\kappa$-densities on the corresponding stack of bundles (earlier we proved that these functions are locally constant on the locus of very stable bundles). We prove the relevant algebro-geometric statements for curves of genus $2$ and for non-hyperelliptic curves of genus $3$.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for $p$-adic Heights on Hyperelliptic Curves of Arbitrary Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an algorithm for computing Coleman--Gross (and hence Nekov\'a\v{r}) $p$-adic heights on hyperelliptic curves over number fields with arbitrary reduction type above $p$. This height is defined as a sum of local heights at each finite place and we use algorithms for Vologodsky integrals, developed by Katz and the second-named author, to compute the local heights above $p$. We also discuss an alternative method to compute these for odd degree genus 2 curves via $p$-adic sigma functions, via work of the first-named author. For both approaches one needs to choose a splitting of the Hodge filtration. A canonical choice for this is due to Blakestad in the case of an odd degree curve of genus $2$ that has semistable ordinary reduction at $p$. We provide an algorithm to compute Blakestad's splitting, which is conjecturally the unit root splitting for the action of Frobenius. We give several numerical examples, including the first worked quadratic Chabauty example in the literature for a curve with bad reduction.</description>

      <title>Twisted triple product root numbers and a cycle of Darmon-Rotger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an algebraic cycle on the triple product of the prime level modular curve $X_0(p)$ with origins in work of Darmon and Rotger. It is defined over the quadratic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ ramified only at $p$ whose associated quadratic character $\chi$ is the Legendre symbol at $p$. We prove that it is null-homologous and describe actions of various groups on it. For any three normalised cuspidal eigenforms $f_1, f_2, f_3$ of weight $2$ and level $\Gamma_0(p)$, we prove that the global root number of the twisted triple product $L$-function $L(f_1\otimes f_2\otimes f_3\otimes \chi, s)$ is $-1$. Assuming conjectures of Beilinson and Bloch, and guided by the Gross-Zagier philosophy, this suggests that the Darmon-Rotger cycle could be non-torsion, although we do not currently have a proof of this.</description>
