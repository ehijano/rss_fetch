      <title>To clean or not to clean: The free-rider problem in sequentially shared resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared resources enhance productivity yet at the same time provide channels for biological and digital contamination, turning physical or digital hygiene into a cooperation dilemma prone to free-riding. Here we introduce a game of sequential sharing of common resources, an empirically parameterized evolutionary model of population dynamics in sequential-use settings such as gyms and shared workspaces. The success of the strategies implemented in the model, such as cleaning equipment before or after use, are based on the trade-offs between cleaning costs, contamination risk, and social incentives to mitigate disease transmission. We find that cooperative hygiene can be achieved by lowering the effective costs of cleaning, strengthening pro-social incentives, and monitoring population-level noncompliance. Remarkably, stability of fully altruistic populations is primarily affected by the cleaning costs. In contrast, increasing effective infection costs, for example through punishment, appears less important in this case. The model's evolutionary dynamics exhibit multi-stability, hysteresis, and abrupt shifts in strategy composition, broadly consistent with empirical observations from shared-use facilities. Our framework offers testable predictions and is amenable to quantitative calibration with behavioral and environmental data. Our predictions can be used to inform the design of cost-effective public health and digital security policies.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Theory for Heider Balance under Heterogeneous Social Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heider balance theory provides a fundamental framework for understanding the formation of friendly and hostile relations in social networks. Existing stochastic formulations typically assume a uniform social temperature, implying that all interpersonal relations fluctuate with the same intensity. However, studies show that social interactions are highly heterogeneous, with broad variability in stability, volatility, and susceptibility to change. In this work, we introduce a generalized Heider balance model on a complete graph in which each link is assigned its own social temperature. Within a mean-field formulation, we derive a distribution-dependent self-consistency condition for the collective opinion state and identify the criteria governing the transition between polarized and non-polarized configurations. This framework reveals how the entire distribution of interaction heterogeneity shapes the macroscopic behavior of the system. We show that the functional form of the inverse-temperature distribution, in particular whether it is light-tailed or heavy-tailed, leads to qualitatively distinct phase diagrams. We also establish universal bounds for the critical transition, where the homogeneous-temperature limit provides a universal lower bound for the critical mean of an inverse-temperature distribution governing the transition. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions and highlight the nontrivial effects introduced by heterogeneity. Our results provide a unified route to understanding structural balance in realistic social systems and lay the groundwork for extensions incorporating fluctuations beyond mean field, external fields, and network topologies beyond the complete graph.</description>

      <title>Impact of seed node position on network robustness under localized attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized attacks (LAs), where damage propagates from a single seed node to its neighbors, pose significant threats to the robustness of complex networks. Although previous studies have extensively analyzed network vulnerability under such attacks, they typically assume random seed node placement and evaluate average robustness. However, the structural position of the seed node can significantly impact the extent of damage. This study proposes the Localized Attack Vulnerability Index (LAVI), a node-level metric that quantifies the potential impact of a LA initiated at a specific node. LAVI quantifies the cumulative number of severed links during attack progression, capturing how local connectivity and topological position amplify the resulting damage. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that LAVI correlates more strongly with network robustness degradation than standard centrality measures, such as degree, closeness, and betweenness. Our findings highlight that classical centrality metrics fail to capture key dynamics of spatially localized failures, while LAVI provides an accurate and generalizable indicator of node vulnerability under such disruptions.</description>

      <title>An attention economy model of co-evolution between content quality and audience selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human attention has become a scarce and strategically contested resource in digital environments. Content providers increasingly engage in excessive competition for visibility, often prioritizing attention-grabbing tactics over substantive quality. Despite extensive empirical evidence, however, there is a lack of theoretical models that explain the fundamental dynamics of the attention economy. Here, we develop a minimal mathematical framework to explain how content quality and audience attention coevolve under limited attention capacity. Using an evolutionary game approach, we model strategic feedback between providers, who decide how much effort to invest in production, and consumers, who choose whether to search selectively for high-quality content or to engage passively. Analytical and numerical results reveal three characteristic regimes of content dynamics: collapse, boundary, and coexistence. The transitions between these regimes depend on how effectively audiences can distinguish content quality. When audience discriminability is weak, both selective attention and high-quality production vanish, leading to informational collapse. When discriminability is sufficient and incentives are well aligned, high- and low-quality content dynamically coexist through feedback between audience selectivity and providers' effort. These findings identify two key conditions for sustaining a healthy information ecosystem: adequate discriminability among audiences and sufficient incentives for high-effort creation. The model provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how institutional and platform designs can prevent the degradation of content quality in the attention economy.</description>

      <title>Smart On-Street Parking: Survey of Actual Implementations in Cities and Insights from Practitioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart solutions for on-street parking, which collect and leverage real-time information about on-street parking space availability to guide drivers or adjust policies, have attracted considerable attention in academia and in the corporate world, but comprehensive feedback on actual implementations was still missing. Here, we survey around 25 smart parking (SP) implementations in cities across the world using online sources. To get more candid insights, we complement this objective review with case studies centred around interviews that we conducted with practitioners from ten cities across continents (San Francisco, Saint Pete Beach, Penang, Douala, Soissons, Grand Paris Seine Ouest, Montpellier, Frauenfeld, Zurich, Perth). Summing up our observations, we underline the broad diversity of SP implementations in terms of contexts and scales, from 2-to-3-year small-scale pilot studies to large deployments that take centre stage in a city's mobility policy. Technological choices also vary widely, from the ground sensors used in pioneering deployments in the early 2010s and still in use, to static cameras (which cover more spaces per device), and to mobile cameras with automatic licence-plate recognition embarked in roaming cars, a more and more popular solution for parking control. Different attitudes to the role given to smartphone applications are also noticed. But, importantly, not only means, but also goals differ: facilitating parking control and enhancing revenue, or providing data for a curb-pricing strategy, or feeding live data into navigation algorithms to reduce parking search times. Unfortunately, their level of achievement is seldom gauged with robust metrics. Hardware durability issues are mentioned as causes of premature termination, particularly for `first-generation' ground sensors, but so, too, are fluctuating political will and changing priorities. Smaller-scale, geographically isolated implementations and pilots are particularly vulnerable to these fluctuations, to discontinued funding or defaulting start-ups, and to limited public awareness.</description>

      <title>Threshold Resource Redistribution in Spatially-Structured Kinship Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model for a threshold-based resource redistribution process in a spatially-explicit population, characterizing the relation between kinship network structure, local interactions and persistence. We find that population survival becomes possible for lower resource densities, but leads to increased network heterogeneity and locally centralized clusters. We interpret this in relation to a feedback between the kinship network structure and reproduction ability. Agents receive stochastic resources and solicit additional resources from connected individuals when below a minimum, with each agent contributing a fraction of their excess based on relatedness. We first analyze a fully-connected population with uniform redistribution fraction and discuss mean field expectations as well as finite size corrections. We extend this model to a hub-and-spoke network, exploring the impact of network asymmetry or centrality on resource distribution. We then develop a spatially-limited population model with diffusion, local pairing, reproduction and mortality. Redistribution is introduced as a function of relatedness (generational distance through most-recent common ancestor) and distance. Redistribution-dependent populations exhibit a higher level of relational closeness with increased clustering for agents of highest node strength. These results highlight the interaction of resource density, cooperation and kinship in a spatially-limited regime.</description>

      <title>Tensor network dynamical message passing for epidemic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While epidemiological modeling is pivotal for informing public health strategies, a fundamental trade-off limits its predictive fidelity: exact stochastic simulations are often computationally intractable for large-scale systems, whereas efficient analytical approximations typically fail to account for essential short-range correlations and network loops. Here, we resolve this trade-off by introducing Tensor Network Dynamical Message Passing (TNDMP), a framework grounded in a rigorous property we term \textit{Susceptible-Induced Factorization}. This theoretical insight reveals that a susceptible node acts as a dynamical decoupler, factorizing the global evolution operator into localized components. Leveraging this, TNDMP provides a dual-mode algorithmic suite: an exact algorithm that computes local observables with minimal redundancy on tractable topologies and a scalable and tunable approximation for complex real-world networks. We demonstrate that widely adopted heuristics, such as Dynamical Message Passing (DMP) and Pair Approximation (PA), are mathematically recoverable as low-order limits of our framework. Numerical validation in synthetic and real-world networks confirms that TNDMP significantly outperforms existing methods to predict epidemic thresholds and steady states, offering a rigorous bridge between the efficiency of message passing and the accuracy of tensor network formalisms.</description>

      <title>Scaling law of individual urban tour behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing and modeling the mobility process with tour behavior is fundamental to understanding a wide range of complex systems, including animal foraging, human mobility and freight transportation. However, despite their importance, the distribution of tour length has long been neglected in individual human mobility models. To fill this gap, we analyze Foursquare users' check-in data and find that the distribution of urban tour length follows a truncated power-law distribution. To reproduce the universal scaling law for human mobility in urban areas, we introduce a tour terminate-continue model. Our model reproduces not only the urban tour length distribution but also Heaps' law, Zipf's lawand the distribution of the radius of gyration, providing a new perspective for characterizing individual human mobility.</description>

      <title>The meaning of closeness to women and/or LGBTQ+ physicists: a social network analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 'Closeness' is well-defined as a quantitative measure of centrality in social network analysis (SNA), but it is not as well defined qualitatively as a description of social relationships. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of 'closeness' as it is defined both implicitly and explicitly in interviews with 100 women and/or LGBTQ+ PhD physicists. The interviews include a social network construction component, and we define a quantitative network parameter that serves as a proxy for closeness, which we examine in relation to attributes of network members. We find that physicists in this sample see trust, relaxed boundaries, reliance, and support as concepts that most directly define closeness in their relationships. Consistent interaction, positive affect, and commonalities are also often present in (and in some cases, defining of) these relationships. From the quantitative analysis, we find that these physicists tend to view family and partners, friends, and professional friends as comprising their closest relationships. These results are consistent with other studies which have sought to define closeness qualitatively, but the prevalence of trust in this dataset in particular suggests that these physicists see the ability to confide as uniquely important in their relationships. We make recommendations to institutions supporting and employing physicists on how to better support gender and sexual minority (GSM) physicists going forward, and we believe these results help us gain a better understanding of how GSM physicists find success in physics despite the barriers they face due to their identities.</description>

      <title>Topological Symmetry Breaking in Antagonistic Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dynamic concordia discors, a finely tuned equilibrium between opposing forces, is hypothesized to drive historical transformations. Similarly, a precise interplay of excitation and inhibition, often approximated by an 80:20 ratio, underlies the normal functionality of neural systems. In artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning enables the fine-tuning of internal signed connections, optimizing adaptive responses to complex stimuli and ensuring robust performance. Engineered systems with antagonistic interactions remain comparatively unexplored, particularly because their emergent phases are closely linked to frustration mechanisms in the underlying network. In this context, spin-glass theory has shown how apparently uncontrollable non-ergodic and chaotic behavior can arise from the complex interplay of competing interactions and frustration among units, leading to multiple metastable states that prevent the system from exploring all accessible configurations over time. Here, we show how topology constrains dynamics in systems with antagonistic interactions. We use the signed Laplacian operator to demonstrate how fundamental topological defects in lattices and networks percolate, shaping the geometrical structure and the complex energy landscape of the system. This reveals novel and highly robust multistable phases and establishes deep connections with spin glasses when thermal noise is considered, providing a natural topological and algebraic description of emergent multistability and non-ergodicity in frustrated systems.</description>

      <title>Breakthrough Asymmetries across Disciplines and Countries: A Network approach to Structural Complexity of Scientific Progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Science is driven by community endeavors across diverse fields and specializations, forming a complex structure that renders conventional performance evaluation methods inadequate. Using established indicators, the network-based normalized citation score, and the disruptive index, combined with the GENEPY algorithm, we evaluate the complexity rank of countries based on their breakthrough performance across 89 subfields of physical sciences, drawing on nearly 60 million articles (1900-2023). This quality-focused integrated approach reveals pronounced asymmetries: while countries such as the United States, Israel, and several in Europe sustain long-term structural advantages, emerging nations show rapid gains in later decades. A power-law relationship between aggregated breakthrough performance and countries' R&amp;D expenditure underscores the unequal and scale-dependent nature of global science. These results demonstrate that scientific advancement arises not from uniform growth but from asymmetric complexity, offering actionable insights for policymakers and funding agencies aiming to foster sustainable, high-quality research ecosystems.</description>
