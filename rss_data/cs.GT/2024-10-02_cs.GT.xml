      <title>The Value of Compromising Strategic Intent in General Lotto Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resource allocation in adversarial environments is a fundamental challenge across various domains, from corporate competition to military strategy. This article examines the impact of compromising an opponent's strategic intent in the context of General Lotto games, a class of resource allocation problems. We consider a scenario where one player, termed the "Breaker", has access to partial information about their opponent's strategy through a binary sensor. This sensor reveals whether the opponent's allocated resources exceed a certain threshold. Our analysis provides a comprehensive characterization of equilibrium strategies and payoffs for both players under this information structure. Through numerical studies, we demonstrate that the information provided by the sensor can significantly improve the Breaker's performance.</description>

      <title>Computing Ex Ante Equilibrium in Heterogeneous Zero-Sum Team Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ex ante equilibrium for two-team zero-sum games, where agents within each team collaborate to compete against the opposing team, is known to be the best a team can do for coordination. Many existing works on ex ante equilibrium solutions are aiming to extend the scope of ex ante equilibrium solving to large-scale team games based on Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO). However, the joint team policy space constructed by the most prominent method, Team PSRO, cannot cover the entire team policy space in heterogeneous team games where teammates play distinct roles. Such insufficient policy expressiveness causes Team PSRO to be trapped into a sub-optimal ex ante equilibrium with significantly higher exploitability and never converges to the global ex ante equilibrium. To find the global ex ante equilibrium without introducing additional computational complexity, we first parameterize heterogeneous policies for teammates, and we prove that optimizing the heterogeneous teammates' policies sequentially can guarantee a monotonic improvement in team rewards. We further propose Heterogeneous-PSRO (H-PSRO), a novel framework for heterogeneous team games, which integrates the sequential correlation mechanism into the PSRO framework and serves as the first PSRO framework for heterogeneous team games. We prove that H-PSRO achieves lower exploitability than Team PSRO in heterogeneous team games. Empirically, H-PSRO achieves convergence in matrix heterogeneous games that are unsolvable by non-heterogeneous baselines. Further experiments reveal that H-PSRO outperforms non-heterogeneous baselines in both heterogeneous team games and homogeneous settings.</description>

      <title>Logit-Q Dynamics for Efficient Learning in Stochastic Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new family of logit-Q dynamics for efficient learning in stochastic games by combining the log-linear learning (also known as logit dynamics) for the repeated play of normal-form games with Q-learning for unknown Markov decision processes within the auxiliary stage-game framework. In this framework, we view stochastic games as agents repeatedly playing some stage game associated with the current state of the underlying game while the agents' Q-functions determine the payoffs of these stage games. We show that the logit-Q dynamics presented reach (near) efficient equilibrium in stochastic teams with unknown dynamics and quantify the approximation error. We also show the rationality of the logit-Q dynamics against agents following pure stationary strategies and the convergence of the dynamics in stochastic games where the stage-payoffs induce potential games, yet only a single agent controls the state transitions beyond stochastic teams. The key idea is to approximate the dynamics with a fictional scenario where the Q-function estimates are stationary over epochs whose lengths grow at a sufficiently slow rate. We then couple the dynamics in the main and fictional scenarios to show that these two scenarios become more and more similar across epochs due to the vanishing step size and growing epoch lengths.</description>

      <title>Multi-weighted Reachability Games and Their Application to Permissiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-player multi-weighted reachability games played on a finite directed graph, where an agent, called P1, has several quantitative reachability objectives that he wants to optimize against an antagonistic environment, called P2. In this setting, we ask what cost profiles P1 can ensure regardless of the opponent's behavior. Cost profiles are compared thanks to: (i) a lexicographic order that ensures the unicity of an upper value and (ii) a componentwise order for which we consider the Pareto frontier. We synthesize (i) lexico-optimal strategies and (ii) Pareto-optimal strategies. The strategies are obtained thanks to a fixpoint algorithm which also computes the upper value in polynomial time and the Pareto frontier in exponential time. The constrained existence problem is proved in P for the lexicographic order and PSPACE-complete for the componentwise order. Finally, we show how complexity results about permissiveness of multi-strategies in two-player quantitative reachability games can be derived from the results we obtained in the two-player multi-weighted reachability games setting.</description>

      <title>Do Large Language Models Learn Human-Like Strategic Preferences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate whether LLMs learn to make human-like preference judgements in strategic scenarios as compared with known empirical results. Solar and Mistral are shown to exhibit stable value-based preference consistent with humans and exhibit human-like preference for cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma (including stake-size effect) and traveler's dilemma (including penalty-size effect). We establish a relationship between model size, value-based preference, and superficiality. Finally, results here show that models tending to be less brittle have relied on sliding window attention suggesting a potential link. Additionally, we contribute a novel method for constructing preference relations from arbitrary LLMs and support for a hypothesis regarding human behavior in the traveler's dilemma.</description>

      <title>Optimal Budget Aggregation with Star-Shaped Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of aggregating distributions, such as budget proposals, into a collective distribution. An ideal aggregation mechanism would be Pareto efficient, strategyproof, and fair. Most previous work assumes that agents evaluate budgets according to the $\ell_1$ distance to their ideal budget. We investigate and compare different models from the larger class of star-shaped utility functions - a multi-dimensional generalization of single-peaked preferences. For the case of two alternatives, we extend existing results by proving that under very general assumptions, the uniform phantom mechanism is the only strategyproof mechanism that satisfies proportionality - a minimal notion of fairness introduced by Freeman et al. (2021). Moving to the case of more than two alternatives, we establish sweeping impossibilities for $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$ disutilities: no mechanism satisfies efficiency, strategyproofness, and proportionality. We then propose a new kind of star-shaped utilities based on evaluating budgets by the ratios of shares between a given budget and an ideal budget. For these utilities, efficiency, strategyproofness, and fairness become compatible. In particular, we prove that the mechanism that maximizes the Nash product of individual utilities is characterized by group-strategyproofness and a core-based fairness condition.</description>
