      <title>Signals vs. Videos: Advancing Motion Intention Recognition for Human-Robot Collaboration in Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) in the construction industry depends on precise and prompt recognition of human motion intentions and actions by robots to maximize safety and workflow efficiency. There is a research gap in comparing data modalities, specifically signals and videos, for motion intention recognition. To address this, the study leverages deep learning to assess two different modalities in recognizing workers' motion intention at the early stage of movement in drywall installation tasks. The Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model utilizing surface electromyography (sEMG) data achieved an accuracy of around 87% with an average time of 0.04 seconds to perform prediction on a sample input. Meanwhile, the pre-trained Video Swin Transformer combined with transfer learning harnessed video sequences as input to recognize motion intention and attained an accuracy of 94% but with a longer average time of 0.15 seconds for a similar prediction. This study emphasizes the unique strengths and trade-offs of both data formats, directing their systematic deployments to enhance HRC in real-world construction projects.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preserving Semantic Communications Using Vision Language Models: A Segmentation and Generation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless systems, improving the communication efficiency by transmitting high-level semantic features. However, reliance on unimodal representations can degrade reconstruction under poor channel conditions, and privacy concerns of the semantic information attack also gain increasing attention. In this work, a privacy-preserving semantic communication framework is proposed to protect sensitive content of the image data. Leveraging a vision-language model (VLM), the proposed framework identifies and removes private content regions from input images prior to transmission. A shared privacy database enables semantic alignment between the transmitter and receiver to ensure consistent identification of sensitive entities. At the receiver, a generative module reconstructs the masked regions using learned semantic priors and conditioned on the received text embedding. Simulation results show that generalizes well to unseen image processing tasks, improves reconstruction quality at the authorized receiver by over 10% using text embedding, and reduces identity leakage to the eavesdropper by more than 50%.</description>

      <title>RTR: A Transformer-Based Lossless Crossover with Perfect Phase Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a transformer-based lossless crossover method, termed Resonant Transformer Router (RTR), which achieves frequency separation while ensuring perfect phase alignment between low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) channels at the crossover frequency. The core property of RTR is that its frequency responses satisfy a linear complementary relation HLF(f)+HHF(f)=1. so that the original signal can be perfectly reconstructed by linear summation of the two channels. Theoretical derivation and circuit simulations demonstrate that RTR provides superior energy efficiency, phase consistency, and robustness against component tolerances. Compared with conventional LC crossovers and digital FIR/IIR filters, RTR offers a low-loss, low-latency hardware-assisted filtering solution suitable for high-fidelity audio and communication front-ends.
  The core theory behind this paper's work, lossless crossover, is based on a Chinese patent [CN116318117A] developed from the previous research of one of the authors, Jianluan Li. We provide a comprehensive experimental validation of this theory and propose a new extension.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Trade-off in Wideband Stacked Intelligent Metasurface Assisted OFDMA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional digital beamforming for wideband multiuser orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) demands numerous power-hungry components, increasing hardware costs and complexity. By contrast, the stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) can perform wave-based precoding at near-light speed, drastically reducing baseband overhead. However, realizing SIM-enhanced fully-analog beamforming for wideband multiuser transmissions remains challenging, as the SIM configuration has to handle interference across all subcarriers. To address this, this paper proposes a flexible subcarrier allocation strategy to fully reap the SIM-assisted fully-analog beamforming capability in an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) system, where each subcarrier selectively serves one or more users to balance interference mitigation and resource utilization of SIM. We propose an iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the subcarrier assignment matrix and SIM transmission coefficients, approximating an interference-free channel for those selected subcarriers. Results show that the proposed system has low fitting errors yet allows each user to exploit more subcarriers. Further comparisons highlight a fundamental trade-off: our system achieves near-zero interference and robust data reliability without incurring the hardware burdens of digital precoding.</description>

      <title>Fluid-Antenna-aided AAV Secure Communications in Eavesdropper Uncertain Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) secure communications, traditional designs based on fixed position antenna (FPA) lack sufficient spatial degrees of freedom (DoF), which leaves the line-of-sight-dominated AAV links vulnerable to eavesdropping. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a framework that effectively incorporates the fluid antenna (FA) and the artificial noise (AN) techniques. Specifically, the minimum secrecy rate (MSR) among multiple eavesdroppers is maximized by jointly optimizing AAV deployment, signal and AN precoders, and FA positions. In particular, the worst-case MSR is considered by taking the channel uncertainties due to the uncertainty about eavesdropping locations into account. To tackle the highly coupled optimization variables and the channel uncertainties in the formulated problem, an efficient and robust algorithm is proposed. Particularly, the uncertain regions of eavesdroppers, whose shapes can be arbitrary, are disposed by constructing convex hull. In addition, two movement modes of FAs are considered, namely, free movement mode and zonal movement mode, for which different optimization techniques are applied, respectively. Numerical results show that, the proposed FA schemes boost security by exploiting additional spatial DoF rather than transmit power, while AN provides remarkable gains under high transmit power. Furthermore, the synergy between FA and AN results in a secure advantage that exceeds the sum of their individual contributions, achieving a balance between security and reliability under limited resources.</description>

      <title>Information and Communication Theoretical Foundations of the Internet of Plants, Principles, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plants exchange information through multiple modalities, including chemical, electrical, mycorrhizal, and acoustic signaling, which collectively support survival, defense, and adaptation. While these processes are well documented in biology, their systematic analysis from an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) perspective remains limited. To address this gap, this article is presented as a tutorial with survey elements. It provides the necessary biological background, reformulates inter-plant signaling within ICT frameworks, and surveys empirical studies to guide future research and applications. First, the paper introduces the fundamental biological processes to establish a foundation for readers in communications and networking. Building on this foundation, existing models of emission, propagation, and reception are synthesized for each modality and reformulated in terms of transmitter, channel, and receiver blocks. To complement theory, empirical studies and state-of-the-art sensing approaches are critically examined. Looking forward, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions, with particular emphasis on the emerging vision of the Internet of Plants (IoP). This paradigm frames plants as interconnected nodes within ecological and technological networks, offering new opportunities for applications in precision agriculture, ecosystem monitoring, climate resilience, and bio-inspired communication systems. By integrating biological insights with ICT frameworks and projecting toward the IoP, this article provides a comprehensive tutorial on plant communication for the communications research community and establishes a foundation for interdisciplinary advances.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of ISAC over the D-Band in a Phase-Noise Aware OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase noise (PN) is a critical impairment at D-band frequencies (110 to 170 GHz), which are widely investigated as promising candidates for beyond 5G/6G ISAC systems. This paper evaluates OFDM based ISAC sensing performance under realistic oscillator impairments using a hardware-tuned 3GPP PN model at 130 GHz and FFT based radar processing. With a numerology of 480 kHz, results show that PN introduces range RMSE floors of 0.04 to 0.05 m and velocity RMSE floors of 0.12 to 0.18 m/s. Doppler sidelobe metrics also saturate, with PSLR around minus 6 dB and ISLR around minus 4 dB. These findings confirm that range accuracy remains bandwidth limited, while velocity estimation and sidelobe suppression are strongly PN-sensitive. The study highlights the importance of PN-aware waveform and numerology design for sub-THz ISAC and provides insights for future multi-band transceivers. Communication metrics and PN mitigation strategies such as PTRS and CPE tracking are left for future work.</description>

      <title>Modular PE-Structured Learning for Cross-Task Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent trends in learning wireless policies attempt to develop deep neural networks (DNNs) for handling multiple tasks with a single model. Existing approaches often rely on large models, which are hard to pre-train and fine-tune at the wireless edge. In this work, we challenge this paradigm by leveraging the structured knowledge of wireless problems -- specifically, permutation equivariant (PE) properties. We design three types of PE-aware modules, two of which are Transformer-style sub-layers. These modules can serve as building blocks to assemble compact DNNs applicable to the wireless policies with various PE properties. To guide the design, we analyze the hypothesis space associated with each PE property, and show that the PE-structured module assembly can boost the learning efficiency. Inspired by the reusability of the modules, we propose PE-MoFormer, a compositional DNN capable of learning a wide range of wireless policies -- including but not limited to precoding, coordinated beamforming, power allocation, and channel estimation -- with strong generalizability, low sample and space complexity. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed modular PE-based framework outperforms relevant large model in both learning efficiency and inference time, offering a new direction for structured cross-task learning for wireless communications.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Near-Field ISAC for Multi-Target Indication in NLoS Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling multi-target sensing in near-field integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems is a key challenge, particularly when line-of-sight paths are blocked. This paper proposes a beamforming framework that leverages a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to achieve multi-target indication. Our contribution is the extension of classic beampattern gain and inter-target cross-correlation metrics to the near-field, leveraging both angle and distance information to discriminate between multiple users and targets. We formulate a problem to maximize the worst-case sensing performance by jointly designing the beamforming at the base station and the phase shifts at the RIS, while guaranteeing communication rates. The non-convex problem is solved via an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that utilizes semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Simulations demonstrate that our RIS-assisted framework enables high-resolution sensing of co-angle targets in blocked scenarios.</description>

      <title>RAPID Quantum Detection and Demodulation of Covert Communications: Breaking the Noise Limit with Solid-State Spin Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for the detection and demodulation of covert electromagnetic signals using solid-state spin sensors. Our approach, named RAPID, is a two-stage hybrid strategy that leverages nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to operate below the classical noise floor employing a robust adaptive policy via imitation and distillation. We first formulate the joint detection and estimation task as a unified stochastic optimal control problem, optimizing a composite Bayesian risk objective under realistic physical constraints. The RAPID algorithm solves this by first computing a robust, non-adaptive baseline protocol grounded in the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), and then using this baseline to warm-start an online, adaptive policy learned via deep reinforcement learning (Soft Actor-Critic). This method dynamically optimizes control pulses, interrogation times, and measurement bases to maximize information gain while actively suppressing non-Markovian noise and decoherence. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the protocol achieves a significant sensitivity gain over static methods, maintains high estimation precision in correlated noise environments, and, when applied to sensor arrays, enables coherent quantum beamforming that achieves Heisenberg-like scaling in precision. This work establishes a theoretically rigorous and practically viable pathway for deploying quantum sensors in security-critical applications such as electronic warfare and covert surveillance.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Control of Acoustic Emissions from Marine Energy Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the mitigation of acoustic emissions from tidal current converters (TCCs) through optimized control strategies to enhance power generation efficiency while minimizing environmental impacts on marine life. A MATLAB/Simulink-based model of a Tidal Current Conversion System (TCCS) was developed to simulate the effects of variable control parameters, including switching frequencies, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) coefficients, and the elimination of the gearbox, on underwater noise levels. Acoustic emissions were quantified in terms of sound pressure levels (SPLs), and their potential impacts on marine mammals and fish were evaluated against species-specific auditory thresholds for temporary and permanent hearing threshold shifts. The results indicate that adjusting control parameters can significantly reduce SPLs, with the removal of the gearbox yielding the greatest noise reduction. The study identifies operational conditions under which marine species are at risk of auditory damage and proposes control strategies to mitigate these risks without compromising energy output. These findings contribute to the understanding of how control system modifications can balance the efficiency of marine energy systems with ecological considerations, offering guidance for the design and operation of environmentally compliant TCCs.</description>

      <title>Universal Graph Learning for Power System Reconfigurations: Transfer Across Topology Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses a fundamental challenge in applying deep learning to power systems: developing neural network models that transfer across significant system changes, including networks with entirely different topologies and dimensionalities, without requiring training data from unseen reconfigurations. Despite extensive research, most ML-based approaches remain system-specific, limiting real-world deployment. This limitation stems from a dual barrier. First, topology changes shift feature distributions and alter input dimensions due to power flow physics. Second, reconfigurations redefine output semantics and dimensionality, requiring models to handle configuration-specific outputs while maintaining transferable feature extraction. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a Universal Graph Convolutional Network (UGCN) that achieves transferability to any reconfiguration or variation of existing power systems without any prior knowledge of new grid topologies or retraining during implementation. Our approach applies to both transmission and distribution networks and demonstrates generalization capability to completely unseen system reconfigurations, such as network restructuring and major grid expansions. Experimental results across power system applications, including false data injection detection and state forecasting, show that UGCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-system zero-shot transferability of new reconfigurations.</description>

      <title>Downlink MIMO Channel Estimation from Bits: Recoverability and Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO systems, a major challenge lies in acquiring the downlink channel state information}\ (CSI) at the base station (BS) from limited feedback sent by the user equipment (UE). To tackle this fundamental task, our contribution is twofold: First, a simple feedback framework is proposed, where a compression and Gaussian dithering-based quantization strategy is adopted at the UE side, and then a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is formulated at the BS side. Recoverability of the MIMO channel under the widely used double directional model is established. Specifically, analyses are presented for two compression schemes -- showing one being more overhead-economical and the other computationally lighter at the UE side. Second, to realize the MLE, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm is carefully designed to integrate a sophisticated harmonic retrieval (HR) solver as subroutine, which turns out to be the key of effectively tackling this hard MLE problem.Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Multi-target Range, Doppler and Angle estimation in MIMO-FMCW Radar with Limited Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar offers several performance and flexibility advantages over traditional radar arrays. However, high angular and Doppler resolutions necessitate a large number of antenna elements and the transmission of numerous chirps, leading to increased hardware and computational complexity. While compressive sensing (CS) has recently been applied to pulsed-waveform radars with sparse measurements, its application to frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar for target detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel CS-based multi-target localization algorithm in the range, Doppler, and angular domains for MIMO-FMCW radar, where we jointly estimate targets' velocities and angles of arrival. To this end, we present a signal model for sparse-random and uniform linear arrays based on three-dimensional spectral estimation. For range estimation, we propose a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based focusing and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based techniques, each with distinct advantages, while two-dimensional CS is used for joint Doppler-angle estimation. Leveraging the properties of structured random matrices, we establish theoretical uniform and non-uniform recovery guarantees with high probability for the proposed framework. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve similar detection performance and higher resolution compared to conventional DFT and MUSIC with fewer transmitted chirps and antenna elements.</description>

      <title>A New Interpretation of the Time-Interleaved ADC Mismatch Problem: A Tracking-Based Hybrid Calibration Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-interleaved ADCs (TI-ADCs) achieve high sampling rates by interleaving multiple sub-ADCs in parallel. Mismatch errors between the sub-ADCs, however, can significantly degrade the signal quality, which is a main performance bottleneck. This paper presents a hybrid calibration approach by interpreting the mismatch problem as a tracking problem, and uses the extended Kalman filter for online estimation and compensation of the mismatch errors. After estimation, the desired signal is reconstructed using a truncated fractional delay filter and a high-pass filter. Simulations demonstrate that our algorithm substantially outperforms the existing hybrid calibration method in both mismatch estimation and compensation.</description>

      <title>Modeling Micro-Doppler Signature of Multi-Propeller Drones in Distributed ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) will be one key feature of future 6G networks, enabling simultaneous communication and radar sensing. The radar sensing geometry of ISAC will be multistatic since that corresponds to the common distributed structure of a mobile communication network. Within this framework, micro-Doppler analysis plays a vital role in classifying targets based on their micromotions, such as rotating propellers, vibration, or moving limbs. However, research on bistatic micro-Doppler effects, particularly in ISAC systems utilizing OFDM waveforms, remains limited. Existing methods, including electromagnetic simulations, often lack scalability for generating the large datasets required to train machine learning algorithms. To address this gap, this work introduces an OFDM-based bistatic micro-Doppler model for multi-propeller drones. The proposed model adapts the classic thin-wire model to include bistatic sensing configuration with an OFDM-like signal. Then, it extends further by incorporating multiple propellers and integrating the reflectivity of the drone's static parts. Measurements were performed to collect ground truth data for verification of the proposed model. Validation results show that the model generates micro-Doppler signatures closely resembling those obtained from measurements, demonstrating its potential as a tool for data generation. In addition, it offers a comprehensive approach to analyzing bistatic micro-Doppler effects.</description>

      <title>A Direct Comparison of Simultaneously Recorded Scalp, Around-Ear, and In-Ear EEG for Neural Selective Auditory Attention Decoding to Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current assistive hearing devices, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, lack the ability to adapt to the listener's focus of auditory attention, limiting their effectiveness in complex acoustic environments like cocktail party scenarios where multiple conversations occur simultaneously. Neuro-steered hearing devices aim to overcome this limitation by decoding the listener's auditory attention from neural signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG). While many auditory attention decoding (AAD) studies have used high-density scalp EEG, such systems are impractical for daily use as they are bulky and uncomfortable. Therefore, AAD with wearable and unobtrusive EEG systems that are comfortable to wear and can be used for long-term recording are required. Around-ear EEG systems like cEEGrids have shown promise in AAD, but in-ear EEG, recorded via custom earpieces offering superior comfort, remains underexplored. We present a new AAD dataset with simultaneously recorded scalp, around-ear, and in-ear EEG, enabling a direct comparison. Using a classic linear stimulus reconstruction algorithm, a significant performance gap between all three systems exists, with AAD accuracies of 83.4% (scalp), 67.2% (around-ear), and 61.1% (in-ear) on 60s decision windows. These results highlight the trade-off between decoding performance and practical usability. Yet, while the ear-based systems using basic algorithms might currently not yield accurate enough performances for a decision speed-sensitive application in hearing aids, their significant performance suggests potential for attention monitoring on longer timescales. Furthermore, adding an external reference or a few scalp electrodes via greedy forward selection substantially and quickly boosts accuracy by over 10 percent point, especially for in-ear EEG. These findings position in-ear EEG as a promising component in EEG sensor networks for AAD.</description>

      <title>A Compact Dynamic Antenna for Physical Layer Wireless Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel omnidirectional antenna design incorporating directional modulation for secure narrow planar information transmission. The proposed antenna features a compact size and stable omnidirectional radiation performance by employing two tightly spaced, printed meander line monopole antennas, acting as a single radiating element. To achieve a narrow information secure region, the proposed antenna is fed by differential power excitation of two ports with real-time dynamic switching. This leads to phase pattern modulation only along the electrical polarization, resulting in directionally confined information recoverable region in the E-plane, while maintaining highly constant or static omnidirectional H-plane pattern, inducing a $360^\circ$ information recoverable region. The dynamic antenna is designed and fabricated on a single layer of Rogers RO4350B which provides a miniaturized planar size of $0.36 \times 0.5 , \lambda_0^2$ at 2.7 GHz and easy integration. To validate the wireless communication performance, the fabricated antenna is directly fed with a 10 dB power ratio by a radio frequency (RF) switching system and evaluated for 16-QAM and 256-QAM transmission in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment. Experimental results demonstrate that for 16-QAM transmission, a narrow E-plane information beam (IB) of approximately $34^\circ$ and omnidirectional H-plane IB are obtained, and a narrower E-plane IB is achieved around $15^\circ$ for 256-QAM. These results confirm that the proposed antenna offers a simple yet effective approach to enhance planar physical information security with a compact dynamic antenna system.</description>

      <title>A Unified Transformer Architecture for Low-Latency and Scalable Wireless Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unified Transformer-based architecture for wireless signal processing tasks, offering a low-latency, task-adaptive alternative to conventional receiver pipelines. Unlike traditional modular designs, our model integrates channel estimation, interpolation, and demapping into a single, compact attention-driven architecture designed for real-time deployment. The model's structure allows dynamic adaptation to diverse output formats by simply modifying the final projection layer, enabling consistent reuse across receiver subsystems. Experimental results demonstrate strong generalization to varying user counts, modulation schemes, and pilot configurations, while satisfying latency constraints imposed by practical systems. The architecture is evaluated across three core use cases: (1) an End-to-End Receiver, which replaces the entire baseband processing pipeline from pilot symbols to bit-level decisions; (2) Channel Frequency Interpolation, implemented and tested within a 3GPP-compliant OAI+Aerial system; and (3) Channel Estimation, where the model infers full-band channel responses from sparse pilot observations. In all cases, our approach outperforms classical baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work presents a deployable, data-driven alternative to hand-engineered PHY-layer blocks, and lays the foundation for intelligent, software-defined signal processing in next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>RadHARSimulator V1: Model-Based FMCW Radar Human Activity Recognition Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) is a pivotal research area for applications requiring non-invasive monitoring. However, the acquisition of diverse and high-fidelity radar datasets for robust algorithm development remains a significant challenge. To overcome this bottleneck, a model-based frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar HAR simulator is developed. The simulator integrates an anthropometrically scaled $13$-scatterer kinematic model to simulate $12$ distinct activities. The FMCW radar echo model is employed, which incorporates dynamic radar cross-section (RCS), free-space or through-the-wall propagation, and a calibrated noise floor to ensure signal fidelity. The simulated raw data is then processed through a complete pipeline, including moving target indication (MTI), bulk Doppler compensation, and Savitzky-Golay denoising, culminating in the generation of high-resolution range-time map (RTM) and Doppler-time maps (DTMs) via both short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and Fourier synchrosqueezed transform (FSST). Finally, a novel neural network method is proposed to validate the effectiveness of the radar HAR. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the simulator successfully generates high-fidelity and distinct micro-Doppler signature, which provides a valuable tool for radar HAR algorithm design and validation. The installer of this simulator is released at: https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/RadHARSimulatorV1-Model-Based-FMCW-Radar-Human-Activity-Recognition-Simulator.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Energy Consumption and Completion Time in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14900v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an intriguing distributed machine learning approach due to its privacy-preserving characteristics. To balance the trade-off between energy and execution latency, and thus accommodate different demands and application scenarios, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of total energy consumption and completion time through two weight parameters. The optimization variables include bandwidth, transmission power and CPU frequency of each device in the FL system, where all devices are linked to a base station and train a global model collaboratively. Through decomposing the non-convex optimization problem into two subproblems, we devise a resource allocation algorithm to determine the bandwidth allocation, transmission power, and CPU frequency for each participating device. We further present the convergence analysis and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm not only has better performance at different weight parameters (i.e., different demands) but also outperforms the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Alternating Minimization Schemes for Computing Rate-Distortion-Perception Functions with $f$-Divergence Perception Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the computation of the rate-distortion-perception function (RDPF) for discrete memoryless sources subject to a single-letter average distortion constraint and a perception constraint belonging to the family of $f$-divergences. In this setting, the RDPF forms a convex programming problem for which we characterize optimal parametric solutions. We employ the developed solutions in an alternating minimization scheme, namely Optimal Alternating Minimization (OAM), for which we provide convergence guarantees. Nevertheless, the OAM scheme does not lead to a direct implementation of a generalized Blahut-Arimoto (BA) type of algorithm due to implicit equations in the iteration's structure. To overcome this difficulty, we propose two alternative minimization approaches whose applicability depends on the smoothness of the used perception metric: a Newton-based Alternating Minimization (NAM) scheme, relying on Newton's root-finding method for the approximation of the optimal solution of the iteration, and a Relaxed Alternating Minimization (RAM) scheme, based on relaxing the OAM iterates. We show, by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions, that both schemes guarantee convergence to a globally optimal solution. We also provide sufficient conditions on the distortion and perception constraints, which guarantee that the proposed algorithms converge exponentially fast in the number of iteration steps. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical simulations and establish connections with existing results.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS in Multiuser MIMO: Graph Theoretic Modeling and Optimal Architectures with Low Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is regarded as a key enabler of wave/analog-domain beamforming, processing, and computing in future wireless communication systems. Recently, Beyond Diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed as a generalization of conventional RIS, offering enhanced design flexibility thanks to the presence of tunable impedances that connect RIS elements. However, increased interconnections lead to high circuit complexity, which poses a significant practical challenge. In this paper, we address the fundamental open question: What is the class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance in a RIS-aided multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system? By modeling BD-RIS architectures using graph theory, we identify a class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance--matching that of fully-connected RIS--while maintaining low circuit complexity. Our result holds for a broad class of performance metrics, including the commonly used sum channel gain/sum-rate/energy efficiency maximization, transmit power minimization, and the information-theoretic capacity region. The number of tunable impedances in the proposed class is ${O}(N\min\{D,N/2\})$, where $N$ denotes the number of RIS elements and $D$ is the degree of freedom of the multiuser MIMO channel, i.e., the minimum between the number of transmit antennas and the total number of received antennas across all users. Since $D$ is much smaller than $N$ in practice, the complexity scales as ${O}(ND)$, which is substantially lower than the ${O}(N^2)$ complexity of fully-connected RIS. We further introduce two novel BD-RIS architectures--band-connected RIS and stem-connected RIS--and show that they belong to the optimal architecture class under certain conditions. Simulation results validate the optimality and enhanced performance-complexity tradeoff of our proposed architectures.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Multi-coding with Arbitrary Correlations Among the Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of non-orthogonal signals has several benefits over orthogonal signals in multi-coded communications. We provide a novel, theoretical study of non-orthogonal signaling to expand the applicability of these schemes. Motivated by a class of multi-carrier spread spectrum systems, this paper presents a thorough symbol error rate analysis of the broad class of multi-code signaling methods when they make use of codes which are not necessarily orthogonal. Our analysis is also extended to the case where the code set includes the negative of each code vector, i.e., an extension to biorthogonal signaling. Moreover, it is shown that the symbol error rate results derived in this paper reduce to those available in the literature when the multi-codes are orthogonal or have equal correlation between vectors. Additionally, we show how Monte Carlo integration can be used to evaluate the integrals in the error probability calculation and derive low complexity upper bounds on the error probabilities. We show that by combining these techniques, the error probability can be efficiently computed across the full SNR regime. Finally, we use the upper bound of the error probability to develop some analytical insights about the impacts of non-orthogonality among the code vectors on the symbol error probability.</description>

      <title>Revealing Hidden Precursors to Earthquakes via a Stress-Sensitive Transformation of Seismic Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic records from seven major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake forecasting.</description>
