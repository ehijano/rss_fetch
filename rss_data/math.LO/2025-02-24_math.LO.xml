      <title>From descriptive to distributed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past couple of years a rich connection has been found between the fields of descriptive set theory and distributed computing. Frequently, and less surprisingly, finitary algorithms can be adopted to the infinite setting, resulting in theorems about infinite, definable graphs. In this survey, we take a different perspective and illustrate how results and ideas from descriptive set theory provide new insights and techniques to the theory of distributed computing. We focus on the two classical topics from graph theory, vertex and edge colorings. After summarizing the up-to-date results from both areas, we discuss the adaptation of Marks' games method to the LOCAL model of distributed computing and the development of the multi-step Vizing's chain technique, which led to the construction of the first non-trivial distributed algorithms for Vizing colorings. We provide a list of related open problems to complement our discussion. Finally, we describe an efficient deterministic distributed algorithm for Brooks coloring on graphs of subexponential growth.</description>

      <title>Invariants for metrisable locally compact Boolean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pierce identified 3 invariants of a compact metrisable Boolean space, derived from its Cantor-Bendixson sequence, that determine the space up to homeomorphism. For locally compact spaces we define an additional invariant, the compact rank, and show that these 4 invariants determine a locally compact metrisable Boolean space up to homeomorphism. We also identify which combinations of the 4 invariants can arise in practice.
  A Boolean ring and its associated Boolean space are primitive if the ring is disjointly generated by its pseudo-indecomposable (PI) elements. Spaces in this important sub-class of Boolean spaces can be well described (uniquely in the case of compact spaces) by an extended PO system (poset with a distinguished subset). We define the Cantor-Bendixson sequence and associated invariants for a PO system, and show that almost all of the invariant information for a primitive space can be recovered from that of an associated extended PO system.
  We also show how the primitivity of a Boolean space corresponds to a notion of primitivity of the additive measure associated with the rank function of a space, which in turn depends on the additive measure being sufficiently 'self-similar'. We use these ideas to develop a method for constructing non-primitive spaces.</description>

      <title>Generalized Oxtoby subshifts and hyperfiniteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there exists a class of symbolic subshifts which realizes all Choquet simplices as simplices of invariant measures and the conjugacy relation on that class is hyperfinite.</description>
