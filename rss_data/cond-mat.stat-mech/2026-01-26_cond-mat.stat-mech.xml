      <title>Fluctuation-Response Theory for Nonequilibrium Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a unified fluctuation-response relation for Langevin dynamics. By exploiting the common mathematical structures underlying fluctuations and responses of empirical density and current, we derive a unified identity that generalizes the fluctuation-dissipation theorem from equilibrium to nonequilibrium settings. This relation connects global fluctuations of observables with their local responses to perturbations in force, mobility, and temperature. We further derive finite-time fluctuation-response inequalities, leading to response uncertainty relations that complement the identity by providing more practical bounds. These derivations establish a unified theoretical framework linking the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Using the $F_1$-ATPase molecular motor model, we illustrate how these response-based bounds constrain the long-time diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Active Cahn--Hilliard theory for non-equilibrium phase separation: quantitative macroscopic predictions and a microscopic derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-separating active systems can display phenomenology that is impossible in equilibrium. The binodal densities are not solely determined by a bulk (effective) free energy, but also affected by gradient terms, while capillary waves and Ostwald processes are determined by three distinct interfacial tensions. These and related phenomena were so far explained at continuum level using a top-down minimal theory (Active Model B+). This theory, by Taylor-expanding in the scalar order parameter (or density), effectively assumes that phase separation is weak, which is not true across most of the phase diagram. Here we develop a quantitative account of active phase separation, by introducing an active counterpart of Cahn-Hilliard theory, constructing the density current from all possible terms with up to four spatial derivatives without Taylor-expanding in the density. From this O(grad^4) theory, we show how to compute binodals and interfacial tensions for arbitrary choices of the five density-dependent 'coefficient functions' that specify the theory (replacing the four constant coefficients of Active Model B+). We further consider a particle model composed of thermal quorum-sensing active particles (tQSAPs) yielding a fully specified example of the O(grad^4) theory upon coarse-graining. We find that to coarse-grain consistently at O(grad^4) requires a novel procedure, based on multiple-scale analysis, to systematically eliminate fast-evolving orientational moments. Using this, we calculate from microscopic physics all five coefficient functions of the active Cahn-Hilliard theory for tQSAPs. We identify contributions that were missed in previous continuum theories, and show how neglecting them becomes justified only in the limit of large quorum-sensing range parameter. Comparison with particle simulations of tQSAPs shows that our O(grad^4) theory improves on previous continuum models [...]</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of a 2D material in a gas reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and validate a partition function for low-dimensional systems interacting with a heat bath, addressing the general issue of thermodynamic modeling of nanoscale systems. In contrast to bulk systems in the canonical (NVT) ensemble where the partition function is solely determined by the Hamiltonian of the system and the temperature of the heat bath, our formulation demonstrates that accounting for the interactions with the heat bath is essential for describing the statistical mechanics of low-dimensional materials. To validate our theoretical findings, we develop a molecular dynamics (MD) algorithm for directly modeling the heat bath as a gas reservoir. We first validate our approach using a 1D harmonic oscillator, calculating its length distribution through explicit numerical integration and confirming these results with MD simulations. We then extend our method to investigate the out-of-plane fluctuations of a 2D graphene monolayer immersed in a gas at finite temperature and pressure. Comparisons with conventional NVT ensemble simulations controlled by a thermostat reveal that environmental interactions significantly influence the properties of the 2D material system.</description>

      <title>Universal classical and quantum fluctuations in the large deviations of current of noisy quantum systems: The case of QSSEP and QSSIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fluctuation statistics of integrated currents in noisy quantum diffusive systems, focusing on the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion and Inclusion Processes (QSSEP/QSSIP). These one-dimensional fermionic (QSSEP) and bosonic (QSSIP) models feature stochastic nearest-neighbor hopping driven by Brownian noise, together with boundary injection and removal processes. They provide solvable microscopic settings in which quantum coherence coexists with diffusion. Upon noise averaging, their dynamics reduce to those of the classical SSEP/SSIP. We show that the cumulant generating function of the integrated current, at large scales, obeys a large deviation principle. To leading order in system size and for each noise realization, it converges to that of the corresponding classical process, establishing a classical typicality of current fluctuations in these noisy quantum systems. We further demonstrate a direct connection with Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (MFT), showing that the large-scale equations satisfied by biased quantum densities coincide with the steady-state Hamilton equations of MFT, thereby providing a microscopic quantum justification of the MFT framework in these models. Finally, we identify the leading finite-size corrections to the current statistics. We show the existence of subleading contributions of purely quantum origin, which are absent in the corresponding classical setting, and provide their explicit expressions for the second and third current cumulants. These quantum corrections are amenable to direct experimental or numerical verification, provided sufficient control over the noise realizations can be achieved. Their presence points toward the necessity of a quantum extension of Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory.</description>

      <title>D-MODD: A Diffusion Model of Opinion Dynamics Derived from Online Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first empirical derivation of a continuous-time stochastic model for real-world opinion dynamics. Using longitudinal social-media data to infer users opinion on a binary climate-change topic, we reconstruct the underlying drift and diffusion functions governing individual opinion updates. We show that the observed dynamics are well described by a Langevin-type stochastic differential equation, with persistent attractor basins and spatially sensitive drift and diffusion terms. The empirically inferred one-step transition probabilities closely reproduce the transition kernel generated from the D-MODD model we introduce. Our results provide the first direct evidence that online opinion dynamics on a polarized topic admit a Markovian description at the operator level, with empirically reconstructed transition kernels accurately reproduced by a data-driven Langevin model, bridging sociophysics, behavioral data, and complex-systems modeling.</description>

      <title>Gluing Randomness via Entanglement: Tight Bound from Second R\'enyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient generation of random quantum states is a long-standing challenge, motivated by their diverse applications in quantum information processing tasks. In this work, we identify entanglement as the key resource that enables local random unitaries to generate global random states by effectively gluing randomness across the system. Specifically, we demonstrate that approximate random states can be produced from an entangled state $|\psi\rangle$ through the application of local random unitaries. We show that the resulting ensemble forms an approximate state design with an error saturating as $\Theta(e^{-\mathcal{N}_2(\psi)})$, where $\mathcal{N}_2(\psi)$ is the second R\'enyi entanglement entropy of $|\psi\rangle$. Furthermore, we prove that this tight bound also applies to the second R\'enyi entropy of coherence when the ensemble is constructed using coherence-free operations. These results imply that, when restricted to resource-free gates, the quality of the generated random states is determined entirely by the resource content of the initial state. Notably, we find that among all $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropeis, the second R\'enyi entropy yields the tightest bounds. Consequently, these second R\'enyi entropies can be interpreted as the maximal capacities for generating randomness using resource-free operations. Finally, moving beyond approximate state designs, we utilize this entanglement-assisted gluing mechanism to present a novel method for generating pseudorandom states in multipartite systems from a locally entangled state via pseudorandom unitaries in each of parties.</description>

      <title>Generalized Integrable Boundary States in XXZ and XYZ Spin Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate integrable boundary states in the anisotropic Heisenberg chain under periodic or twisted boundary conditions, for both even and odd system lengths. Our work demonstrates that the concept of integrable boundary states can be readily generalized. For the XXZ spin chain, we present a set of factorized integrable boundary states using the KT-relation, and these states are also applicable to the XYZ chain. It is shown that a specific set of eigenstates of the transfer matrix can be selected by each boundary state, resulting in an explicit selection rule for the Bethe roots.</description>

      <title>Hard disks confined within a narrow channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ inhomogeneous integral equation theory to investigate the equilibrium properties of hard disks confined to a channel of width $L$ by hard parallel walls. If the channel width is narrowed below two disk diameters, then the system enters a quasi one-dimensional regime for which the particles cannot move past each other. In the limit when $L$ is equal to one particle diameter the system reduces to the one-dimensional bulk along the center of the channel. We study first the dimensional crossover properties of the inhomogeneous Percus-Yevick (PY) integral equation as $L$ is reduced and then investigate the behaviour of a quasi one-dimensional system as the packing of the particles is increased for a fixed value of $L$. We find that the inhomogeneous PY equation is highly accurate for situations of quasi one-dimensional confinement and that it predicts the onset of a structural transition to a zigzag state at higher packing. The excellent performance of this integral equation method and the ease with which it handles confinement-induced dimensional crossover is a consequence of the improved resolution which comes from treating explicitly the inhomogeneous two-body correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Constrained Symplectic Quantization I: the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symplectic quantization is a functional approach to quantum field theory that allows sampling of quantum fluctuations directly in Minkowski space-time by means of a generalized microcanonical ensemble similar to the one of the standard microcanonical approach to lattice field theory. In a previous paper we showed that, for an interacting scalar field theory in 1+1-dimensions, this formalism allows to capture numerically some crucial real-time features inaccessible to any Euclidean approach to lattice field theory. Yet, the new approach was plagued by two main limitations: an ill-defined non-interacting limit and the absence of a direct formal correspondence between its correlation functions and those generated by the Feynman path integral approach. In this paper, we introduce the new \emph{"constrained symplectic quantization"} approach, for which the perfect equivalence with the Feynman path integral is proved and which is perfectly well defined for the free theory. This new approach is characterized by the analytical continuation of all fields and of the action from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{C}$ and the presence of some constraints which guarantee the stability of the generalized Hamiltonian dynamics and the convergence of the corresponding generalized microcanonical partition function, hence the name of the theory. We show the application of this formalism to the quantum harmonic oscillator on a Minkowskian-time lattice, finding perfect agreement between one- and two-point numerical correlators and the exact quantum-mechanical results. We observe genuine real-time features such as the oscillatory propagator and the discrete excited-state energy spectrum. Our results provide strong numerical evidence that constrained symplectic quantization can sample real-time quantum-mechanical observables, offering a concrete route to overcome the limitations of Euclidean-time importance sampling.</description>

Abstract: We provide a consistent thermodynamic analysis of stochastic thermal engines driven by finite-size reservoirs, which are in turn coupled to infinite-size reservoirs. We consider a cyclic operation mode, where the working medium couples sequentially to hot and cold reservoirs, and a continuous mode with both reservoirs coupled simultaneously. We derive an effective temperature for the finite-size reservoirs determining the entropy production for two-state engines in the sequential coupling scenario, and show that finite-size reservoirs can meaningfully affect the power when compared to infinite-size reservoirs in both sequential and simultaneous coupling scenarios. We also investigate a three-state engine comprising two interacting units and optimize its performance in the presence of a finite reservoir. Notably, we show that the efficiency at maximum power can exceed the Curzon-Ahlborn bound with finite reservoirs. Our work introduces tools to optimize the performance of nanoscale engines under realistic conditions of finite reservoir heat capacity and imperfect thermal isolation.</description>

Abstract: By performing Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional Ising model, we apply the recently proposed Lee-Yang-zero ratio (LYZR) method to determine the location of the critical point in this model. We demonstrate that the LYZR method is as powerful as the conventional Binder-cumulant method in studying the critical point, while the LYZR method has the advantage of suppressing the violation of the finite-size scaling and non-linearity near the critical point. We also achieve a precise determination of the values of the LYZRs at the critical point, which are universal numbers. In addition, we propose an alternative method that uses only a single Lee-Yang zero and show that it is also useful for the search for the critical point.</description>

Abstract: Search processes are a fundamental part of natural and artificial systems. In such settings, the number of searchers is rarely constant: new agents may be recruited while others can abandon the search. Despite the ubiquity of these dynamics, their combined influence on search efficiency remains unexplored. Here we present a general framework for stochastic search in which independent agents progressively join and leave the process, a mechanism we term dynamic redundancy and mortality (DRM). Under minimal assumptions on the underlying search dynamics, this framework yields exact first-passage time statistics. It further reveals surprising connections to stochastic resetting, including a regime in which the resetting mean first-passage time emerges as a universal lower bound for DRM, as well as regimes in which DRM search is faster. We illustrate our results through a detailed analysis of one-dimensional Brownian DRM search. Altogether, this work provides a rigorous foundation for studying first-passage processes with a fluctuating number of searchers, with direct relevance across physical, biological, and algorithmic systems.</description>

      <title>Bubble formation in active binary mixture model</title>

Abstract: Phase separation, the spontaneous segregation of density, is a ubiquitous phenomenon observed across diverse physical and biological systems. Within a crowd of motile elements, active phase separation emerges from the interplay of activity (i.e., self-propulsion) and density interactions. A striking feature of active phase separation is the persistent formation of dilute-phase bubbles within the dense phase, which has been explored in theoretical models. However, the fundamental parameters that systematically control bubble formation remain unclear in conventional self-propelled particle models. Here, we introduce an active binary mixture model in which solutes and solvents dynamically exchange positions on a lattice; both solutes and solvents are self-propelled particles, but solvents play a role analogous to empty space in typical dry active matter. Within this model, we find that spontaneous bubble formation of solvents can be tuned by activity asymmetry, which is the difference between the solute and solvent activities. Numerical simulations reveal that moderate solvent activity enhances bubble formation, while larger solvent activity, comparable to solute activity, suppresses it. By employing mean-field theory, which captures essential phase behaviors, we consider the mechanism for the enhancement of bubble formation induced by solvent activity. Beyond these findings, when solute and solvent activities are equal, we apply the finite-size scaling analysis to estimate the critical exponents for active phase separation under the suppression of bubbles. Our findings establish activity asymmetry as a key control parameter for active matter phase transitions, offering new insights into universality in nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Boltzmann brains, the time-asymmetry of memory, and the second law</title>

Abstract: Are your perceptions, memories and observational data, a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe, having no correlation with the actual past state of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against this "Boltzmann brain" hypothesis. Complicating these arguments have been the many subtle -- and very often implicit -- joint dependencies among these arguments and others that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even for Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These dependencies can easily lead to circular reasoning. To avoid this problem, since all of these arguments involve the stochastic properties of the dynamics of the universe's entropy, we begin by formalizing that dynamics as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process, which we call the entropy conjecture. Crucially, like all stochastic processes, the entropy conjecture does not specify any time(s) which it should be conditioned on in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning times and associated entropy values must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that these all make an arbitrary assumption that the dynamics of the universe's entropy should be conditioned on a single event at a single moment in time, differing only in the details of their assumptions. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).</description>

      <title>Information Propagation in Predator-Prey Dynamics of Turbulent Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetically confined fusion plasmas exhibit predator-prey-like cyclic oscillations through the self-regulating interaction between drift-wave turbulence and zonal flow. To elucidate the detailed mechanism and causality underlying this phenomenon, we construct a simple stochastic predator-prey model that incorporates intrinsic fluctuations and analyze its statistical properties from an information-theoretic perspective. We first show that the model exhibits persistent fluctuating cyclic oscillations called quasi-cycles due to amplification of intrinsic noise. This result suggests the possibility that the previously observed periodic oscillations in a toroidal plasma are not limit cycles but quasi-cycles, and that such quasi-cycles may be widely observed under various conditions. For this model, we further prove that information of the zonal flow is propagated to turbulence. This result suggests that turbulence behavior may be predictable to a certain extent based on zonal flow characteristics.</description>

      <title>Modified rational six vertex model on a rectangular lattice : new formula, homogeneous and thermodynamic limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the work of Belliard, Pimenta and Slavnov (2024) studying the modified rational six vertex model. We find another formula of the partition function for the inhomogeneous model, in terms of a determinant that mix the modified Izergin one and a Vandermonde one. This expression enables us to compute the partition function in the homogeneous limit for the rectangular lattice, and then to study the thermodynamic limit. It leads to a new result, we obtain the first order of free energy with boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>From motifs to L\'evy flights: Modeling urban mobility in Bogot\'a's public transport system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two years of access card validation records from Bogot\'a's multimodal public transport system, comprising over 2.3 billion trips across bus rapid transit, feeder buses, dual-service buses, and an aerial cable network. From user trajectories constructed exclusively from access records, we derive motifs that reveal recurrent mobility patterns extending beyond simple two-location visits. This approach enables the construction of an integrated origin-destination (OD) matrix covering 2,828 urban zones. Similarity analysis using the Jensen-Shannon divergence confirms the temporal stability of mobility structures across semesters, despite infrastructure changes and fare policy adjustments. From the obtained OD matrices, we derive transition probabilities between zones and uncover a robust power-law relationship with geographical distance, consistent with L\'evy flight dynamics. We validate our model using Monte Carlo simulations showing that reproduces both local and long-range displacements, with similar scaling exponents across time. These findings demonstrate that Bogot\'a's public transport mobility can be effectively modeled through L\'evy processes, providing a novel framework for analyzing complex transportation systems based solely on user access records.</description>

      <title>Local spreading of stabilizer R\'enyi entropy in a brickwork random Clifford circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07769</link>

Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, or magic, constitutes a fundamental resource for quantum computation and a crucial ingredient for quantum advantage. Recent progress has substantially advanced the characterization of magic in many-body quantum systems, with stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) emerging as a computable and experimentally accessible measure. In this work, we investigate the spreading of SRE in terms of single-qubit reduced density matrices, where an initial product state that contains magic in a local region evolves under brickwork random Clifford circuits. For the case with Haar-random local Clifford gates, we find that the spreading profile exhibits a diffusive structure within a ballistic light cone when viewed through a normalized version of single-qubit SRE, despite the absence of explicit conserved charges. We further examine the robustness of this non-ballistic behavior of the normalized single-qubit SRE spreading by extending the analysis to a restricted Clifford circuit, where we unveil a superdiffusive spreading. Finally, we discuss that a similar non-ballistic spreading within the light cone is found for another indicator of the magic, i.e., the robustness of magic.</description>

      <title>Nature is stingy: Universality of Scrooge ensembles in quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulators allow direct experimental access to ensembles of pure states generated by measuring part of an isolated quantum many-body system. These projected ensembles encode fine-grained information beyond thermal expectation values and provide a new window into quantum thermalization. In chaotic dynamics, projected ensembles exhibit universal statistics governed by maximum-entropy principles, known as deep thermalization. At infinite temperature this universality is characterized by Haar-random ensembles. More generally, physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws lead to Scrooge ensembles, which are maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with these constraints. Here we introduce Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and use this framework to sharpen the conditions under which Scrooge-like behavior emerges. We first show that global Scrooge designs arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without measurements. Second, we show that measuring a complementary subsystem of a scrambled global state drawn from a global Scrooge $2k$-design induces a local Scrooge $k$-design. Third, we show that a local Scrooge $k$-design arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a scrambled basis induced by a unitary drawn from a Haar $2k$-design. These results show that the resources required to generate approximate Scrooge ensembles scale only with the desired degree of approximation, enabling efficient implementations. Complementing our analytical results, numerical simulations identify coherence, entanglement, non-stabilizerness, and information scrambling as essential ingredients for the emergence of Scrooge-like behavior. Together, our findings advance theoretical explanations for maximally entropic, information-stingy randomness in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature topological transitions in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address issues related to the presence of defects at finite-temperature topological transitions, in particular when defects are modeled in terms of further variables associated with a quenched disorder, corresponding to the limit in which the defect dynamics is very slow. As a paradigmatic model, we consider the classical three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge model in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder associated with the plaquettes of the lattice, whose topological transitions are characterized by the absence of a local order parameter. We study the critical behaviors in the presence of weak disorder. We show that they belong to a new topological universality class, different from that of the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge models without disorder, in agreement with the Harris criterium for the relevance of uncorrelated quenched disorder when the pure system undergoes a continuous transition with positive specific-heat critical exponent.</description>
