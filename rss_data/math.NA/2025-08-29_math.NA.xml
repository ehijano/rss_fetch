      <title>Multi-Order Monte Carlo IMEX hierarchies for uncertainty quantification in multiscale hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Multi-Order Monte Carlo approach for uncertainty quantification in the context of multiscale time-dependent partial differential equations. The new framework leverages Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta time integrators to satisfy the asymptotic-preserving property across different discretization orders of accuracy. In contrast to traditional Multi-Level Monte Carlo methods, which require costly hierarchical re-meshing, our method constructs a multi-order hierarchy by varying both spatial and temporal discretization orders within the Monte Carlo framework. This enables efficient variance reduction while naturally adapting to the multiple scales inherent in the problem. The proposed method is particularly well-suited for hyperbolic systems with stiff relaxation, kinetic equations, and low Mach number flows, where standard Multi-Level Monte Carlo techniques often encounter computational challenges. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the novel Multi-Order Monte Carlo approach achieves substantial reduction of both error and variance while maintaining asymptotic consistency in the asymptotic limit.</description>

      <title>Operator learning meets inverse problems: A probabilistic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator learning offers a robust framework for approximating mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. It has also become a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in the computational sciences. This chapter surveys methodological and theoretical developments at the intersection of operator learning and inverse problems. It begins by summarizing the probabilistic and deterministic approaches to inverse problems, and pays special attention to emerging measure-centric formulations that treat observed data or unknown parameters as probability distributions. The discussion then turns to operator learning by covering essential components such as data generation, loss functions, and widely used architectures for representing function-to-function maps. The core of the chapter centers on the end-to-end inverse operator learning paradigm, which aims to directly map observed data to the solution of the inverse problem without requiring explicit knowledge of the forward map. It highlights the unique challenge that noise plays in this data-driven inversion setting, presents structure-aware architectures for both point predictions and posterior estimates, and surveys relevant theory for linear and nonlinear inverse problems. The chapter also discusses the estimation of priors and regularizers, where operator learning is used more selectively within classical inversion algorithms.</description>

      <title>Automated Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om time stepping for finite element methods in Irksome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irksome is a library based on the Unified Form Language (UFL) that automates the application of Runge-Kutta time-stepping methods for finite element spatial discretizations of partial differential equations (PDEs). This paper describes recent updates to Irksome that allow users to express semidiscrete forms of PDEs that contain second-order temporal derivatives, whence it generates stage-coupled variational problems to be solved at each time step for Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om methods. Firedrake then generates code for these variational problems and provides a rich interface to PETSc for solving them. Directly discretizing second-order time derivatives with Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om methods provides several advantages relative to discretizing a rewritten first-order system with a standard Runge-Kutta method. Besides working with an interface closer to the problem formulation in UFL, avoiding these auxiliary variables means that Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om methods lead to smaller algebraic systems and better run-time. Our numerical results indicate that, with effective preconditioning, fully implicit Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om methods can be made competitive with more traditional explicit methods for wave equations. They are also (essentially) required to discretize wave-type equations with higher-order spatial derivatives. We also provide numerical experiments for fully dynamic poroelasticity, a system of mixed temporal order, where our time-stepping and algebraic solvers perform effectively even as we approach the incompressible limit.</description>

      <title>Randomized Krylov methods for inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop randomized Krylov subspace methods for efficiently computing regularized solutions to large-scale linear inverse problems. Building on the recently developed randomized Gram-Schmidt process, where sketched inner products are used to estimate inner products of high-dimensional vectors, we propose a randomized Golub-Kahan approach that works for general rectangular matrices. We describe new iterative solvers based on the randomized Golub-Kahan approach and show how they can be used for solving inverse problems with rectangular matrices, thus extending the capabilities of the recently proposed randomized GMRES method. We also consider hybrid projection methods that combine iterative projection methods, based on both the randomized Arnoldi and randomized Golub-Kahan factorizations, with Tikhonov regularization, where regularization parameters can be selected automatically during the iterative process. Numerical results from image deblurring and seismic tomography show the potential benefits of these approaches.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Exponential Sum Approximation of Power-Law Kernels for Solving Fractional Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for approximating the weakly singular power-law kernel $t^{\alpha-1}$ of fractional integral and differential operators, where $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and $t \in [\delta,T]$ with $0&lt;\delta&lt;T&lt;\infty$, using a finite sum of exponentials. This approximation method begins by substituting an exponential function into the Laplace transform of the power function, followed by the application of the trapezoidal rule to approximate the resulting integral. To ensure computational feasibility, the integral limits are truncated, leading to a finite exponential sum representation of the kernel. In contrast to earlier approaches, we pre-specify the admitted computational cost (measured in terms of the number of exponentials) and minimize the approximation error. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost while maintaining accuracy, we present a two-stage algorithm based on Prony's method that compresses the exponential sum. The compressed kernel is then embedded into the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral and applied to solve fractional differential equations. To this end, we discuss two solution strategies, namely (a) method based on piecewise constant interpolation and (b) a transformation of the original fractional differential equation into a system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This reformulation makes the problem solvable by standard ODE solvers with low computational cost while retaining the accuracy benefits of the exponential-sum-approximation. Finally, we apply the proposed strategies to solve some well-known fractional differential equations and demonstrate the advantages, accuracy, and the experimental order of convergence of the methods through numerical results.</description>

      <title>Artificial neural network solver for Fokker-Planck and Koopman eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that is an It\^{o} diffusion or Langevin equation, the Fokker-Planck operator governs the evolution of the probability density, while its adjoint, the infinitesimal generator of the stochastic Koopman operator, governs the evolution of system observables, in the mean. The eigenfunctions of these operators provide a powerful framework to analyze SDEs, and have shown to be particularly useful for systems of stochastic oscillators. However, computing these eigenfunctions typically requires solving high-dimensional PDEs on unbounded domains, which is numerically challenging. Building on previous work, we propose a data-driven artificial neural network solver for Koopman and Fokker-Planck eigenfunctions. Our approach incorporates the differential operator into the loss function, improving accuracy and reducing dependence on large amounts of accurate training data. We demonstrate our approach on several numerical examples in two, three, and four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Numerical Method for Space-Time Fractional Diffusion: A Stochastic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop and analyze a stochastic algorithm for solving space-time fractional diffusion models, which are widely used to describe anomalous diffusion dynamics. These models pose substantial numerical challenges due to the memory effect of the time-fractional derivative and the nonlocal nature of the spatial fractional Laplacian and the, leading to significant computational costs and storage demands, particularly in high-dimensional settings. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a Monte Carlo method based on the Feynman--Kac formula for space-time fractional models. The novel algorithm combines the simulation of the monotone path of a stable subordinator in time with the ``walk-on-spheres'' method that efficiently simulates the stable Levy jumping process in space. We rigorously derive error bounds for the proposed scheme, explicitly expressed in terms of the number of simulation paths and the time step size. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical error bounds and demonstrate the computational efficiency of the method, particularly in domains with complex geometries or high-dimensional spaces. Furthermore, both theoretical and numerical results emphasize the robustness of the proposed approach across a range of fractional orders, particularly for small fractional values, a capability often absent in traditional numerical methods.</description>

      <title>D3PINNs: A Novel Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework for Staged Solving of Time-Dependent Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Dynamic Domain Decomposition Physics-Informed Neural Networks (D3PINNs), for solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). In this framework, solutions of time-dependent PDEs are dynamically captured. First, an approximate
  solution is obtained by the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) containing the domain decomposition, then the time derivative terms in the PDE will be retained and the other terms associated with the solution will be replaced with the approximate solution. As a result, the PDE reduces to an ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Finally, the time-varying solution will be solved by the classical numerical methods for ODEs. D3PINNs retain the computational efffciency and ffexibility inherent to PINNs and enhance the ability for capturing solutions of time-dependent PDEs. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>A Chebyshev--Jackson series based block SS--RR algorithm for computing partial eigenpairs of real symmetric matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers eigenpair computations of large symmetric matrices with the desired eigenvalues lying in a given interval using the contour integral-based block SS--RR method, a Rayleigh--Ritz projection onto a certain subspace generated by moment matrices. Instead of using a numerical quadrature to approximately compute the moments by solving a number of large shifted complex linear systems at each iteration, we make use of the Chebyshev--Jackson (CJ) series expansion to approximate the moments, which only involves matrix-vector products and avoids expensive solutions of the linear systems. We prove that the CJ series expansions pointwise converge to the moments as the series degree increases, but at different convergence rates depending on point positions and moment orders. These extend the available convergence results on the zeroth moment of CJ series expansions to higher order ones. Based on the results established, we develop a CJ--SS--RR algorithm. Numerical experiments illustrate that the new algorithm is more efficient than the contour integral-based block SS--RR algorithm with the trapezoidal rule.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we review and systematically compare three finite element discretization methods for a harmonic map heat flow problem from the unit disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$ to the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in an unified framework. Numerical tests validate the convergence rates in a regime of smooth solutions and are used to compare the methods in terms of computational efficiency.

      <title>Tsunami modeling with dynamic seafloors: a high-order solver validated with shallow water benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent scientific studies have suggested that, in certain physical configurations, the time-dependent behavior of earthquake rupture and seafloor (bathymetry) motion can leave observable near-field signatures in tsunami wave generation and propagation. However, dynamic ground movement is often neglected in conventional tsunami models, which commonly assume instantaneous ground displacement (sourcing). This work introduces a pseudo-spectral algorithm for the solution of the nonlinear shallow water equations with timedependent seafloor displacement and velocity. Based on a Fourier continuation (FC) methodology for the accurate trigonometric interpolation of a non-periodic function, the solver provides high-order convergence in space and time; mild (linear) Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constraints for explicit time integration; and results that are effectively free of numerical dispersion (or ''pollution'') errors. Such properties enable the efficient and robust resolution of the different space-time scales involved modeling tsunamis generated by dynamic earthquake ground motion (including over long distances). Numerical experiments attesting to accuracy and computational performance are presented with direct comparisons to high-order finite difference methodologies. The solver is physically validated by a number of classical and semi-classical benchmark cases based on simulated or experimental data. Additionally, a seismologically realistic, first-of-its-kind parametric study based on earthquake speed is introduced, whose results-easily facilitated by the FC-based approach proposed herein, with minimal numerical tuning-further demonstrate the potential importance of (and the motivation herein for) incorporating time-dependent seafloor behavior in quantitative tsunami hazard assessment.</description>

      <title>High-order fully well-balanced numerical methods for one-dimensional blood flow with discontinuous properties, friction and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present well-balanced, high-order, semi-discrete numerical schemes for one-dimensional blood flow models with discontinuous mechanical properties and algebraic source terms representing friction and gravity. While discontinuities in model parameters are handled using the Generalized Hydrostatic Reconstruction, the presence of algebraic source terms implies that steady state solutions cannot always be computed analytically. In fact, steady states are defined by an ordinary differential equation that needs to be integrated numerically. Therefore, we resort on a numerical reconstruction operator to identify and, where appropriate, preserve steady states with an accuracy that depends on the reconstruction operator's numerical scheme. We extend our methods to deal with networks of vessels and show numerical results for single- and multiple-vessel tests, including a network of 118 vessels, demonstrating the capacity of the presented methods to outperform naive discretizations of the equations under study.</description>

      <title>Curvilinear coordinates and curvature in radiative transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a general expression for the streaming term in radiative transport equa- tions and other transport problems when formulated in curvilinear coordinates, emphasizing coordinate systems adapted to the geometry of the domain and the directional dependence of particle transport. By parametrizing the angular vari- able using a local orthonormal frame, we express directional derivatives in terms of curvature-related quantities that reflect the geometry of underlying spatial man- ifolds. Our formulation highlights how the interaction between coordinate choices and curvature influences the streaming operator, offering geometric interpretations of its components. The resulting framework offers intuitive insight into when and how angular dependence can be simplified and may guide the selection of coordinate systems that balance analytical tractability and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Uniform error analysis of a rectangular Morley finite element method on a Shishkin mesh for a 4th-order singularly perturbed boundary value problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problem $\varepsilon^2\Delta^2 u - \mathrm{div}\left(c\nabla u\right) = f$ is considered on the unit square $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with homogenous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Its solution typically contains boundary layers on all sides of~$\Omega$. It is discretised by a finite element method that uses rectangular Morley elements on a Shishkin mesh. In an associated energy-type norm that is natural for this problem, we prove an $O(\varepsilon^{1/2}N^{-1}+\varepsilon N^{-1}\ln N + N^{-3/2})$ rate of convergence for the error in the computed solution, where $N$~is the number of mesh intervals in each coordinate direction. Thus in the most troublesome regime when $\varepsilon \approx N^{-1}$, our method is proved to attain an $O(N^{-3/2})$ rate of convergence, which is shown to be sharp by our numerical experiments and is superior to the $O(N^{-1/2})$ rate that is proved in Meng &amp; Stynes, Adv. Comput. Math. 2019 when Adini finite elements are used to solve the same problem on the same mesh.</description>

      <title>Fast numerical derivatives based on multi-interval Fourier extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computationally efficient algorithm for stable numerical differentiation from noisy, uniformly-sampled data on a bounded interval. The method combines multi-interval Fourier extension approximations with an adaptive domain partitioning strategy: a global precomputation of local Fourier sampling matrices and their thin SVDs is reused throughout a recursive bisection procedure that selects locally-resolved Fourier fits. Each accepted subinterval stores a compact set of Fourier coefficients that are subsequently used to reconstruct the derivative via a precomputed differentiation operator. The stopping criterion balances fitting error and an explicit noise-level bound, and the algorithm automatically refines the partition where the function exhibits rapid oscillations or boundary activity. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, achieving accurate derivative reconstruction for challenging functions. The approach provides a robust framework for ill-posed differentiation problems while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Lattice Random Walk Discretisations of Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a lattice random walk discretisation scheme for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that samples binary or ternary increments at each step, suppressing complex drift and diffusion computations to simple 1 or 2 bit random values. This approach is a significant departure from traditional floating point discretisations and offers several advantages; including compatibility with stochastic computing architectures that avoid floating-point arithmetic in place of directly manipulating the underlying probability distribution of a bitstream, elimination of Gaussian sampling requirements, robustness to quantisation errors, and handling of non-Lipschitz drifts. We prove weak convergence and demonstrate the advantages through experiments on various SDEs, including state-of-the-art diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Optimization on the Extended Tensor-Train Manifold with Shared Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies tensors that admit decomposition in the Extended Tensor Train (ETT) format, with a key focus on the case where some decomposition factors are constrained to be equal. This factor sharing introduces additional challenges, as it breaks the multilinear structure of the decomposition. Nevertheless, we show that Riemannian optimization methods can naturally handle such constraints and prove that the underlying manifold is indeed smooth. We develop efficient algorithms for key Riemannian optimization components, including a retraction operation based on quasi-optimal approximation in the new format, as well as tangent space projection using automatic differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach through tensor approximation tasks and multidimensional eigenvalue problem.</description>

      <title>Objective Value Change and Shape-Based Accelerated Optimization for the Neural Network Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC (value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation. Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration method.</description>

      <title>A Deep-Learning Enhanced Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Method for Conjugate Heat Transfer Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current study aims to develop a non-intrusive Reduced Order Model (ROM) to reconstruct the full temperature field for a large-scale industrial application based on both numerical and experimental datasets. The proposed approach is validated against a domestic refrigerator. At the full order level, air circulation and heat transfer in fluid and between fluid and surrounding solids in the fridge were numerically studied using the Conjugated Heat Transfer (CHT) method to explore both the natural and forced convection-based fridge model followed by a parametric study-based on the ambient temperature, fridge fan velocity, and evaporator temperature. The main novelty of the current work is the introduction of a stable Artificial Neural Network (ANN) enhanced Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (GPOD) method which shows better performance than the conventional GPOD approach in such large-scale industrial applications. The full-order model is validated with the experimental results and the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model associated with different reduced-order approaches is compared with the benchmark numerical results or high-fidelity results. In our current work, we show that a prediction error of one degree centigrade and computational speed-up of 5000 is achieved even at a very sparse training dataset using the proposed deep-learning enhanced GPOD approach.</description>

      <title>Spectral Gaps with Quantum Counting Queries and Oblivious State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximating the $k$-th spectral gap $\Delta_k=|\lambda_k-\lambda_{k+1}|$ and the corresponding midpoint $\mu_k=\frac{\lambda_k+\lambda_{k+1}}{2}$ of an $N\times N$ Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues $\lambda_1\geq\lambda_2\geq\ldots\geq\lambda_N$, is an important special case of the eigenproblem with numerous applications in science and engineering. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm which approximates these values up to additive error $\epsilon\Delta_k$ using a logarithmic number of qubits. Notably, in the QRAM model, its total complexity (queries and gates) is bounded by $O\left( \frac{N^2}{\epsilon^{2}\Delta_k^2}\mathrm{polylog}\left( N,\frac{1}{\Delta_k},\frac{1}{\epsilon},\frac{1}{\delta}\right)\right)$, where $\epsilon,\delta\in(0,1)$ are the accuracy and the success probability, respectively. For large gaps $\Delta_k$, this provides a speed-up against the best-known complexities of classical algorithms, namely, $O \left( N^{\omega}\mathrm{polylog} \left( N,\frac{1}{\Delta_k},\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$, where $\omega\lesssim 2.371$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. A key technical step in the analysis is the preparation of a suitable random initial state, which ultimately allows us to efficiently count the number of eigenvalues that are smaller than a threshold, while maintaining a quadratic complexity in $N$. In the black-box access model, we also report an $\Omega(N^2)$ query lower bound for deciding the existence of a spectral gap in a binary (albeit non-symmetric) matrix.</description>

Abstract: We propose novel scale-invariant error estimators for the Monte Carlo and multilevel Monte Carlo estimation of mean and variance. For any linear transformation of the distribution of the quantity of interest, the computation cost across grid levels is optimized using a normalized error estimate, which is not only fully dimensionless but also remains robust to variation in characteristics of the distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms through application to a mechanical simulation of linear elastic bone tissue, where material uncertainty incorporating both heterogeneity and random anisotropy is considered in the constitutive law.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of adaptive approximations for stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14201v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study numerical approximations for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that use adaptive step sizes. In particular, we consider a general setting where decisions to reduce step sizes are allowed to depend on the future trajectory of the underlying Brownian motion. Since these adaptive step sizes may not be previsible, the standard mean squared error analysis cannot be directly applied to show that the numerical method converges to the solution of the SDE. Building upon the pioneering work of Gaines and Lyons, we instead use rough path theory to establish pathwise convergence for a wide class of adaptive numerical methods on general Stratonovich SDEs (with sufficiently smooth vector fields). To our knowledge, this is the first convergence guarantee that applies to standard solvers, such as the Milstein and Heun methods, with non-previsible step sizes. In our analysis, we require adaptive step sizes to have a "no skip" property and to take values at only dyadic times. Secondly, in contrast to the Euler-Maruyama method, we require the SDE solver to have unbiased "L\'evy area" terms in its Taylor expansion. We conjecture that for adaptive SDE solvers more generally, convergence is still possible provided the method does not introduce "L\'evy area bias". We present a simple example where the step size control can skip over previously considered times, resulting in the numerical method converging to an incorrect limit (i.e. not the Stratonovich SDE). Finally, we conclude with an experiment demonstrating the accuracy of Heun's method and a newly introduced Splitting Path-based Runge-Kutta scheme (SPaRK) when used with adaptive step sizes.</description>

      <title>A theoretical study on the effect of mass lumping on the discrete frequencies in immersogeometric analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In structural dynamics, mass lumping techniques are commonly employed for improving the efficiency of explicit time integration schemes and increasing their critical time step constrained by the largest discrete frequency of the system. For immersogeometric methods, Leidinger \cite{leidinger2020explicit} first showed in 2020 that for sufficiently smooth spline discretizations, the largest frequency was not affected by small trimmed elements if the mass matrix was lumped, a finding later supported by several independent numerical studies. This article provides a rigorous theoretical analysis aimed at unraveling this property. By combining linear algebra with functional analysis, we derive sharp analytical estimates capturing the behavior of the largest discrete frequency for lumped mass approximations and various trimming configurations. Additionally, we also provide estimates for the smallest discrete frequency, which has lately drawn closer scrutiny. Our estimates are then confirmed numerically for 1D and 2D problems.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a numerical method to solve a time-fractional Burgers equation, achieving order of convergence $(2-\alpha)$ in time, here $\alpha$ represents the order of the time derivative. The fractional derivative is modeled by Caputo-Prabhakar (CP) formulation, which incorporates a kernel defined by the three-parameter Mittag-Leffler function. Finite difference methods are employed for the discretization of the derivatives. To handle the non-linear term, the Newton iteration method is used. The proposed numerical scheme is proven to be stable and convergent in the $L_{\infty}$ norm. The validity of the theory is supported by two numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel localized Fourier extension method for approximating non-periodic functions via domain segmentation. By partitioning the computational domain into subregions with uniform discretization scales, the method achieves spectral accuracy at $\mathcal{O}(M)$ computational complexity. Theoretical error bounds and parameter dependency analyses validate the robustness of the proposed method. The relationship among the key parameters involved is analytically established, accompanied by an optimized parameter selection strategy. Numerical experiments further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we establish best approximation type error estimates for the fully discrete Galerkin solutions of the time-dependent Stokes problem using the stream-function formulation. For the time discretization we use the discontinuous Galerkin method of arbitrary degree, whereas we present the space discretization in a general framework. This makes our result applicable for a wide variety of space discretization methods, provided some Galerkin orthogonality conditions are satisfied. As an example, conformal $C^1$ and $C^0$ interior penalty methods are covered by our analysis. The results do not require any additional regularity assumptions beyond the natural regularity given by the domain and data and can be used for optimal control problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the Hu-Zhang element for linear elasticity to curved domains, preserving strong symmetry and H(div)-conformity. The non-polynomial structure of the curved Hu-Zhang element makes it difficult to analyze the stability, which is overcome by establishing a novel inf-sup condition. Optimal convergence rates are achieved for all variables except for the stress in the $L^2$-norm. This suboptimality originates from the fact that the divergence space of the curved Hu-Zhang element is not contained in the discrete displacement space, which is improved by local $p$-enrichment on boundary elements. Two numerical experiments validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a class of nonuniform time-stepping, high-order linear stabilized schemes that can preserve both the discrete energy stability and maximum-bound principle (MBP) for the time-fractional Allen-Cahn equation. To this end, we develop a new prediction strategy to obtain a second-order and MBP-preserving predicted solution, which is then used to handle the nonlinear potential explicitly. Additionally, we introduce an essential nonnegative auxiliary functional that enables the design of an appropriate stabilization term to dominate the predicted nonlinear potential, and thus to preserve the discrete MBP. Combining the newly developed prediction strategy and auxiliary functional, we propose two unconditionally energy-stable linear stabilized schemes, L1 and L2-$1_\sigma$ schemes. We show that the L1 scheme unconditionally preserves the discrete MBP, whereas the L2-$1_\sigma$ scheme requires a mild time-step restriction. Furthermore, we develop an improved L2-$1_\sigma$ scheme with enhanced MBP preservation for large time steps, achieved through a novel unbalanced stabilization term that leverages the boundedness and monotonicity of the auxiliary functional. Representative numerical examples validate the accuracy, effectiveness, and physics-preserving of the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Superstate Quantum Mechanics (SQM) as a theory that considers states in Hilbert space subject to multiple quadratic constraints. Traditional quantum mechanics corresponds to a single quadratic constraint of wavefunction normalization. In its simplest form, SQM considers states in the form of unitary operators, where the quadratic constraints are conditions of unitarity. In this case, the stationary SQM problem is a quantum inverse problem with multiple applications in physics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The SQM stationary problem is equivalent to a new algebraic problem that we address in this paper. The SQM non-stationary problem considers the evolution of a quantum system itself, distinct from the explicit time dependence of the Hamiltonian, $H(t)$. Two options for the SQM dynamic equation are considered: (1) within the framework of linear maps from higher-order quantum theory, where 2D-type quantum circuits are introduced to transform one quantum system into another; and (2) in the form of a Gross-Pitaevskii-type nonlinear map. Although no known physical process currently describes such 2D dynamics, this approach naturally bridges direct and inverse quantum mechanics problems, allowing for the development of a new type of computer algorithms. Beyond computer modeling, the developed theory could be directly applied if or when a physical process capable of solving a quantum inverse problem in a single measurement act (analogous to how an eigenvalue arises from a measurement in traditional quantum mechanics) is discovered in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A replicator dynamic for non-exchangeable agents in a continuous action space is formulated and its well-posedness is proven in a space of probability measures. The non-exchangeability allows for the analysis of evolutionary games involving agents with distinct (and possibly infinitely many) types. We also explicitly connect this replicator dynamic to a stationary mean field game, which determines the pairwise actions of the heterogeneous agents. Moreover, as a byproduct of our theoretical results, we show that a class of nonlinear voter models, recently the subject of increasing interest, called q-voter models, can be viewed as a replicator dynamic driven by a utility that is a power of the probability density. This implies that non-exchangeable and/or mean-field game formulations of these models can also be constructed. We also present computational examples of evolutionary and mean field game models using a finite difference method, focusing on tragedy of the commons and the q-voter model with non-exchangeable agents, of which are interesting cases from theoretical and computational perspectives.</description>
