      <title>Tunneling method for Hawking quanta in analogue gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogue Hawking radiation from acoustic horizons is now a well-established phenomenon, both theoretically and experimentally. Its persistence, despite the modified dispersion relations characterising analogue models, has been crucial in advancing our understanding of the robustness of this phenomenon against ultraviolet modifications of our spacetime description. However, previous theoretical approaches, such as the Bogoliubov transformation relating asymptotic states, have somewhat lacked a straightforward physical intuition regarding the origin of this robustness and its limits of applicability. To address this, we revisit analogue Hawking radiation using the tunneling method. We present a unified treatment that allows us to consider flows with and without acoustic horizons and with superluminal or subluminal dispersion relations. This approach clarifies the fundamental mechanism behind the resilience of Hawking radiation in these settings and explains the puzzling occurrence of excitations even in subcritical (supercritical) flows with subluminal (superluminal) dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal particle production in Einstein-Cartan gravity with modified Holst term and non-minimal couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-thermal fermionic particle production is investigated in Einstein-Cartan modified gravity with a modified Holst term and non-minimal couplings between the spin connection and a fermion. By using the auxiliary field method, the theory is rewritten into a pseudoscalar-tensor theory with Einstein-Hilbert action and canonical kinetic and potential terms for a pseudoscalar field. The introduced field is called Einstein-Cartan pseudoscalaron. If the potential energy of the Einstein-Cartan pseudoscalaron dominates the energy density of the early universe, it causes inflationary expansion. After the end of inflation, the pseudoscalaron develops a large value and the non-minimal couplings destabilize the vacuum. Evaluating the non-thermal fermionic particle production process, we obtain the mass and the helicity dependences of the produced particle number density. We show the model parameters to enhance the preheating and reheating processes.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the static vacuum asymptotically flat spacetimes with massive particle spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish that a four-dimensional static vacuum asymptotically flat spacetime containing a massive particle sphere is isometric to the Schwarzschild spacetime. Our results expand upon existing uniqueness theorems for static vacuum asymptotically flat spacetimes, which focus on scenarios featuring event horizons or photon spheres. Similarly to the uniqueness theorems concerning photon spheres or event horizons, only a single massive particle sphere is sufficient to obtain a unique solution. However, in contrast to previous theorems, our result leads to the existence of an entire spacetime foliation sliced by a set of massive particle spheres spanning various energies.</description>

      <title>Aspects of time evolution in $p$-form field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that higher form fields, specifically 2- and 3-forms in four spacetime dimensions, suffer from loss of hyperbolicity when they have self interaction. The equations of motion lose their wave-like characteristic in certain parts of the configuration space, and such problematic regions can also be reached dynamically from healthy initial data. These findings are analogous to recent results for vector fields, which are equivalently 1-forms, however, the details of the pathology can be different for higher forms. We also show that the possibility of more than one self interaction term in higher forms also leads to the amelioration of hyperbolicity problems.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of optical spring in an un-detuned cavity containing an optical parametric amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we demonstrate the capacity to manipulate the optical spring (OS) effect by employing an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) within an optical cavity. We observed more than a factor of 2 increase in the OS frequency shift with the OPA. We also showed for the first time that the OS can be tuned by solely adjusting the OPA phase and showing an un-detuned cavity exhibiting an optical spring. The method can be applied to gravitational wave detectors in the signal recycling configuration to realize narrow bandwidth high sensitivity. The OS can be tuned to align the detector peak sensitivity frequency to known frequency continuous gravitational wave signals, dynamically tuned to track the gravitational wave signal from merging compact binaries or tuned to search for the post-merger signal of known binary coalescence.</description>

      <title>The Penrose limit of the Weyl double copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We embed the Penrose limit into the Weyl classical double copy. Thereby, we provide a lift of the double copy properties of plane wave spacetimes into black hole geometries and we open a novel avenue towards taking the classical double copy beyond statements about algebraically special backgrounds. In particular, the Penrose limit, viewed as the leading order Fermi coordinate expansion around a null geodesic, complements approaches leveraging asymptotic flatness such as the asymptotic Weyl double copy. Along the way, we show how our embedding of the Penrose limit within the Weyl double copy naturally fixes the functional ambiguity in the double copy for Petrov type N spacetimes. We also highlight the utility of a spinorial approach to the Penrose limit. In particular, we use this spinorial approach to derive a simple analytical expression for arbitrary Penrose limits of four-dimensional, vacuum type D spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Amplitudes and Polarizations of Quadratic Quasi-Normal Modes for a Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity predicts the existence of quadratic quasi-normal modes at second order in perturbation theory. Building on our recent work, we compute the amplitudes and polarizations of these modes for non-rotating black holes, showing that they are completely determined by the amplitudes and polarizations of linear modes. We obtain the ratio of quadratic to linear amplitudes, which still depends on the initial conditions of the merger through the polarization of linear modes. However, we demonstrate that this dependence is captured by four fundamental numbers, independent of initial conditions, representing four different combinations of linear modes parities. Additionally, we prove two selection rules regarding the vanishing of classes of quadratic modes. Our results are available online as a package which provides the ratio of amplitudes across a broad spectrum of angular momenta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that particle detectors coupled to a massless quantum field through its derivative can genuinely harvest entanglement form the field even when they are in causal contact in flat spacetime. This is particularly relevant since the derivative coupling model captures some interesting experimentally realizable systems and since the harvested entanglement peaks at full light contact.</description>

      <title>The Unexpected Lack of Asymmetry in the Horizon-Scale Image of Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ring-like images of the two supermassive black holes captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provide powerful probes of the physics of accretion flows at horizon scales. Specifically, the brightness asymmetry in the images carries information about the angular velocity profile of the inner accretion flow and the inclination of the observer, owing to the Doppler boosts photons experience at their site of emission. In this paper, we develop a method for quantifying the brightness asymmetry of black-hole images in the Fourier domain, which can be measured directly from interferometric data. We apply this method to current EHT data and find that the image of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) has an unusually low degree of asymmetry that is even lower than that inferred for M87. We then use a covariant semi-analytic model to obtain constraints on the inclinations and velocity profiles of the inner accretion flow for Sgr A*. We find that the lack of significant brightness asymmetry forces the observer inclination to uncomfortably small values ($6-10^\circ$), if the plasma velocity follows Keplerian profiles. Alternatively, larger inclination angles can be accommodated if the plasma velocities are significantly sub-Keplerian and the black hole is not spinning rapidly.</description>

      <title>Stirring the false vacuum via interacting quantized bubbles on a 5564-qubit quantum annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False vacuum decay is a potential mechanism governing the evolution of the early Universe, with profound connections to non-equilibrium quantum physics, including quenched dynamics, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and dynamical metastability. The non-perturbative character of the false vacuum decay and the scarcity of its experimental probes make the effect notoriously difficult to study, with many basic open questions, such as how the bubbles of true vacuum form, move and interact with each other. Here we utilize a quantum annealer with 5564 superconducting flux qubits to directly observe quantized bubble formation in real time -- the hallmark of false vacuum decay dynamics. Moreover, we develop an effective model that describes the initial bubble creation and subsequent interaction effects. We demonstrate that the effective model remains accurate in the presence of dissipation, showing that our annealer can access coherent scaling laws in driven many-body dynamics of 5564 qubits for over $1\mu$s, i.e., more than 1000 intrinsic qubit time units. This work sets the stage for exploring late-time dynamics of the false vacuum at computationally intractable system sizes, dimensionality, and topology in quantum annealer platforms.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Scattering and Beyond from Extreme Mass Ratio Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a recently proposed effective field theory describing electromagnetically or gravitationally interacting massive particles in an expansion about their mass ratio, also known as the self-force (SF) expansion. By integrating out the deviation of the heavy particle about its inertial trajectory, we obtain an effective action whose only degrees of freedom are the lighter particle together with the photon or graviton, all propagating in a Coulomb or Schwarzschild background. The 0SF dynamics are described by the usual background field method, which at 1SF is supplemented by a "recoil operator" that encodes the wobble of the heavy particle, and similarly computable corrections appearing at 2SF and higher. Our formalism exploits the fact that the analytic expressions for classical backgrounds and particle trajectories encode dynamical information to all orders in the couplings, and from them we extract multiloop integrands for perturbative scattering. As a check, we study the two-loop classical scattering of scalar particles in electromagnetism and gravity, verifying known results. We then present new calculations for the two-loop classical scattering of dyons, and of particles interacting with an additional scalar or vector field coupling directly to the lighter particle but only gravitationally to the heavier particle.</description>

      <title>Testing cosmic anisotropy with Pade approximation and Pantheon+ sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmography can be used to constrain the kinematics of universe in a model-independent way. In this work, we attempted to combine the Pad$\rm \acute{e}$ approximations with the latest Pantheon+ sample for testing cosmological principle. Based on the Pad$\rm \acute{e}$ approximations, we first gave the cosmographic constraints on the different order polynomials including third-order (Pad$\rm \acute{e}$$_{(2,1)}$), fourth-order (Pad$\rm \acute{e}$$_{(2,2)}$) and fifth-order (Pad$\rm \acute{e}$$_{(3,2)}$). Based on the Pad$\rm \acute{e}$$_{(2,1)}$ ($j_{0}$ = 1) polynomial and hemisphere comparison (HC) method, we tested the cosmological principle and found the preferred directions of cosmic anisotropy, such as (l, b) = (304.6$^{\circ}$$_{-37.4}^{+51.4}$, $-$18.7$^{\circ}$$_{-20.3}^{+14.7}$) and (311.1$^{\circ}$$_{-8.4}^{+17.4}$, $-$17.53$^{\circ}$$_{-7.7}^{+7.8}$) for $q_{0}$ and $H_{0}$, respectively. These two directions are consistent with each other in $1\sigma$ confidence level, but the corresponding results of statistical isotropy analyses including Isotropy and Isotropy with real positions (RP) are quite different. The statistical significance of $H_{0}$ are stronger than that of $q_{0}$, i.e., 4.75$\sigma$ and 4.39$\sigma$ for the Isotropy and Isotropy with RP respectively. Reanalysis with fixed $q_{0} = -0.55$ (corresponds to $\Omega_{m}$ = 0.30) gives similar results. Overall, our model-independent results provide clear indications for a possible cosmic anisotropy, which must be taken seriously. Further test is needed to better understand this signal.</description>

      <title>Plunging region emission in the X-ray binary MAXI J0637$-$430</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the second of November 2019 the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J0637$-$430 went into outburst, at the start of which it was observed in a thermal ``disc-dominated'' state. High photon energy (extending above 10 keV) observations taken by the NuSTAR telescope reveal that this thermal spectrum can not be fit by conventional two-component (disc plus corona) approaches which ignore disc emission sourced from within the plunging region of the black hole's spacetime. Instead, these models require a third ``additional'' thermal component to reproduce the data. Using new disc solutions which extend classical models into the plunging region we show that this ``additional'' thermal emission can be explained self-consistently with photons emitted from the accretion flow at radii within the innermost stable circular orbit of the black hole. This represents the second low mass X-ray binary, after MAXI J1820+070, with a detection of plunging region emission, suggesting that signatures of this highly relativistic region may well be widespread but not previously widely appreciated. To allow for a detection of the plunging region, the black hole in MAXI J0637$-$430 must be at most moderately spinning, and we constrain the spin to be $a_\bullet &lt; 0.86$ at 99.9$\%$ confidence. We finish by discussing the observational requirements for the robust detection of this region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By working with the covariant phase space formalism, we have shown that not only can the Hamiltonian conjugate to a Killing vector field {\xi} be expressed as the sum of the associated Noether charge and {\xi} contracted with the Hilbert action boundary term for F(Riemann) gravity, but also be written as its contraction with another {\xi} independent tensor field. With this, we have proven the equivalence of Noether charge and Hilbert action boundary term formulae for the stationary black hole entropy in F(Riemann) gravity, which is further substantiated by our explicit computation using both formulae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional quantum gravity endowed with a positive cosmological constant and coupled to a conformal field theory of large and positive central charge. We study cosmological properties at the classical and quantum level. We provide a complete ADM analysis of the classical phase space, revealing a family of either bouncing or big bang/crunch type cosmologies. At the quantum level, we solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation exactly. In the semiclassical limit, we link the Wheeler-DeWitt state space to the classical phase space. Wavefunctionals of the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin type are identified, and we uncover a quantum version of the bouncing spacetime. We retrieve the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction from the disk path integral of timelike Liouville theory. To do so, we must select a particular contour in the space of complexified fields. The quantum information content of the big bang cosmology is discussed, and contrasted with the de Sitter horizon entropy as computed by a gravitational path integral over the two-sphere.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Star Properties with NJL and MFTQCD Model: A Bayesian Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composition of the core of neutron stars is still under debate. One possibility is that because of the high densities reached in their cores, matter could be deconfined into quark matter. The possible existence of hybrid stars is investigated using microscopic models to describe the different phases of matter. Within these microscopic models we aim at calculating the properties of neutron stars and matter. We want to probe the influence of pQCD calculations and analyze the properties that identify a transition to deconfined matter. A Bayesian approach using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling process is applied to generate 8 sets of equations of state. A Maxwell construction describes the deconfinement transition. For the hadronic phase, we consider a stiff and a soft EOS obtained from the Relativistic Mean Field model with non-linear meson terms. For the quark phase, we use two different models: the NJL model with multiquark interactions and the Mean Field Theory of QCD, similar to the MIT bag model with a vector term. The model parameters were determined by Bayesian inference imposing observations from NICER and the phase transition density range. We have also applied restrictions from the pQCD calculations. Hybrid stars are compatible with current observational data. The restrictions of pQCD reduce the value of the maximum mass. However, even when applying this restriction, the models were able to reach 2.1 to 2.3 solar masses. The conformal limit was not attained at the center of the most massive stars. The vector interactions are essential to describe hybrid stars with a mass above two solar masses. The multiquark interactions affect the limits of some quantities considered as indicators of the presence of a deconfined phase. It is possible to find a set of EOS, that predict that inside NS the renormalized matter trace anomaly is always positive.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Acceleration and the notion of Alternative Vacuum in Nash Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that Nash theory, a quadratic theory of Gravity, can describe a late-time cosmic acceleration without any exotic matter or cosmological constant. The observational viability of an exact cosmological solution of Nash theory is adjudged using a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation and JLA+OHD+BAO data sets. Departures from standard {\Lambda}CDM cosmology are noted and analyzed. We prove that the Nash vacuum dynamics is equivalent to the dynamics of an Einstein vacuum plus a self-interacting Higgs scalar field, only if a mild evolution of the Higgs Vacuum Expectation Value is allowed. This leads to variations in the mass scales of fundamental particles and the fine structure constant. The variations are found to fit nicely with the analysis of molecular absorption spectra from a series of Quasars.</description>

      <title>A new scale in the quasi-static limit of Aether Scalar Tensor Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the aims of Aether Scalar Tensor Theory (AeST) is to reproduce the successes of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) on galactic scales. Indeed, the quasi-static limit of AeST achieves precisely this, assuming that the vector field $\vec{A}$ vanishes and that the so-called ghost condensate can be neglected. The effects of the ghost condensate were investigated in detail in previous studies. Here, we focus on the assumption of a vanishing vector field. We argue that this assumption is not always justified and show how to correctly take into account the vector field, finding that the quasi-static limit depends on a model parameter $m_\times$. In the limit $m_\times \to 0$, one recovers the quasi-static limit with a vanishing vector field. In particular, one finds a two-field version of MOND. In the opposite limit, $m_\times \to \infty$, one finds a single-field version of MOND. We show that, in practice, much of the phenomenology of the quasi-static limit depends only very little on the value of $m_\times$. Still, for some observational tests, such as those involving wide binaries, $m_\times$ has percent-level effects that may be important.</description>

      <title>Curvature-enhanced multipartite coherence in the multiverse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we study quantum coherence of N-partite GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) and W states in the multiverse consisting of N causally disconnected de Sitter spaces. Interestingly, N-partite coherence increases monotonically as the curvature increases, while the Unruh effect destroys multipartite coherence in Rindler spacetime. Conversely, the curvature effect destroys quantum entanglement and discord, meaning that the curvature effect is beneficial to quantum coherence and harmful to quantum correlations in the multiverse. We find that, with the increase of n expanding de Sitter spaces, N-partite coherence of GHZ state increases monotonically for any curvature, while quantum coherence of the W state decreases or increases monotonically depending on the curvature. We find a distribution relationship, which indicates that the correlated coherence of N-partite W state is equal to the sum of all bipartite correlated coherence in the multiverse. Multipartite coherence exhibits unique properties in the multiverse, which argues that it may provide some evidence for the existence of the multiverse.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Spacetime With Multipole Moments: The Minimal Size Conjecture, Black Hole Shadow, and Gravitational Wave Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explicitly construct the vacuum solution of Einstein's equations with prescribed multipole moments. By observing the behavior of the multipole spacetime metric at small distances, we conjecture that for a sufficiently large multipole moment, there is a minimal size below which no object in nature can support such a moment. The examples we have investigated suggest that such minimal size scales as $(M_n)^{1/(n+1)}$ (instead of $(M_n/M)^{1/n}$), where $M$ is the mass and $M_n$ is the $n$th order multipole moment. With the metric of the "multipole spacetime", we analyze the shape of black hole shadow for various multipole moments and discuss the prospects of constraining the moments from shadow observations. In addition, we discuss the shift of gravitational wave phase with respect to those of the Kerr spacetime, for a test particle moving around an object with this set of multipole moments. These phase shifts are required for the program of mapping out the spacetime multipole moments based on gravitational wave observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examined the quantum properties of scalar-tensor gravity with a coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet term in the low energy limit, exploring both linear and quadratic couplings. We calculated the leading-order corrections to the non-relativistic one-body gravitational potential and the metric by studying the gravitational field of a point-like scalar particle. We studied light-like scattering and compared it with the classical theory. We found that the non-minimal coupling does not contribute to the small-angle scattering for the quadratic coupling but does in the case of linear coupling. The results provide an opportunity to constrain the linear non-minimal coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet term with forthcoming observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in investigating homogeneous but anisotropic spacetimes owing to their relation with nonrotating, uncharged black hole interiors. We present a description of axial perturbations for a massless scalar field minimally coupled to this geometry. We truncate the action at the quadratic perturbative order and tailor our analysis to compact spatial sections. Perturbations are described in terms of perturbative gauge invariants, linear perturbative constraints, and their canonically conjugate variables. The entire set, encompassing perturbations and homogeneous degrees of freedom, is consolidated into a canonical one. We employ a hybrid approach to quantize this system, integrating a quantum representation of the homogeneous sector using Loop Quantum Cosmology techniques with a conventional field quantization of the perturbations.</description>

      <title>Probing the signature of axions through the quasinormal modes of black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The axion-photon coupling allows the existence of a magnetically and electrically charged black hole (BH) solution endowed with a pseudo-scalar hair. For the Reissner-Nordstrom BH with a given total charge and mass, it is known that the quasinormal modes (QNMs) are independent of the mixture between the magnetic and electric charges due to the presence of electric-magnetic duality. We show that the BH with an axion hair breaks this degeneracy by realizing nontrivial QNMs that depend on the ratio between the magnetic and total charges. Thus, the upcoming observations of BH QNMs through gravitational waves offer an exciting possibility for probing the existence of both magnetic monopoles and the axion coupled to photons.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes of Analog Rotating Black Holes in 2-Dimensional Photon-Fluid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently found that the optical field fluctuations in self-defocusing media can be described by sound waves propagating in a two-dimensional photon-fluid. This photon-fluid is controlled by the driving beam and serves as the background in which the sound waves can experience an effective curved spacetime, such that it provides a new platform of studying analog black holes. In this paper, we are interested in investigating the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of this analog black hole in the photon-fluid model. Based on the master equation of motion of the optical field fluctuations, we calculate the frequencies of quasinormal modes (QNF) with three different numerical methods to make sure the QNF we get are reliable. Besides fundamental modes, we also try to calculate the overtones up to $n=3$ aiming to uncover more properties of QNF. The effects of angular velocity $\Omega_H$ of the black hole, the overtone number $n$ and the winding number $m$ on the QNF are investigated. Under the $m$ with opposite sign, we find that both the real and imaginary part of the QNF will show strikingly contrasting behaviors when the QNF is plotted against $\Omega_H$, and the similar contrast effects are also found when comparing the influences from winding number and overtone number. We hope that this work may potentially contribute to the future detections of QNMs in experimental settings of photon-fluid.</description>

      <title>The complete exterior spacetime of spherical Brans-Dicke stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the complete expression for the Brans Class I exterior spacetime explicitly in terms of the energy and pressures profiles of a stationary spherisymmetric gravity source. This novel and generic expression is achieved in a parsimonious manner, requiring only a subset of the Brans-Dicke field equation and the scalar equation. For distant orbiting test particles, this expression promptly provides a simple, closed and exact formula of the [textgreek]&lt;LaTeX&gt;\textgreek{g}&lt;/LaTeX&gt; Eddington parameter, which reads {\gamma}_{exact}=(({\omega}+1+({\omega}+2){\Theta})/({\omega}+2+({\omega}+1){\Theta})), where {\Theta} is the ratio of the star's "total pressure" integral over its energy integral. This non-perturbative result reproduces the usual Post-Newtonian (({\omega}+1)/({\omega}+2)) expression in the case of a "Newtonian star", in which the pressure is negligible with respect to the energy density. Furthermore, it converges to the General Relativity value ({\gamma}_{GR}=1) as the star's equation of state approaches that of ultra-relativistic matter (in which case {\Theta} approaches 1), a behavior consistent with broader studies on scalar-tensor gravity. Our derivation underscores the essence of these results involving (1) the key relevant portion of the Brans-Dicke field equations, (2) the uniqueness of the Brans Class I vacuum solution for the non-phantom action, viz. {\omega}&gt;-3/2, and (3) the involvement of only two free parameters in this solution, hence requiring two quantities (energy and pressure integrals) of the mass source to fully characterize the solution. From a practical standpoint, it elucidates how a given stellar interior structure model determines the star's exterior gravitational field and impacts the motions of light objects (such as planets and accretion disks) orbiting it.</description>

      <title>Spherical orbits around Kerr-Newman and Ghosh black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17277v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive study on spherical orbits around two types of black holes: Kerr-Newman black holes, which are charged, and Ghosh black holes, which are nonsingular. In this work, we consider both null and timelike cases of orbits. Utilizing the Mino formalism, all analytical solutions for the geodesics governing these orbits can be obtained. It turns out that all spherical photon orbits outside the black hole horizons are unstable. In the extremal cases of both models, we obtain the {\it photon boomerangs}. The existence of charge in the Kerr-Newman allows the orbits to transition between retrograde and prograde motions, and its increase tends to force the orbits to be more equatorial. On the other hand, the Ghosh black hole, characterized by a regular core and a lack of horizons in certain conditions, presents the possibility of observable stable spherical orbits in the so-called {\it no-horizon} condition. As the Ghosh parameter $k$ increases, trajectories tend to exhibit larger latitudinal oscillation amplitudes. We observe that as the Ghosh parameter $k$ increases the trajectories tend to have larger latitudinal oscillation amplitudes. Finally, we investigate the existence of {\it innermost stable spherical orbits} (ISSOs). Both black holes demonstrate the appearance of two branches of ISSO radii as a function of the Carter constant $\mathcal{C}$. However, there are notable differences in their behavior: in the case of the Kerr-Newman black hole, the branches merge at a critical value, beyond which no ISSO exists, while for the Ghosh black hole, the transcendental nature of the metric function causes the branches to become complex at some finite distance.</description>

Abstract: We review the description of classical gravitational scatterings of two compact objects by means of the eikonal framework. This encodes via scattering amplitudes both the motion of the bodies and the gravitational-wave signals that such systems produce. As an application, we combine the next-to-leading post-Minkowskian (PM) waveform derived in the post-Newtonian (PN) limit with the 4PM static loss due to the linear memory effect to reproduce known results for the total angular mometum loss in the center-of-mass frame up to $\mathcal O(G^4)$ and 2.5PN order. We also provide similar expressions for the change in the system's mass dipole, discussing the subtleties related to its sensitivity to the Coulombic components of the field and to the nonlinear memory effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supertranslation ambiguity of angular momentum is a long-standing problem in general relativity. In the context of post-Minkowskian expansion, the supertranslation ambiguity arises the puzzle of the angular momentum loss to start at ${\cal O}(G^2)$ or at ${\cal O}(G^3)$ in gravitational scattering. In this paper, we propose a generic prescription to fix the supertranslation ambiguity at the linear order in post-Minkowskian expansion which will uniquely determine the angular momentum loss. The proposal is self-contained in the post-Minkowskian expansion and involves only null infinity data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher dimensions on the properties of Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black holes, focusing on the photonsphere, black hole shadow, deflection angles, and quasinormal modes (QNMs). We find that these properties diminish as the dimensionality ($n$) of the black hole increases. Analysis of the shadow radius measured by the Event Horizon Telescope suggests non-integer dimensions around $n\lessgtr4$. We derive an analytic formula for the weak field deflection angle, highlighting the need for advanced sensitive detection devices to observe lensed images influenced by higher dimensions. Our study of QNMs using physics-informed neural networks and the WKB method reveals a convergence towards known relationships between QNM frequencies and photon-sphere orbit frequencies. Despite the energetic nature of perturbing fields in higher dimensions, their damping increases. This suggests a complex interplay between dimensionality and the dynamics of black hole phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quadratic algebraically special perturbations (ASPs) of the Schwarzschild black hole. Their dynamics are derived from the expansion up to second order in perturbation of the most general algebraically special twisting vacuum solution of general relativity. Following this strategy, we present analytical expressions for the axial-axial, polar-polar and polar-axial source terms entering in the dynamical equations. We show that these complicated inhomogeneous equations can be solved analytically and we present explicit expressions for the profiles of the quadratic ASPs. As expected, they exhibit exponential growth both at the past and future horizons even in the non-linear regime. We further use this result to analyze the quadratic zero modes and their interpretation in terms of quadratic corrections to mass and spin of the Schwarzschild black hole. The present work provides a direct extension beyond the linear regime of the original work by Couch and Newman.</description>

Abstract: One of the main predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes featuring a horizon beyond which nothing can escape. Gravitational waves from the remnants of compact binary coalescences have the potential to probe new physics close to the black hole horizons. This prospect is of particular interest given several quantum-gravity models that predict the presence of horizonless and singularity-free compact objects. The membrane paradigm is a generic framework that allows one to parametrise the interior of compact objects in terms of the properties of a fictitious fluid located at the object's radius. It has been used to derive the quasinormal mode spectrum of static horizonless compact objects. Extending the membrane paradigm to rotating objects is crucial to constrain the properties of the spinning merger remnants. In this work, we extend the membrane paradigm to linear order in spin and use it to analyse the relationships between the quasi-normal modes, the object's reflectivity, and the membrane parameters. We find a breaking of isospectrality between axial and polar modes when the object is partially reflecting or the compactness differs from the black hole case. We also find that in reflective ultracompact objects some of the modes tend towards instability as the spin increases. Finally, we show that the spin enhances the deviations from the black-hole quasinormal mode spectrum as the compactness decreases. This implies that spinning horizonless compact objects may be more easily differentiated than nonspinning ones in the prompt ringdown.</description>

      <title>A quantization of moduli spaces of 3-dimensional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a quantization of the moduli space $\mathcal{GH}_\Lambda(S\times\mathbb{R})$ of maximal globally hyperbolic Lorentzian metrics on $S\times \mathbb{R}$ with constant sectional curvature $\Lambda$, for a punctured surface $S$. Although this moduli space is known to be symplectomorphic to the cotangent bundle of the Teichm\"uller space of $S$ independently of the value of $\Lambda$, we define geometrically natural classes of observables leading to $\Lambda$-dependent quantizations. Using special coordinate systems, we first view $\mathcal{GH}_\Lambda(S\times\mathbb{R})$ as the set of points of a cluster $\mathscr{X}$-variety valued in the ring of generalized complex numbers $\mathbb{R}_\Lambda = \mathbb{R}[\ell]/(\ell^2+\Lambda)$. We then develop an $\mathbb{R}_\Lambda$-version of the quantum theory for cluster $\mathscr{X}$-varieties by establishing $\mathbb{R}_\Lambda$-versions of the quantum dilogarithm function. As a consequence, we obtain three families of projective unitary representations of the mapping class group of $S$. For $\Lambda &lt;0$ these representations recover those of Fock and Goncharov, while for $\Lambda\geq 0$ the representations are new.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing binary black hole precessional morphologies with gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precessional motion of binary black holes can be classified into one of three morphologies, based on the evolution of the angle between the components of the spins in the orbital plane: Circulating, librating around 0, and librating around $\pi$. These different morphologies can be related to the binary's formation channel and are imprinted in the binary's gravitational wave signal. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian model selection method to determine the preferred spin morphology of a detected binary black hole. The method involves a fast calculation of the morphology which allows us to restrict to a specific morphology in the Bayesian stochastic sampling. We investigate the prospects for distinguishing between the different morphologies using gravitational waves in the Advanced LIGO/Advanced Virgo network with their plus-era sensitivities. For this, we consider fiducial high- and low-mass binaries having different spin magnitudes and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We find that in the cases with high spin and high SNR, the true morphology is strongly favored with $\log_{10}$ Bayes factors $\gtrsim 4$ compared to both alternative morphologies when the binary's parameters are not close to the boundary between morphologies. However, when the binary parameters are close to the boundary between morphologies, only one alternative morphology is strongly disfavored. In the low-spin, high-SNR cases, the true morphology is still favored with a $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor $\sim 2$ compared to one alternative morphology. We also consider the gravitational wave signal from GW200129_065458 that has some evidence for precession (modulo data quality issues) and find that there is no preference for a specific morphology. Our method for restricting the prior to a given morphology is publicly available through an easy-to-use Python package called bbh_spin_morphology_prior. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Constraining the General Oscillatory Inflaton Potential with Freeze-in Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reheating phase after inflation is one of the least observationally constrained epochs in the evolution of the Universe. The forthcoming gravitational wave observatories will enable us to constrain at least some of the non-standard scenarios. For example, models where the radiation bath is produced by the perturbative inflaton decay that oscillates around the minimum of the potential of the form $V\propto\phi^{2n}$, with $n&gt;2$. In such scenarios a part of the inflationary gravitational wave spectrum becomes blue tilted, making it observable, depending on the inflation energy scale and the reheating temperature. The degeneracy between the latter two parameters can be broken if dark matter in the Universe is produced via the freeze-in mechanism. The combination of the independent measurement of dark matter mass with gravitational wave observations makes it possible to constrain the reheating temperature and the energy scale at the end of inflation, at least within some parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Vortices, topology and time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We relate physical time with the topology of magnetic field vortices. We base ourselves on a formulation of unimodular gravity where the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ appears as the canonical dual to a variable which on-shell becomes four-volume time. If the theory is restricted to a topological axionic form (viz. a parity-odd product of an electric and a magnetic field), such a time variable becomes the spatial integral of the Chern-Simons density. The latter equates to helicity, so that unimodular time is transmuted into the linking number of the vortices of the topological magnetic field, times their flux. With the added {\it postulate} that this flux is a universal constant, the flow of time can thus be interpreted as the progressive weaving of further links between magnetic field vortices, each link providing a quantum of time with value related to the fixed flux. Non-abelian extensions, and targetting parameters other than $\Lambda$ are briefly examined, exposing different types of vortices and a possible role for inter-linking leading to new phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Conformal Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scale-invariant extensions of the electroweak theory are not only attractive because they can dynamically generate the weak scale, but also due to their role in facilitating supercooled first-order phase transitions. We study the minimal scale-invariant $U(1)_{\rm D}$ extension of the standard model and show that Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) can be abundantly produced. The mass of these PBHs is bounded from above by that of the moon due to QCD catalysis limiting the amount of supercooling. Lunar-mass PBHs, which are produced for dark Higgs vev $v_\phi\simeq 20~\rm TeV$, correspond to the best likelihood to explain the HSC lensing anomaly. For $v_\phi\gtrsim 400~\rm TeV$, the model can explain hundred per cent of dark matter. At even larger hierarchy of scales, it can contribute to the $511~\rm keV$ line. While the gravitational wave (GW) signal produced by the HSC anomaly interpretation is large and detectable by LISA above astrophysical foreground, the dark matter interpretation in terms of PBHs can not be entirely probed by future GW detection. This is due to the dilution of the signal by the entropy injected during the decay of the long-lived $U(1)_{\rm D}$ scalar. This extended lifetime is a natural consequence of the large hierarchy of scales.</description>

Abstract: We investigate how the speed of propagation of physical excitations is encoded in the coefficients of five-point interactions. This leads to a superluminality bound on scalar five-point interactions, which we present here for the first time. To substantiate our result, we also consider the case of four-point interactions for which bounds from S-matrix sum rules exist and show that these are parametrically equivalent to the bounds obtained within our analysis. Finally, we extend the discussion to a class of higher-point interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the method of smoothed asymptotics developed by Terence Tao, we introduce a new ultra-violet regularisation scheme for loop integrals in quantum field theory which we call $\eta$ regularisation. This allows us to reveal a surprising connection between the elimination of divergences in divergent series of powers and the preservation of gauge invariance in the regularisation of loop integrals in quantum field theory. In particular, we note that a method for regularising the series of natural numbers so that it converges to minus one twelfth inspires a regularisation scheme for non-abelian gauge theories coupled to Dirac fermions that preserves the Ward identity for the vacuum polarisation tensor. We also comment on a possible connection to Schwinger proper time integrals.</description>

      <title>Swamplandish Unification of the Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a short overview of recent progress made in our understanding of the dark sector based on the Swampland program which in turn is rooted in lessons from string theory. We explain how the existence of one extra mesoscopic dimension (the ``dark dimension") in the micron range emerges and how this can lead to a unification of the dark energy and dark matter. In particular the smallness of the dark energy leads to the prediction of the existence of a tower of weakly interacting light particles which can naturally play the role of dark matter. Moreover this unifies dark matter with gravity as dark matter ends up being excitations of graviton in the dark dimension. We also explain how in combination with other Swampland principles one finds an explanation of the ``why now" and the ``cosmological coincidence" problems. This model is consistent with the cosmological bounds as well as the Newton's inverse square law, but makes predictions which differ from $\Lambda$CDM. It also gives rise to an appealing picture of hierarchy of scales in particle physics pegged to the dark energy, including a possible origin of the electroweak hierarchy and the prediction of masses of QCD axion and sterile neutrinos both in the 1-10 meV range. This review is intended for a broad audience of high energy theorists and cosmologists without prior knowledge of string theory and it explains the motivations and predictions of this program in a non-technical form.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waveform: A Tale of Two Formalisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the quantum-amplitude-based derivation of the gravitational waveform emitted by the scattering of two spinless massive bodies at the third order in Newton's constant, $h \sim G+G^2+G^3$ (one-loop level), and correspondingly update its comparison with its classically-derived multipolar-post-Minkowskian counterpart. A spurious-pole-free reorganization of the one-loop five-point amplitude substantially simplifies the post-Newtonian expansion. We find complete agreement between the two results up to the fifth order in the small velocity expansion after taking into account three subtle aspects of the amplitude derivation: (1) in agreement with [arXiv:2312.07452 [hep-th]], the term quadratic in the amplitude in the observable-based formalism [JHEP 02, 137 (2019)] generates a frame rotation by half the classical scattering angle; (2) the dimensional regularization of the infrared divergences of the amplitude introduces an additional $(d-4)/(d-4)$ finite term; and (3) zero-frequency gravitons are found to contribute additional terms both at order $h \sim G^1$ and at order $h \sim G^3$ when including disconnected diagrams in the observable-based formalism.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical and relativistic modeling of the recoiling black-hole candidate in quasar 3C 186</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The compact object in quasar 3C 186 is one of the most promising recoiling black-hole candidates, exhibiting both an astrometric displacement between the quasar and the host galaxy as well as a spectroscopic shift between broad and narrow lines. 3C 186 also presents a radio jet which, when projected onto the plane of the sky, appears to be perpendicular to the quasar/galaxy displacement. Assuming a gravitational-wave kick is indeed responsible for the properties of 3C 186 and using state-of-the-art relativistic modeling, we show that current observations allow for exquisite modeling of the recoiling black hole. Most notably, we find that the kick velocity, the black-hole spin, and the line of sight are almost collinear and the former appear perpendicular to each other only because of a strong projection effect. The targeted configuration requires substantial fine-tuning: while there exists a region in the black-hole binary parameter space that is compatible with 3C 186, the observed system appears to be a rare occurrence. Using archival radio observations, we explore different strategies that could potentially confirm or rule out our interpretation. In particular, we develop two observational tests that rely on the brightness ratio between the approaching and receding jet as well as the asymmetry of the jet lobes. While the available radio data provide loose constraints, deeper observations have the unique potential of unveiling the nature of 3C 186.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the radial action of a spinning probe particle in Kerr spacetime from the worldline formalism in the first-order form, focusing on linear in spin effects. We then develop a novel covariant Dirac bracket formalism to compute the impulse and the spin kick directly from the radial action, generalizing some conjectural results in the literature and providing ready-to-use expressions for amplitude calculations with generic spin orientations. This allows, for the first time, to find new covariant expressions for scattering observables in the probe limit up to $\mathcal{O}(G^6 s_1 s_2^4)$. Finally, we use the action-angle representation to compute the fundamental frequencies for generic bound orbits, including the intrinsic spin precession, the periastron advance and the precession of the orbital plane.</description>

      <title>Effect of spin in binary neutron star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of spin on equal and unequal mass binary neutron star mergers using finite-temperature, composition-dependent Hempel-Schaffner-Bielich (SFHo) equation of state, via 3+1 general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations which take into account neutrino emission and absorption. Equal mass cases that have a mass of $M_{1,2}$ =$1.27$, $1.52$ and $2.05M_{\odot}$, result in a supramassive neutron star, a delayed, and a prompt collapse to a black hole, respectively. For all cases, we analyse the effect of initial spin on dynamics, on the structure of the final remnant, its spin evolution, the amount and composition of the ejected matter, gravitational waves, neutrino energy and luminosities, and disc masses. We show that in equal mass binary neutron star mergers, the ejected mass could reach $\sim0.085M_{\odot}$ for highly aligned-spins ($\chi=0.67$). The black hole which results from such highly spinning, high-mass binary neutron star merger reaches a dimensionless spin of $0.92$; this is the highest spin reached in binary neutron star mergers, to date.</description>

      <title>The Separate Universe approach for multifield inflation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes could constitute part or all of dark matter but they require large inhomogeneities to form in the early universe. These inhomogeneities can strongly backreact on the large scale dynamics of the universe. Stochastic inflation provides a way of studying this backreaction and getting an estimation of the abundance of primordial black holes. Because stochastic inflation focuses on large scale dynamics, it rests on the separate universe approach. However, the validity of this approach has only been checked in single field models, but not in multifield models in which we expect strong boosts in the power spectrum, leading to the formation of primordial black holes. We will check the validity of a separate universe approach in multifield models by matching it with a complete cosmological perturbation theory approach at large scales. In particular, we wish to compare these two paradigms and their differences in the adiabatic and entropic directions of the phase space. This will give us a range of validity and conditions one needs to verify in order to apply the separate universe approach and stochastic inflation in multifield models.</description>

Abstract: Dark Energy Survey five-year supernovae data (DES 5YR SNe) in conjunction with Planck CMB and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO data has detected a strong dynamical dark energy deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. Here, we shift the focus of DES data to the pressureless matter sector in the $\Lambda$CDM model by studying the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$. Employing frequentist profile likelihoods, we demonstrate that $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift in the DES dataset at up to $2.5 \sigma$ level. At the highest redshifts, one encounters negative dark energy densities $\Omega_m &gt; 1$. Our findings corroborate earlier observations in Pantheon and Pantheon+ datasets with an independent SNe dataset with a higher effective redshift. In an appendix, we confirm that curvature $\Omega_k$ decreases with effective redshift disfavouring a flat Universe in higher redshift DES SNe at $&gt; 3 \sigma$. Our choice of $\Omega_k$ prior leads to an underestimation of the tension with a flat Universe.</description>

Abstract: This paper delves into the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe and the evolution of cosmic structures within the context of a specific \( f(R, L_m) \) gravity model, formulated as \( f(R, L_m) = \lambda R + \beta L_m^\alpha + \eta \). To study the cosmological viability of the model, we employed the latest cosmic measurement datasets: i) 57 observational Hubble parameter data points (\texttt{OHD}); ii) 1048 distance moduli data points (\texttt{SNIa}); iii) a combined dataset (\texttt{OHD+SNIa}); and large scale structure datasets, including iv) 14 growth rate data points (\texttt{f}); and v) 30 redshift space distortion data points (\texttt{f}$\sigma_8$). These datasets facilitated the constraint of the \( f(R, L_m) \)-gravity model via MCMC simulations, followed by a comparative analysis with the \(\Lambda\)CDM model. A comprehensive statistical analysis has been conducted to evaluate the \( f(R, L_m) \)-gravity model's efficacy in explaining both the accelerated expansion of the universe and the growth of cosmic structures.</description>

      <title>Entanglement island and Page curve of Hawking radiation in rotating Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the information paradox of rotating Kerr black holes by employing the recently proposed island rule. It is known that the scalar field theory near the Kerr black hole horizon can be reduced to the 2-dimensional effective theory. Working within the framework of the 2-dimensional effective theory and assuming the small angular momentum limit, we demonstrate that the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation from the non-extremal Kerr black hole follows the Page curve and saturates the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at late times. In addition, we also discuss the effect of the black hole rotation on the Page time and scrambling time. For the extreme Kerr black hole, the entanglement entropy at late times also approximates the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the extreme Kerr black hole. These results imply that entanglement islands can provide a semi-classical resolution of the information paradox for rotating Kerr black holes.</description>
