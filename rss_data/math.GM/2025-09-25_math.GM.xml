      <title>Symmetry and Pseudosymmetry properties with Ricci soliton of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary objective of the article is to investigate the symmetry and pseudosymmetry properties of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter (briefly, RNdS) spacetime. The secondary aim of the paper is to explore the notion of Ricci solitons in RNdS spacetimes. The study is important due to the conceding of almost Ricci soliton and almost Ricci Yamabe soliton of the RNdS spacetime. The analysis shows that this spacetime satisfies multiple types of symmetric and pseudosymmetric conditions. It is interesting to note that RNdS spacetime reveled pseudosymmetry, conformal pseudosymmetry, Weyl projective pseudosymmetry, conharmonic pseudosymmetry, and concircular pseudosymmetry. Furthermore, in the RNdS spacetime, obtained by second order covariant derivatives $R\cdot R$ is linearly dependent on $Q(S,R)$ and $Q(g,C)$. It is demonstrated that the RNdS spacetime is 2-quasi Einstein and an Ein(2) space with recurrent conformal 2-forms. We derive the general form of the compatible tensors for this spacetime. The energy-momentum tensor of the RNdS spacetime is also shown to be pseudosymmetric and also the energy momentum tensor is pseudosymmetric due to conformal, conharmonic, concircular and projective curvature tensor. The energy momentum tensor is compatible with these curvature. We study a generalized notion of curvature inheritance and find that, with respect to the non-Killing vector fields $\partial/\partial r$ and $\partial/\partial \theta$, the RNdS spacetime does not satisfy these inheritance conditions. However, the RNdS spacetime is shown to admit an almost Ricci soliton and an almost $\eta$-Ricci Yamabe soliton with respect to the non-Killing vector field $\partial/\partial r$ but with respect to the non-Killing vector field $\partial/\partial \theta$ the spacetime does not admit such notions. Finally, we present a comparison between the RNdS and Vaidya-Bonner-de Sitter (VBdS) spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: Let $p&gt;1$ be a large prime number, let $q=O(\log\log p)$ and let $1\leq a&lt;q$ be a pair of relatively prime integers. It is proved that there is a prime primitive root $u\ll (\log p)(\log \log p)^5$ such that $u\equiv a\bmod q$ in the prime finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$.</description>

      <title>The properties of general Fourier partial sums of functions $f \in C_L$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence properties of Fourier partial sums associated with general orthonormal systems, focusing on functions that belong to specific differentiable function classes. While classical Fourier analysis has extensively studied trigonometric systems, our approach considers a broader class of orthonormal systems, including those adapted to weighted function spaces or arising from orthogonal polynomials. The primary objective is to analyze how the smoothness and differentiability of the function \( f \) affect the rate and nature of convergence of its Fourier partial sums. We derive estimates for the approximation error in various norms and establish sufficient conditions under which uniform or pointwise convergence occurs. In particular, we highlight how differentiability constraints on \( f \) can lead to sharper convergence results than those available for general \( L^2 \)-functions. Furthermore, we explore the impact of specific system properties, such as localization and boundedness, on the summation behavior. Several illustrative examples are provided, demonstrating the theoretical findings for commonly used orthonormal systems. Our results contribute to the deeper understanding of spectral approximations and have potential applications in numerical analysis, signal processing, and the theory of function spaces.</description>

      <title>Initial Value Problems for Some Functional Equations and the PENLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study initial value problems for a class of functional equations. We introduce the concept of appropriate initial sets to enable the unique extension of an initial function into a solution defined over larger domains. Our analysis characterizes the structure and size of these initial sets, illustrating how functions specified on them can be uniquely extended to broader regions. Furthermore, we propose the Principle of Exclusion of Neighborhoods of Limit Points (PENLP)-a novel conceptual framework that elucidates the behavior of solutions near limit points and their impact on the extension process. We demonstrate that the initial sets must avoid the limit points of the functional equations to ensure uniqueness and well-posedness. The functional equations examined in this study include: $$ y(x+1)= y(bx),\quad b \neq 0, $$ $$ y(x)=y(2x),\quad y(x)=y(-2x),\quad y(3x)=y(x)+y(2x), $$ as well as the equations characterizing even functions and odd functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove and discuss some new $\left( H_{p},weak-L_{p}\right) $ type inequalities of maximal operators of $T$ means with respect to Vilenkin systems with monotone coefficients. We also apply these results to prove a.e. convergence of \ such $T$ means. It has also been proven that these results are the best possible in a special sense. As applications, both well-known and new results are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Conic optimization techniques yield sufficient conditions for set-completely positive matrix completion under arrowhead specification pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix completion results deal with the question of when a partially specified symmetric matrix can be completed to a member of certain matrix cones. Results from positive semidefinite matrix completion and completely positive matrix completion have been successfully applied in optimization to greatly reduce the number of variables in conic optimization problems in the space of symmetric matrices. In this text, we go the other direction and show that we can use tools from conic optimization (more precisely: from copositive optimization) to establish a new completion result that complements the existing literature in two regards: firstly, we consider set-completely positive matrix completion, which generalizes completion with respect to the traditional completely positive matrix cone. Secondly, we consider a specification pattern that is not in the scope of classical results for completely positive matrix completion. Namely, we consider arrow-head specification patterns where the width is equal to one. Our theory is applied to a class of quadratic optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Row completion of polynomial and rational matrices II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the row completion problem of polynomial and rational matrices with partial prescription of the structural data. The prescription of the complete structural data has been solved in Amparan et al., Lin. Alg. Appl. 720 (2025) 109-138, where several results of prescription of some of the four types of invariants composing the structural data have also been obtained. In this paper we deal with the cases not analyzed there. More precisely, we solve the row completion problem of a rational or a polynomial matrix when we prescribe the infinite (finite) structure and the column and/or the row minimal indices, and when only the column and/or row minimal indices are prescribed. The necessity of the conditions obtained are valid over arbitrary fields, but in some cases the proof of the sufficiency requires working over algebraically closed fields. By transposition the results obtained hold for the corresponding column completion problems.</description>

      <title>Geometric Constructions through Ordered Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work discusses an approach to solving geometric construction problems in which the given figure is included in a set ordered by construction steps. The flow of information is carried through the chain, allowing the original problem to be transformed and solved in a broader context. For demonstration, three classical tasks of construction are considered: proportional segments, a Gothic detail, and proportional angles.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Infinite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a novel mathematical technique for dealing with the infinities arising from divergent sums and integrals. It assigns them fine-grained infinite values from the set of hyperreal numbers in a manner that refines the standard theories of summation and integration. This has implications in statistics (helping us work with distributions whose mean or variance is infinite), decision theory (allowing comparison of options with infinite expected values), economics (allowing evaluation of infinitely long streams of utility without discounting), and ethics (allowing evaluation of infinite worlds). There are even implications for finite cases, as the ability to handle these infinities undermines a common argument for bounded utility and the discounting of future utility.</description>
