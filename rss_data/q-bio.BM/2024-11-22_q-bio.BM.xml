      <title>Interpretable QSPR Modeling using Recursive Feature Machines and Multi-scale Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study pioneers the application of Recursive Feature Machines (RFM) in QSPR modeling, introducing a tailored feature importance analysis approach to enhance interpretability. By leveraging deep feature learning through AGOP, RFM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in predicting molecular properties, as demonstrated through solubility prediction across nine benchmark datasets. To capture a wide array of structural information, we employ diverse molecular representations, including MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints, and a custom multi-scale hybrid fingerprint (HF) derived from global descriptors and SMILES local fragmentation techniques. Notably, the HF offers significant advantages over MACCS and Morgan fingerprints in revealing structural determinants of molecular properties. The feature importance analysis in RFM provides robust local and global explanations, effectively identifying structural features that drive molecular behavior and offering valuable insights for drug development. Additionally, RFM demonstrates strong redundancy-filtering abilities, as model performance remains stable even after removing redundant features within custom fingerprints. Importantly, RFM introduces the deep feature learning capabilities of the average gradient outer product (AGOP) matrix into ultra-fast kernel machine learning, to imbue kernel machines with interpretable deep feature learning capabilities. We extend this approach beyond the Laplace Kernel to the Matern, Rational Quadratic, and Gaussian kernels, to find that the Matern and Laplace kernels deliver the best performance, thus reinforcing the flexibility and effectiveness of AGOP in RFM. Experimental results show that RFM-HF surpasses both traditional machine learning models and advanced graph neural networks.</description>

      <title>Machine learning framework to predict the performance of lipid nanoparticles for nucleic acid delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are highly effective carriers for gene therapies, including mRNA and siRNA delivery, due to their ability to transport nucleic acids across biological membranes, low cytotoxicity, improved pharmacokinetics, and scalability. A typical approach to formulate LNPs is to establish a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) between their compositions and in vitro/in vivo activities which allows for the prediction of activity based on molecular structure. However, developing QSAR for LNPs can be challenging due to the complexity of multi-component formulations, interactions with biological membranes, and stability in physiological environments. To address these challenges, we developed a machine learning framework to predict the activity and cell viability of LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. We curated data from 6,398 LNP formulations in the literature, applied nine featurization techniques to extract chemical information, and trained five machine learning models for binary and multiclass classification. Our binary models achieved over 90% accuracy, while the multiclass models reached over 95% accuracy. Our results demonstrated that molecular descriptors, particularly when used with random forest and gradient boosting models, provided the most accurate predictions. Our findings also emphasized the need for large training datasets and comprehensive LNP composition details, such as constituent structures, molar ratios, nucleic acid types, and dosages, to enhance predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Investigating Graph Neural Networks and Classical Feature-Extraction Techniques in Activity-Cliff and Molecular Property Prediction</title>

Abstract: Molecular featurisation refers to the transformation of molecular data into numerical feature vectors. It is one of the key research areas in molecular machine learning and computational drug discovery. Recently, message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a novel method to learn differentiable features directly from molecular graphs. While such techniques hold great promise, further investigations are needed to clarify if and when they indeed manage to definitively outcompete classical molecular featurisations such as extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) and physicochemical-descriptor vectors (PDVs). We systematically explore and further develop classical and graph-based molecular featurisation methods for two important tasks: molecular property prediction, in particular, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) prediction, and the largely unexplored challenge of activity-cliff (AC) prediction. We first give a technical description and critical analysis of PDVs, ECFPs and message-passing GNNs, with a focus on graph isomorphism networks (GINs). We then conduct a rigorous computational study to compare the performance of PDVs, ECFPs and GINs for QSAR and AC-prediction. Following this, we mathematically describe and computationally evaluate a novel twin neural network model for AC-prediction. We further introduce an operation called substructure pooling for the vectorisation of structural fingerprints as a natural counterpart to graph pooling in GNN architectures. We go on to propose Sort &amp; Slice, a simple substructure-pooling technique for ECFPs that robustly outperforms hash-based folding at molecular property prediction. Finally, we outline two ideas for future research: (i) a graph-based self-supervised learning strategy to make classical molecular featurisations trainable, and (ii) trainable substructure-pooling via differentiable self-attention.</description>

      <title>S-MolSearch: 3D Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning for Bioactive Molecule Search</title>

Abstract: Virtual Screening is an essential technique in the early phases of drug discovery, aimed at identifying promising drug candidates from vast molecular libraries. Recently, ligand-based virtual screening has garnered significant attention due to its efficacy in conducting extensive database screenings without relying on specific protein-binding site information. Obtaining binding affinity data for complexes is highly expensive, resulting in a limited amount of available data that covers a relatively small chemical space. Moreover, these datasets contain a significant amount of inconsistent noise. It is challenging to identify an inductive bias that consistently maintains the integrity of molecular activity during data augmentation. To tackle these challenges, we propose S-MolSearch, the first framework to our knowledge, that leverages molecular 3D information and affinity information in semi-supervised contrastive learning for ligand-based virtual screening. Drawing on the principles of inverse optimal transport, S-MolSearch efficiently processes both labeled and unlabeled data, training molecular structural encoders while generating soft labels for the unlabeled data. This design allows S-MolSearch to adaptively utilize unlabeled data within the learning process. Empirically, S-MolSearch demonstrates superior performance on widely-used benchmarks LIT-PCBA and DUD-E. It surpasses both structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening methods for AUROC, BEDROC and EF.</description>

      <title>Structure-Based Molecule Optimization via Gradient-Guided Bayesian Update</title>

Abstract: Structure-based molecule optimization (SBMO) aims to optimize molecules with both continuous coordinates and discrete types against protein targets. A promising direction is to exert gradient guidance on generative models given its remarkable success in images, but it is challenging to guide discrete data and risks inconsistencies between modalities. To this end, we leverage a continuous and differentiable space derived through Bayesian inference, presenting Molecule Joint Optimization (MolJO), the first gradient-based SBMO framework that facilitates joint guidance signals across different modalities while preserving SE(3)-equivariance. We introduce a novel backward correction strategy that optimizes within a sliding window of the past histories, allowing for a seamless trade-off between explore-and-exploit during optimization. Our proposed MolJO achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossDocked2020 benchmark (Success Rate 51.3% , Vina Dock -9.05 and SA 0.78), more than 4x improvement in Success Rate compared to the gradient-based counterpart, and 2x "Me-Better" Ratio as much as 3D baselines. Furthermore, we extend MolJO to a wide range of optimization settings, including multi-objective optimization and challenging tasks in drug design such as R-group optimization and scaffold hopping, further underscoring its versatility and potential.</description>
