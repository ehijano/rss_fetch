      <title>Distribution of ${}^{7}$Li Implants in Nb Films for a Sterile Neutrino Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BeEST experiment is measuring the ${}^{7}$Li recoil spectrum from the decay of ${}^{7}$Be implanted into Ta-based sensors to provide the most stringent limits on the existence of sterile neutrinos in the sub-MeV mass range. Its sensitivity is limited by spectral broadening due to interactions between the atomic shell of the ${}^{7}$Be/${}^{7}$Li and the Ta sensor film. This study is investigating the suitability of Nb as an alternative sensor material by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) of ${}^{7}$Li-implanted Nb films. STEM does not detect any change in the microstructure of polycrystalline Nb due to ${}^{7}$Li implantation. APT reveals some segregation of ${}^{7}$Li at grain boundaries in Nb. While this may slightly alter the ${}^{7}$Li binding energies, the effect on the recoil spectrum is not expected to be strong enough to preclude using Nb-based detectors in future phases of the BeEST experiment.</description>

      <title>Embedding the Timepix4 in Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs) and pixel charge readout enables specific experimental opportunities. Using the Timepix4 for the readout is advantageous because of its size (around 7 cm^2 active area) and its Through Silicon Vias. The latter enables to connect to the Timepix4 from the back side. Thus, it can be tiled on four sides, allowing it to cover large areas without loss of active area.
  Here, the first results of reading out MPGDs with the Timepix4 are presented. Measurements with a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detector show that event selection based on geometrical parameters of the interaction is possible, X-ray imaging studies can be performed, as well as energy and time-resolved measurements. In parallel, the embedding of a Timepix4 into a micro-resistive Well (uRWell) amplification structure is explored. The first mechanical tests have been successful. The status of the electrical functionality is presented, as well as simulation studies on the signal induction in such a device.</description>

      <title>Performance study of the Highly Granular Neutron Detector prototype in the BM@N experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-of-flight Highly Granular Neutron Detector (HGND) with a multilayer longitudinal structure of interleaved absorber and scintillator plates, high transverse granularity and a time resolution of about 150 ps is currently under development. The detector is designed to identify neutrons produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions and measure neutron kinetic energies of 0.3-4 GeV by the time-of-flight method in the BM@N experiment at the NICA accelerator complex at JINR. In order to validate the concept of the full-scale HGND, a compact HGND prototype was first designed and built, and its performance was studied in the BM@N experiment. The acceptance of the HGND prototype and the detection efficiency of forward neutrons emitted in hadronic fragmentation and electromagnetic dissociation (EMD) of 3.8A GeV $^{124}$Xe projectiles interacting with a CsI target were calculated by means of the DCM-QGSM-SMM and RELDIS models, respectively. The energy distributions of forward spectator neutrons and neutrons from the EMD were measured and compared with the simulations. The developed methods will be used to calibrate the full-scale HGND and to study its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Offset sideband locking to iodine for laser cooling on the $\mathrm{{}^1 S_0}\rightarrow \mathrm{{}^3 P_1}$ transition of ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present absolute frequency measurements of a laser stabilized using an offset sideband locking technique on the P(49)24-1 rovibrational transition of $^{127}\mathrm{I}_2$ near 556 nm. The P(49)24-1 transition is offset by 4.8 GHz from the intercombination transition of ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$. A dual-tone electro-optical modulator is employed to bridge this frequency gap, enabling frequency stabilization of the 556 nm laser near the Yb transition, achieving a fractional frequency stability of $1.2 \times 10^{-11}$ at one second. We thoroughly characterize the frequency shifts associated with this locking scheme, with typical systematic effects fractional uncertainties of $9 \times 10^{-12}$.</description>

      <title>A custom experimental setup for scintillator characterization: application to a Ce-doped GAGG crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scintillators are widely used in radiation detection, with continuous advancements enhancing their performance and developing new materials. This study presents a custom experimental setup for the characterization of crystal scintillators under different temperature and pressure conditions. The setup is flexible and capable of providing prompt feedback, which is crucial for material development. We tested the setup with a Ce-doped Gd3Al2Ga3O12 (GAGG) scintillator, evaluating its response to different types of radiation, particularly alpha particles. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of GAGG's scintillation properties, including light output, quenching factors, and pulse-shape discrimination capabilities.</description>

      <title>High-resolution computed tomography of two-dimensional beam profile using dual-axis rotating wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of a wire probe is a robust method for beam profile measurement, but it can only provide a 1D projection of the beam profile. In this study, we developed a novel method for measuring a beam projected from a 360{\deg} angle by a dual-axis rotation of a wire probe and obtaining a complete 2D profile via image reconstruction. We conducted a proof-of-principle study using an Ar+ ion beam and optimized the reconstruction algorithm. The experimental results showed that the use of the order subsets expectation maximization (OS-EM) algorithm is the most reasonable method, providing a highly accurate absolute 2D beam profile within a processing time on the millisecond scale. Furthermore, analysis of 2D profiles at different probing positions provided the beam direction and the phase space distribution. This versatile method can be applied to various fields of quantum beam technologies, such as particle therapy, semiconductor processing, and material analysis, as well as basic scientific research.</description>

      <title>Non-cyclic prototype of JUNO-TAO VETO water tank with 3 inch PMTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO, also known as JUNO-TAO) is a satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO). A ton-level liquid scintillator detector will be placed at about 30 m from a core of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant. The reactor antineutrino spectrum will be measured with sub-percent energy resolution, to provide a reference spectrum for future reactor neutrino experiments, and to provide a benchmark measurement to test nuclear databases. A Cerenkov water tank system with a thickness of 1.2 m pure water will be located around the central detector of TAO. The water tank system designed with 300 3" PMTs (SPMT) will use the same electronics as JUNO SPMT, but with online software multiplicity trigger. The performance of a Cerenkov detector with the JUNO SPMT and electronics designed for liquid scintillator detector needs to be checked, including the software triggering. The features and the long stability of the detector without water circulation also needs to be checked as a common concern and a backup option for future JUNO-TAO running. Here we will summary the integration and testing of a prototype water tank detector system, including SPMT, electronics, data taking, simulation and measurement results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a review of the current and future industrial applications of neutrinos. We address the industrial applications of neutrinos in geological and geochemical studies of the Earth's interior, in monitoring earthquakes, in terrestrial communications, in applications for submarines, in monitoring nuclear power plants and fusion reactors, in the management of fissile materials used in nuclear plants, in tracking nuclear tests, among other applications. We also address future possibilities for industrial applications of neutrinos, especially concerning communications in the solar system and geotomography of solar system bodies.</description>

      <title>On-chip GaAs carrier lifetime investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an alternative way to determine GaAs carrier lifetime using pump-probe measurement based on fibre optics and integrated waveguides. We find that our GaAs samples have the lifetime ranging from 30-80 ps, supporting the bandwidth $\geq$ 12.5 GHz. The platform utilised in this work could offer a cost-effective way to investigate photocarrier lifetime. Moreover, it may have the potential for high-speed switches and detectors, or could be exploited for possible all-optical modulation.</description>

      <title>Initial acquisition requirements for optical cavities in the space gravitational wave antennae DECIGO and B-DECIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DECIGO (DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) is a space-based gravitational wave antenna concept targeting the 0.1-10 Hz band. It consists of three spacecraft arranged in an equilateral triangle with 1,000 km sides, forming Fabry-P\'erot cavities between them. A precursor mission, B-DECIGO, is also planned, featuring a smaller 100 km triangle. Operating these cavities requires ultra-precise formation flying, where inter-mirror distance and alignment must be precisely controlled. Achieving this necessitates a sequential improvement in precision using various sensors and actuators, from the deployment of the spacecraft to laser link acquisition and ultimately to the control of the Fabry-P\'erot cavities to maintain resonance. In this paper, we derive the precision requirements at each stage and discuss the feasibility of achieving them. We show that the relative speed between cavity mirrors must be controlled at the sub-micrometer-per-second level and that relative alignment must be maintained at the sub-microradian level to obtain control signals from the Fabry-P\'erot cavities of DECIGO and B-DECIGO.</description>

      <title>A Downstream and vertexing algorithm for Long Lived Particles (LLP) selection at the first High-level trigger (HLT1) of LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new algorithm has been developed at LHCb which is able to reconstruct and select very displaced vertices in real-time at the first level of the trigger (HLT1). It makes use of the Upstream Tracker (UT) and the Scintillator Fiber detector (SciFi) of LHCb and it is executed on GPUs inside the Allen framework. In addition to an optimized strategy, it utilizes a Neural Network (NN) implementation to increase the track efficiency and reduce the ghost rates, with very high throughput and limited time budget. Besides serving to reconstruct $K_{s}^{0}$ and $\Lambda$ particles from the Standard Model, the Downstream algorithm and the associated two-track vertexing could largely increase the LHCb physics potential for detecting long-lived particles during the Run 3.</description>

      <title>Characterization of FBK NUV-HD-Cryo SiPMs near LHe temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10497v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Five FBK ``NUV-HD-Cryo'' SiPMs have been characterized at 7 K and 10 K, with 405 nm and 530 nm LED light, respectively. The dark current rate (DCR) was measured to be $\sim$ 1 Hz for the $\sim$ 100 mm$^2$-size SiPMs, or 0.01 Hz/mm$^2$, which is $\sim$ 7 orders lower than the DCR at room temperature (RT). Given the tiny DCR at these cryogenic temperatures, we measured the SiPMs' I-V curves with such a method: illuminated the SiPMs with weak light, which differs from the conventional measurements at RT. Then, we measured the photo-detection efficiency (PDE), after-pulse (AP), and cross-talk (CT) with a bias voltage ranging from 6 to 11 V overvoltage (OV). At the OV interval (6 to 11 V), the PDE was between 20\% - 45\%, and the AP and CT were both between $\sim$ 5\% and $\sim$ 20\%. Suppose the bias is $\ge$ 10 V OV, the PDE would be $\ge$ 40\%, and the AP and CT are $\sim$ 20\%. Combining all of the measurements, we are confident that the SiPMs can be equipped as the photosensors on liquid helium detectors, including but not limited to the time projection chambers, which we have proposed in hunting for low-mass dark matter directly and beyond.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic cesium iodide as a potential PET material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Total Body PET (TBPET) scanners have recently demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce both acquisition time and the administered radioactive dose, thanks to their increased sensitivity. However, their widespread adoption is limited by the high costs associated with the current available systems. Cesium iodide (CsI), though historically less favored for PET due to its lower stopping power and light yield compared to crystals like LYSO, shows remarkable improvement when operated at cryogenic temperatures ($\sim$100 K). Under these conditions, CsI light yield rises dramatically to about 100 photons/keV, providing excellent energy resolution and good coincidence time resolution at a lower cost - typically 3 to 5 times cheaper than other crystals at parity of radiation length. In our study, we measured the light yield, the energy resolution and the coincidence time resolution as a function of temperature for two pure CsI crystals read out by a pair of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). An energy resolution of 6.3% FWHM and a coincidence time resolution of 1.84 ns at 511 keV were achieved at a temperature of 104 K. These results point towards the potential of cryogenic CsI as a cost-effective, high-performance material for TBPET scanners.</description>

      <title>Development and validation of a high-fidelity full-spectrum Monte Carlo model for the Swiss airborne gamma-ray spectrometry system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02102</link>

Abstract: Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS) is a critical tool for radiological emergency response, enabling the rapid identification and quantification of hazardous terrestrial radionuclides over large areas. However, existing calibration methods are limited to a few gamma-ray sources, excluding most radionuclides released in severe nuclear accidents and nuclear weapon detonations, compromising effective response and risk assessment. Here, we present a high-fidelity Monte Carlo model that overcomes these limitations, offering full-spectrum calibration for any gamma-ray source. Unlike previous approaches, our model integrates a detailed mass model of the aircraft and a calibrated non-proportional scintillation model, enabling accurate event-by-event predictions of the spectrometer's response to arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. Validation in near-, mid-, and far-field scenarios demonstrates that the model not only addresses major deficiencies of previous approaches but also achieves the accuracy required to supersede empirical calibration methods. This advancement enables high-fidelity spectral signature generation for any gamma-ray source, reduces calibration time and costs, minimizes reliance on high-intensity sources, and eliminates related radioactive waste. The approach presented here is a critical step toward integrating advanced full-spectrum data reduction methods for AGRS, unlocking new capabilities beyond emergency response, such as atmospheric cosmic-ray flux quantification for geophysics and trace-level airborne radionuclide identification for nuclear security.</description>

      <title>A Demonstration of Slowed Electron ${\bf E} \times {\bf B}$ Drift for PTOLEMY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The novel transverse electromagnetic filtering system proposed by the PTOLEMY collaboration necessitates the precise control of $\beta$-decay electron motion via ${\bf E} \times {\bf B}$ drift. In particular, drift speed must be slowed substantially to contain electrons within the radio-frequency antenna region and accurately tune voltage potentials within the filter. This paper presents the experimental design to vary ${\bf E} \times {\bf B}$ drift speed of carbon-14 $\beta$-decay electrons using a custom electrode field cage situated between the pole faces of an electromagnet. Matching our results with high-fidelity simulation, we deduce a capacity to increase particle time of flight by a factor of 5 in the field cage's slow drift region. Limited only by the dimensions of our system, we assert drift speed can be arbitrarily slowed to meet the needs of PTOLEMY's future detector.</description>

      <title>Calibration of hydrogen atoms measurement using femtosecond two-photon laser induced fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new calibration method for H-fs-TALIF is proposed, and the ratio of two-photon absorption cross-sections, $\sigma^{(2)}$, for atomic hydrogen (H) and krypton (Kr) is determined for the broadband emission of a femtosecond laser system. The estimated ratio of the two-photon absorption cross-sections for H and Kr is $\sigma^{(2)}$ for H and Kr $\sigma^{(2)}$(Kr)/$\sigma^{(2)}$(H) = $0.027\pm 20$%, which is nearly twenty times lower than values previously obtained with narrowband nanosecond lasers. This discrepancy highlights the need for independent calibration of TALIF measurements for a specific laser pulsewidth range.</description>

      <title>Novel concept for low-energy antineutron production and its application for antineutron scattering experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extensive data of antiproton scattering cross sections with protons and nuclei have advanced our understanding of hadronic interactions with antinucleons. However, low-energy antineutron scattering data are scarce, thereby limiting our understanding of the S-wave antinucleon-nucleon and antinucleon-nucleus interactions. We present a novel production scheme of extremely low-energy antineutrons that could remedy this situation. This method is based on backward charge-exchange reaction ($p\bar{p}\to n\bar{n}$), and can reach the lowest momentum of 9 MeV/c, which would be well suited to study of the S-wave antinucleon-nucleon or antinucleon-nucleus interactions.</description>
