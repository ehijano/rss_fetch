      <title>Equivalence of Lagrangian and Multisymplectic Hamiltonian Formalisms for the Description of Classical Fields Interacting with Point Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multisymplectic Hamiltonian formalism is a generalization of the Hamiltonian formalism that is known to manifestly preserve Lorentz covariance in the description of fields and has been suggested as a possible path for developing a covariant canonical quantization process. However, since this formalism allows for multiple definitions of Poisson brackets, its practical use in field theory has been very limited. In this paper, we demonstrate the equivalence between the Lagrangian and the multisymplectic Hamiltonian formalisms in the momentum representation for describing classical fields interacting with point particles by deriving the image in that representation of the de Donder-Weyl function for a general tensor representation of the Lorentz group. The calculation is performed explicitly for a complex scalar field, the electromagnetic field, and the classical Dirac field. The obtained results allow us to propose a Lorentz covariant bilinear form as a Poisson bracket with respect to the canonical variables of the fields, thus opening the possibility of studying the complete system in a canonical and relativistic coherent way.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of populations of weakly-coupled low-temperature-differential Stirling engines with synchronous and asynchronous transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study developed the theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for populations of low-temperature-differential (LTD) Stirling engines weakly-coupled in a general class of networks to clarify the effects of synchronous and asynchronous transitions on the power and thermal efficiency. We first show that synchronous (asynchronous) transitions increase (decrease) the power and thermal efficiency of weakly-coupled LTD Stirling engines based on quasilinear response relations between formally defined thermodynamic fluxes and forces. After that, we construct a conceptual model satisfying the quasilinear response relations to give a physical interpretation of the changes in power and thermal efficiency due to synchronous and asynchronous transitions, and justify the use of this conceptual model. We then show that the conceptual model, rather than the quasilinear response relations, preserves the thermodynamic irreversibility of the original model and thus gives more accurate results than those using the quasilinear response relations. Finally, we compare the dynamics between the original and the conceptual models for two-engine systems and show that the conceptual models roughly preserve the dynamical characteristics leading up to the synchronous transitions, while some detailed dynamical structures are lost.</description>
