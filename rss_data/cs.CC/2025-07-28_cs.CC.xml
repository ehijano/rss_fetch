      <title>On Higher Order Busy Beaver Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend Busy Beaver function to a class of higher order Busy Beaver functions based on Turing oracle machine. We prove some results about the relation between decidability of number theoretical formula and higher order Busy Beaver functions, and the relation between computability of max-min partial recursive functions and higher order Busy Beaver functions. We also present some conjectures on higher order Busy Beaver functions.</description>

      <title>Parallel Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering in Low Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is an extensively studied and widely used method for hierarchical clustering in $\mathbb{R}^k$ based on repeatedly merging the closest pair of clusters according to an input linkage function $d$. Highly parallel (i.e., NC) algorithms are known for $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate HAC (where near-minimum rather than minimum pairs are merged) for certain linkage functions that monotonically increase as merges are performed. However, no such algorithms are known for many important but non-monotone linkage functions such as centroid and Ward's linkage.
  In this work, we show that a general class of non-monotone linkage functions -- which include centroid and Ward's distance -- admit efficient NC algorithms for $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate HAC in low dimensions. Our algorithms are based on a structural result which may be of independent interest: the height of the hierarchy resulting from any constant-approximate HAC on $n$ points for this class of linkage functions is at most $\operatorname{poly}(\log n)$ as long as $k = O(\log \log n / \log \log \log n)$. Complementing our upper bounds, we show that NC algorithms for HAC with these linkage functions in \emph{arbitrary} dimensions are unlikely to exist by showing that HAC is CC-hard when $d$ is centroid distance and $k = n$.</description>

      <title>Racing to Idle: Energy Efficiency of Matrix Multiplication on Heterogeneous CPU and GPU Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paradigm shift towards multi-core and heterogeneous computing, driven by the fundamental power and thermal limits of single-core processors, has established energy efficiency as a first-class design constraint in high-performance computing (HPC). Heterogeneous systems, integrating traditional multi-core CPUs with specialized accelerators like discrete (dGPU) and integrated (iGPU) graphics processing units, offer a compelling path to navigating the trade-offs between performance and power. However, quantifying these trade-offs on widely accessible hardware remains a critical area of study. This paper presents a direct, empirical measurement of the performance and energy-to-solution of a canonical HPC workload -- a 4096x4096 matrix-matrix multiplication -- on three distinct compute architectures within a single consumer-grade laptop: a multi-core AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, a discrete NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 GPU, and an integrated AMD Radeon Vega GPU. Using standard, validated, and minimally intrusive tools such as Linux perf and nvidia-smi, we find that the discrete GPU is not only the performance leader, achieving a 93.5x speedup over the CPU, but is also the most energy-efficient, consuming only 2% of the energy used by the CPU, resulting in a 50-fold improvement in energy efficiency. These findings provide a practical demonstration of the "race to idle" principle and offer clear, quantitative guidance on architectural choices for energy-aware software development.</description>

      <title>The Power of Negation in Higher-Order Datalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the expressive power of Higher-Order Datalog$^\neg$ under both the well-founded and the stable model semantics, establishing tight connections with complexity classes. We prove that under the well-founded semantics, for all $k\geq 1$, $(k+1)$-Order Datalog$^\neg$ captures k-EXP, a result that holds without explicit ordering of the input database. The proof of this fact can be performed either by using the powerful existential predicate variables of the language or by using partially applied relations and relation enumeration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this expressive power is retained within a stratified fragment of the language. Under the stable model semantics, we show that $(k+1)$-Order Datalog$^\neg$ captures co-(k-NEXP) using cautious reasoning and k-NEXP using brave reasoning, again with analogous results for the stratified fragment augmented with choice rules. Our results establish a hierarchy of expressive power, highlighting an interesting trade-off between order and non-determinism in the context of higher-order logic programming: increasing the order of programs under the well-founded semantics can surpass the expressive power of lower-order programs under the stable model semantics.</description>

      <title>Core Safety Values for Provably Corrigible Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our framework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate* utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness, low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step, self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \emph{learned} to mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal, the probability of violating \emph{any} safety property is bounded while still ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF, which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable island'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs. Consequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage and generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality rather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation guidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>On Approximability of Satisfiable k-CSPs: V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework of algorithm vs. hardness for all Max-CSPs and demonstrate it for a large class of predicates. This framework extends the work of Raghavendra [STOC, 2008], who showed a similar result for almost satisfiable Max-CSPs.
  Our framework is based on a new hybrid approximation algorithm, which uses a combination of the Gaussian elimination technique (i.e., solving a system of linear equations over an Abelian group) and the semidefinite programming relaxation. We complement our algorithm with a matching dictator vs. quasirandom test that has perfect completeness.
  The analysis of our dictator vs. quasirandom test is based on a novel invariance principle, which we call the mixed invariance principle. Our mixed invariance principle is an extension of the invariance principle of Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz [Annals of Mathematics, 2010] which plays a crucial role in Raghavendra's work. The mixed invariance principle allows one to relate 3-wise correlations over discrete probability spaces with expectations over spaces that are a mixture of Guassian spaces and Abelian groups, and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Low Sets and Closure Properties of Counting Function Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A language L is low for a relativizable complexity class C, if it doesn't increase the computational power of a class when it is used as an oracle: C$^L$ = C. For the classes #P, GapP, and SpanP low classes of languages are known: Low(#P) = UP $\cap$ coUP, Low(GapP) = SPP, and Low(SpanP) = NP $\cap$ coNP. In this paper, we prove that Low(TotP) = P, and give characterizations of low function classes for #P, GapP, TotP, and SpanP. We establish the relations between NPSVt, UPSVt, and the counting function classes. For each of the inclusions between these classes we give an equivalent inclusion between language classes. We also prove that SpanP $\subseteq$ GapP if and only if NP $\subseteq$ SPP, and the inclusion GapP+ $\subseteq$ SpanP implies PH = $\Sigma_{2}^{P}$. For the classes #P, GapP, TotP, and SpanP we summarize the known results and prove that each of these classes is closed under left composition with FP+ if and only if it collapses to its low class of functions.</description>

      <title>A Proposed Characterization of p-Simulation Between Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a characterization of when one axiomatic theory, as a proof system for tautologies, $p$-simulates another, by showing: (i)~if c.e. theory $\mathcal{S}$ efficiently interprets $\mathcal{S}{+}\phi$, then $\mathcal{S}$ $p$-simulates $\mathcal{S}{+}\phi$ (Je\v{r}\'abek in Pudl\'ak17 proved simulation), since the interpretation maps an $\mathcal{S}{+}\phi$-proof whose lines are all theorems into an $\mathcal{S}$-proof; (ii)~$\mathcal{S}$ proves ``$\mathcal{S}$ efficiently interprets $\mathcal{S}{+}\phi$'' iff $\mathcal{S}$ proves ``$\mathcal{S}$ $p$-simulates $\mathcal{S}{+}\phi$'' (if so, $\mathcal{S}$ already proves the $\Pi_1$ theorems of $\mathcal{S}{+}\phi$). To explore whether this framework conceivably resolves other open questions, the paper formulates conjectures stronger than ``no optimal proof system exists'' that imply Feige's Hypothesis, the existence of one-way functions, and circuit lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Sampling recovery in $L_2$ and other norms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07539v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the recovery of functions in various norms, including $L_p$ with $1\le p\le\infty$, based on function evaluations. We obtain worst case error bounds for general classes of functions in terms of the best $L_2$-approximation from a given nested sequence of subspaces and the Christoffel function of these subspaces. In the case $p=\infty$, our results imply that linear sampling algorithms are optimal up to a constant factor for many reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Learning unitaries with quantum statistical queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose several algorithms for learning unitary operators from quantum statistical queries with respect to their Choi-Jamiolkowski state. Quantum statistical queries capture the capabilities of a learner with limited quantum resources, which receives as input only noisy estimates of expected values of measurements. Our approach leverages quantum statistical queries to estimate the Fourier mass of a unitary on a subset of Pauli strings, generalizing previous techniques developed for uniform quantum examples. Specifically, we show that the celebrated quantum Goldreich-Levin algorithm can be implemented with quantum statistical queries, whereas the prior version of the algorithm involves oracle access to the unitary and its inverse. As an application, we prove that quantum Boolean functions with constant total influence or with constant degree are efficiently learnable in our model. Moreover, we prove that $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-juntas are efficiently learnable and constant-depth circuits are learnable query-efficiently with quantum statistical queries. On the other hand, all previous algorithms for these tasks demand significantly greater resources, such as oracle access to the unitary or direct access to the Choi-Jamiolkowski state. We also demonstrate that, despite these positive results, quantum statistical queries lead to an exponentially larger query complexity for certain tasks, compared to separable measurements to the Choi-Jamiolkowski state. In particular, we show an exponential lower bound for learning a class of phase-oracle unitaries and a double exponential lower bound for testing the unitarity of channels. Taken together, our results indicate that quantum statistical queries offer a unified framework for various unitary learning tasks, with potential applications in quantum machine learning, many-body physics and benchmarking of near-term devices.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Perceptrons, Number Partitioning and Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symmetric binary perceptron ($\mathrm{SBP}_{\kappa}$) problem with parameter $\kappa : \mathbb{R}_{\geq1} \to [0,1]$ is an average-case search problem defined as follows: given a random Gaussian matrix $\mathbf{A} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)^{n \times m}$ as input where $m \geq n$, output a vector $\mathbf{x} \in \{-1,1\}^m$ such that $$|| \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} ||_{\infty} \leq \kappa(m/n) \cdot \sqrt{m}~.$$ The number partitioning problem ($\mathrm{NPP}_{\kappa}$) corresponds to the special case of setting $n=1$. There is considerable evidence that both problems exhibit large computational-statistical gaps.
  In this work, we show (nearly) tight average-case hardness for these problems, assuming the worst-case hardness of standard approximate shortest vector problems on lattices.
  For $\mathrm{SBP}$, for large $n$, the best that efficient algorithms have been able to achieve is $\kappa(x) = \Theta(1/\sqrt{x})$ (Bansal and Spencer, Random Structures and Algorithms 2020), which is a far cry from the statistical bound. The problem has been extensively studied in the TCS and statistics communities, and Gamarnik, Kizildag, Perkins and Xu (FOCS 2022) conjecture that Bansal-Spencer is tight: namely, $\kappa(x) = \widetilde{\Theta}(1/\sqrt{x})$ is the optimal value achieved by computationally efficient algorithms. We prove their conjecture assuming the worst-case hardness of approximating the shortest vector problem on lattices.
  For $\mathrm{NPP}$, Karmarkar and Karp's classical differencing algorithm achieves $\kappa(m) = 2^{-O(\log^2 m)}~.$ We prove that Karmarkar-Karp is nearly tight: namely, no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve $\kappa(m) = 2^{-\Omega(\log^3 m)}$, once again assuming the worst-case subexponential hardness of approximating the shortest vector problem on lattices to within a subexponential factor.</description>

      <title>String Consensus Problems with Swaps and Substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String consensus problems aim at finding a string that minimizes some given distance with respect to an input set of strings. In particular, in the Closest string problem, we are given a set of strings of equal length and a radius $d$. The objective is to find a new string that differs from each input string by at most $d$ substitutions. We study a generalization of this problem where, in addition to substitutions, swaps of adjacent characters are also permitted, each operation incurring a unit cost. Amir et al. showed that this generalized problem is NP-hard, even when only swaps are allowed. In this paper, we show that it is FPT with respect to the parameter $d$. Moreover, we investigate a variant in which the goal is to minimize the sum of distances from the output string to all input strings. For this version, we present a polynomial-time algorithm.</description>
