      <title>The Cosmic Timeline Implied by the JWST Reionization Crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST's discovery of well-formed galaxies and supermassive black holes only a few hundred Myr after the big bang, and the identification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at $z=6.71$, seriously challenge the timeline predicted by $\Lambda$CDM. Now, a recent analysis of reionization after JWST by Munoz et al. (2024) has concluded that the $\Lambda$CDM timeline simply cannot accommodate the combined JWST-Planck observations even if exotic fixes are introduced to modify the standard reionization model. In this paper, we argue that this so-called `photon budget crisis' is more likely due to flaws in the cosmological model itself. We employ the standard reionization model using the JWST-measured UV luminosity function in the early Universe and the timeline and physical conditions in both $\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\rm h}=ct$. We then contrast the predicted reionization histories in these two scenarios and compare them with the data. We confirm that the reionization history predicted by $\Lambda$CDM is in significant tension with the observations, and demonstrate that the latter are instead in excellent agreement with the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ timeline. Together, the four anomalies uncovered by JWST provide strong evidence against the timeline predicted by $\Lambda$CDM and in favor of the evolutionary history in $R_{\rm h}=ct$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic accretion shocks as a tool to measure the dark matter mass of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological accretion shocks created during the formation of galaxy clusters are a ubiquitous phenomenon all around the Universe. These shocks, and their features, are intimately related with the gravitational energy put into play during galaxy cluster formation. Studying a sample of simulated galaxy clusters and their associated accretion shocks, we show that objects in our sample sit in a plane within the three dimensional-space of cluster total mass, shock radius, and Mach number (a measure of shock intensity). Using this relation, and considering that forthcoming new observations will be able to measure shock radii and intensities, we put forward the idea that the dark matter content of galaxy clusters could be indirectly measured with an error up to around 30 per cent at the $1\sigma$ confidence level. This procedure would be a new and independent method to measure the dark matter mass in cosmic structures, and a novel constraint to the accepted $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>The infall region as a complementary probe to cluster abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster abundance measurements provide a classic test of cosmology. They are most sensitive to the evolved amplitude of fluctuations, usually expressed as $S_8 = \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$. Thus, abundance constraints exhibit a strong degeneracy between $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$, as do other similar low-redshift tests such as cosmic shear. The mass distribution in the infall region around galaxy clusters, where material is being accreted from the surrounding field, also exhibits a cosmological dependence, but in this case it is nearly orthogonal to the $S_8$ direction in the $\Omega_m$--$\sigma_8$ plane, making it highly complementary to halo abundance or cosmic shear studies. We explore how weak lensing measurements of the infall region might be used to complement abundance studies, considering three different tests. The splashback radius is a prominent feature of the infall region; we show that detection of this feature in lensing data from the Euclid survey could independently constrain $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ to $\pm 0.05$. Another feature, the depletion radius where the bias reaches a minimum, also shows cosmological dependence, though it is challenging to observe in practice. The strongest constraints come from direct measurements of the shear profile in the infall region at $2$--$4\,r_{200{\rm c}}$. Combining the latter with abundance constraints such as those reported from SRG$/$eROSITA should reduce the area of the error contours by an estimated factor of $1.2$ using a sample of clusters observed by the UNIONS survey, or a factor of $3$ using clusters observed by the Euclid Wide survey over a broader range of redshift.</description>

      <title>Galaxy clustering in modified gravity from full-physics simulations. I: two-point correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an in-depth investigation of galaxy clustering based on a new suite of realistic large-box galaxy-formation simulations in $f(R)$ gravity, with a subgrid physics model that has been recalibrated to reproduce various observed stellar and gas properties. We focus on the two-point correlation functions of the luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and emission line galaxies (ELGs), which are primary targets of ongoing and future galaxy surveys such as DESI. One surprising result is that, due to several nontrivial effects of modified gravity on matter clustering and the galaxy-halo connection, the clustering signal does not depend monotonically on the fifth-force strength. For LRGs this complicated behaviour poses a challenge to meaningfully constraining this model. For ELGs, in contrast, this can be straightforwardly explained by the time evolution of the fifth force, which means that weaker $f(R)$ models can display nearly the same -- up to $25\%$ -- deviations from $\Lambda$CDM as the strongest ones, albeit at lower redshifts. This implies that even very weak $f(R)$ models can be strongly constrained, unlike with most other observations. Our results show that galaxy formation acquires a significant environment dependence in $f(R)$ gravity which, if not properly accounted for, may lead to biased constraints on the model. This highlights the essential role of hydrodynamical simulations in future tests of gravity exploring precision galaxy-clustering data from the likes of DESI and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Enhancing inflationary model predictions via refined slow-roll dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inflationary paradigm not only addresses early Universe puzzles but also aligns well with the observational constraints, with slow-roll inflationary models fitting best. Evaluating these model predictions requires considering both slow-roll inflationary dynamics and the subsequent reheating epoch. This involves the quantitative analysis that takes into account the effective equation of state (EoS) and duration of reheating, connecting these with the perturbations generated deep during the inflationary era. Given the complexities involved, many approximations are often used for simplification. However, as future observations are expected to improve the accuracy of these observables significantly, this work takes a different approach. Instead of relying on approximations, we consider the near-accurate solutions of inflationary models and compare our results with the pre-existing ones. It mainly incorporates two improvements: the first is the accurate dynamics of the slow-roll evolution, and, thus, the end of inflation; and the second is the higher-order slow-roll corrections to the perturbed observables. Our findings indicate that, by implementing these corrections, the theoretical predictions improve significantly. It also indicates that seemingly minor corrections can have significant effects on the perturbed observables, and these refined predictions can be compared with future observations to potentially rule out models and help resolve the degeneracy problem of the inflationary paradigm.</description>

      <title>The little coadd that could: Estimating shear from coadded images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming wide field surveys will have many overlapping epochs of the same region of sky. The conventional wisdom is that in order to reduce the errors sufficiently for systematics-limited measurements, like weak lensing, we must do simultaneous fitting of all the epochs. Using current algorithms this will require a significant amount of computing time and effort. In this paper, we revisit the potential of using coadds for shear measurements. We show on a set of image simulations that the multiplicative shear bias can be constrained below the 0.1% level on coadds, which is sufficient for future lensing surveys. We see no significant differences between simultaneous fitting and coadded approaches for two independent shear codes: Metacalibration and BFD. One caveat of our approach is the assumption of a principled coadd, i.e. the PSF is mathematically well-defined for all the input images. This requires us to reject CCD images that do not fully cover the coadd region. We estimate that the number of epochs that must be rejected for a survey like LSST is on the order of 20%, resulting in a small loss in depth of less than 0.1 magnitudes. We also put forward a cell-based coaddition scheme that meets the above requirements for unbiased weak lensing shear estimation in the context of LSST.</description>

      <title>Fast modeling of the shear three-point correlation function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-point correlation function (3PCF) of a weak lensing shear field contains information that is complementary to that in the two-point correlation function (2PCF), which can help improve the cosmological parameters and calibrate astrophysical and observational systematics parameters. However, the application of the 3PCF to observed data has been limited due to the computational challenges of calculating theoretical predictions of the 3PCF from a bispectrum model. In this paper, we present a new method to compute the shear 3PCF efficiently and accurately. We employ the multipole expansion of the bispectrum to compute the shear 3PCF, and show that the method is substantially more efficient than direct numerical integration. We found that the multipole-based method can compute the shear 3PCF with 5% accuracy in 10 (40) seconds for the single (four) source redshift bin setup. The multipole-based method can be also used to compute the third-order aperture mass statistics quickly and accurately, accounting for the bin-averaging effect on the shear 3PCF. Our method provides a fast and robust tool for probing the underlying cosmological model with third-order statistics of weak lensing shear.</description>

      <title>The interface of gravity and dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At sufficiently large radii dark energy modifies the behavior of (a) bound orbits around a galaxy and (b) virialized gas in a cluster of galaxies. Dark energy also provides a natural cutoff to a cluster's dark matter halo. In (a) there exists a maximum circular orbit beyond which periodic motion is no longer possible, and orbital evolution near critical binding is analytically calculable using an adiabatic invariant integral. The finding implicates the study of wide galaxy pairs. In (b), dark energy necessitates the use of a generalized Virial Theorem to describe gas at the outskirts of a cluster. When coupled to the baryonic escape condition, aided by dark energy, the results is a radius beyond which the continued establishment of a hydrostatic halo of thermalized baryons is untenable. This leads to a theoretically motivated virial radius. We use this theory to probe the structure of a cluster's baryonic halo and apply it to X-ray and weak-lensing data collected on cluster Abell 1835. We find that gas in its outskirts deviates significantly from hydrostatic equilibrium beginning at $\sim 1.3\ {\rm Mpc}$, the `inner' virial radius. We also define a model dependent dark matter halo cutoff radius to A1835. The dark matter cutoff gives an upper limit to the cluster's total mass of $\sim7\times 10^{15}M_{\odot}$. Moreover, it is possible to derive an `outer' hydrostatic equilibrium cutoff radius given a dark matter cutoff radius. A region of cluster gas transport and turbulence occurs between the inner and outer cutoff radii.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Nonlinear Power Spectrum in Low-redshift HI Intensity Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simulation-based framework to forecast the HI power spectrum on non-linear scales ($k\gtrsim 1\ {\rm Mpc^{-1}}$), as measured by interferometer arrays like MeerKAT in the low-redshift ($z\leq 1.0$) universe. Building on a galaxy-based HI mock catalog, we meticulously consider various factors, including the emission line profiles of HI discs and some observational settings, and explore their impacts on the HI power spectrum. While it is relatively insensitive to the profile shape of HI emission line at these scales, we identify a strong correlation with the profile width, that is, the Full Width at Half Maxima (FWHM, also known as $W_{\rm 50}$ in observations) in this work. By modeling the width function of $W_{50}$ as a function of $v_{\rm max}$, we assign each HI source a emission line profile and find that the resulting HI power spectrum is comparatively close to results from particles in the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation. After implementing $k$-space cuts matching the MeerKAT data, our prediction replicates the trend of the measurements obtained by MeerKAT at $z\approx 0.44$, though with a significantly lower amplitude. Utilizing a Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling method, we constrain the parameter $A_{W_{\rm 50}}$ in the $W_{\rm 50}$ models and $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ with the MeerKAT measurements and find that a strong degeneracy exists between these two parameters.</description>

      <title>Conversations in the dark: cross-correlating birefringence and LSS to constrain axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unveiling the dark sector of the Universe is one of the leading efforts in theoretical physics. Among the many models proposed, axions and axion-like particles stand out due to their solid theoretical foundation, capacity to contribute significantly to both dark matter and dark energy, and potential to address the small-scale crisis of $\Lambda$CDM. Moreover, these pseudo-scalar fields couple to the electromagnetic sector through a Chern-Simons parity-violating term, leading to a rotation of the plane of linearly polarized waves, namely cosmic birefringence. We explore the impact of the axion-parameters on anisotropic birefringence and study, for the first time, its cross-correlation with the spatial distribution of galaxies, focusing on ultralight axions with masses $10^{-33}\,{\rm eV}\le m_\phi\le10^{-28}\,{\rm eV}$. Through this novel approach, we investigate the axion-parameter space in the mass $m_\phi$ and initial misalignment angle $\theta_i$, within the framework of early dark energy models, and constrain the axion-photon coupling $g_{\phi\gamma}$ required to achieve unity in the signal-to-noise ratio of the underlying cross-correlation, computed with the instrument specifications of Euclid and forthcoming CMB-polarization data. Our findings reveal that for masses below $10^{-32}\,{\rm eV}$ and initial misalignment angles greater in absolute value than $\pi/4$, the signal-to-noise ratio not only exceeds unity but also surpasses that achievable from the auto-correlation of birefringence alone (up to a factor 7), highlighting the informative potential of this new probe. Additionally, given the late-time evolution of these low-mass axions, the signal stems from the epoch of reionization, providing an excellent tool to single out the birefringence generated during this period.</description>

      <title>Baryon Acoustic Oscillations analyses with Density-Split Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling for the evolution of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) is essential for using it as a standard ruler to probe cosmology. We explore the non-linearity of the BAO in different environments using the density-split statistics and compare them to the case of the conventional two-point correlation function (2PCF). We detect density-dependent shifts for the position of the BAO with respect to its linear version using halos from N-body simulations. Around low/high-densities, the scale of the BAO expands/contracts due to non-linear peculiar velocities. As the simulation evolves from redshift 1 to 0, the difference in the magnitude of the shifts between high- and low-density regions increases from the sub-percent to the percent level. In contrast, the scale of the BAO does not evolve in the total 2PCF in the same redshift range. The width of the BAO around high density regions increases as the universe evolves, similar to the known broadening of the BAO in the 2PCF due to non-linear evolution. In contrast, the width is smaller and stable for low density regions. We discuss possible implications for the reconstructions of the BAO in light of our results.</description>

      <title>Network Theory in Galaxy Distributions: The Coma Supercluster Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use the theory of spatial networks to analyze galaxy distributions. The aim is to develop new approaches to study the spatial galaxy environment properties by means of the network parameters. We investigate how each of the network parameters (degree, closeness and betweeness centrality; diameter; giant component; transitivity) map the cluster structure and properties. We measure the network parameters of galaxy samples comprising the Coma Supercluster and 4 regions in their neighborhood ($z&lt;0.0674$) using the catalog produced by \citet{tempel2014flux}. For comparison we repeat the same procedures for Random Geometric Graphs and Segment Cox process, generated with the same dimensions and mean density of nodes. We found that there is a strong correlation between degree centrality and the normalized environmental density. Also, at high degrees there are more elliptical than spiral galaxies, which confirms the density-morphology relation. The mean degree as a function of the connection radius is an estimator of the count-of-spheres and consequently provides the correlation dimension as a function of the connection radius. The correlation dimension indicates high clustering at scales indicated by the network diameter. Further, at this scales, high values of betweeness centrality characterize galaxy bridges connecting dense regions, tracing very well the filamentary structures. Then, since galaxies with the highest closeness centrality belongs to the largest components of the network, associated to supercluster regions, we can produce a catalog of superclusters only by extracting the largest connected components of the network. Establishing the correlation between the well-studied normalized environmental densities and the parameters of the network theory allows us to develop alternative tools to the study of the large-scale structures.</description>

      <title>Cubic Galileon Gravity in the CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the models addressing the Hubble tension, those introducing a dynamical dark component around recombination have been the most promising thus far. Their study has highlighted that, in fact, cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observations can allow for such components before and near recombination.
  The new dynamical degree of freedom can be early dark energy (EDE) or early modified gravity depending on its coupling to gravity. We study a new model, $\mathcal{G}$EDE, featuring the cubic Galileon operator $X\Box\phi$ and test it against the most recent Planck PR4 CMB and Cepheid calibrated Pantheon+ type Ia Supernovae data. Thanks to the kinetic braiding effects, $\mathcal{G}$EDE gives a better fit to the data, with a higher $H_0$, and is preferred over the canonical EDE with a Bayes factor $\ln B=0.9$, despite introducing one more parameter. This calls for further explorations of modified gravity near and before last scattering. To facilitate these, we introduce a substantial extension of the cosmological code \texttt{EFTCAMB} that allows to fully evolve the background and linear dynamics of any covariant theory, oscillatory or not, belonging to the Horndeski class.</description>

Abstract: The collapse of supermassive stars (SMSs) via the general-relativistic (GR) instability would provide a natural explanation to the existence of the most extreme quasars. The presence of dark matter in SMSs is thought to potentially impact their properties, in particular their mass at collapse. Dark matter might be made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that can be captured by the gravitational potential well of SMSs due to interaction with the baryonic gas. The annihilation of WIMPs can provide fuel to support the star before H-burning ignition, favouring low densities of baryonic gas, long stellar lifetimes and high final masses. Here, we estimate the impact of dark matter on the GR dynamical stability of rapidly accreting SMSs. We add a dark matter term to the relativistic equation of adiabatic pulsations and apply it to hylotropic structures in order to determine the onset point of the GR instability. We find that, in principle, the dark matter gravitational field can remove completely the GR instability. However, for SMSs fuelled by H-burning, the dark matter densities required to stabilise the star against GR are orders of magnitude above the values that are expected for the dark matter background. On the other hand, for SMSs fuelled by WIMP annihilation, we find that the low densities of baryonic gas inhibit the destabilising GR corrections, which shifts the stability limit by typically an order of magnitude towards higher masses. As long as central temperatures $\lesssim10^7$ K are maintained by WIMP annihilation, the GR instability is reached only for stellar masses $&gt;10^6$ M$_\odot$. Dark matter can impact the GR dynamical stability of SMSs only in the case of energetically significant WIMP annihilation. The detection of a SMS with mass $&gt;10^6$ M$_\odot$ in an atomically cooled halo can be interpreted as an evidence of WIMP annihilation in the star's core.</description>

      <title>Accurate measurement of telescope filter bandpasses with a Collimated Beam Projector and impact on cosmological parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of magnitudes with different filters in photometric surveys gives access to cosmological distances and parameters. However, for current and future large surveys like the ZTF, DES, HSC or LSST, the photometric calibration uncertainties are almost comparable to statistical uncertainties in the error budget of type Ia cosmology analysis, which limits our ability to use type Ia supernovae for precision cosmology. The knowledge of the bandpasses of the survey filters at the per-mill level can help reach the sub-percent precision for magnitudes. We show how a misknowledge of the bandpasses central wavelengths or of the presence of out-of-band leakages leads to biased cosmological measurements. Then, we present how to measure the filter throughputs at the required precision with a Collimated Beam Projector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel realisation of leptogenesis that relies on the out-of-equilibrium decay of an axion-like particle (ALP) into right-handed Majorana neutrinos (RHNs) in the early Universe. With respect to standard thermal leptogenesis, our mechanism lowers by two orders of magnitude the RHN mass, or the tuning in the RHN mass splittings, needed to reproduce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and neutrino masses. We find that ALP leptogenesis requires $m_a &gt; 10^{4}$ GeV and $f_a &gt; 10^{11}$ GeV for the ALP mass and decay constant, and predicts an early period of matter domination induced by the ALP in parts of its parameter space. We finally provide a viable supersymmetric realisation of ALP leptogenesis where the ALP is the $R$-axion, which accommodates GeV gravitino dark matter and predicts RHN below 10 TeV.</description>

      <title>Hawking Radiation of Nonrelativistic Scalars: Applications to Pion and Axion Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In studying secondary gamma-ray emissions from Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), the production of scalar particles like pions and axion-like particles (ALPs) via Hawking radiation is crucial. While previous analyses assumed relativistic production, asteroid-mass PBHs, relevant to upcoming experiments like AMEGO-X, likely produce pions and ALPs non-relativistically when their masses exceed 10 MeV. To account for mass dependence in Hawking radiation, we revisit the greybody factors for massive scalars from Schwarzschild black holes, revealing significant mass corrections to particle production rates compared to the projected AMEGO-X sensitivity. We highlight the importance of considering non-relativistic $\pi^0$ production in interpreting PBH gamma-ray signals, essential for determining PBH properties. Additionally, we comment on the potential suppression of pion production due to form factor effects when producing extended objects via Hawking radiation. We also provide an example code for calculating the Hawking radiation spectrum of massive scalar particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new theory of dark matter based on axion physics and cosmological phase transitions. We show that theories in which a gauge coupling increases through a first-order phase transition naturally result in `axion relic pockets': regions of relic false vacua stabilised by the pressure from a kinematically trapped, hot axion gas. Axion relic pockets provide a viable and highly economical theory of dark matter: the macroscopic properties of the pockets depend only on a single parameter (the phase transition temperature). We describe the formation, evolution and present-day properties of axion relic pockets, and outline how their phenomenology is distinct from existing dark matter paradigms. We briefly discuss how laboratory experiments and astronomical observations can be used to test the theory, and identify gamma-ray observations of magnetised, dark-matter-dense environments as particularly promising.</description>

      <title>A central degeneracy induced outer core in fermionic dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several galaxy-scale observations challenge the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm based on cosmological simulations. The cusp-core problem is one of the most outstanding. However, current simulations are unable to consider quantum statistical effects. For a fermionic dark matter halo, a degenerate inner core induces an extended outer core that dominates in gravity in the region relevant for rotation curve observation. We study the properties of this outer core and show that its density and radius are correlated. The prediction remarkably agrees with the measured scaling relation in both the slope and the magnitude. Such consistency suggests that the observed cored profiles do not contradict massive dark matter but indicate its fermionic nature.</description>

      <title>Constraining Fundamental Constants with Fast Radio Bursts: Unveiling the Role of Energy Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding physical mechanisms relies on the accurate determination of fundamental constants, although inherent limitations in experimental techniques introduce uncertainties into these measurements. This paper explores the uncertainties associated with measuring the fine-structure constant ($\alpha$) and the proton-to-electron mass ratio ($\mu$) using observed fast radio bursts (FRBs). We select 50 localized FRBs to quantify the effects of varying this fundamental coupling on the relation between dispersion measure and redshift. By leveraging independent measurements of dispersion measures and redshifts of these FRBs, we constrain the uncertainties in $\alpha$ and $\mu$ approximately to $\Delta\alpha/\alpha=1.99\times 10^{-5}$ and $\Delta\mu/\mu=-1.00\times 10^{-5}$ within the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological framework. Remarkably, these constraints improve nearly an order-of-magnitude when considering a dynamical dark energy model. This investigation not only yields one of the most stringent constraints on $\alpha$ and $\mu$ to date but also emphasizes the criticality of accounting for the energy scale of the system when formulating constraints on fundamental parameters.</description>

      <title>Extended Uncertainty Principle: A Deeper Insight into the Hubble Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, known as the LambdaCDM model, has been successful in many respects, but it has some significant discrepancies, some of which have not been resolved yet. In measuring the Hubble-Lematre parameter, there is an apparent discrepancy which is known as the Hubble tension, defined as differences in values of this parameter measured by the Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) data (a model-independent method) and by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation maps (a model-dependent method). Although many potential solutions have been proposed, the issue still remains unresolved. Recently, it was observed that the Hubble tension can be due to the concept of uncertainty in measuring cosmological parameters at large distance scales through applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) in cosmological setups. Extending this pioneering idea, in the present study we plan to incorporate the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) containing a minimal fundamental measurable momentum (or equivalently, a maximal fundamental measurable length) as a candidate setup for describing large-scale effects of Quantum Gravity (QG) to address the Hubble tension and constrain the EUP length scale. In this regard, by finding a relevant formula for the effective photon rest mass in terms of the present-time value of the Hubble-Lematre parameter, we see that discrepancies in the value of photon rest mass associated with the Hubble-Lematre parameter values estimated from model-independent and model-dependent methods perhaps is the cause of Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Electroweak phase transition with the Standard Model effective field theory at finite temperature and finite density. Utilizing the dimensional reduction approach, we construct the tree dimensional thermal effective field theory at finite density and investigate the phase transition dynamics. We evaluate how the results depend on the renormalization scale and the chemical potential. Our results show that, with the tree dimensional thermal effective potential at 2-loop level, we can effectively reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the calculations of the phase transition parameters due to the renormalization scale dependence, and the new physics scale is restricted to be $\Lambda\lesssim (770-800)$ GeV by the baryon number washout avoidance condition. Meanwhile, the presence of the chemical potential would affect the phase transition parameter and make the constraints from the baryon number washout avoidance condition more strict, especially for weaker first-order phase transition scenarios at higher new physics scales.</description>

      <title>Systematics in ETG Mass Profile Modelling: Strong Lensing &amp; Stellar Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics are independent and powerful methods to probe the total gravitational potential of galaxies, and thus, their total mass profile. However, inherent degeneracies in the individual models makes it difficult to obtain a full understanding of the distribution of baryons and dark matter (DM), although such degeneracies might be broken by the combination of these two tracers, leading to more reliable measurements of the mass distribution of the lens galaxy. We use mock data from IllustrisTNG50 to compare how dynamical-only, lens-only, and joint modelling can constrain the mass distribution of early-type galaxies (ETGs). The joint model consistently outperforms the other models, achivieng a $2\%$ accuracy in recovering the total mass within $2.5R_\text{eff}$. The Einstein radius is robustly recovered for both lens-only and joint models, with the first showing a median fractional error of $-5\%$ and the latter a fractional error consistent with zero. The stellar mass-to-light ratio and total mass density slope are well recovered by all models. In particular, the dynamical-only model achieves an accuracy of $1\%$ for the stellar mass-to-light ratio, while the accuracy of the mass density slope is typically of the order of $5\%$ for all models. However, all models struggle to constrain integrated quantities involving DM and the halo parameters. Nevertheless, imposing more restrictive assumptions on the DM halo, such as fixing the scale radius, could alleviate some of the issues. Finally, we verify that the number of kinematical constraints ($15, 35, 55$ bins) on the kinematical map does not impact the models outcomes.</description>

      <title>Vector-like Quark Stabilised Higgs Inflation: Implications for Particle Phenomenology, Primordial Gravitational Waves and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model Higgs potential is known to be metastable, therefore Higgs Inflation requires an extension in order to stabilise the potential. Here we consider stabilisation by adding $n_{Q} \leq 3$ Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs) of mass $m_{Q}$: $T$ vector quarks transforming as $({\bf 3}, {\bf 1}, 2/3)$ and $B$ vector quarks transforming as $({\bf 3}, {\bf 1}, -1/3)$. Requiring stability of the finite-temperature effective potential, and assuming $m_{t}$ equals its mean value, we find that the upper bounds on $m_{Q}$ for $T$ quarks are 5.8 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 2$) and 55 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 3$). The corresponding absolute stability upper bounds are 4.4 TeV and 29 TeV. Small upper bounds are obtained for $B$ quarks. For renormalisation in the Einstein frame (Prescription I) the predictions are almost indistinguishable from the classical values: $n_s = 0.966$ and $r = 3.3 \times 10^{-3}$. Renormalisation in the Jordan frame (Prescription II) predicts larger values of $n_{s}$ and $r$, with $n_{s}$ generally in the range 0.980 to 0.990 and $r$ of the order of 0.01. The predicted range of $n_{s}$ is consistent with the CMB range obtained in Hubble tension solutions which modify the sound horizon at decoupling, whilst the predicted values of $r$ will be easily observable by forthcoming CMB experiments. The observational upper bound on $r$ generally imposes a stronger constraint on $m_{Q}$, with the $T$ quark upper bound equal to 2.4 TeV for $n_{Q} = 2$ and 13 TeV for $n_{Q} = 3$. We conclude that VLQ-stabilised Higgs Inflation with Prescription II renormalisation favours 1-10 TeV vector-like quarks that will be accessible to future colliders, and predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio that will be observable in forthcoming CMB experiments and values of $n_{s}$ that favour an early-time solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to interactions with dark matter, neutrinos can acquire refractive masses which explain the data from oscillation experiments. We study the effects of relic neutrinos with refractive masses on structure formation in the Universe. In the model with a light fermionic mediator, above the resonance energy, $E_R$, associated with the mass of the mediator, refractive masses have all the properties identical to the usual vacuum masses. Below the resonance, refractive masses decrease with neutrino energy, however, they cannot be used in the same way as usual masses. We study the dispersion relations and group velocities of such neutrinos and their dependence on redshift. We show that in the epoch of structure formation, relic neutrinos were ultrarelativistic and essentially massless particles for $E_R = (10 - 10^5)\,$eV. This allows to reconcile the values of masses extracted from oscillation experiments with the stringent bounds on sum of neutrino masses from cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>The minimally extended Varying Speed of Light (meVSL)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.09274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even though there have been the various varying speed of light (VSL) cosmology models, they remain out of the mainstream because of their possible violation of physics laws built into fundamental physics. In order to be the VSL as a viable theory, it should inherit the success of special relativity including Maxwell equations and thermodynamics at least. Thus, we adopt that the speed of light, $\tilde c$ varies for the cosmic time not for the local time, i.e., $\tilde c[z]$ where $z$ is the cosmological redshift. When one describes the background FLRW universe, one can define the constant-time hypersurface by using physical quantities such as temperature, density, and $\tilde c$. It is because they evolve in time, and the homogeneity of the Universe demands that they must equal at the equal cosmic time. The variation of $\tilde c$ accompanies the joint variations of all related physical constants in order to satisfy the Lorentz invariance, thermodynamics, and Bianchi identity. We call this VSL model as a "minimally extended VSL (meVSL)". We derive cosmological observables of meVSL and obtain the constraints on the variation of $\tilde c$ by using the current observations. Interestingly, $z$ and all geometrical distances except the luminosity distance of meVSL are the same as those of general relativity. However, the Hubble parameter of meVSL is rescaled as $H = (1+z)^{-b/4} H^{(\rm GR)}$ which might be used as a solution for the tension of the Hubble parameter measurements. In this manuscript, we provide the main effects of meVSL on various cosmological observations including BBN, CMB, SZE, BAO, SNe, GWs, H, SL, and $\Delta \alpha$.</description>

      <title>Recovering 21cm Monopole Signals Without Smoothness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06134v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expect the monopole signal at the lowest frequencies below $100\,$MHz to be composed of two components: the deep Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background and two distinct features: the dark ages trough at $\sim 17\,$MHz and the cosmic dawn trough at $\sim 75\,$Mhz. These are hidden under orders of magnitude brighter foregrounds whose emission is approximately a power-law with a spectral index $\approx -2.5$. It is usually assumed that monopole signals of interest are separable from foregrounds based on spectral smoothness. We argue that this is a difficult approach and likely impossible for the Dark Ages trough. Instead, we suggest that the fluctuations in the foreground emission around the sky should be used to build a model distribution of possible shapes of foregrounds, which can be used to constrain the presence of a monopole signal. We implement this idea using normalizing flows and show that this technique allows for efficient unsupervised detection of the amplitude, width, and center of the Dark Ages trough as well as the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background for a sufficiently sensitive experiment. We show that achromatic and smooth response significantly helps with foreground separation. We discuss the limitations of the inherent assumptions in this method and the impact on the design of future low-frequency experiments.</description>

      <title>Simulations of galaxy cluster mergers with velocity-dependent, rare and frequent self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) has been proposed to solve small-scale problems in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In previous work, constraints on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter have been derived assuming that the self-interaction cross-section is independent of velocity. However, a velocity-dependent cross-section is more natural in most theories of SIDM. Using idealized $N$-body simulations without baryons, we study merging clusters with velocity-dependent SIDM. In addition to the usual rare scattering in the isotropic limit, we also simulate these systems with anisotropic, small-angle (frequent) scatterings. We find that the collision-less brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) has an offset from the DM peak that grows at later stages. Finally, we also extend the existing upper bounds on the velocity-independent, isotropic self-interaction cross-section to the parameter space of rare and frequent velocity-dependent self-interactions by studying the central densities of dark matter-only isolated haloes. For these upper-bound parameters, the DM-BCG offsets just after the first pericentre in the dark matter-only simulations are found to be $\leq$ 10 kpc. On the other hand, because of BCG oscillations, we speculate that the distribution of BCG offsets in a relaxed cluster is a statistically viable probe. Therefore, this motivates further studies of BCG off-centring in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Realisation of the ultra-slow roll phase in Galileon inflation and PBH overproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the explicit realisation of the ultra-slow roll phase in the framework of the effective field theory of single-field Galileon inflation. The pulsar timing array (PTA) collaboration hints at the scalar-induced gravity waves (SIGW) from the early universe as an explanation for the origin of the observed signal, which, however, leads to an enhancement in the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum giving rise to the overproduction of primordial black holes (PBHs). In the setup under consideration, we examine the generation of SIGW consistent with PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) data, in addition to which we also consider the impact from QCD crossover at the nHz frequencies and address the PBH overproduction issue assuming linear approximations for the over-density without incorporating non-Gaussian effects from the comoving curvature perturbation. The framework is shown to give rise to SIGWs well consistent with the PTA signal with comfortable PBH abundance, $10^{-3} \lesssim f_{\rm PBH} &lt; 1$, of near solar-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Impact of weak lensing on bright standard siren analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from binary mergers at cosmological distances will experience weak lensing by large scale structure. This causes a (de-)magnification, $\mu$, of the wave amplitude, and a degenerate modification to the inferred luminosity distance $d_L$. To address this the uncertainty on $d_L$ is increased according to the dispersion of the magnification distribution at the source redshift, $\sigma_\mu$. But this term is dependent on cosmological parameters that are being constrained by gravitational wave "standard sirens", such as the Hubble parameter $H_0$, and the matter density fraction $\Omega_m$. $\sigma_\mu$ is also sensitive to the resolution of the simulation used for its calculation. Tension in the measured value of $H_0$ from independent datasets, and the present use of outdated cosmological simulations, suggest $\sigma_\mu$ could be underestimated. We consider two classes of standard siren, supermassive black hole binary and binary neutron star mergers. Underestimating $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ when calculating $\sigma_\mu$ increases the probability of finding a residual lensing bias on these parameters greater than $1\sigma$ by 1.5-3 times. Underestimating $\sigma_\mu$ by using low resolution/small sky-area simulations can also significantly increase the probability of biased results. For neutron star mergers, the spread of possible biases is 0.25 km/s/Mpc, comparable to the forecasted uncertainty. Left uncorrected this effect limits the use of BNS mergers for precision cosmology. For supermassive black hole binaries, the spread of possible biases on $H_0$ is significant, 5 km/s/Mpc, but $O(200)$ observations are needed to reduce the variance below the bias. To achieve accurate sub-percent level precision on cosmological parameters using standard sirens, first much improved knowledge on the form of the magnification distribution and its dependence on cosmology is needed.</description>

      <title>Does the Correlation between 2MRS Galaxies and the CMB Indicate an Unmodeled CMB Foreground?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the claimed detection of a new cosmic microwave background (CMB) foreground based on the correlation between low-redshift 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) galaxies and CMB temperature maps from the Planck and WMAP missions. We reproduce the reported measurements but argue that the original analysis significantly underestimated the uncertainties. We cross-correlate the 2MRS galaxy positions with simulated CMB maps and show that the correlation measured with the real data for late-type spiral galaxies at angular scales $\theta\geq0.1^{\circ}$ and redshift $cz&lt;4500$ km s$^{-1}$ is consistent with zero at the $1.7\sigma$ level or less, depending on the exact CMB map and simulation construction. This was the sample that formed the basis for the original detection claim. For smaller angular separations the results are not robust to galaxy type or CMB cleaning method, and we are unable to draw firm conclusions. The original analysis did not propose a specific, falsifiable physical correlation mechanism, and it is impossible to rule out any contribution from an underlying physical effect. However, given our calculations, the lack of signal from expanding the redshift range, and the lack of corroboration from other galaxy surveys, we do not find the evidence for a new CMB foreground signal compelling.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Tsallis cosmology using recent low and high redshift measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Tsallis cosmology has been presented as a novel proposal for alleviating both $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions. Hence a universe filled with matter and radiation as perfect fluids and considering the Tsallis entropy is confronted using recent cosmological measurements coming from cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, hydrogen II galaxies, quasars, and baryon acoustic oscillations. Following a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis and combining the samples, we constrain the main characteristic parameters $\alpha = 1.031^{+0.054}_{-0.051}$ and $\delta = 1.005^{+0.001}_{-0.001}$ where the uncertainties are $1\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, we estimate the current deceleration parameter $q_0=-0.530^{+0.018}_{-0.017}$, the deceleration-acceleration transition redshift $z_T=0.632^{+0.028}_{-0.028}$ and the age of the universe $\tau_U = 12.637^{+0.067}_{-0.066}\,\rm{Gyrs}$ which are in agreement with the standard cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM) within $1.5\sigma$. Furthermore, we find that the dark energy equation of state is consistent with both phantom and quintessence behaviors within $1\sigma$ in the past and converging to $\Lambda$CDM in the future. Additionally, we find agreement values of $H_0$ within $1\sigma$ with the SH0ES values when the CMB distance priors are added to the analysis, suggesting that $H_0$ tension could be alleviated. Finally, Tsallis cosmology is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM by the combined data that motives further studies at the perturbation level.</description>

      <title>SKA sensitivity for possible radio emission from dark matter in Omega Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14117v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Omega Centauri, the largest known globular cluster in the Milky Way, is believed to be the remains of a dwarf galaxy's core. Giving its potential abundance of dark matter (DM), it is an attractive target for investigating the nature of this elusive substance in our local environment. Our study demonstrates that by observing Omega Centauri with the SKA for 1000 hours, we can detect synchrotron radio or Inverse Compton (IC) emissions from the DM annihilation products. It enables us to constrain the cross-section of DM annihilation down to $\sim {\rm 10^{-30}~cm^3~s^{-1}}$ for DM mass from several $\rm{GeV}$ to $\rm{100~GeV}$, which is much stronger compared with other observations. Additionally, we explore the axion, another well-motivated DM candidate, and provide stimulated decay calculations. It turns out that the sensitivity can reach $g_{\rm{a\gamma\gamma}} \sim 10^{-10} ~\rm{GeV^{-1}}$ for $2\times 10^{-7} ~\rm{eV} &lt; m_a &lt; 2\times 10^{-4} ~\rm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Albatross: A scalable simulation-based inference pipeline for analysing stellar streams in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar streams are potentially a very sensitive observational probe of galactic astrophysics, as well as the dark matter population in the Milky Way. On the other hand, performing a detailed, high-fidelity statistical analysis of these objects is challenging for a number of key reasons. Firstly, the modelling of streams across their (potentially billions of years old) dynamical age is complex and computationally costly. Secondly, their detection and classification in large surveys such as Gaia renders a robust statistical description regarding e.g., the stellar membership probabilities, challenging. As a result, the majority of current analyses must resort to simplified models that use only subsets or summaries of the high quality data. In this work, we develop a new analysis framework that takes advantage of advances in simulation-based inference techniques to perform complete analysis on complex stream models. To facilitate this, we develop a new, modular dynamical modelling code sstrax for stellar streams that is highly accelerated using jax. We test our analysis pipeline on a mock observation that resembles the GD1 stream, and demonstrate that we can perform robust inference on all relevant parts of the stream model simultaneously. Finally, we present some outlook as to how this approach can be developed further to perform more complete and accurate statistical analyses of current and future data.</description>

      <title>Peregrine: Sequential simulation-based inference for gravitational wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current and upcoming generations of gravitational wave experiments represent an exciting step forward in terms of detector sensitivity and performance. For example, key upgrades at the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA facilities will see the next observing run (O4) probe a spatial volume around four times larger than the previous run (O3), and design implementations for e.g. the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer and LISA experiments are taking shape to explore a wider frequency range and probe cosmic distances. In this context, however, a number of very real data analysis problems face the gravitational wave community. For example, it will be crucial to develop tools and strategies to analyse (amongst other scenarios) signals that arrive coincidentally in detectors, longer signals that are in the presence of non-stationary noise or other shorter transients, as well as noisy, potentially correlated, coherent stochastic backgrounds. With these challenges in mind, we develop peregrine, a new sequential simulation-based inference approach designed to study broad classes of gravitational wave signal. In this work, we describe the method and implementation, before demonstrating its accuracy and robustness through direct comparison with established likelihood-based methods. Specifically, we show that we are able to fully reconstruct the posterior distributions for every parameter of a spinning, precessing compact binary coalescence using one of the most physically detailed and computationally expensive waveform approximants (SEOBNRv4PHM). Crucially, we are able to do this using only 2% of the waveform evaluations that are required in e.g. nested sampling approaches. Finally, we provide some outlook as to how this level of simulation efficiency and flexibility in the statistical analysis could allow peregrine to tackle these current and future gravitational wave data analysis problems.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Arrow of Time in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that time's arrow is naturally induced by quantum mechanical evolution, whenever the systems have a very large number ${\cal N}$ of non-degenerate states and a Hamiltonian bounded from below. When ${\cal N}$ is finite, the arrow is imperfect, since evolution can resurrect past states. In the limit ${\cal N} \rightarrow \infty$ the arrow is fixed by the "tooth of time": the decay of excited states induced by {\it spontaneous emission} to the ground state, mediated by interactions and a large number of decay products which carry energy and information to infinity. This applies to individual isolated atoms, and does not require a coupling to a separate large heath bath.</description>

      <title>Mirror QCD phase transition as the origin of the nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16769v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have recently provided strong evidence for a nHz Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). Here we investigate the implications of a first-order phase transition occurring within the early universe's dark quantum chromodynamics (dQCD) epoch, specifically within the framework of the mirror twin Higgs dark sector model. Our analysis indicates a distinguishable SGWB signal originating from this phase transition, which can explain the measurements obtained by PTAs. Remarkably, a significant portion of the parameter space for the SGWB signal also effectively resolves the existing tensions in both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ measurements in Cosmology. This intriguing correlation suggests a possible common origin of these three phenomena for $0.2 &lt; \Delta N_{\rm eff} &lt; 0.5$, where the mirror dark matter component constitutes about $30\%$ of the total dark matter abundance. Next generation CMB experiment such as CMB-S4 is able to test this parameter region.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference for stochastic gravitational wave background data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next generation of space- and ground-based facilities promise to reveal an entirely new picture of the gravitational wave sky: thousands of galactic and extragalactic binary signals, as well as stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) of unresolved astrophysical and possibly cosmological signals. These will need to be disentangled to achieve the scientific goals of experiments such as LISA, Einstein Telescope, or Cosmic Explorer. We focus on one particular aspect of this challenge: reconstructing an SGWB from (mock) LISA data. We demonstrate that simulation-based inference (SBI) - specifically truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE) - is a promising avenue to overcome some of the technical difficulties and compromises necessary when applying more traditional methods such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC). To highlight this, we show that we can reproduce results from traditional methods both for a template-based and agnostic search for an SGWB. Moreover, as a demonstration of the rich potential of SBI, we consider the injection of a population of low signal-to-noise ratio supermassive black hole transient signals into the data. TMNRE can implicitly marginalize over this complicated parameter space, enabling us to directly and accurately reconstruct the stochastic (and instrumental noise) contributions. We publicly release our TMNRE implementation in the form of the code saqqara.</description>

      <title>LtU-ILI: An All-in-One Framework for Implicit Inference in Astrophysics and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference (LtU-ILI) pipeline, a codebase for rapid, user-friendly, and cutting-edge machine learning (ML) inference in astrophysics and cosmology. The pipeline includes software for implementing various neural architectures, training schemata, priors, and density estimators in a manner easily adaptable to any research workflow. It includes comprehensive validation metrics to assess posterior estimate coverage, enhancing the reliability of inferred results. Additionally, the pipeline is easily parallelizable and is designed for efficient exploration of modeling hyperparameters. To demonstrate its capabilities, we present real applications across a range of astrophysics and cosmology problems, such as: estimating galaxy cluster masses from X-ray photometry; inferring cosmology from matter power spectra and halo point clouds; characterizing progenitors in gravitational wave signals; capturing physical dust parameters from galaxy colors and luminosities; and establishing properties of semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. We also include exhaustive benchmarking and comparisons of all implemented methods as well as discussions about the challenges and pitfalls of ML inference in astronomical sciences. All code and examples are made publicly available at https://github.com/maho3/ltu-ili.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos and Relic Neutrino Matter Effect on the High-energy Neutrino Flavor Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac, they can potentially affect the flavor ratio predictions for the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube. In this context, we point out a novel matter effect induced by the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) on the flavor ratio composition. Specifically, the active-sterile neutrino oscillations over the astrophysical baseline lead to an energy-dependent flavor ratio at Earth due to the C$\nu$B matter effect, which is distinguishable from the vacuum oscillation effect, provided there is a local C$\nu$B overdensity. Considering the projected precision of the 3-neutrino oscillation parameter measurements and improved flavor triangle measurements, we show that the next-generation neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT, can probe the pseudo-Dirac neutrino hypothesis in a distinctive way.</description>
