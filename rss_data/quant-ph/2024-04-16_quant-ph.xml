      <title>Feasibility of first principles molecular dynamics in fault-tolerant quantum computer by quantum phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article shows a proof of concept regarding the feasibility of ab initio molecular simulation, wherein the wavefunctions and the positions of nuclei are simultaneously determined by the quantum algorithm, as is realized by the so-called Car-Parrinello method by classical computing. The approach used in this article is of a hybrid style, which shall be realized by future fault-tolerant quantum computer. First, the basic equations are approximated by polynomials. Second, those polynomials are transformed to a specific form, wherein all variables (representing the wavefunctions and the atomic coordinates) are given by the transformations acting on a linear space of monomials with finite dimension, and the unknown variables could be determined as the eigenvalues of those transformation matrices. Third, the eigenvalues are determined by quantum phase estimation. Following these three steps, namely, symbolic, numeric, and quantum steps, we can determine the optimized electronic and atomic structures of molecules.</description>

      <title>Model-based Offline Quantum Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first algorithm for model-based offline quantum reinforcement learning and demonstrates its functionality on the cart-pole benchmark. The model and the policy to be optimized are each implemented as variational quantum circuits. The model is trained by gradient descent to fit a pre-recorded data set. The policy is optimized with a gradient-free optimization scheme using the return estimate given by the model as the fitness function. This model-based approach allows, in principle, full realization on a quantum computer during the optimization phase and gives hope that a quantum advantage can be achieved as soon as sufficiently powerful quantum computers are available.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum simulation: a case study for understanding warm starts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The barren plateau phenomenon, characterized by loss gradients that vanish exponentially with system size, poses a challenge to scaling variational quantum algorithms. Here we explore the potential of warm starts, whereby one initializes closer to a solution in the hope of enjoying larger loss variances. Focusing on an iterative variational method for learning shorter-depth circuits for quantum real and imaginary time evolution we conduct a case study to elucidate the potential and limitations of warm starts. We start by proving that the iterative variational algorithm will exhibit substantial (at worst vanishing polynomially in system size) gradients in a small region around the initializations at each time-step. Convexity guarantees for these regions are then established, suggesting trainability for polynomial size time-steps. However, our study highlights scenarios where a good minimum shifts outside the region with trainability guarantees. Our analysis leaves open the question whether such minima jumps necessitate optimization across barren plateau landscapes or whether there exist gradient flows, i.e., fertile valleys away from the plateau with substantial gradients, that allow for training.</description>

      <title>Sparse Simulation of VQE Circuits for Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a promising algorithm for future Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices to simulate chemical systems. In this paper, we consider the classical simulation of the iterative Qubit Coupled Cluster (iQCC) ansatz. To this end, we implement a multi-threaded sparse wave function simulator and simulate iQCC circuits with up to 80 qubits and 980 entanglers to compare our results to experimental values and previous approximate simulations. In contrast to previous iQCC simulations, e.g., for computing the emission spectra of a phosphorescent emitting material, our approach features a variational guarantee, such that the resulting energies are true upper bounds on the exact energies. Additionally, our method is two orders of magnitude more memory-efficient, because it does not store the transformed Hamiltonians. Our theoretical analysis also enables the construction of ans\"atze with a limited number of nonzero amplitudes, for which our simulator can obtain exact results. This will allow one to generate complex benchmarking instances for future NISQ quantum computers and simulators.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Entanglement Renormalization on a Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed resource estimate for the prospect of using deep entanglement renormalization ansatz (DMERA) on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, focusing on the regime in which the target system is large. For probing a relatively large system size ($64\times 64$), we observe up to an order of magnitude reduction in the number of qubits, compared to the approaches based on quantum phase estimation (QPE). We discuss two complementary strategies to measure the energy. The first approach is based on a random sampling of the local terms of the Hamiltonian, requiring $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ invocations of quantum circuits, each of which have depth of at most $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, where $\epsilon$ is the relative precision in the energy and $N$ is the system size. The second approach is based on a coherent estimation of the expectation value of observables averaged over space, which achieves the Heisenberg scaling while incurring only a logarithmic cost in the system size. For estimating the energy per site of $\epsilon$, $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log N}{\epsilon} \right)$ $T$ gates and $\mathcal{O}\left(\log N \right)$ qubits suffice. The constant factor of the leading contribution is shown to be determined by the depth of the DMERA circuit, the gates used in the ansatz, and the periodicity of the circuit. We also derive tight bounds on the variance of the energy gradient, assuming the gates are random Pauli rotations.</description>

      <title>Landau-Zener without a Qubit: Unveiling Multiphoton Interference, Synthetic Floquet Dimensions, and Dissipative Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interference emerges when the parameters of a $\textit{qubit}$ are periodically modulated across an avoided level crossing. Here, we investigate the occurrence of the LZSM phenomenon in nonlinear multilevel bosonic systems, where the interference pattern is determined by multiple energy levels and cannot be described by a level crossing between only two states. We fabricate two superconducting resonators made of flux-tunable Josephson junction arrays. The first device is very weakly nonlinear (the nonlinearity is smaller than the photon-loss rate) and, when a weak driving field is applied, it behaves as a linear resonator, yet shows the same LZSM interference as in a two-level system. Notably, here the interference originates from multiple avoided level crossings of the harmonic ladder. When subjected to a stronger drive, nonlinear effects start playing a role, and the interference pattern departs from the one observed in two-level systems. We demonstrate that, when two or more LZSM interference peaks merge, dissipative quantum chaos emerges. In the second device, where the nonlinearity surpasses the photon-loss rate, we observe additional LZSM interference peaks due to Kerr multiphoton resonances. When described under the light of the Floquet theory, these resonances can be interpreted as synthetic modes of an array of coupled cavities. We derive a simple effective model highlighting the essential features of the entirety of these phenomena. As the control of LZSM in qubit systems led to the implementation of fast protocols for characterization and state preparation, our findings pave the way to better control of nonlinear resonators, with implications for diverse quantum technological platforms.</description>

      <title>A strongly interacting, two-dimensional, dipolar spin ensemble in (111)-oriented diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems of spins with strong dipolar interactions and controlled dimensionality enable new explorations in quantum sensing and simulation. In this work, we investigate the creation of strong dipolar interactions in a two-dimensional ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers generated via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) on (111)-oriented diamond substrates. We find that diamond growth on the (111) plane yields high incorporation of spins, both nitrogen and NV centers, where the density of the latter is tunable via the miscut of the diamond substrate. Our process allows us to form dense, preferentially aligned, 2D NV ensembles with volume-normalized AC sensitivity down to $\eta_{AC}$ = 810 pT um$^{3/2}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$. Furthermore, we show that (111) affords maximally positive dipolar interactions amongst a 2D NV ensemble, which is crucial for leveraging dipolar-driven entanglement schemes and exploring new interacting spin physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Risk Analysis of Financial Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two quantum algorithms to compute the Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) of financial derivatives using quantum computers: the first by applying existing ideas from quantum risk analysis to derivative pricing, and the second based on a novel approach using Quantum Signal Processing (QSP). Previous work in the literature has shown that quantum advantage is possible in the context of individual derivative pricing and that advantage can be leveraged in a straightforward manner in the estimation of the VaR and CVaR. The algorithms we introduce in this work aim to provide an additional advantage by encoding the derivative price over multiple market scenarios in superposition and computing the desired values by applying appropriate transformations to the quantum system. We perform complexity and error analysis of both algorithms, and show that while the two algorithms have the same asymptotic scaling the QSP-based approach requires significantly fewer quantum resources for the same target accuracy. Additionally, by numerically simulating both quantum and classical VaR algorithms, we demonstrate that the quantum algorithm can extract additional advantage from a quantum computer compared to individual derivative pricing. Specifically, we show that under certain conditions VaR estimation can lower the latest published estimates of the logical clock rate required for quantum advantage in derivative pricing by up to $\sim 30$x. In light of these results, we are encouraged that our formulation of derivative pricing in the QSP framework may be further leveraged for quantum advantage in other relevant financial applications, and that quantum computers could be harnessed more efficiently by considering problems in the financial sector at a higher level.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Hybrid HHL Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a classical enhancement to improve the accuracy of the Hybrid variant (Hybrid HHL) of the quantum algorithm for solving liner systems of equations proposed by Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd (HHL). We achieve this by using higher precision quantum estimates of the eigenvalues relevant to the linear system, and an enhanced classical processing step to guide the eigenvalue inversion part of Hybrid HHL. We show that eigenvalue estimates with just two extra bits of precision results in tighter error bounds for our Enhanced Hybrid HHL compared to HHL. We also show that our enhancement reduces the error of Hybrid HHL by an average of 57 percent on an ideal quantum processor for a representative sample of 2x2 systems. On IBM Hanoi and IonQ Aria-1 hardware, we see that the error of Enhanced Hybrid HHL algorithm is on average 13 percent and 20 percent (respecitvely) less than that of HHL for a similar set of 2x2 systems. Finally, we use simulated eigenvalue estimates to perform an inversion of a 4x4 matrix on IonQ Aria-1 with a fidelity of 0.61. To our knowledge this is the largest HHL implementation with a fidelity greater than 0.5.</description>

      <title>Simulating Chemistry on Bosonic Quantum Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic quantum devices offer a novel approach to realize quantum computations, where the quantum two-level system (qubit) is replaced with the quantum (an)harmonic oscillator (qumode) as the fundamental building block of the quantum simulator. The simulation of chemical structure and dynamics can then be achieved by representing or mapping the system Hamiltonians in terms of bosonic operators. In this perspective, we review recent progress and future potential of using bosonic quantum devices for addressing a wide range of challenging chemical problems, including the calculation of molecular vibronic spectra, the simulation of gas-phase and solution-phase adiabatic and nonadiabatic chemical dynamics, the efficient solution of molecular graph theory problems, and the calculations of electronic structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computations with quantum harmonic oscillators or qumodes is a promising and rapidly evolving approach towards quantum computing. In contrast to qubits, which are two-level quantum systems, bosonic qumodes can in principle have infinite discrete levels, and can also be represented with continuous variable bases. One of the most promising applications of quantum computing is simulating many-fermion problems such as molecular electronic structure. Although there has been a lot of recent progress on simulating many-fermion systems on qubit-based quantum hardware, they can not be easily extended to bosonic quantum devices due to the fundamental difference in physics represented by qubits and qumodes. In this work, we show how an electronic structure Hamiltonian can be transformed into a system of qumodes with a fermion to boson mapping scheme and apply it to simulate the electronic structure of dihydrogen molecule as a system of two qumodes. Our work opens the door for simulating many-fermion systems by harnessing the power of bosonic quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical eigenvalue solver that constructs a wavefunction ansatz from a linear combination of matrix product states in rotated orbital bases, enabling the characterization of chemical ground states that are not subject to the constraint of a one-dimensional area law of entanglement. The energy is converged via a gradient-free generalized sweep algorithm based on quantum subspace diagonalization, with a potentially exponential speedup in the off-diagonal matrix element contractions upon translation into shallow quantum circuits of linear depth in the number of qubits. Chemical accuracy is attained in numerical experiments for both a stretched water molecule and an octahedral arrangement of hydrogen atoms, achieving substantially better correlation energies compared to a unitary coupled-cluster benchmark, with orders of magnitude reductions in quantum resource estimates and a surprisingly high tolerance to shot noise. This proof-of-concept study suggests a promising new avenue for scaling up simulations of strongly correlated chemical systems on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in aperiodically driven classical spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically driven classical many-body systems can host a rich zoo of prethermal dynamical phases. In this work, we extend the paradigm of classical prethermalization to aperiodically driven systems. We establish the existence of a long-lived prethermal regime in spin systems subjected to random multipolar drives (RMDs). We demonstrate that the thermalization time scales as $(1/T)^{2n+2}$, where $n$ is the multipolar order and $T$ is the intrinsic time-scale associated with the drive. In the $n \rightarrow \infty$ limit, the drive becomes quasi-periodic and the thermalization time becomes exponentially long ($\sim \exp(\beta/T)$). We further establish the robustness of prethermalization by demonstrating that these thermalization time scaling laws hold for a wide range of initial state energy densities. Intriguingly, the thermalization process in these classical systems is parametrically slower than their quantum counterparts, thereby highlighting important differences between classical and quantum prethermalization. Finally, we propose a protocol to harness this classical prethermalization to realize time rondeau crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dense coding (QDC) means to transmit two classical bits by only transferring one quantum bit, which has enabled high-capacity information transmission and strengthened system security. Continuousvariable QDC offers a promising solution to increase communication rates while achieving seamless integration with classical communication systems. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a high-speed quantum radio-frequency-over-light (RFoL) communication scheme based on QDC with entangled state, and achieve a practical rate of 20 Mbps through digital modulation and RFoL communication. This scheme bridges the gap between quantum technology and real-world communication systems, which bring QDC closer to practical applications and offer prospects for further enhancement of metropolitan communication networks.</description>

      <title>A novel scheme for modelling dissipation or thermalization in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we introduce a novel method for investigating dissipation or thermalization in an open quantum system. In this method, the quantum system is coupled linearly with a copy of itself or with another system described by a finite number of bosonic operators. The time-dependent coupling functions play a fundamental role in this scheme. To demonstrate the efficacy and significance of this method, we apply it to examine several important and ubiquitous open quantum systems. Firstly, we investigate a quantum oscillator in the presence of a thermal bath at the inverse temperature $\beta$, obtaining the reduced density matrix, the Husimi distribution function, and the quantum heat distribution function accurately. The results are consistent with existing literature by appropriate choices for the time-dependent coupling function. To illustrate the generalizability of this method to systems interacting with multiple thermal baths, we study the interaction of a quantum oscillator with two thermal baths at different temperatures and obtain compatible results. Subsequently, we analyze a two-level atom with energy or phase dissipation and derive the spontaneous emission and the pure dephasing processes consistently using the new method. Finally, we investigate Markovian and non-Markovian processes in a dissipative two-level atom and observe that these processes depend on the coupling strength $g_0$, and the non-Markovian property increases with an increase in $g_0$.</description>

Abstract: Quantum technologies offer a promising route to the efficient sampling and analysis of stochastic processes, with potential applications across the sciences. Such quantum advantages rely on the preparation of a quantum sample state of the stochastic process, which requires a memory system to propagate correlations between the past and future of the process. Here, we introduce a method of lossy quantum dimension reduction that allows this memory to be compressed, not just beyond classical limits, but also beyond current state-of-the-art quantum stochastic sampling approaches. We investigate the trade-off between the saving in memory resources from this compression, and the distortion it introduces. We show that our approach can be highly effective in low distortion compression of both Markovian and strongly non-Markovian processes alike. We further discuss the application of our results to quantum stochastic modelling more broadly.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-enhanced quantum sensing in Stark probes</title>

Abstract: Stark systems in which a linear gradient field is applied across a many-body system have recently been harnessed for quantum sensing. Here, we explore sensing capacity of Stark models, in both single-particle and many-body interacting systems, for estimating the strength of both linear and nonlinear Stark fields. The problem naturally lies in the context of multi-parameter estimation. We determine the phase diagram of the system in terms of both linear and nonlinear gradient fields showing how the extended phase turns into a localized one as the Stark fields increase. We also characterize the properties of the phase transition, including critical exponents, through a comprehesive finite-size scaling analysis. Interestingly, our results show that the estimation of both the linear and the nonlinear fields can achieve super-Heisenberg scaling. In fact, the scaling exponent of the sensing precision is directly proportional to the nonlinearity exponent which shows that nonlinearity enhances the estimation precision. Finally, we show that even after considering the cost of the preparation time the sensing precision still reveals super-Heisenberg scaling.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study on A Tapered Paul Trap: From Design to Potential Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a tapered Paul trap whose radio frequency electrodes are inclined to the symmetric axis of the endcap electrodes, resulting in a funnel-shaped trapping potential. With this configuration, a charged particle confined in this trap has its radial degrees of freedom coupled to that of the axial direction. The same design was successfully used to experimentally realize a single-atom heat engine, and with this setup amplification of zeptonewton forces was implemented. In this paper, we show the design, implementation, and characterization of such an ion trap in detail. This system offers a high level of control over the ion's motion. Its novel features promise applications in the field of quantum thermodynamics, quantum sensing, and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Observation of thermal microwave photons with a Josephson junction detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When measuring electromagnetic radiation of frequency $f$, the most sensitive detector is the one that counts the single quanta of energy $h f$. Single photon detectors (SPDs) were demonstrated from $\gamma$-rays to infrared wavelengths, and extending this range down to the microwaves is the focus of intense research. The energy of $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ microwave photon, about $40\,\mathrm{\mu eV}$ or $7\, \mathrm{yJ},$ is enough to force a superconducting Josephson junction into its resistive state, making it suitable to be used as a sensor. In this work, we use an underdamped Josephson junction to detect single thermal photons stochastically emitted by a microwave copper cavity at millikelvin temperatures. After characterizing the source and detector, we vary the temperature of the resonant cavity and measure the increased photon rate. The device shows an efficiency up to 40% and a dark count rate of $0.1\,\mathrm{Hz}$ in a bandwidth of several gigahertz. To confirm the thermal nature of the emitted photons we verify their super-Poissonian statistics, which is also a signature of quantum chaos. We discuss detector application in the scope of Dark Matter Axion searches, and note its importance for quantum information, metrology and fundamental physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify two signatures of quantum vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field on a harmonically trapped charged particle. They are a shift from the natural trap frequency and generation of quantum coherences. The frequency shift, estimated for a single-electron cyclotron, should be observable in future experiments. We also suggest a possible route to detecting vacuum-generated quantum coherences. We assess the role of the long-wavelength and rotating-wave approximations in arriving at our estimates. These experiments should settle the debate on the choice of approximations and gauge in capturing the effect of the quantum vacuum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Quantum Jumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the principles of the ETH - Approach to Quantum Mechanics we study fluorescence and the phenomenon of ``quantum jumps'' in idealized models of atoms coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field. In a limiting regime where the orbital motion of the atoms is neglected and the velocity of light tends to infinity we derive explicit non-linear stochastic differential equations describing the effective time evolution of states of individual atoms. These equations give rise to a measure on state-trajectories with quantum jumps which is a quantum-mechanical analogue of the Wiener measure of Brownian motion. Our results amount to a derivation of the fundamental randomness in the quantum-mechanical description of microscopic systems from basic principles in the context of some simple models.</description>

      <title>Pulse Engineering via Projection of Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an iterative optimal control method of quantum systems, aimed at an implementation of a desired operation with optimal fidelity. The update step of the method is based on the linear response of the fidelity to the control operators, and its projection onto the mode functions of the corresponding operator. Our method extends methods such as gradient ascent pulse engineering and variational quantum algorithms, by determining the fidelity gradient in a hyperparameter-free manner, and using it for a multi-parameter update, capitalizing on the multi-mode overlap of the perturbation and the mode functions. This directly reduces the number of dynamical trajectories that need to be evaluated in order to update a set of parameters. We demonstrate this approach, and compare it to the standard GRAPE algorithm, for the example of a quantum gate on two qubits, demonstrating a clear improvement in convergence and optimal fidelity of the generated protocol.</description>

      <title>Purification of Noisy Measurements and Faithful Distillation of Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider entanglement distillation in a realistic scenario with noisy operations in which quantum measurements that constitute a general quantum operation are particularly noisy. We present a protocol for purifying noisy measurements and show that with the help of the purification, imperfect local operations can be used to distill entanglement. We show that the purification protocol is robust against noise in implementation and analyze the purification in a practical realization: for measurement and gate errors up to 10%, we suggest that the purification with two additional qubits is cost-effective for distilling entanglement. The purification protocol is feasible with currently available quantum technologies and readily applied to entanglement applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a powerful framework aiming to determine optimal behavior in highly complex decision-making scenarios. This objective can be achieved using policy iteration, which requires to solve a typically large linear system of equations. We propose the variational quantum policy iteration (VarQPI) algorithm, realizing this step with a NISQ-compatible quantum-enhanced subroutine. Its scalability is supported by an analysis of the structure of generic reinforcement learning environments, laying the foundation for potential quantum advantage with utility-scale quantum computers. Furthermore, we introduce the warm-start initialization variant (WS-VarQPI) that significantly reduces resource overhead. The algorithm solves a large FrozenLake environment with an underlying 256x256-dimensional linear system, indicating its practical robustness.</description>

      <title>Few-mode squeezing in type-I parametric downconversion by complete group velocity matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-degenerate pulsed type-I parametric downconversion is a widely used source of squeezed light for numerous quantum optical applications. However, this source is typically spectrally multimode and the generated squeezing is distributed between many spectral modes with a limited degree of squeezing per mode. We show that in a nonlinear crystal, where the condition of complete group velocity matching for the pump and the signal is satisfied, the number of generated modes may be as low as 2 or 3 modes. We illustrate the general theory with the example of the MgO-doped lithium niobate crystal pumped at 775 nm and generating squeezed light at 1.55 $\mu$m. Our model includes the derivation of the degree of squeezing from the properties of the pump and the crystal and shows that 12 dB of squeezing can be obtained in a periodically poled crystal of length 80 mm.</description>

      <title>Scatter-Gather DMA Performance Analysis within an SoC-based Control System for Trapped-Ion Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scatter-gather dynamic-memory-access (SG-DMA) is utilized in applications that require high bandwidth and low latency data transfers between memory and peripherals, where data blocks, described using buffer descriptors (BDs), are distributed throughout the memory system. The data transfer organization and requirements of a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer (TIQC) possess characteristics similar to those targeted by SG-DMA. In particular, the ion qubits in a TIQC are manipulated by applying control sequences consisting primarily of modulated laser pulses. These optical pulses are defined by parameters that are (re)configured by the electrical control system. Variations in the operating environment and equipment make it necessary to create and run a wide range of control sequence permutations, which can be well represented as BD regions distributed across the main memory. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the latency and throughput of SG-DMA on Xilinx radiofrequency SoC (RFSoC) devices under a variety of BD and payload sizes as a means of determining the benefits and limitations of an RFSoC system architecture for TIQC applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for copula-based risk aggregation using orthogonal series density estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo integration (QMCI) provides a quadratic speed-up over its classical counterpart, and its applications have been investigated in various fields, including finance. This paper considers its application to risk aggregation, one of the most important numerical tasks in financial risk management. Risk aggregation combines several risk variables and quantifies the total amount of risk, taking into account the correlation among them. For this task, there exists a useful tool called copula, with which the joint distribution can be generated from marginal distributions with a flexible correlation structure. Classically, the copula-based method utilizes sampling of risk variables. However, this procedure is not directly applicable to the quantum setting, where sampled values are not stored as classical data, and thus no efficient quantum algorithm is known. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for copula-based risk aggregation that is compatible with QMCI. In our algorithm, we first estimate each marginal distribution as a series of orthogonal functions, where the coefficients can be calculated with QMCI. Then, by plugging the marginal distributions into the copula and obtaining the joint distribution, we estimate risk measures using QMCI again. With this algorithm, nearly quadratic quantum speed-up can be obtained for sufficiently smooth marginal distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors based on solid-state defects, in particular nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, enable precise measurement of magnetic fields, temperature, rotation, and electric fields. However, the sensitivity of leading NV spin ensemble sensors remains far from the intrinsic spin-projection noise limit. Here we move towards this quantum limit of performance by introducing (i) a cavity quantum electrodynamic (cQED) hybrid system operating in the strong coupling regime, which enables high readout fidelity of an NV ensemble using microwave homodyne detection; (ii) a comprehensive nonlinear model of the cQED sensor operation, including NV ensemble inhomogeneity and optical polarization; and (iii) ``spin refrigeration'' where the optically-polarized spin ensemble sharply reduces the ambient-temperature microwave thermal noise, resulting in enhanced sensitivity. Applying these advances to magnetometry, we demonstrate a broadband sensitivity of 580 fT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ around 15 kHz in ambient conditions. We then discuss the implications of this model for design of future magnetometers, including devices approaching 12 fT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity. Applications of these techniques extend to the fields of gyroscope and clock technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of non-Markovian open quantum dynamics is essential but challenging for standard quantum computers due to their non-Hermitian nature, leading to non-unitary evolution, and the limitations of available quantum resources. Here we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed for simulating dissipative dynamics in system with non-Markovian environment. Our approach includes formulating a non-Markovian Stochastic Schr\"odinger equation with complex frequency modes (cNMSSE) where the non-Markovianity is characterized by the mode excitation. Following this, we utilize variational quantum simulation to capture the non-unitary evolution within the cNMSSE framework, leading to a substantial reduction in qubit requirements. To demonstrate our approach, we investigated the spin-boson model and dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPT) within transverse field Ising model (TFIM). Significantly, our findings reveal the enhanced DQPT in TFIM due to non-Markovian behavior.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the multimode nature of single-photon sources based on spontaneous parametric down conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon sources are necessary components for many prospective quantum technologies. One candidate for a single-photon source is spontaneous parametric down conversion combined with a heralding photon detection. The heralded light pulse from such a source, is typically treated as single-mode, this treatment, however, is incomplete. We develop a full multimode description based on the exact Bogoliubov treatment of the down conversion process. We then provide a perturbative and effective treatment, which illustrates the most important physical mechanisms and permits analytical estimates of the success probability and purity of single-photon states under practical heralding conditions, both without relying on the precise detection time of the heralding photon and when accepting photons only in a narrow window around the time of the detection. This permits us to characterize the emitted light under three different assumptions for the pump pulse. For spontaneous parametric down conversion with a very short pump pulse, we find the single-mode description to be accurate, while for longer pump pulses and continuous pumping, a multimode description is necessary. Our findings can be used to guide the design of quantum information protocols based on heralded single-photon sources, as their performance may depend on the multimode nature of the sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) can be considered the backbone of the modern power system optimization process, with a large application spectrum, from Unit Commitment and Optimal Transmission Switching to verifying Neural Networks for power system applications. The main issue of these formulations is the computational complexity of the solution algorithms, as they are considered NP-Hard problems. Quantum computing has been tested as a potential solution towards reducing the computational burden imposed by these problems, providing promising results, motivating the can be used to speedup the solution of MILPs. In this work, we present a general framework for solving power system optimization problems with a Quantum Computer (QC), which leverages mathematical tools and QCs' sampling ability to provide accelerated solutions. Our guiding applications are the optimal transmission switching and the verification of neural networks trained to solve a DC Optimal Power Flow. Specifically, using an accelerated version of Benders Decomposition , we split a given MILP into an Integer Master Problem and a linear Subproblem and solve it through a hybrid ``quantum-classical'' approach, getting the best of both worlds. We provide 2 use cases, and benchmark the developed framework against other classical and hybrid methodologies, to demonstrate the opportunities and challenges of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for power system mixed integer optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Two-time quantities as elements of physical reality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, time correlators have received renewed attention, especially under the guise of identifiers of nonclassical correlations. However, the physical interpretation of these objects, and more generally of multi-times variables, remains ambiguous, which may be one of the reasons why they are so difficult to measure. In this work, we introduce and advance the perspective that a two-time correlator should actually be regarded as an average involving a novel single physical observable, one that cannot be rephrased in terms of the primitive ones, according to quantum principles. In particular, we provide examples showing that the presumed constituents of a two-time correlator and the proposed two-time operator itself cannot be simultaneous elements of the physical reality.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space delocalization under random unitary circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary dynamics of a quantum system initialized in a selected basis state yields, generically, a state that is a superposition of all the basis states. This process, associated with the quantum information scrambling and intimately tied to the resource theory of coherence, may be viewed as a gradual delocalization of the system's state in the Hilbert space. This work analyzes the Hilbert space delocalization under dynamics of random quantum circuits, which serve as a minimal model of chaotic dynamics of quantum many-body systems. We employ analytical methods based on the replica trick and Weingarten calculus to investigate the time evolution of the participation entropies which quantify the Hilbert space delocalization. We demonstrate that the participation entropies approach, up to a fixed accuracy, their long-time saturation value in times that scale logarithmically with the system size. Exact numerical simulations and tensor network techniques corroborate our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During their operation, due to shifts in environmental conditions, devices undergo various forms of detuning from their optimal settings. Typically, this is addressed through control loops, which monitor variables and the device performance, to maintain settings at their optimal values. Quantum devices are particularly challenging since their functionality relies on precisely tuning their parameters. At the same time, the detailed modeling of the environmental behavior is often computationally unaffordable, while a direct measure of the parameters defining the system state is costly and introduces extra noise in the mechanism. In this study, we investigate the application of reinforcement learning techniques to develop a model-free control loop for continuous recalibration of quantum device parameters. Furthermore, we explore the advantages of incorporating minimal environmental noise models. As an example, the application to numerical simulations of a Kennedy receiver-based long-distance quantum communication protocol is presented.</description>

      <title>Quantum Teleportation Coexisting with Conventional Classical Communications in Optical Fiber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability for quantum and classical networks to operate in the same optical fibers would aid the deployment of quantum network technology. However, quantum performance can be susceptible to noise photons generated by spontaneous Raman scattering of high-power coexisting classical light. Quantum teleportation is a fundamental operation in quantum networking, but has yet to be demonstrated in fibers populated with high data rate conventional optical signals. In this paper, we demonstrate a three-node quantum state teleportation system coexisting with 400-Gbps C-band classical communications in 30.2 km of fiber. To protect quantum fidelity, Raman noise rates are suppressed using optimized O-band quantum channels and filtering in multiple degrees of freedom. Fidelity is shown to be well maintained with elevated classical powers as high as 18.7 dBm, which could support multiple classical channels with many terabits/s aggregate data rates. These results show the feasibility of advanced quantum and classical network applications operating within a unified fiber infrastructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new approach to quantum benchmarking inspired by quantum verification motivating new paradigms of quantum benchmarking. Our proposed benchmark not only serves as a robust indicator of computational capability but also offers scalability, customizability, and universality. By providing formal statements regarding the quality of quantum devices while assuming device consistency, we eliminate the reliance on heuristics. We establish a deep connection between quantum verification and quantum benchmarking. For practical application, we present a concrete benchmarking protocol derived from a quantum verification protocol, and prove it to match our redefined standards for quantum benchmarking.</description>

      <title>An angle rounding parameter initialization technique for ma-QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-angle quantum approximate optimization algorithm (ma-QAOA) is a recently introduced algorithm that gives at least the same approximation ratio as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and, in most cases, gives a significantly higher approximation ratio than QAOA. One drawback to ma-QAOA is that it uses significantly more classical parameters than QAOA, so the classical optimization component more complex. In this paper, we motivate a new parameter initialization strategy in which angles are initially randomly set to multiples of $\pi/4$ between $-2\pi$ and $2\pi$ and this vector is used to seed one round of BFGS. We find that the parameter initialization strategy on four-vertex and eight-vertex data sets gives average approximation ratios of 0.931 and 0.894, respectively. This is comparable to the average approximation ratios of ma-QAOA where optimal parameters are found using BFGS with 1 random starting seed, which are 0.910 and 0.901 for the four-vertex and eight-vertex data sets.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Distributed Algorithms for the Survivable Network Design Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate distributed classical and quantum approaches for the survivable network design problem (SNDP), sometimes called the generalized Steiner problem. These problems generalize many complex graph problems of interest, such as the traveling salesperson problem, the Steiner tree problem, and the k-connected network problem. To our knowledge, no classical or quantum algorithms for the SNDP have been formulated in the distributed settings we consider. We describe algorithms that are heuristics for the general problem but give concrete approximation bounds under specific parameterizations of the SNDP, which in particular hold for the three aforementioned problems that SNDP generalizes. We use a classical, centralized algorithmic framework first studied in (Goemans &amp; Bertsimas 1993) and provide a distributed implementation thereof. Notably, we obtain asymptotic quantum speedups by leveraging quantum shortest path computations in this framework, generalizing recent work of (Kerger et al. 2023). These results raise the question of whether there is a separation between the classical and quantum models for application-scale instances of the problems considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A model potential previously developed for the ammonia molecule is treated in a single-center partial-wave approximation in analogy with a self-consistent field method developed by Moccia. The latter was used in a number of collision studies. The model potential is used to calculate dc Stark resonance parameters, i.e., resonance positions and shifts within a single-center partial wave expansion, using the exterior complex scaling method for the radial coordinate. Three molecular valence orbitals are investigated for fields along the three Cartesian coordinates, i.e., along the molecular axis and in two perpendicular directions. The work extends previous work on the planar-geometry water molecule for which non-monotonic shifts were observed. We find such non-monotonic shifts for fields along the molecular axis. For perpendicular fields we report the splitting of the 1e orbitals into a fast- and a slow-ionizing orbital.</description>

      <title>Relating interfacial Rossby wave interaction in shear flows with Feynman's two-state coupled quantum system model for the Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we show how Feynman's simplified model for the Josephson junction, as a macroscopic two-state coupled quantum system, has a one-to-one correspondence with the stable dynamics of two interfacial Rossby waves in piecewise linear shear flows. The conservation of electric charge and energy of the superconducting electron gas layers become respectively equivalent to the conservation of wave action and pseudoenergy of the Rossby waves. Quantum-like tunneling is enabled via action-at-a-distance between the two Rossby waves. Furthermore, the quantum-like phenomena of avoided crossing between eigenstates, described by the Klein-Gordon equation, is obtained as well in the classical shear flow system. In the latter, it results from the inherent difference in pseudoenergy between the in-phase and anti-phased normal modes of the interfacial waves. This provides an intuitive physical meaning to the role of the wavefunction's phase in the quantum system. A partial analog to the quantum collapse of the wavefunction is also obtained due to the existence of a separatrix between "normal mode regions of influence" on the phase plane, describing the system's dynamics. As for two-state quantum bits (qubits), the two-Rossby wave system solutions can be represented on a Bloch sphere, where the Hadamard gate transforms the two normal modes/eigenstates into an intuitive computational basis in which only one interface is occupied by a Rossby wave. Yet, it is a classical system which lacks exact analogs to collapse and entanglement, thus cannot be used for quantum computation, even in principle.</description>

      <title>Energy Transfer Mechanism Under Incoherent Light Excitation in noisy Environments: Memory Effects in Efficiency Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations in the energy gap and coupling constants in and between chromophores can play important role in the absorption and energy transfer across a collection of two level systems. In a noisy environment, fluctuations can control efficiency of energy transfer through several factors, including quantum coherence. Several recent studies have investigated the impact of light-induced stationary quantum coherence on the efficiency of transferring optical excitation to a designated "trap" state, crucial for subsequent reactions such as those in photosynthesis. However, these studies have typically employed either a Markovian, or a perturbative approximation for the environment induced fluctuations. In this study, we depart from these approaches to incorporate memory effects by using Kubo's quantum stochastic Liouville equation (QSLE). We introduce the effects of the decay of excitation (to the ground state) and the desired trapping that provides the direction of the motion of the excitation. In the presence of light-induced pumping, we establish a relation between the mean survival time, efficiency, and the correlation decay time of the bath-induced fluctuations. We find a decrease in the steady state coherence during the transition from the non-Markovian regime (characterized by small values of fluctuation strength V and inverse of bath correlation time b) to the Markovian limit (where V and b are both large), resulting in a decrease in efficiency. We recover a connection between transfer flux and the imaginary part of coherences in both equilibrium and excited bath states, in both correlated and We uncover a non-monotonic dependence of efficiency on site energy heterogeneity for both correlated and uncorrelated bath models.</description>

      <title>Multi-photon stimulated grasers assisted by laser-plasma interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically the possibility of achieving the stimulated amplification of $\gamma$-rays. Herein, our approach circumvents the so-called ``graser dilemma" through a non-linear, multi-photon mechanism. Our work foresees the combination of a high-intensity $\gamma-$flash generated by the interaction of a high-intensity laser pulse with plasma and intensive photons supplied by an additional laser. We show that multi-photon stimulated emission processes can have a larger effective cross-section compared to a one-photon process. The bandwidth of the supplied photons can also be tuned to curtail linewidth broadening. Naturally, Mossbauer transitions can be chosen to apply the scheme in the first instance. Furthermore, we derive that even multi-photon stimulated emission in the form of an anti-Stokes type could allow our scheme to be applied to non-Mossbauer nuclei, provided that the supplied photon energy can be tuned to compensate for the recoil and other broadening induced losses. The graser development can be spearheaded using multi-PW class high-power laser systems such as the 10 PW installation at Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) in Romania.</description>

      <title>Wormholes and Factorization in Exact Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the general framework of effective theories obtained via exact path integration of a complete theory over some sector of its degrees of freedom. Theories constructed this way contain multi-integrals which couple fields arbitrarily far apart, and in certain settings even on path-disconnected components of the space. These are not just entanglement, but genuine non-local interactions that we dub quantum wormholes.
  Any state the path integral of such an effective theory prepares is shown to be a partial trace of a state of the complete theory over the integrated-out sector. The resulting reduced density operator is generally mixed due to bra-ket wormholes. An infinite family of ensembles of pure states of the complete theory giving the same effective state is identified. These allow one to equivalently interpret any effective state as being prepared by an ensemble of theories. When computing entropic quantities, bra-ket wormholes give rise to replica wormholes. This causes replica path integrals for the effective theory to not factorize even when the underlying manifold does, as expected from mixing. In contrast, effective theories obtained by derivative expansions have no quantum wormholes and prepare pure states. There exist operators in the algebra of effective theories which can distinguish mixed from pure states, implying a breakdown of non-exact effective theories for sufficiently complex observables.
  This framework unifies and provides new insights into much of the phenomena observed in quantum gravity, including the interplay between wormholes and unitarity, the breakdown of bulk effective theory, the factorization puzzle, state ensembles, theory ensembles, quantum error correction, and baby universes. Some interesting lessons are drawn accounting also for characteristic aspects of gravity concerning IR/UV mixing and Kaluza-Klein reductions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ''Berry-dipole semimetals'', whose band degeneracies are characterized by quantized Berry dipoles. Through a two-band model constructed by Hopf map, we reveal that the Berry-dipole semimetals display a multitude of salient properties distinct from other topological semimetals. On the boundary, we find that the first-order Berry-dipole semimetal harbors anomalous paired Fermi arcs with the same spin polarization, even though the layer Chern number is zero, and the second-order Berry-dipole semimetal hosts dispersionless hinge arcs. In the bulk, we find that the low-energy Berry-dipole Hamiltonian near the band node has a quadratic energy dispersion and peculiar Berry curvature, which give rise to rather unique characteristics in the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, orbital magnetization and Landau levels. Our study shows that Berry-dipole semimetals are a class of topological gapless phases supporting rich intriguing physics.</description>

      <title>Universal distributions of overlaps from unitary dynamics in generic quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the preparation of a quantum state using a circuit of depth $t$ from a factorized state of $N$ sites. We argue that in the appropriate scaling limit of large $t$ and $N$, the overlap between states evolved under generic many-body chaotic dynamics belongs to a family of universal distribution that generalizes the celebrated Porter-Thomas distribution. This is a consequence of a mapping in the space of replicas to a model of dilute domain walls. Our result provides a rare example in which analysis at an arbitrary number of replicas is possible, giving rise to the complete overlap distribution. Our general picture is derived and corroborated by the exact solution of the random phase model and of an emergent random matrix model given by the Ginibre ensemble. Finally, numerical simulations of two distinct random circuits show excellent agreement, thereby demonstrating universality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimal control of switching on a coupling term between two quantum many-body systems. Specifically, we (i) quantify the energetic cost of establishing a weak junction between two quantum spin-$1/2$ chains in finite time $\tau$ and (ii) identify the energetically optimal protocol to realize it. For linear driving protocols, we find that for long times the excess (irreversible) work scales as $\tau^{-\eta}$, where $\eta=1, 2$ or a nonuniversal number depending on the phase of the chains. Interestingly, increasing a $J_z$ anisotropy in the chains suppresses the excess work thus promoting quasi-adiabaticity. The general optimal control problem is solved, employing a Chebyshev ansatz. We find that the optimal control protocol is intimately sensitive to the chain phases.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics at the Quantum-Classical Boundary: A Self-Consistent Framework Based on Adiabatic-Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscopic thermal machines promise to play an important role in future quantum technologies. Making such devices widely applicable will require effective strategies to channel their output into easily accessible storage systems like classical degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a self-consistent theoretical framework that makes it possible to model such quantum-classical hybrid devices in a thermodynamically consistent manner. Our approach is based on the assumption that the quantum part of the device is subject to strong decoherence and dissipation induced by a thermal reservoir. Due to the ensuing separation of time scales between slowly evolving classical and fast relaxing quantum degrees of freedom, the dynamics of the hybrid system can be described by means of adiabatic-response theory. We show that, upon including fluctuations in a minimally consistent way, the resulting equations of motion can be equipped with a first and second law, both on the ensemble level and on the level of individual trajectories of the classical part of the system, where thermodynamic quantities like heat and work become stochastic variables. As an application of our theory, we work out a physically transparent model of a quantum-classical hybrid engine, whose working system consists of a chain of Rydberg atoms, which is confined in an optical cavity and driven by periodic temperature variations. We show by means of numerical simulations that the engine can sustain periodic oscillations of a movable mirror, which acts as a classical load, against external friction and extract the full distributions of input heat and output work. By making the statistics of thermodynamic processes in quantum-classical hybrid systems accessible without the need to further specify a measurement protocol, our work contributes towards bridging the long-standing gap between classical and quantum stochastic thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Rotational Superradiance in a Time-Reversal Symmetry-Broken Quantum Gas inside an Optical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Appearance of quantized vortices in a superfluid and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) stems from their nontrivial response to broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Here we show that breaking of the TRS by, for example, rotation or an external synthetic magnetic field in a transversely-driven BEC coupled to a single mode of an optical cavity modifies drastically Dicke-superradiance and self-ordering phenomena in this system. In particular, photon scattering from the pump laser into the cavity is amplified by the rotational motion of the BEC, leading to so-called 'rotational superradiance' - in a loose analogy to black-hole physics - with distinct critical scaling properties. Another notable finding is that cavity photons mediate long-range, periodic attractive interactions among the vortices, which compete with pair-wise logarithmic repulsive vortex interactions and deform the Abrikosov triangular vortex lattice favoring a stripe-like pattern. Remarkably, the rotation of the BEC and topological properties of the vortex lattice can be monitored nondestructively through the cavity output field.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of an optical tweezer phonon laser</title>

Abstract: The creation and manipulation of coherence continues to capture the attention of scientists and engineers. The optical laser is a canonical example of a system that, in principle, exhibits complete coherence. Recent research has focused on the creation of coherent, laser-like states in other physical systems. The phonon laser is one example where it is possible to amplify self-sustained mechanical oscillations. A single mode phonon laser in a levitated optical tweezer has been demonstrated through appropriate balance of active feedback gain and damping. In this work, coherent control of the dynamics of an optical tweezer phonon laser is used to share coherence between its different modes of oscillation, creating a multimode phonon laser. The coupling of the modes is achieved by periodically rotating the asymmetric optical potential in the transverse focal plane of the trapping beam via trap laser polarization rotation. The presented theory and experiment demonstrate that coherence can be transferred across different modes of an optical tweezer phonon laser, and are a step toward using these systems for precision measurement and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Strong Markov dissipation in driven-dissipative quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation, which describes Markovian quantum dynamics under dissipation, is usually derived under the weak system-bath coupling assumption. Strong system-bath coupling often leads to non-Markov evolution. The singular-coupling limit is known as an exception: it yields a Lindblad equation with an arbitrary strength of dissipation. However, the singular-coupling limit requires high-temperature limit of the bath, and hence the system ends up in a trivial infinite-temperature state, which is not desirable in the context of quantum control. In this work, it is shown that we can derive a Markovian Lindblad equation for an arbitrary strength of the system-bath coupling by considering a new scaling limit that is called the singular-driving limit, which combines the singular-coupling limit and fast periodic driving. In contrast to the standard singular-coupling limit, an interplay between dissipation and periodic driving results in a nontrivial steady state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Possible light bosonic dark matter interactions with the Standard Model photon have been searched by microwave resonant cavities. In this paper, we demonstrate the cryogenic readout system calibration of a 7.138 GHz copper cavity with a loaded quality factor $Q_l=10^4$, operated at 22 mK temperature based on a dilution refrigerator. Our readout system consists of High Electron Mobility Transistors as cryogenic amplifiers at 4 K, plus room-temperature amplifiers and a spectrum analyzer for signal power detection. We test the system with a superconducting two-level system as a single-photon source in the microwave frequency regime and report an overall 95.6 dB system gain and -71.4 dB attenuation in the cavity's input channel. The effective noise temperature of the measurement system is 7.5 K.</description>

Abstract: We present a new scheme to create all-optical tunable and lossless waveguide using a controllable coherent Raman process in an atomic rubidium vapor in N-type configuration. We employ a Gaussian Raman field and a Laguerre-Gaussian control field to imprint a high-contrast tunable waveguide-like feature inside the atomic medium. We numerically demonstrate that such a waveguide is able to guide arbitrary modes of a weak probe beam to several Rayleigh length without diffraction and absorption. Our results on all-optical waveguide based scheme may have potential application in lossless image processing, high contrast biomedical imaging and image metrology.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is a highly abstract scientific discipline, which, however, is expected to have great practical relevance in future information technology. This forces educators to seek new methods to teach quantum computing for students with diverse backgrounds and with no prior knowledge of quantum physics. We have developed an online course built around an interactive quantum circuit simulator designed to enable easy creation and maintenance of course material with ranging difficulty. The immediate feedback and automatically evaluated tasks lowers the entry barrier to quantum computing for all students, regardless of their background.</description>

      <title>Advances in Atom Interferometry and their Impacts on the Performance of Quantum Accelerometers On-board Future Satellite Gravity Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in cold atom interferometry have cleared the path for space applications of quantum inertial sensors, whose level of stability is expected to increase dramatically with the longer interrogation times accessible in space. In this study, a comprehensive in-orbit model is developed for a Mach-Zehnder-type cold-atom accelerometer. Performance tests are realized under different assumptions, and the impact of various sources of errors on instrument stability is evaluated. Current and future advances for space-based atom interferometry are discussed, and their impact on the performance of quantum sensors on-board satellite gravity missions is investigated in three different scenarios: state-of-the-art scenario, near-future (between the next 5 and 10 years) and far-future scenarios (between the next 10 to 20 years). We show that one can achieve a sensitivity level close to 5E-10 with the current state-of-the-art technology. We also estimate that in the near and far-future, atom interferometry in space is expected to achieve sensitivity levels of 1E-11 and 1E-12, respectively. A roadmap for improvements in atom interferometry is provided that would maximize the performance of future CAI accelerometers, considering their technical capabilities. Finally, the possibility and challenges of having ultra-sensitive atom interferometry in space for future space missions are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a bipartition technique using a super-lattice architecture to access correlations between alternating planes of a mesoscopic array of spin-3 chromium atoms trapped in a 3D optical lattice. Using this method, we observe that out-of-equilibrium dynamics driven by long-range dipolar interactions lead to spin anti-correlations between the two spatially separated subsystems. Our bipartite measurements reveal a subtle interplay between the anisotropy of the 3D dipolar interactions and that of the lattice structure, without requiring single-site addressing. We compare our results to theoretical predictions based on a truncated cumulant expansion and a new cluster semi-classical method that we use to investigate correlations at the microscopic scale. Comparison with a high-temperature analytical model reveals quantum thermalization at a high negative spin temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong coupling of organic molecules to the vacuum field of a nanoscale cavity can be used to modify their chemical and physical properties. We extend the Tavis-Cummings model for molecular ensembles and show that the often neglected interaction terms arising from the static dipole moment and the dipole self-energy are essential for a correct description of the light-matter interaction in polaritonic chemistry. On the basis of a full quantum description, we simulate the excited-state dynamics and spectroscopy of MgH$^+$ molecules resonantly coupled to an optical cavity. We show that the inclusion of static dipole moments and the dipole self-energy is necessary to obtain a consistent model. We construct an efficient two-level system approach that reproduces the main features of the real molecular system and may be used to simulate larger molecular ensembles.</description>

      <title>Keeping the photon in the dark: Enabling full quantum dot control by chirped pulses and magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because dark excitons in quantum dots are not directly optically accessible, so far they have not played a significant role in using quantum dots for photon generation. They possess significantly longer lifetimes than their brighter counterparts and hence offer enormous potential for photon storage or manipulation. In this work, we demonstrate an all-optical storage and retrieval of the spin-forbidden dark exciton in a quantum dot from the ground state employing chirped pulses and an in-plane magnetic field. Our experimental findings are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions of the dynamics calculated using state-of-the-art product tensor methods. Our scheme enables an all-optical control of dark states without relying on any preceding decays. This opens up a new dimension for optimal quantum control and time-bin entangled photon pair generation from quantum dots.</description>

Abstract: We propose and investigate a method to optimize recurrence entanglement purification protocols. The approach is based on a numerical search in the whole set of SU(4) matrices with the aid of a quasi-Newton algorithm. Our method evaluates average concurrences where the probabilistic occurrence of mixed entangled states is also taken into account. We show for certain families of states that optimal protocols are not necessarily achieved by bilaterally applied controlled-NOT gates. As we discover several optimal solutions, the proposed method offers some flexibility in experimental implementations of entanglement purification protocols and interesting perspectives in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>A random matrix model for random approximate $t$-designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Haar random set $\mathcal{S}\subset U(d)$ of quantum gates we consider the uniform measure $\nu_\mathcal{S}$ whose support is given by $\mathcal{S}$. The measure $\nu_\mathcal{S}$ can be regarded as a $\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)$-approximate $t$-design, $t\in\mathbb{Z}_+$. We propose a random matrix model that aims to describe the probability distribution of $\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)$ for any $t$. Our model is given by a block diagonal matrix whose blocks are independent, given by Gaussian or Ginibre ensembles, and their number, size and type is determined by $t$. We prove that, the operator norm of this matrix, $\delta({t})$, is the random variable to which $\sqrt{|\mathcal{S}|}\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)$ converges in distribution when the number of elements in $\mathcal{S}$ grows to infinity. Moreover, we characterize our model giving explicit bounds on the tail probabilities $\mathbb{P}(\delta(t)&gt;2+\epsilon)$, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. We also show that our model satisfies the so-called spectral gap conjecture, i.e. we prove that with the probability $1$ there is $t\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $\sup_{k\in\mathbb{Z}_{+}}\delta(k)=\delta(t)$. Numerical simulations give convincing evidence that the proposed model is actually almost exact for any cardinality of $\mathcal{S}$. The heuristic explanation of this phenomenon, that we provide, leads us to conjecture that the tail probabilities $\mathbb{P}(\sqrt{\mathcal{S}}\delta(\nu_\mathcal{S},t)&gt;2+\epsilon)$ are bounded from above by the tail probabilities $\mathbb{P}(\delta(t)&gt;2+\epsilon)$ of our random matrix model. In particular our conjecture implies that a Haar random set $\mathcal{S}\subset U(d)$ satisfies the spectral gap conjecture with the probability $1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common feature of collapse models and an expected signature of the quantization of gravity at energies well below the Planck scale is the deviation from ordinary quantum-mechanical behavior. Here, we analyze the general consequences of such modifications from the point of view of quantum information theory and we anticipate applications to different quantum systems. We show that quantum systems undergo corrections to the quantum speed limit which, in turn, imply the modification of the Heisenberg limit for parameter estimation. Our results hold for a wide class of scenarios beyond ordinary quantum mechanics. For some nonlocal models inspired by quantum gravity, the bounds are found to oscillate in time, an effect that could be tested in future high-precision quantum experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present the construction of standard entanglement-assisted (EA) qubit Reed-Muller (RM) codes and their tensor product variants from classical RM codes. We show that the EA RM codes obtained using the CSS construction have zero coding rate and negative catalytic rate. We further show that EA codes constructed from these same classical RM codes using the tensor product code (TPC) construction have positive coding rate and provide a subclass of EA RM TPCs that have positive catalytic rate, thus establishing the coding analog of superadditivity for this family of codes, useful towards quantum communications. We also generalize this analysis to obtain conditions for EA TPCs from classical codes to have positive catalytic rate when their corresponding EA CSS codes have zero rate.</description>

Abstract: We propose an analogue of $\text{SU}(1,1)$ interferometry to measure rotation of a spin by using two-spin squeezed states. Attainability of the Heisenberg limit for the estimation of the rotation angle is demonstrated for maximal squeezing. For a specific direction and strength an advantage in sensitivity for all equatorial rotation axes (and hence non-commuting rotations) over the classical bound is shown in terms of quadratic scaling of the single-parameter quantum Fisher information for the corresponding rotation angles. Our results provide a method for measuring magnetic fields in any direction in the $x$-$y$-plane with the same optimized initial state.</description>

Abstract: We present a protocol to encode and decode arbitrary quantum states in the parity architecture with constant circuit depth using measurements, local nearest-neighbor and single-qubit operations only. While this procedure typically requires a quadratic overhead of simultaneous qubit measurements, it allows for a simple and low-depth implementation of logical multi-qubit gates in the parity encoding via code deformation. We discuss how such encoding and decoding schemes can be used to flexibly change the size and shape of the underlying code to enable a more efficient implementation of quantum gates or algorithms. We apply the new findings to the QAOA which leads to a constant depth implementation using local gates at the same optimization performance as the standard, potentially non-local, QAOA approach without the parity encoding. Furthermore, we show that our method can reduce the depth of implementing the quantum Fourier transform by a factor of two when allowing measurements.</description>

      <title>Multi-self-loop Lackadaisical Quantum Walk with Partial Phase Inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lackadaisical quantum walk, a quantum analog of the lazy random walk, is obtained by adding a weighted self-loop transition to each state. Impacts of the self-loop weight $l$ on the final success probability in finding a solution make it a key parameter for the search process. The number of self-loops can also be critical for search tasks. This article proposes the quantum search algorithm Multi-self-loop Lackadaisical Quantum Walk with Partial Phase Inversion, which can be defined as a lackadaisical quantum walk with multiple self-loops, where the target state phase is partially inverted. In the proposed algorithm, each vertex has $m$ self-loops, with weights $l' = l/m$, where $l$ is a real parameter. The phase inversion is based on Grover's algorithm and acts partially, modifying the phase of a given quantity $s &lt; m$ of self-loops. We also propose two new weight values based on two ideal weights $l$ used in the literature. On a hypercube structure, we analyzed the situation where $s=1$ and $1 \leqslant m \leqslant 30$. We investigated the effects of partial phase inversion in the search for $1$ to $12$ marked vertices. As a result, this proposal improved the maximum success probabilities to values close to $1$ in $O (\sqrt{(n+m)\cdot N})$, where $n$ is the hypercube degree. This article contributes with a new perspective on the use of quantum interferences in constructing new quantum search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories via deterministic duality transformations assisted by measurements</title>

Abstract: Quantum simulation is one of the major applications of quantum devices. In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, however, the general quantum simulation is not yet feasible, such as that of lattice gauge theories, which is likely limited due to the violation of the Gauss law constraint and the complexity of the real-time dynamics, especially in the deconfined phase. Inspired by the recent works of S. Ashkenazi and E. Zohar [Phys. Rev. A 105, 022431 (2022)] and of N. Tantivasadakarn, R. Thorngren, A. Vishwanath, and R. Verresen [arXiv: 2112.01519], we propose to simulate dynamics of lattice gauge theories by using the Kramers-Wannier transfomation via cluster-state-like entanglers, mid-circuit measurements and feedforwarded corrections, which altogether is a constant-depth deterministic operation. In our scheme, specifically, we first quantum simulate the time evolution under a corresponding symmetric Hamiltonian from an initial symmetric state, and then apply the Kramers-Wannier procedure. This results in a wave function that has time evolved under the corresponding lattice gauge theory from a corresponding initial, gauged wave function. In the presence of noises in time evolution, the procedure succeeds when we can pair up magnetic monopoles represented by non-trivial measurement outcomes. Further, given a noise-free Kramers-Wannier transformation, the resulting wave function from a noisy time evolution satisfies the Gauss law constraint. We give explicit examples with the low dimensional pure gauge theories and gauge theories coupled to bosonic/fermionic matters such as the Fradkin-Shenker model.</description>

      <title>Characterising the Hierarchy of Multi-time Quantum Processes with Classical Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memory is the fundamental form of temporal complexity: when present but uncontrollable, it manifests as non-Markovian noise; conversely, if controllable, memory can be a powerful resource for information processing. Memory effects arise from/are transmitted via interactions between a system and its environment; as such, they can be either classical or quantum. From a practical standpoint, quantum processes with classical memory promise near-term applicability: they are more powerful than their memoryless counterpart, yet at the same time can be controlled over significant timeframes without being spoiled by decoherence. However, despite practical and foundational value, apart from simple two-time scenarios, the distinction between quantum and classical memory remains unexplored. Here, we analyse multi-time quantum processes with memory mechanisms that transmit only classical information forward in time. Complementing this analysis, we also study two related -- but simpler to characterise -- sets of processes that could also be considered to have classical memory from a structural perspective, and demonstrate that these lead to remarkably distinct phenomena in the multi-time setting. Subsequently, we systematically stratify the full hierarchy of memory effects in quantum mechanics, many levels of which collapse in the two-time setting, making our results genuinely multi-time phenomena.</description>

      <title>Derivative Pricing using Quantum Signal Processing</title>

Abstract: Pricing financial derivatives on quantum computers typically includes quantum arithmetic components which contribute heavily to the quantum resources required by the corresponding circuits. In this manuscript, we introduce a method based on Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) to encode financial derivative payoffs directly into quantum amplitudes, alleviating the quantum circuits from the burden of costly quantum arithmetic. Compared to current state-of-the-art approaches in the literature, we find that for derivative contracts of practical interest, the application of QSP significantly reduces the required resources across all metrics considered, most notably the total number of T-gates by $\sim 16$x and the number of logical qubits by $\sim 4$x. Additionally, we estimate that the logical clock rate needed for quantum advantage is also reduced by a factor of $\sim 5$x. Overall, we find that quantum advantage will require $4.7$k logical qubits, and quantum devices that can execute $10^9$ T-gates at a rate of $45$MHz. While in this work we focus specifically on the payoff component of the derivative pricing process where the method we present is most readily applicable, similar techniques can be employed to further reduce the resources in other applications, such as state preparation.</description>

      <title>Amplifying Frequency Up-Converted Infrared Signals with a Molecular Optomechanical Cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency up-conversion, enabled by molecular optomechanical coupling, has recently emerged as a promising approach for converting infrared signals into the visible range through quantum coherent conversion of signals. However, detecting these converted signals poses a significant challenge due to their inherently weak signal intensity. In this work, we propose an amplification mechanism capable of enhancing the signal intensity by a factor of 1000 or more for the frequency up-converted infrared signal in a molecular optomechanical system. The mechanism takes advantage of the strong coupling enhancement with molecular collective mode and Stokes sideband pump. This work demonstrates a feasible approach for up-converting infrared signals to the visible range.</description>

      <title>More Quantum Chemistry with Fewer Qubits</title>

Abstract: Quantum computation is one of the most promising new paradigms for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei, with applications in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, or molecular biology. This requires a truncated representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian using a finite number of orbitals. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian. An important application is to go beyond the active-space approximation, allowing to include corrections of virtual orbitals, known as multireference perturbation theory. Here, we exploit that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. This gives rise to more accurate energy estimates without increasing the number of qubits. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically for realistic chemical systems that the overall runtime of our method has highly favourable scaling in the number of virtual orbitals compared to previous work. The numerical calculations confirm the necessity of the multireference perturbation theory energy corrections to reach accurate ground state energy estimates. Our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can also be applied to Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory. As such, we reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry by leveraging perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Reversibility of quantum resources through probabilistic protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the most fundamental questions in the manipulation of quantum resources such as entanglement is the possibility of reversibly transforming all resource states. The key consequence of this would be the identification of a unique entropic resource measure that exactly quantifies the limits of achievable transformation rates. Remarkably, previous results claimed that such asymptotic reversibility holds true in very general settings; however, recently those findings have been found to be incomplete, casting doubt on the conjecture. Here we show that it is indeed possible to reversibly interconvert all states in general quantum resource theories, as long as one allows protocols that may only succeed probabilistically. Although such transformations have some chance of failure, we show that their success probability can be ensured to be bounded away from zero, even in the asymptotic limit of infinitely many manipulated copies. As in previously conjectured approaches, the achievability here is realised through operations that are asymptotically resource non-generating, and we show that this choice is optimal: smaller sets of transformations cannot lead to reversibility. Our methods are based on connecting the transformation rates under probabilistic protocols with strong converse rates for deterministic transformations, which we strengthen into an exact equivalence in the case of entanglement distillation.</description>

      <title>Statistical Complexity of Quantum Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant activity on the problem of using data for the purpose of learning properties of quantum systems or of processing classical or quantum data via quantum computing. As in classical learning, quantum learning problems involve settings in which the mechanism generating the data is unknown, and the main goal of a learning algorithm is to ensure satisfactory accuracy levels when only given access to data and, possibly, side information such as expert knowledge. This article reviews the complexity of quantum learning using information-theoretic techniques by focusing on data complexity, copy complexity, and model complexity. Copy complexity arises from the destructive nature of quantum measurements, which irreversibly alter the state to be processed, limiting the information that can be extracted about quantum data. For example, in a quantum system, unlike in classical machine learning, it is generally not possible to evaluate the training loss simultaneously on multiple hypotheses using the same quantum data. To make the paper self-contained and approachable by different research communities, we provide extensive background material on classical results from statistical learning theory, as well as on the distinguishability of quantum states. Throughout, we highlight the differences between quantum and classical learning by addressing both supervised and unsupervised learning, and we provide extensive pointers to the literature.</description>

      <title>Check-Agnosia based Post-Processor for Message-Passing Decoding of Quantum LDPC Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inherent degeneracy of quantum low-density parity-check codes poses a challenge to their decoding, as it significantly degrades the error-correction performance of classical message-passing decoders. To improve their performance, a post-processing algorithm is usually employed. To narrow the gap between algorithmic solutions and hardware limitations, we introduce a new post-processing algorithm with a hardware-friendly orientation, providing error correction performance competitive to the state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed post-processing, referred to as check-agnosia, is inspired by stabilizer-inactivation, while considerably reducing the required hardware resources, and providing enough flexibility to allow different message-passing schedules and hardware architectures. We carry out a detailed analysis for a set of Pareto architectures with different tradeoffs between latency and power consumption, derived from the results of implemented designs on an FPGA board. We show that latency values close to one microsecond can be obtained on the FPGA board, and provide evidence that much lower latency values can be obtained for ASIC implementations. In the process, we also demonstrate the practical implications of the recently introduced t-covering layers and random-order layered scheduling.</description>

      <title>Towards Unclonable Cryptography in the Plain Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By leveraging the no-cloning principle of quantum mechanics, unclonable cryptography enables us to achieve novel cryptographic protocols that are otherwise impossible classically. Two most notable examples of unclonable cryptography are quantum copy-protection and unclonable encryption. Most known constructions rely on the quantum random oracle model (as opposed to the plain model). Despite receiving a lot of attention in recent years, two important open questions still remain: copy-protection for point functions in the plain model, which is usually considered as feasibility demonstration, and unclonable encryption with unclonable indistinguishability security in the plain model. A core ingredient of these protocols is the so-called monogamy-of-entanglement (MoE) property. Such games allow quantifying the correlations between the outcomes of multiple non-communicating parties sharing entanglement in a particular context. Specifically, we define the games between a challenger and three players in which the first player is asked to split and share a quantum state between the two others, who are then simultaneously asked a question and need to output the correct answer.
  In this work, by relying on previous works of Coladangelo, Liu, Liu, and Zhandry (Crypto'21) and Culf and Vidick (Quantum'22), we establish a new MoE property for subspace coset states, which allows us to progress towards the aforementioned goals. However, it is not sufficient on its own, and we present two conjectures that would allow first to show that copy-protection of point functions exists in the plain model, with different challenge distributions (including arguably the most natural ones), and then that unclonable encryption with unclonable indistinguishability security exists in the plain model. We believe that our new MoE to be of independent interest, and it could be useful in other applications as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the SYK model -- an important toy model for quantum gravity on IBM's superconducting qubit quantum computers. By using a graph-coloring algorithm to minimize the number of commuting clusters of terms in the qubitized Hamiltonian, we find the gate complexity of the time evolution using the first-order product formula for $N$ Majorana fermions is $\mathcal{O}(N^5 J^{2}t^2/\epsilon)$ where $J$ is the dimensionful coupling parameter, $t$ is the evolution time, and $\epsilon$ is the desired precision. With this improved resource requirement, we perform the time evolution for $N=6, 8$ with maximum two-qubit circuit depth of 343. We perform different error mitigation schemes on the noisy hardware results and find good agreement with the exact diagonalization results on classical computers and noiseless simulators. In particular, we compute return probability after time $t$ and out-of-time order correlators (OTOC) which is a standard observable of quantifying the chaotic nature of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>CAMEL: Physically Inspired Crosstalk-Aware Mapping and gatE Scheduling for Frequency-Tunable Quantum Chips</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crosstalk represents a formidable obstacle in quantum computing. When quantum gates are executed parallelly, the resonance of qubit frequencies can lead to residual coupling, compromising the fidelity. Existing crosstalk solutions encounter difficulties in mitigating crosstalk and decoherence when dealing with parallel two-qubit gates in frequency-tunable quantum chips. Inspired by the physical properties of frequency-tunable quantum chips, we introduce a Crosstalk-Aware Mapping and gatE Scheduling (CAMEL) approach to address these challenges. CAMEL aims to mitigate crosstalk of parallel two-qubit gates and suppress decoherence. Utilizing the features of the tunable coupler, the CAMEL approach integrates a pulse compensation method for crosstalk mitigation. Furthermore, we present a compilation framework, including two steps. Firstly, we devise a qubit mapping approach that accounts for both crosstalk and decoherence. Secondly, we introduce a gate timing scheduling approach capable of prioritizing the execution of the largest set of crosstalk-free parallel gates to shorten quantum circuit execution times. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of CAMEL in mitigating crosstalk compared to crosstalk-agnostic methods. Furthermore, in contrast to approaches serializing crosstalk gates, CAMEL successfully suppresses decoherence. Finally, CAMEL exhibits better performance over dynamic-frequency awareness in low-complexity hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose using the dynamical invariant also known as the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant, to speed-up the equilibration of a driven open quantum system. This allows us to reverse engineer the time-dependent master equation that describes the dynamics of the open quantum system and systematically derive a protocol that realizes a shortcut to equilibration. The method does not require additional constraints on the timescale of the dynamics beside the Born-Markov approximation and can be generically applied to boost single particle quantum engines significantly. We demonstrate it with the damped harmonic oscillator, and show that our protocol can achieve a high-fidelity control in shorter timescales than simple non-optimized protocols. We find that the system is heated during the dynamics to speed-up the equilibration, which can be considered as an analogue of the Mpemba effect in quantum control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to entangle two magnon modes based on parity measurement. In particular, we consider a system that two yttrium-iron-garnet spheres are coupled to a $V$-type superconducting qutrit through the indirect interactions mediated by cavity modes. An effective parity-measurement operator that can project the two macroscopic spin systems to the desired subspace emerges when the ancillary qutrit is projected to the ground state. Consequently, conventional and multi-excitation magnon Bell states can be generated from any separable states with a nonvanishing population in the desired subspace. The target state can be distilled with a near-to-unit fidelity only by several rounds of measurements and can be stabilized in the presence of the measurement imperfection and environmental decoherence. In addition, a single-shot version of our scheme is obtained by shaping the detuning in the time domain. Our scheme that does not rely on any nonlinear Hamiltonian brings insight to the entangled-state generation in massive ferrimagnetic materials via quantum measurement.</description>

Abstract: We show that the concept of total variance of a spin state, defined as the average of the variances of spin projection measurements along three orthogonal axes, also gives the rotational speed of the state in projective space, averaged over all rotation axes. We compute the addition law, under system composition, for this quantity and find that, in the case of separable states, it is of simple pythagorean form. In the presence of entanglement, we find that the composite state "rotates faster than its parts", thus unveiling a kinematical origin for the correlation of total variance with entanglement. We analyze a similar definition for the acceleration of a state under rotations, for both pure and mixed states, and probe numerically its relation with a wide array of entanglement related measures.</description>

In this work, we investigate possible reasons why, and analyze the impact of different low mode volume resonator design choices on their utility in quantum optics experiments. We analyze band structure features and loss rates of low mode volume bowtie cavities in diamond and demonstrate independent design control over cavity-emitter coupling strength and loss rates. Further, using silicon vacancy centers in diamond as exemplary emitters, we investigate the influence of placement imprecision. We find that the benefit on photon collection efficiency and indistinguishability is limited, while the fabrication complexity of ultra-small cavity designs increases substantially compared to conventional photonic crystals. We conclude that ultra-small mode volume designs are primarily of interest for dispersive spin-photon interactions, which are of great interest for future quantum networks.</description>

      <title>A blockBP decoder for the surface code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new decoder for the surface code, which combines the accuracy of the tensor-network decoders with the efficiency and parallelism of the belief-propagation algorithm. Our main idea is to replace the expensive tensor-network contraction step in the tensor-network decoders with the blockBP algorithm - a recent approximate contraction algorithm, based on belief propagation. Our decoder is therefore a belief-propagation decoder that works in the degenerate maximal likelihood decoding framework. Unlike conventional tensor-network decoders, our algorithm can run efficiently in parallel, and may therefore be suitable for real-time decoding. We numerically test our decoder and show that for a large range of lattice sizes and noise levels it delivers a logical error probability that outperforms the Minimal-Weight-Perfect-Matching (MWPM) decoder, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted classical capacities of some channels acting as radial multipliers on fermion algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a new class of unital quantum channels on $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$, acting as radial multipliers when we identify the matrix algebra $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$ with a finite-dimensional fermion algebra. Our primary contribution lies in the precise computation of the (optimal) rate at which classical information can be transmitted through these channels from a sender to receiver when they share an unlimited amount of noiseless entanglement. Our approach relies on new connections between fermion algebras with the $n$-dimensional discrete hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$. Significantly, our calculations yield exact values applicable to the operators of the fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. This advancement not only provides deeper insights into the structure and behaviour of these channels but also enhances our understanding of Quantum Information Theory in a dimension-independent context.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of the echo state property in quantum reservoir computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The echo state property (ESP) represents a fundamental concept in the reservoir computing (RC) framework that ensures output-only training of reservoir networks by being agnostic to the initial states and far past inputs. However, the traditional definition of ESP does not describe possible non-stationary systems in which statistical properties evolve. To address this issue, we introduce two new categories of ESP: $\textit{non-stationary ESP}$, designed for potentially non-stationary systems, and $\textit{subspace/subset ESP}$, designed for systems whose subsystems have ESP. Following the definitions, we numerically demonstrate the correspondence between non-stationary ESP in the quantum reservoir computer (QRC) framework with typical Hamiltonian dynamics and input encoding methods using non-linear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) tasks. We also confirm the correspondence by computing linear/non-linear memory capacities that quantify input-dependent components within reservoir states. Our study presents a new understanding of the practical design of QRC and other possibly non-stationary RC systems in which non-stationary systems and subsystems are exploited.</description>

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger equation for an electron under the influence of an electromagnetic field is analyzed based on the conserved operators of the system when the magnetic field is described by Landau's gauge. It is shown that the Lorentz force can be recovered only if two conserved generalized momentum operators are considered: one along the $x$-axis and the second one along $y$-axis; otherwise, the system cannot be fully described. Based on the general solution found, a ground state is built which has the characteristic of having quantized resistivity proportional to integer multiples of the von Klitzing's constant when it is invariant under a unitary transform.</description>

      <title>Concatenated Steane code with single-flag syndrome checks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fault-tolerant error correction (FTEC) protocol with a high error suppression rate and low overhead is very desirable for the near-term implementation of quantum computers. In this work, we develop a distance-preserving flag FTEC protocol for the [[49,1,9]] concatenated Steane code, which requires only two ancilla qubits per generator and can be implemented on a planar layout. We generalize the weight-parity error correction (WPEC) technique from [Phys. Rev. A 104, 042410 (2021)] and find a gate ordering of flag circuits for the concatenated Steane code which makes syndrome extraction with two ancilla qubits per generator possible. The FTEC protocol is constructed using the optimization tools for flag FTEC developed in [arXiv:2306.12862] and is simulated under the circuit-level noise model without idling noise. Our simulations give a pseudothreshold of $1.64 \times 10^{-3}$ for the [[49,1,9]] concatenated Steane code, which is better than a pseudothreshold of $1.43 \times 10^{-3}$ for the [[61,1,9]] 6.6.6 color code simulated under the same settings. This is in contrast to the code capacity model where the [[61,1,9]] code performs better.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently gained attention where the growth of operator complexity in time is measured in terms of the off-diagonal operator Lanczos coefficients. The operator Lanczos algorithm reduces the problem of complexity growth to a single-particle semi-infinite tight-binding chain (known as the Krylov chain). Employing the phenomenon of Anderson localization, we propose the inverse localization length on the Krylov chain as a probe to detect weak ergodicity-breaking. On the Krylov chain we find delocalization in an ergodic regime, as we show for the SYK model, and localization in case of a weakly ergodicity-broken regime. Considering the dynamics beyond scrambling, we find a collapse across different system sizes at the point of weak ergodicity-breaking leading to a quantitative prediction. We further show universal traits of different operators in the ergodic regime beyond the scrambling dynamics. We test for two settings: (1) the coupled SYK model, and (2) the quantum East model. Our findings open avenues for mapping ergodicity/weak ergodicity-breaking transitions to delocalization/localization phenomenology on the Krylov chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing provides a promising approach for solving the real-time dynamics of systems consist of quarks and gluons from first-principle calculations that are intractable with classical computers. In this work, we start with an initial problem of the ultra-relativistic quark-nucleus scattering and present an efficient and precise approach to quantum simulate the dynamics on the light front. This approach employs the eigenbasis of the asymptotic scattering system and implements the compact scheme for basis encoding. It exploits the operator structure of the light-front Hamiltonian of the scattering system, which enables the Hamiltonian input scheme that utilizes the quantum Fourier transform for efficiency. It utilizes the truncated Taylor series for the dynamics simulations. The qubit cost of our approach scales logarithmically with the Hilbert space dimension of the scattering system. The gate cost has optimal scaling with the simulation error and near optimal scaling with the simulation time. These scalings make our approach advantageous for large-scale dynamics simulations on future fault-tolerant quantum computers. We demonstrate our approach with a simple scattering problem and benchmark the results with those from the Trotter algorithm and the classical calculations, where good agreement between the results is found.</description>

      <title>QUSL: Quantum Unsupervised Image Similarity Learning with Enhanced Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging quantum advantages to enhance machine learning capabilities has become a primary focus of research, particularly for complex tasks such as image similarity detection. To fully exploit the potential of quantum computing, it is essential to design quantum circuits tailored to the specific characteristics of the task at hand. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel quantum unsupervised similarity learning method,QUSL. Building upon the foundation of similarity detection triplets and generating positive samples through perturbations of anchor images, QUSL operates independently of classical oracles. By leveraging the performance of triplets and the characteristics of quantum circuits, QUSL systematically explores high-performance quantum circuit architectures customized for dataset features using metaheuristic algorithms, thereby achieving efficient quantum feature extraction with reduced circuit costs. Comprehensive numerical simulations and experiments on quantum computers demonstrate QUSL's remarkable performance compared to state-of-the-art quantum methods. QUSL achieves reductions exceeding 50% in critical quantum resource utilization while also realizing an enhancement of up to 19.5% in similarity detection correlation across the DISC21, COCO, and landscape datasets. This enables efficient quantum similarity modeling for large-scale unlabeled image data with reduced quantum resource utilization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement-induced quantum computation with continuous-variable cluster states utilizes teleportation propagating the states through the cluster accompanied by non-Gaussian measurements and feedforward control. We analyze such propagation of a quantum non-Gaussian state with nonlinear squeezing through a small cluster state and show that when a nonlinear feedforward is involved in the teleportation protocol, higher nonlinear squeezing can be transferred. In a probabilistic regime, the improvement can be manifested even with current experimental resources. Better processing of non-Gaussian states can bring us closer to the necessary interplay between cluster states and non-Gaussianity required by quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: The recently proposed zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM) source of entangled photons enables higher efficiency in entanglement distribution than SPDC sources and can be carried out using both space-to-ground and ground-to-ground links. We demonstrate the flexibility of ZALM architectures to be adapted to alternative entanglement distribution protocols. Focusing on the counter-intuitive result that entanglement can be generated between distant parties without using any entanglement as a resource, we analyze two protocols for entanglement distribution to memories via separable states. Modelling them in a ZALM setup, we consider the effects of noise both in the communication channels and in the memories. We thereby identify the optimal protocol to use, with respect to the highest entanglement generated, given the noise conditions of the network.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes experiments showing that some tasks in natural language processing (NLP) can already be performed using quantum computers, though so far only with small datasets.
  We demonstrate various approaches to topic classification. The first uses an explicit word-based approach, in which word-topic scoring weights are implemented as fractional rotations of individual qubit, and a new phrase is classified based on the accumulation of these weights in a scoring qubit using entangling controlled-NOT gates. This is compared with more scalable quantum encodings of word embedding vectors, which are used in the computation of kernel values in a quantum support vector machine: this approach achieved an average of 62% accuracy on classification tasks involving over 10000 words, which is the largest such quantum computing experiment to date.
  We describe a quantum probability approach to bigram modeling that can be applied to sequences of words and formal concepts, investigating a generative approximation to these distributions using a quantum circuit Born machine, and an approach to ambiguity resolution in verb-noun composition using single-qubit rotations for simple nouns and 2-qubit controlled-NOT gates for simple verbs.
  The smaller systems described have been run successfully on physical quantum computers, and the larger ones have been simulated. We show that statistically meaningful results can be obtained using real datasets, but this is much more difficult to predict than with easier artificial language examples used previously in developing quantum NLP systems.
  Other approaches to quantum NLP are compared, partly with respect to contemporary issues including informal language, fluency, and truthfulness.</description>

Abstract: Whereas many different models exist in the mathematical and physics literature for ground states of non-relativistic crystals, the relativistic case has been much less studied and we are not aware of any mathematical result on a fully relativistic treatment of crystals. In this paper, we introduce a mean-field relativistic energy for crystals in terms of periodic density matrices. This model is inspired both from a recent definition of the Dirac-Fock ground state for atoms and molecules, due to one of us, and from the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock model for crystals. We prove the existence of a ground state when the number of electrons per cell is not too large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By calculating the dynamical structure factor along the high symmetry directions in the Brillouin zone, the dynamical excitations of attractive Fermi-Hubbard model in a two-dimensional square optical lattice are studied with random phase approximation. {Two kinds of collective modes are investigated, including a Goldstone phonon mode at transferred momentum ${\bf q}=\left[0,0\right]$ and a roton mode at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$. The phonon origins from the spontaneously U(1) symmetry breaking of pairing gap, and its speed is suppressed by the interaction strength. The collective roton mode origins from the breaking of a global pseudospin SU(2) symmetry.} Dynamical excitations at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$ consist of a sharp roton molecular peak in the low-energy region and a broad atomic excitation band in the higher energy region. Furthermore, the weight of the roton molecular peak decreases monotonically with increasing the hopping strength, while the weight of the atomic excitations increases quickly. Interestingly we check that the area covered by the roton molecular peak scales with the square of the pairing gap, which is also true in the system with spin-orbit coupling. This conclusion paves a potential way to measure the pairing gap of lattice system experimentally by measuring the dynamical structure factor at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric topological phases with Pontryagin index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a certain class of three-dimensional topological insulators and semimetals protected by spinless $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, hosting an integer-valued bulk invariant. We show using homotopy arguments that these phases host multi-gap topology, providing a realization of a single $\mathbb{Z}$ invariant in three spatial dimensions that is distinct from the Hopf index. We identify this invariant with the Pontryagin index, which describes BPST instantons in particle physics contexts and corresponds to a 3-sphere winding number. We study naturally arising multi-gap linked nodal rings, topologically characterized by split-biquaternion charges, which can be removed by non-Abelian braiding of nodal rings, even without closing a gap. We additionally connect the describing winding number in terms of gauge-invariant combinations of non-Abelian Berry connection elements, indicating relations to Pontryagin characteristic class in four dimensions. These topological configurations are furthermore related to fully non-degenerate multi-gap phases that are characterized by a pair of winding numbers relating to two isoclinic rotations in the case of four bands and can be generalized to an arbitrary number of bands. From a physical perspective, we also analyze the edge states corresponding to this Pontryagin index as well as their dissolution subject to the gap-closing disorder. Finally, we elaborate on the realization of these novel non-Abelian phases, their edge states and linked nodal structures in acoustic metamaterials and trapped-ion experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lindbladian formalism, as tuned to dissipative and open systems, has been all-pervasive to interpret non-equilibrium steady states of quantum many-body systems. We study the fate of free fermionic and superconducting phases in a dissipative one-dimensional Kitaev model - where the bath acts both as a source and a sink of fermionic particles with different coupling rates. As a function of these two couplings, we investigate the steady state, its entanglement content, and its approach from varying initial states. Interestingly, we find that the steady state phase diagram retains decipherable signatures of ground state critical physics. We also show that early-time fidelity is a useful marker to find a subclass of phase transitions in such situations. Moreover, we show that the survival of critical signatures at late-times, strongly depend on the thermal nature of the steady state. This connection hints at a correspondence between quantum observables and classical magnetism in the steady state of such systems. Our work uncovers interesting connections between dissipative quantum many-body systems, thermalization of a classical spin and many-body quantum critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Escaping fronts in local quenches of a confining spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider local quenches from initial states generated by a single spin-flip in either the true or the false vacuum state of the confining quantum Ising spin chain in the ferromagnetic regime. Contrary to global quenches, where the light-cone behaviour is strongly suppressed, we find a significant light-cone signal propagating with a nonzero velocity besides the expected localised oscillating component. Combining an analytic representation of the initial state with a numerical description of the relevant excitations using the two-fermion approximation, we can construct the spectrum of post-quench excitations and their overlaps with the initial state, identifying the underlying mechanism. For confining quenches built upon the true vacuum, the propagating signal consists of superpositions of left and right-moving mesons escaping confinement. In contrast, for anti-confining quenches built upon the false vacuum it is composed of superpositions of left and right-moving bubbles which escape Wannier-Stark localisation.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production of Quantum Reset Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the entropy production of Quantum Reset Models (QRMs) corresponding to quantum dynamical semigroups driven by Lindbladians motivated by a probabilistic description of dissipation in an external environment. We investigate the strict positivity of entropy production for Lindbladians given as sums of QRMs, when the Hamiltonian of the total Lindbladian is split as an affine combination of Hamiltonians of the individual QRMs. In this setup, we derive conditions on the coefficients of the combination and on the reset states ensuring either positive or zero entropy production. Second, we deal with a tri-partite system subject at its ends to two independent QRMs and a weak coupling Hamiltonian. The latter is split as an affine combination of individual Hamiltonians, and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions ensuring strict positivity of the entropy production to leading order, with the possible exception of one affine combination. We apply these results to a physically motivated model and exhibit explicit expressions for the leading orders steady-state solution, entropy production and entropy fluxes. Moreover, these approximations are numerically shown to hold beyond the expected regimes.</description>

      <title>A dark-field setup for the measurement of light-by-light scattering with high-intensity lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We put forward a concrete experimental setup allowing to measure light-by-light scattering in the collision of two optical high-intensity laser beams at state-of-the-art high-field facilities operating petawatt class laser systems. Our setup uses the same focusing optics for both laser beams to be collided and employs a dark-field approach for the detection of the single-photon-level nonlinear quantum vacuum response in the presence of a large background. Based on an advanced modeling of the colliding laser fields, we in particular provide reliable estimates for the prospective numbers of signal photons scattered into the dark-field for various laser polarizations.</description>

      <title>Bloch-Landau-Zener oscillations in a quasi-periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bloch oscillations and Landau-Zener tunneling are ubiquitous phenomena which are sustained by a band-gap spectrum of a periodic Hamiltonian and can be observed in dynamics of a quantum particle or a wavepacket in a periodic potential under action of a linear force. Such physical setting remains meaningful for aperiodic potentials too, although band-gap structure does not exist anymore. Here we consider the dynamics of noninteracting atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates in a quasi-periodic one-dimensional optical lattice subjected to a weak linear force. Excited states with energies below the mobility edge, and thus localized in space, are considered. We show that the observed oscillatory behavior is enabled by tunneling between the initial state and a state (or several states) located nearby in the coordinate-energy space. The states involved in such Bloch-Landau-Zener oscillations are determined by the selection rule consisting of the condition of their spatial proximity and condition of quasi-resonances occurring at avoided crossings of the energy levels. The latter condition is formulated mathematically using the Gershgorin circle theorem. The effect of the inter-atomic interactions on the dynamics can also be predicted on the bases of the developed theory. The reported results can be observed in any physical system allowing for observation of the Bloch oscillations, upon introducing incommensurablity in the governing Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Improved Optimization for the Neural-network Quantum States and Tests on the Chromium Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Neural-network Quantum States (NQS) has significantly advanced wave function ansatz research, sparking a resurgence in orbital space variational Monte Carlo (VMC) exploration. This work introduces three algorithmic enhancements to reduce computational demands of VMC optimization using NQS: an adaptive learning rate algorithm, constrained optimization, and block optimization. We evaluate the refined algorithm on complex multireference bond stretches of $\rm H_2O$ and $\rm N_2$ within the cc-pVDZ basis set and calculate the ground-state energy of the strongly correlated chromium dimer ($\rm Cr_2$) in the Ahlrichs SV basis set. Our results achieve superior accuracy compared to coupled cluster theory at a relatively modest CPU cost. This work demonstrates how to enhance optimization efficiency and robustness using these strategies, opening a new path to optimize large-scale Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)-based NQS more effectively and marking a substantial advancement in NQS's practical quantum chemistry applications.</description>
