      <title>Distributed Articulation Point Identification in Time-Varying Undirected Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying articulation points (APs) is fundamental to assessing the robustness of time-varying networks. In such dynamic environments, topological changes including edge additions and deletions can instantly alter the set of APs, demanding rapid and efficient re-assessment. This paper proposes a fully distributed algorithm for identifying APs and monitoring biconnectivity. Our core contribution is an incremental update protocol. Unlike static methods that require global re-initialization which incurs high communication overhead, our algorithm propagates information from the site of the change, updating only the affected nodes' state values. This approach, which builds upon a maximum consensus protocol, not only ensures convergence to the correct AP set following topological changes but also preserves network privacy by preventing nodes from reconstructing the global topology. We provide rigorous proofs of correctness for this eventual convergence and demonstrate its applicability and efficiency through experiments.</description>

      <title>When GenAI Meets Fake News: Understanding Image Cascade Dynamics on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-generated content and misinformation are increasingly prevalent on social networks. While prior research primarily examined textual misinformation, fewer studies have focused on visual content's role in virality. In this work, we present the first large-scale analysis of how misinformation and AI-generated images propagate through repost cascades across five ideologically diverse Reddit communities. By integrating textual sentiment, visual attributes, and diffusion metrics (e.g., time-to-first repost, community reach), our framework accurately predicts both immediate post-level virality (AUC=0.83) and long-term cascade-level spread (AUC=0.998). These findings offer essential insights for moderating synthetic and misleading visual content online.</description>

      <title>Exploring YouTube's Political Communication Networks during the 2024 French Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2024, France was shaken by the far-right National Rally's victory in the European elections. In response to this unprecedented result, French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly, triggering legislative elections just two weeks later. A whirlwind campaign followed, partly on social media, as is now the norm, and concluded with the victory of a left-wing coalition. This article examines the YouTube activity of two key actors during this period, news media and politicians, and the commenting behavior they generated. We built a dataset of 35 news media channels, 28 politicians and parties channels, 43.5k videos posted from three months before the European elections to one week after the second round of the legislative elections, and 7.4M associated comments. We examined upload activity and engagement across political orientations and used network analysis methods to uncover the structure of their commenting communities. We also identified politicians' appearances on news media channels and assessed their impact on commenting user bases. Our findings show that, among politicians and parties channels, far-right and left-wing ones were significantly more active and received substantially higher engagement (views, likes, and comments) than other groups, with denser and more clustered commenting communities. About 7% of commenters commented across political orientations and were much more active than in-group commenters. News media channels tended to favor politically aligned guests, while centrist politicians were over-represented. Finally, politicians' presence in the videos of a specific news media channel increased the share of commenters who were active on this channel and political channels, regardless of their orientation.</description>

      <title>A 'Turtle Model' of Food System Transformations: Embracing Citizens' Diverse Values and Knowledge in Change Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the challenges and opportunities of transitioning towards sustainable food systems through the lens of democratic food governance fostering inclusive and systemic transformation. Drawing on concepts of wicked problems and systems thinking, we propose a theory of change represented as a 'turtle model' that embraces the diversity of citizens' values and knowledge to highlight multiple avenues of transformation. As quadruple helix innovation and governance hubs, cities can be hotspots for food system transformations. We illustrate this for Dublin, Ireland, where local citizens' value-based food identities were galvanized to activate ecological awareness and promote sustainable seafood consumption. Within this democratic food governance framework, approaches such as open science, transdisciplinarity, and citizen engagement are fit-for-purpose to engage diverse food actors from government, industry, academia, and civil society in shared dialogue and action to transform food systems.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Dynamics Based on Reputation in Networked Populations with Game Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The environment undergoes perpetual changes that are influenced by a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors. Consequently, it exerts a substantial influence on an individual's physical and psychological state, directly or indirectly affecting the evolutionary dynamics of a population described by a network, which in turn can also alter the environment. Furthermore, the evolution of strategies, shaped by reputation, can diverge due to variations in multiple factors. To explore the potential consequences of the mentioned situations, this paper studies how game and reputation dynamics alter the evolution of cooperation. Concretely, game transitions are determined by individuals' behaviors and external uncontrollable factors. The cooperation level of its neighbors reflects individuals' reputation, and further, a general fitness function regarding payoff and reputation is provided. Within the context of the donation game, we investigate the relevant outcomes associated with the aforementioned evolutionary process, considering various topologies for distinct interactions. Additionally, a biased mutation is introduced to gain a deeper insight into the strategy evolution. We detect a substantial increase in the cooperation level through intensive simulations, and some important phenomena are observed, e.g., the unilateral increase of the value of prosocial behavior limits promotion in cooperative behavior in square-lattice networks.</description>

      <title>Human Mobility Datasets Enriched With Contextual and Social Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this resource paper, we present two publicly available datasets of semantically enriched human trajectories, together with the pipeline to build them. The trajectories are publicly available GPS traces retrieved from OpenStreetMap. Each dataset includes contextual layers such as stops, moves, points of interest (POIs), inferred transportation modes, and weather data. A novel semantic feature is the inclusion of synthetic, realistic social media posts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling multimodal and semantic mobility analysis. The datasets are available in both tabular and Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats, supporting semantic reasoning and FAIR data practices. They cover two structurally distinct, large cities: Paris and New York. Our open source reproducible pipeline allows for dataset customization, while the datasets support research tasks such as behavior modeling, mobility prediction, knowledge graph construction, and LLM-based applications. To our knowledge, our resource is the first to combine real-world movement, structured semantic enrichment, LLM-generated text, and semantic web compatibility in a reusable framework.</description>
