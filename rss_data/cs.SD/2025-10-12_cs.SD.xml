      <title>LadderSym: A Multimodal Interleaved Transformer for Music Practice Error Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music learners can greatly benefit from tools that accurately detect errors in their practice. Existing approaches typically compare audio recordings to music scores using heuristics or learnable models. This paper introduces \textit{LadderSym}, a novel Transformer-based method for music error detection. \textit{LadderSym} is guided by two key observations about the state-of-the-art approaches: (1) late fusion limits inter-stream alignment and cross-modality comparison capability; and (2) reliance on score audio introduces ambiguity in the frequency spectrum, degrading performance in music with concurrent notes. To address these limitations, \textit{LadderSym} introduces (1) a two-stream encoder with inter-stream alignment modules to improve audio comparison capabilities and error detection F1 scores, and (2) a multimodal strategy that leverages both audio and symbolic scores by incorporating symbolic representations as decoder prompts, reducing ambiguity and improving F1 scores. We evaluate our method on the \textit{MAESTRO-E} and \textit{CocoChorales-E} datasets by measuring the F1 score for each note category. Compared to the previous state of the art, \textit{LadderSym} more than doubles F1 for missed notes on \textit{MAESTRO-E} (26.8\% $\rightarrow$ 56.3\%) and improves extra note detection by 14.4 points (72.0\% $\rightarrow$ 86.4\%). Similar gains are observed on \textit{CocoChorales-E}. This work introduces general insights about comparison models that could inform sequence evaluation tasks for reinforcement Learning, human skill assessment, and model evaluation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs with Spoken Queries under Diverse Acoustic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations in vision-language models have been extensively studied using benchmarks that probe reliability in image-text settings. In contrast, the effect of spoken queries on multimodal hallucinations remains largely unexplored, despite the growing role of voice-driven interfaces. In this work, we investigate how spoken input influences hallucinations in multimodal large language models. We present RePOPE-Spk, an audio-augmented extension of the RePOPE benchmark, where queries are provided as speech under diverse acoustic conditions. Using RePOPE-Spk, we systematically evaluate both proprietary and open-source models. Experimental results show that hallucinations escalate when queries are spoken rather than written: error rates increase by 3% under clean speech and by up to 20% with environmental noise. Input order and query length further affect robustness, while strategies such as many-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning offer partial but insufficient mitigation. These findings highlight a critical and underexplored challenge, opening new directions for building reliable voice interface systems.</description>

      <title>EGSTalker: Real-Time Audio-Driven Talking Head Generation with Efficient Gaussian Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents EGSTalker, a real-time audio-driven talking head generation framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Designed to enhance both speed and visual fidelity, EGSTalker requires only 3-5 minutes of training video to synthesize high-quality facial animations. The framework comprises two key stages: static Gaussian initialization and audio-driven deformation. In the first stage, a multi-resolution hash triplane and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) are used to extract spatial features and construct a compact 3D Gaussian representation. In the second stage, we propose an Efficient Spatial-Audio Attention (ESAA) module to fuse audio and spatial cues, while KAN predicts the corresponding Gaussian deformations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGSTalker achieves rendering quality and lip-sync accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods, while significantly outperforming them in inference speed. These results highlight EGSTalker's potential for real-time multimedia applications.</description>

      <title>Audible Networks: Deconstructing and Manipulating Sounds with Deep Non-Negative Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the use of Non-Negative Autoencoders (NAEs) for sound deconstruction and user-guided manipulation of sounds for creative purposes. NAEs offer a versatile and scalable extension of traditional Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)-based approaches for interpretable audio decomposition. By enforcing non-negativity constraints through projected gradient descent, we obtain decompositions where internal weights and activations can be directly interpreted as spectral shapes and temporal envelopes, and where components can themselves be listened to as individual sound events. In particular, multi-layer Deep NAE architectures enable hierarchical representations with an adjustable level of granularity, allowing sounds to be deconstructed at multiple levels of abstraction: from high-level note envelopes down to fine-grained spectral details. This framework enables a wide new range of expressive, controllable, and randomized sound transformations. We introduce novel manipulation operations including cross-component and cross-layer synthesis, hierarchical deconstructions, and several randomization strategies that control timbre and event density. Through visualizations and resynthesis of practical examples, we demonstrate how NAEs can serve as flexible and interpretable tools for object-based sound editing.</description>

      <title>ControlAudio: Tackling Text-Guided, Timing-Indicated and Intelligible Audio Generation via Progressive Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) generation with fine-grained control signals, e.g., precise timing control or intelligible speech content, has been explored in recent works. However, constrained by data scarcity, their generation performance at scale is still compromised. In this study, we recast controllable TTA generation as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a progressive diffusion modeling approach, ControlAudio. Our method adeptly fits distributions conditioned on more fine-grained information, including text, timing, and phoneme features, through a step-by-step strategy. First, we propose a data construction method spanning both annotation and simulation, augmenting condition information in the sequence of text, timing, and phoneme. Second, at the model training stage, we pretrain a diffusion transformer (DiT) on large-scale text-audio pairs, achieving scalable TTA generation, and then incrementally integrate the timing and phoneme features with unified semantic representations, expanding controllability. Finally, at the inference stage, we propose progressively guided generation, which sequentially emphasizes more fine-grained information, aligning inherently with the coarse-to-fine sampling nature of DiT. Extensive experiments show that ControlAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of temporal accuracy and speech clarity, significantly outperforming existing methods on both objective and subjective evaluations.

      <title>VM-UNSSOR: Unsupervised Neural Speech Separation Enhanced by Higher-SNR Virtual Microphone Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind speech separation (BSS) aims to recover multiple speech sources from multi-channel, multi-speaker mixtures under unknown array geometry and room impulse responses. In unsupervised setup where clean target speech is not available for model training, UNSSOR proposes a mixture consistency (MC) loss for training deep neural networks (DNN) on over-determined training mixtures to realize unsupervised speech separation. However, when the number of microphones of the training mixtures decreases, the MC constraint weakens and the separation performance falls dramatically. To address this, we propose VM-UNSSOR, augmenting the observed training mixture signals recorded by a limited number of microphones with several higher-SNR virtual-microphone (VM) signals, which are obtained by applying linear spatial demixers (such as IVA and spatial clustering) to the observed training mixtures. As linear projections of the observed mixtures, the virtual-microphone signals can typically increase the SNR of each source and can be leveraged to compute extra MC losses to improve UNSSOR and address the frequency permutation problem in UNSSOR. On the SMS-WSJ dataset, in the over-determined six-microphone, two-speaker separation setup, VM-UNSSOR reaches 17.1 dB SI-SDR, while UNSSOR only obtains 14.7 dB; and in the determined two-microphone, two-speaker case, UNSSOR collapses to -2.7 dB SI-SDR, while VM-UNSSOR achieves 10.7 dB.</description>

      <title>DiTSinger: Scaling Singing Voice Synthesis with Diffusion Transformer and Implicit Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) demonstrates strong expressiveness but remains limited by data scarcity and model scalability. We introduce a two-stage pipeline: a compact seed set of human-sung recordings is constructed by pairing fixed melodies with diverse LLM-generated lyrics, and melody-specific models are trained to synthesize over 500 hours of high-quality Chinese singing data. Building on this corpus, we propose DiTSinger, a Diffusion Transformer with RoPE and qk-norm, systematically scaled in depth, width, and resolution for enhanced fidelity. Furthermore, we design an implicit alignment mechanism that obviates phoneme-level duration labels by constraining phoneme-to-acoustic attention within character-level spans, thereby improving robustness under noisy or uncertain alignments. Extensive experiments validate that our approach enables scalable, alignment-free, and high-fidelity SVS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new training strategy to improve speech dereverberation systems in an unsupervised manner using only reverberant speech. Most existing algorithms rely on paired dry/reverberant data, which is difficult to obtain. Our approach uses limited acoustic information, like the reverberation time (RT60), to train a dereverberation system. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves more consistent performance across various objective metrics than the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>O_O-VC: Synthetic Data-Driven One-to-One Alignment for Any-to-Any Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional voice conversion (VC) methods typically attempt to separate speaker identity and linguistic information into distinct representations, which are then combined to reconstruct the audio. However, effectively disentangling these factors remains challenging, often leading to information loss during training. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages synthetic speech data generated by a high-quality, pretrained multispeaker text-to-speech (TTS) model. Specifically, synthetic data pairs that share the same linguistic content but differ in speaker identity are used as input-output pairs to train the voice conversion model. This enables the model to learn a direct mapping between source and target voices, effectively capturing speaker-specific characteristics while preserving linguistic content. Additionally, we introduce a flexible training strategy for any-to-any voice conversion that generalizes well to unseen speakers and new languages, enhancing adaptability and performance in zero-shot scenarios. Our experiments show that our proposed method achieves a 16.35% relative reduction in word error rate and a 5.91% improvement in speaker cosine similarity, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>MMAudioSep: Taming Video-to-Audio Generative Model Towards Video/Text-Queried Sound Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MMAudioSep, a generative model for video/text-queried sound separation that is founded on a pretrained video-to-audio model. By leveraging knowledge about the relationship between video/text and audio learned through a pretrained audio generative model, we can train the model more efficiently, i.e., the model does not need to be trained from scratch. We evaluate the performance of MMAudioSep by comparing it to existing separation models, including models based on both deterministic and generative approaches, and find it is superior to the baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even after acquiring functionality for sound separation via fine-tuning, the model retains the ability for original video-to-audio generation. This highlights the potential of foundational sound generation models to be adopted for sound-related downstream tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/sony/mmaudiosep.</description>

      <title>Emotion-Disentangled Embedding Alignment for Noise-Robust and Cross-Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectiveness of speech emotion recognition in real-world scenarios is often hindered by noisy environments and variability across datasets. This paper introduces a two-step approach to enhance the robustness and generalization of speech emotion recognition models through improved representation learning. First, our model employs EDRL (Emotion-Disentangled Representation Learning) to extract class-specific discriminative features while preserving shared similarities across emotion categories. Next, MEA (Multiblock Embedding Alignment) refines these representations by projecting them into a joint discriminative latent subspace that maximizes covariance with the original speech input. The learned EDRL-MEA embeddings are subsequently used to train an emotion classifier using clean samples from publicly available datasets, and are evaluated on unseen noisy and cross-corpus speech samples. Improved performance under these challenging conditions demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>SynthVC: Leveraging Synthetic Data for End-to-End Low Latency Streaming Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice Conversion (VC) aims to modify a speaker's timbre while preserving linguistic content. While recent VC models achieve strong performance, most struggle in real-time streaming scenarios due to high latency, dependence on ASR modules, or complex speaker disentanglement, which often results in timbre leakage or degraded naturalness. We present SynthVC, a streaming end-to-end VC framework that directly learns speaker timbre transformation from synthetic parallel data generated by a pre-trained zero-shot VC model. This design eliminates the need for explicit content-speaker separation or recognition modules. Built upon a neural audio codec architecture, SynthVC supports low-latency streaming inference with high output fidelity. Experimental results show that SynthVC outperforms baseline streaming VC systems in both naturalness and speaker similarity, achieving an end-to-end latency of just 77.1 ms.</description>

      <title>WildElder: A Chinese Elderly Speech Dataset from the Wild with Fine-Grained Manual Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elderly speech poses unique challenges for automatic processing due to age-related changes such as slower articulation and vocal tremors. Existing Chinese datasets are mostly recorded in controlled environments, limiting their diversity and real-world applicability. To address this gap, we present WildElder, a Mandarin elderly speech corpus collected from online videos and enriched with fine-grained manual annotations, including transcription, speaker age, gender, and accent strength. Combining the realism of in-the-wild data with expert curation, WildElder enables robust research on automatic speech recognition and speaker profiling. Experimental results reveal both the difficulties of elderly speech recognition and the potential of WildElder as a challenging new benchmark. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/NKU-HLT/WildElder.</description>

      <title>Articulation-Informed ASR: Integrating Articulatory Features into ASR via Auxiliary Speech Inversion and Cross-Attention Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior works have investigated the use of articulatory features as complementary representations for automatic speech recognition (ASR), but their use was largely confined to shallow acoustic models. In this work, we revisit articulatory information in the era of deep learning and propose a framework that leverages articulatory representations both as an auxiliary task and as a pseudo-input to the recognition model. Specifically, we employ speech inversion as an auxiliary prediction task, and the predicted articulatory features are injected into the model as a query stream in a cross-attention module with acoustic embeddings as keys and values. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate that our approach yields consistent improvements over strong transformer-based baselines, particularly under low-resource conditions. These findings suggest that articulatory features, once sidelined in ASR research, can provide meaningful benefits when reintroduced with modern architectures.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Stress Detection: A Study of Temporal Progression Modelling of Stress in Speech</title>

Abstract: Detecting psychological stress from speech is critical in high-pressure settings. While prior work has leveraged acoustic features for stress detection, most treat stress as a static label. In this work, we model stress as a temporally evolving phenomenon influenced by historical emotional state. We propose a dynamic labelling strategy that derives fine-grained stress annotations from emotional labels and introduce cross-attention-based sequential models, a Unidirectional LSTM and a Transformer Encoder, to capture temporal stress progression. Our approach achieves notable accuracy gains on MuSE (+5%) and StressID (+18%) over existing baselines, and generalises well to a custom real-world dataset. These results highlight the value of modelling stress as a dynamic construct in speech.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Depression Detection from Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse, heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning (SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations, yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.</description>

      <title>BaldWhisper: Faster Whisper with Head Shearing and Layer Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pruning large pre-trained transformers for low-resource languages is challenging, as it often requires massive retraining data to recover performance. For instance, Distill-Whisper prunes Whisper by 40% and retrains on 21,000 hours of speech, far beyond what is available for most languages. Can Whisper be made lighter and faster for edge devices in data-scarce settings? Focusing on Bambara with only 32h of speech-to-text data, we propose a new pruning recipe. Instead of vocabulary pruning, which is unsuitable due to frequent code-switching by Bambara speakers, we compress the embeddings with low-rank decomposition and feature distillation. Rather than removing layers, we merge them to limit performance loss. The final model preserves 90% of the original performance while being 48% smaller and 2.15x faster on a MacBook Air M1.</description>

      <title>Look before Transcription: End-to-End SlideASR with Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often struggle with domain-specific terminology, especially in specialized settings such as academic lectures. To address this, we define the SlideASR task, which leverages the rich visual information from presentation slides to improve transcription accuracy. Existing pipeline methods for this task tend to be complex and underperform. Although omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) provide a promising end-to-end framework, they frequently fail in practice by degenerating into simple optical character recognition (OCR) systems. To overcome this, we propose Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a novel post-training method designed to control the model's reasoning process. Drawing on the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, VAPO enforces a structured "Look before Transcription" procedure using a &lt;think&gt;&lt;answer&gt; format. Specifically, the model first performs OCR on the slide content within the think step, then generates the transcription by referencing this recognized visual information in the answer step. This reasoning process is optimized via reinforcement learning with four distinct rewards targeting format compliance, OCR accuracy, ASR quality, and visual anchoring consistency. To support further research, we construct SlideASR-Bench, a new entity-rich benchmark consisting of a synthetic dataset for training and testing, and a challenging real-world set for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VAPO significantly improves recognition of domain-specific terms, establishing an effective end-to-end paradigm for SlideASR.</description>

      <title>FLToP CTC: Frame-Level Token Pruning via Relative Threshold for Efficient and Memory-Saving Decoding on Diverse Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a 10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders. Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms (CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech recognition accessibility and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised lexicon learning from speech is limited by representations rather than clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-resource word segmentation and clustering systems aim to tokenise speech into word-like units without access to text labels. Despite progress, the induced lexicons are still far from perfect. In an idealised setting with gold word boundaries, we ask whether performance is limited by the representation of word segments, or by the clustering methods that group them into word-like types. We combine a range of self-supervised speech features (continuous/discrete, frame/word-level) with different clustering methods (K-means, hierarchical, graph-based) on English and Mandarin data. The best system uses graph clustering with dynamic time warping on continuous features. Faster alternatives use graph clustering with cosine distance on averaged continuous features or edit distance on discrete unit sequences. Through controlled experiments that isolate either the representations or the clustering method, we demonstrate that representation variability across segments of the same word type -- rather than clustering -- is the primary factor limiting performance.</description>

      <title>Effects of automotive microphone frequency response characteristics and noise conditions on speech and ASR quality -- an experimental evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upon choosing microphones for automotive hands-free communication or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) applications, OEMs typically specify wideband, super wideband or even fullband requirements following established standard recommendations (e.g., ITU-P.1110, ITU-P.1120). In practice, it is often challenging to achieve the preferred bandwidth for an automotive microphone when considering limitations and constraints on microphone placement inside the cabin, and the automotive grade environmental robustness requirements. On the other hand, there seems to be no consensus or sufficient data on the effect of each microphone characteristic on the actual performance. As an attempt to answer this question, we used noise signals recorded in real vehicles and under various driving conditions to experimentally study the relationship between the microphones' characteristics and the final audio quality of speech communication and performance of ASR engines. We focus on how variations in microphone bandwidth and amplitude frequency response shapes affect the perceptual speech quality. The speech quality results are compared by using ETSI TS 103 281 metrics (S-MOS, N-MOS, G-MOS) and ancillary metrics such as SNR. The ASR results are evaluated with standard metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER). Findings from this study provide knowledge in the understanding of what microphone frequency response characteristics are more relevant for audio quality and choice of proper microphone specifications, particularly for automotive applications.</description>

      <title>Accent-Invariant Automatic Speech Recognition via Saliency-Driven Spectrogram Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource, linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity.

      <title>TARO: Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment with Onset-Aware Conditioning for Synchronized Video-to-Audio Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment with Onset-Aware Conditioning (TARO), a novel framework for high-fidelity and temporally coherent video-to-audio synthesis. Built upon flow-based transformers, which offer stable training and continuous transformations for enhanced synchronization and audio quality, TARO introduces two key innovations: (1) Timestep-Adaptive Representation Alignment (TRA), which dynamically aligns latent representations by adjusting alignment strength based on the noise schedule, ensuring smooth evolution and improved fidelity, and (2) Onset-Aware Conditioning (OAC), which integrates onset cues that serve as sharp event-driven markers of audio-relevant visual moments to enhance synchronization with dynamic visual events. Extensive experiments on the VGGSound and Landscape datasets demonstrate that TARO outperforms prior methods, achieving relatively 53% lower Frechet Distance (FD), 29% lower Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), and a 97.19% Alignment Accuracy, highlighting its superior audio quality and synchronization precision.</description>

      <title>Direction Estimation of Sound Sources Using Microphone Arrays and Signal Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sound-tracking refers to the process of determining the direction from which a sound originates, making it a fundamental component of sound source localization. This capability is essential in a variety of applications, including security systems, acoustic monitoring, and speaker tracking, where accurately identifying the direction of a sound source enables real-time responses, efficient resource allocation, and improved situational awareness. While sound-tracking is closely related to localization, it specifically focuses on identifying the direction of the sound source rather than estimating its exact position in space. Despite its utility, sound-tracking systems face several challenges, such as maintaining directional accuracy and precision, along with the need for sophisticated hardware configurations and complex signal processing algorithms. This paper presents a sound-tracking method using three electret microphones. We estimate the direction of a sound source using a lightweight method that analyzes signals from three strategically placed microphones. By comparing the average power of the received signals, the system infers the most probable direction of the sound. The results indicate that the power level from each microphone effectively determines the sound source direction. Our system employs a straightforward and cost-effective hardware design, ensuring simplicity and affordability in implementation. It achieves a localization error of less than 6 degrees and a precision of 98%. Additionally, its effortless integration with various systems makes it versatile and adaptable. Consequently, this technique presents a robust and reliable solution for sound-tracking and localization, with potential applications spanning diverse domains such as security systems, smart homes, and acoustic monitoring.</description>

      <title>From Coarse to Fine: Recursive Audio-Visual Semantic Enhancement for Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-visual speech separation aims to isolate each speaker's clean voice from mixtures by leveraging visual cues such as lip movements and facial features. While visual information provides complementary semantic guidance, existing methods often underexploit its potential by relying on static visual representations. In this paper, we propose CSFNet, a Coarse-to-Separate-Fine Network that introduces a recursive semantic enhancement paradigm for more effective separation. CSFNet operates in two stages: (1) Coarse Separation, where a first-pass estimation reconstructs a coarse audio waveform from the mixture and visual input; and (2) Fine Separation, where the coarse audio is fed back into an audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) model together with the visual stream. This recursive process produces more discriminative semantic representations, which are then used to extract refined audio. To further exploit these semantics, we design a speaker-aware perceptual fusion block to encode speaker identity across modalities, and a multi-range spectro-temporal separation network to capture both local and global time-frequency patterns. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two noisy datasets show that CSFNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with substantial coarse-to-fine improvements, validating the necessity and effectiveness of our recursive semantic enhancement framework.</description>

      <title>Phonikud: Hebrew Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion for Real-Time Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time text-to-speech (TTS) for Modern Hebrew is challenging due to the language's orthographic complexity. Existing solutions ignore crucial phonetic features such as stress that remain underspecified even when vowel marks are added. To address these limitations, we introduce Phonikud, a lightweight, open-source Hebrew grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) system that outputs fully-specified IPA transcriptions. Our approach adapts an existing diacritization model with lightweight adaptors, incurring negligible additional latency. We also contribute the ILSpeech dataset of transcribed Hebrew speech with IPA annotations, serving as a benchmark for Hebrew G2P, as training data for TTS systems, and enabling audio-to-IPA for evaluating TTS performance while capturing important phonetic details. Our results demonstrate that Phonikud G2P conversion more accurately predicts phonemes from Hebrew text compared to prior methods, and that this enables training of effective real-time Hebrew TTS models with superior speed-accuracy trade-offs. We release our code, data, and models at https: //phonikud.github.io.</description>
