      <title>Plasmon-enhanced Brillouin Light Scattering spectroscopy for magnetic systems. I. Theoretical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brillouin light scattering (BLS) spectroscopy is an effective method for detecting spin waves in magnetic thin films and nanostructures. While it provides extensive insight into the properties of spin waves, BLS spectroscopy is impeded in many practical cases by the limited range of detectable spin wave wavenumbers and its low sensitivity. Here, we present a generalized theoretical model describing plasmon-enhanced BLS spectroscopy. Three types of plasmonic nanoparticles in the shape of an ellipsoid of rotation are considered: a single plasmon resonator, a sandwiched plasmonic structure in which two nanoparticles are separated by a dielectric spacer, and an ensemble of metallic nanoparticles on the surface of a magnetic film. The effective susceptibilities for the plasmonic systems at the surface of the magnetic film are calculated using the electrodynamic Green functions method, and the enhancement coefficient is defined. It is analytically shown that the ratio of the plasmon resonator height to its radius plays the key role in the development of plasmon-enhanced BLS spectroscopy. The developed model serves as a basis for numerical engineering of the optimized plasmon nanoparticle morphology for BLS enhancement.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-enhanced Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) spectroscopy for magnetic systems. II. Numerical simulations</title>

Abstract: Brillouin light scattering (BLS) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for detecting spin waves in magnetic thin films and nanostructures. Despite comprehensive access to spin-wave properties, BLS spectroscopy suffers from the limited wavenumber of detectable spin waves and the typically relatively low sensitivity. In this work, we present the results of numerical simulations based on the recently developed analytical model describing plasmon-enhanced BLS. The effective susceptibility is defined for a single plasmonic nanoparticle in the shape of an ellipsoid of rotation, for the sandwiched plasmonic nanoparticles separated by a dielectric spacer, as well as for the array of plasmonic resonators on the surface of a magnetic film. It is shown that the eccentricity of the metal nanoparticles, which describes their shape, plays a key role in the enhancement of the BLS signal. The optimal conditions for BLS enhancement are numerically defined for gold and silver plasmon systems for photons of different energies. The presented results define the roadmap for the experimental realization of plasmon-enhanced BLS spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Eigenmodes of the Laplacian on Hyperbolic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a specific category of eigenfunctions of the lattice Laplacian on $\{p,q\}$-tessellations of the Poincar\'e disk that bear resemblance to plane waves in the continuum case. Our investigation reveals that the lattice eigenmodes deviate from the continuum solutions by a factor that depends solely on the local inclination of the vertex in relation to the wave's propagation direction. This allows us to compute certain eigenfunctions by numerical and analytical methods. For various special cases we find explicit exact eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues on the infinite lattice.</description>

      <title>Critical assessment of $G_0W_0$ calculations for 2D materials: the example of monolayer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials combine many fascinating properties that make them more interesting than their three-dimensional counterparts for a variety of applications. For example, 2D materials exhibit stronger electron-phonon and electron-hole interactions, and their energy gaps and effective carrier masses can be easily tuned. Surprisingly, published band gaps of several 2D materials obtained with the $GW$ approach, the state-of-the-art in electronic-structure calculations, are quite scattered. The details of these calculations, such as the underlying geometry, the starting point, the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling, and the treatment of the Coulomb potential can critically determine how accurate the results are. Taking monolayer MoS$_2$ as a representative material, we employ the linearized augmented planewave + local orbital method to systematically investigate how all these aspects affect the quality of $G_0W_0$ calculations, and also provide a summary of literature data. We conclude that the best overall agreement with experiments and coupled-cluster calculations is found for $G_0W_0$ results with HSE06 as a starting point including spin-orbit coupling, a truncated Coulomb potential, and an analytical treatment of the singularity at $q=0$.</description>

      <title>A Non-Abelian Gauge Theory for Surface Excitations of $~^3$He-B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $~^3$He-B, two atoms pair in an orbital angular momentum $1$ spin triplet state above the phase transition temperature with $SO(3) \times SO(3)$ symmetry. Below the transition temperature, this symmetry is spontaneously broken to the diagonal $SO(3)$ due to spin-orbit coupling. Considerations based on effective potentials and solitons show that $SO(3)$'s gets enhanced to $SU(3)$'s and the symmetry breaking is that of $G= SU(3) \times SU(3)\times U(1)$ to $H= SU(3)$. The theory of the resultant Goldtsone modes can be naturally formulated as a gauge theory of $H$. Its Gauss law is treated here and shown to lead to surface states in a container with a dynamics governed by large gauge transformations.
  Observable consequences are pointed. The transference of the analysis to the chiral model of QCD is pointed out where $SU(3)$ are the left and right chiral groups, $U(1)$ is the axial $U(1)$ , the surviving symmetry is flavour $SU(3)$ and the Goldstone modes are the pions.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Approximation and Aharonov-Casher Bands in Twisted Homobilayer TMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological flat moir\'e bands with nearly ideal quantum geometry have been identified in AA homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e superlattices, and are thought to be crucial for understanding the fractional Chern insulating states recently observed therein. Previous work proposed viewing the system using an adiabatic approximation that replaces the position-dependence of the layer spinor by a nonuniform periodic effective magnetic field. When the local zero-point kinetic energy of this magnetic field cancels identically against that of an effective Zeeman energy, a Bloch-band version of Aharonov-Casher zero-energy modes, which we refer to as Aharonov-Casher band, emerges leading to ideal quantum geometry. Here, we critically examine the validity of the adiabatic approximation and identify the parameter regimes under which Aharonov-Casher bands emerge. We show that the adiabatic approximation is accurate for a wide range of parameters including those realized in experiments. Furthermore, we show that while the cancellation leading to the emergence of Aharonov-Casher bands is generally not possible beyond the leading Fourier harmonic, the leading harmonic is the dominant term in the Fourier expansions of the zero-point kinetic energy and Zeeman energy. As a result, the leading harmonic expansion accurately captures the trend of the bandwidth and quantum geometry, though it may fail to quantitatively reproduce more detailed information about the bands such as the Berry curvature distribution.</description>
