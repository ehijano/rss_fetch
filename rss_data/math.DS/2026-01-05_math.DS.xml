      <title>Reduced-Order Inference with Structure-Preserving Parametrization for Bending and Rotating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical systems are often characterized only by their response to certain loads known from experiments or simulations. The obtained data can be used for various purposes: system analysis, design of mathematical models, or construction of reduced-order models for further simulations under different loading conditions. The use of data for reduced-order modeling is an important developing research direction, especially when the high-dimensional system operators are unknown and their low-dimensional approximation is required for accurate but fast simulations. Our goal is to obtain the low-dimensional surrogate model from the available input signal and deformation trajectory data, capturing the correct system behavior for the basic deformation cases, namely bending and rotation, which are present in almost every complex mechanical system.
  In this work, we propose a methodology to infer the system operators by solving a nonlinear unconstrained optimization problem. The methodology is based on the operator inference approach for second-order systems and includes a parametrization of the unknown operators that preserves their symmetric positive definite or skew-symmetric structure. We demonstrate the performance of the novel approach for three numerical examples that are used to simulate basic bending and rotating.</description>

      <title>Group Cross-Correlations with Faintly Constrained Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a notion of group cross-correlations, where the associated filter is not as tightly constrained as in the previous literature. This resolves an incompatibility previous constraints have for group actions with non-compact stabilizers. Moreover, we generalize previous results to group actions that are not necessarily transitive, and we weaken the common assumption of unimodularity.</description>

      <title>A new fast multiple-shooting method for computing periodic orbits in symplectic maps leveraging simultaneous Floquet vector computation to avoid large linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a 4D symplectic map $F_0$ that has a normally hyperbolic invariant cylinder foliated by invariant tori, those with rational rotation numbers are themselves foliated by subharmonic periodic orbits (SPOs). If $F_0$ is part of a perturbative family $F_\varepsilon$, one is often interested in computing those SPOs which persist for $\varepsilon &gt;0$. Assuming that a persisting SPO of $F_0$ has been identified, in this paper, we develop a quasi-Newton method which solves for the SPO simultaneously with its Floquet vectors and multipliers. This in turn enables continuation by the perturbation parameter $\varepsilon$. The resulting SPO and Floquet vectors are then used to compute Taylor parameterizations of the SPO's weak stable and unstable manifolds, if they exist. Our quasi-Newton method is based on an adaptation of the parameterization method for invariant tori, with this paper being the first-ever to apply such a framework to directly compute periodic orbit points themselves. The new algorithm improves on efficiency compared to prior multi-shooting methods for SPOs, and notably applies to the case of stroboscopic maps of 2.5 DOF Hamiltonian flows resulting from periodic perturbations of 2 DOF systems. The tools have been successfully used for studies of resonant orbits in perturbed real-life celestial systems, the results of which are summarized as a demonstration of the methods' utility.</description>

      <title>Orbit equivalence of Cantor minimal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the descriptive complexity of the topological orbit equvalence relation for some Borel classes of Cantor minimal systems. Specifically, we study the Borel class of all Cantor minimal systems with only finitely many ergodic measures, and show that the orbit equivalence for this class is Borel bireducible with the equivalence relation $=^+$. We prove the same for the subclass of regular $\{0, 1\}$-Toeplitz subshifts or that of the uniquely ergodic minimal subshifts. We also study the orbit equivalence for the Borel class of minimal subshifts of finite topological rank. Denote by $R_n$ the orbit equivalence for minimal subshifts of topological rank $n\geq 2$. We prove that for any $n\geq 2$, $R_n$ is virtually countable, i.e., Borel reducible to a countable Borel equivalence relation. Moreover, $R_2$ is virtually amenable. On the other hand, $R_n$ is not smooth when $n\geq 2$, is not virtually hyperfinite when $n\geq 4$, and is not virtually treeable when $n\geq 5$. For any $n\geq 2$, our contructions yield uniquely ergodic minimal subshifts of topological rank exactly $n$.</description>

      <title>Intermediate topological presssures and variational principles for nonautonomous dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a one-parameter family of intermediate topological pressures for nonautonomous dynamical systems which interpolate between the Pesin-Pitskel topological pressure and the lower and upper capacity pressures. The construction is based on the Carath\'eodory-Pesin structure in which all admissible strings in a covering satisfy $ N \le n &lt; N/\theta + 1 $, where $ \theta \in [0,1] $ is a parameter. The extremal cases $\theta=0$ and $\theta=1$ recover the Pesin-Pitskel pressure and the two capacity pressures, respectively. We first investigate several properties of the intermediate pressure, including proving that it is continuous on $(0, 1]$ but may fail to be continuous at $0$, as well as establishing the power rule and monotonicity. We then derive inequalities for intermediate pressures with respect to the factor map. Finally, we introduce intermediate measure-theoretic pressures and prove variational principles relating them to the corresponding topological pressures.</description>

      <title>Mean Assouad dimension and spectrum, with applications to infinite dimensional fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the mean Assouad dimension of a dynamical system, motivated by the Assouad dimension in fractal geometry. Using dimension interpolation, we further define the mean Assouad spectrum. This provides a new family of bi-Lipschitz invariants of dynamical systems. We study its basic properties and calculate it for several classes of dynamical systems. As an application, we determine explicit formulae for the mean Assouad dimension and spectrum of infinite-dimensional Bedford--McMullen carpet systems, contributing to the program of studying infinite dimensional fractals, initiated recently by Tsukamoto.</description>

      <title>A direct approach to simplicity of solution manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential equations with state-dependent delays define a semiflow of continuously differentiable solution operators in general only on the associated {\it solution manifold} $X\subset C^1([-h,0],\mathbb{R}^n)$. For systems with discrete state-dependent delays we construct a diffeomorphism on a neighbourhood of $X$ which takes $X$ to an open subset of the subspace given by $\phi'(0)=0$. This is in line with earlier work on the nature of solution manifolds. The present approach, however, is new and dismisses all hypotheses beyond smoothness which have been instrumental so far. Compared to a recent case study it is more direct in the sense that theory of {\it algebraic delay systems} is avoided.</description>

      <title>Exponential stability of second order delay differential equations through Floquet theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain results on exponential stability of second order delay differential equations, which are based on a version of the Floquet theory for delay differential equations of the second order we proposed. Our version allows researchers to preserve the order of equation and to obtain analogues of the classical results of the Floquet theory known for ordinary differential equations. On the basis of our version of the Floquet theory, new original unexpected results on the exponential stability are proposed. We demonstrate that choosing period of coefficients and delays of the gain in corresponding intervals allows to achieve the exponential stabilization in the cases considered as impossible when the standard technique was applied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general regularization procedure for piecewise smooth vector fields whose discontinuity locus is a variety of normal crossings type. We show that such regularization can be smoothed through a finite sequence of blowings-up, thereby reducing the problem to study of the dynamics of a smooth vector field in a manifold with corners. The procedure will be illustrated in the cases of piecewise smooth vector fields on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with discontinuity locus $x=0$ or $xy=0$, and on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with discontinuity locus $xyz=0$. We will see that some unexpected dynamical phenomena may arise even in the case of piecewise constant vector fields.</description>

      <title>The Lagrangian and symplectic structures of the Kuramoto oscillator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being under intense scrutiny for 50 years, the Kuramoto oscillator model has remained a quintessential representative of non-equilibrium phase transitions. One of the reasons for its enduring relevance is the apparent lack of an optimization formulation, due to the fact that (superficially), the equations of motion seem to not be compatible with a Lagrangian structure. We show that, as a mean-field classical (twisted) spin model on $S^2$, the Kuramoto model can be described variationaly. Based on this result perturbation analysis around (unstable) Kuramoto equilibria are shown to be equivalent to low-energy fluctuations of mean-field Heisenberg spin models.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of cultural systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Culture is not just traits but a dynamic system of interdependent beliefs, practices and artefacts embedded in cognitive, social and material structures. Culture evolves as these entities interact, generating path dependence, attractor states and tension, with long-term stability punctuated by rapid systemic transformations. Cultural learning and creativity is modelled as coherence-seeking information processing: individuals filter, transform and recombine input in light of prior acquisitions and dissonance reduction, thereby creating increasingly structured worldviews. Higher-order traits such as goals, skills, norms and cognitive gadgets act as emergent metafilters that regulate subsequent selection by defining what counts as coherent. Together, these filtering processes self-organise into epistemic niches, echo chambers, polarised groups and institutions that channel information flows and constrain future evolution. In this view, LLMs and recommender algorithms are products of cultural embeddings that now act back on cultural systems by automated filtering and recombination of information, reshaping future dynamics of cultural systems.</description>

      <title>Effective geometric ergodicty for Markov chains in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note we prove ``effective" geometric ergodicity (i.e a Perron-Frobenius theorem) for Markov chains in random mixing dynamical environment satisfying a random non-uniform version of the Doeblin condition. Effectivity here means that all the random variables involved in the random exponential rates are integrable with arbitrarily large order. This compliments \cite[Theorem 2.1]{Kifer 1996}, where ``non-effective" geometric ergodicity was obtained. From a different perspective, our result is also motivated by egrodic theory, as it can be seen as an effective version of the ``spectral" gap in the top Oseledets space in the Oseledets multiplicative ergodic theorem for the random Markov operator cocycle (when it applies). We also present applications of the effective ergodicity to rates in the (quenched) almost sure invariance principle (ASIP), exponential decay of correlations for Markovian skew products and for exponential tails for random mixing times. As a byproduct of the proof of the ASIP rates we also provide easy to verify sufficient conditions for the verification of the assumptions of \cite[Theorem 2.4]{Kifer 1998}.</description>

      <title>Global Dynamics and Stabilization of Zero-Mode Singularities in Multi-Scale Reaction-Diffusion Systems via Negative Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a rigorous mathematical framework for the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled System (MNCS), a dynamical model describing hierarchical state spaces with directed, sign-structured interactions. We address the stabilization of reaction-diffusion systems on bounded domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ ($d \le 3$) subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. A critical feature of this setting is the "zero-mode singularity," where the Laplacian operator possesses a trivial zero eigenvalue ($\lambda_0=0$), providing no linear dissipation for the spatial mean. We rigorously prove the global well-posedness of the system and the existence of a compact global attractor $\mathcal{A}$ in the phase space $\mathbb{H}=(L^2(\Omega))^N$. Utilizing the Moser-Alikakos iteration technique, we establish uniform $L^\infty(\Omega)$ bounds, overcoming the lack of Sobolev embedding from $H^1$ into $L^\infty$ in three dimensions. These bounds enable the derivation of explicit upper estimates for the fractal dimension of the attractor via the Kaplan-Yorke trace formula. We show that the dimension scales as $d_F(\mathcal{A}) \sim \max\{0, \mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{A}}-\gamma\}^{d/2}$, confirming that the negative coupling strength $\gamma$ acts as a global regularizer that compresses the phase space. The theoretical results are validated using a stiff-stable Second-Order Exponential Time Differencing (ETD2) scheme with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to strictly enforce no-flux boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Gardner volumes and self-organization in a minimal model of complex ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study self-organization in a minimally nonlinear model of large random ecosystems. Populations evolve over time according to a piecewise linear system of ordinary differential equations subject to a non-negativity constraint resulting in discrete time extinction and revival events. The dynamics are generated by a random elliptic community matrix with tunable correlation strength. We show that, independent of the correlation strength, solutions of the system are confined to subsets of the phase space that can be cast as time-varying Gardner volumes from the theory of learning in neural networks. These volumes decrease with the diversity (i.e. the fraction of extant species) and become exponentially small in the long-time limit. Using standard results from random matrix theory, the changing diversity is then linked to a sequence of contractions and expansions in the spectrum of the community matrix over time, resulting in a sequence of May-type stability problems determining whether the total population evolves toward complete extinction or unbounded growth. In the case of unbounded growth, we show the model allows for a particularly simple nonlinear extension in which the solutions instead evolve towards a new attractor.</description>

      <title>On resonant energy sets for Hamiltonian systems with reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two uncoupled oscillators, horizontal and vertical, residing in rectilinear polygons (with only vertical and horizontal sides) and impacting elastically from their boundary. The main purpose of the article is to analyze the occurrence of resonance in such systems, depending on the shape of the analytical potentials that determine the oscillators. We define resonant energy levels; roughly speaking, these are levels for which the resonance phenomenon occurs more often than rarely. We focus on unimodal analytic potentials with the minimum at zero. The most important result of the work describes the size of the set of resonance levels in the form of the following trichotomy: it is mostly empty or is one-element or is large, i.e. non-empty and open. In this latter case, we show that an abundance of resonant orbits occurs only when the potentials are of a special type; we denote this family by $\mathcal{SP}$. This result can be regarded as a distant analogue of the classical Bertrand's theorem (1873), which characterizes centrally symmetric potentials in the presence of an abundance of periodic orbits.</description>

Abstract: We consider a finite number of orientation preserving $C^2$ interval diffeomorphisms and apply them randomly in such a way that the expected Lyapunov exponents at the boundary points are positive. We prove the exponential decay of correlations for Lipschitz observables with respect to the unique stationary measure supported on the interior of the interval. The key step is to show the exponential synchronization in average.</description>

      <title>On the future cover of a sofic shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper contains a new proof of the theorem by Krieger which establishes the canonicity of the future cover of a sofic shift. In addition the paper describes a method to produce new canonical covers from a given one, resulting in canonical covers related to, but generally different from the future cover.</description>

      <title>On subsets of integers having dense orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A\subset \mathbb{N}$. We say $A$ is an $R$-sequence for a given minimal system $(Y,S)$ if there is $y\in Y$ such that $\{S^ny:n\in A\}$ is dense in $Y$. Richter asked if $A$ is an $R$-sequence for all minimal equicontinuous systems implies that $A$ is an $R$-sequence for all minimal systems. In this paper, we investigate this question and related issues within the framework of totally minimal systems, including a characterization of transitive systems that are disjoint from all totally minimal systems.
  A dynamical system is scattering (resp. weakly scattering) if its product with any minimal (resp. minimal and equicontinuous) system is transitive. It turns out that $(X,T)$ is scattering if and only if for any transitive point $x\in X$ and any minimal system $(Y,S)$ there is $y\in Y$ such that the orbit of $(x,y)$ is dense in $X\times Y$ if and only if for each transitive point $x\in X$ and any non-empty open subset $U$ of $X$, $\{n\in \mathbb{N}:T^nx\in U\}$ is an $R$-sequence. By combining this result with earlier work of Huang and Ye, we deduce that if scattering and weak scattering are distinct properties, then both Richter's question and Katznelson's question admit negative answers.</description>

      <title>Eigenfunctionals for positive operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an eigenfunctional theorem for positive operators, evocative of the Krein--Rutman theorem. A more general version gives a joint eigenfunctional for commuting operators.</description>
