      <title>Upper bounds in non-autonomous quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove upper bounds on outside probabilities for generic non-autonomous Schr\"odinger operators on lattices of arbitrary dimension. Our approach is based on a combination of commutator method originated in scattering theory and novel monotonicity estimate for certain mollified asymptotic observables that track the spacetime localization of evolving states. Sub-ballistic upper bounds are obtained, assuming that momentum vanishes sufficiently fast in the front of the wavepackets. A special case gives a refinement of the general ballistic upper bound of Radin-Simon's, showing that the evolution of wavepackets are effectively confined to a strictly linear light cone with explicitly bounded slope. All results apply to long-range Hamiltonian with polynomial decaying off-diagonal terms and can be extended, via a frozen-coefficient argument, to generic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory for the Dicke Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed analysis of density-functional theory for quantum-electrodynamical model systems is provided. In particular, the quantum Rabi model, the Dicke model, and a generalization of the latter to multiple modes are considered. We prove a Hohenberg-Kohn theorem that manifests the magnetization and displacement as internal variables, along with several representability results. The constrained-search functionals for pure states and ensembles are introduced and analyzed. We find the optimizers for the pure-state constrained-search functional to be low-lying eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and, based on the properties of the optimizers, we formulate an adiabatic-connection formula. In the reduced case of the Rabi model we can even show differentiability of the universal density functional, which amounts to unique pure-state v-representability.</description>

      <title>Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchies with non-formal pseudo-differential operators, non-formal solutions, and a Yang-Mills--like formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We start from the classical Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy posed on formal pseudo-differential operators, and we produce two hierarchies of non-linear equations posed on non-formal pseudo-differential operators lying in the Kontsevich and Vishik's odd class, one of them with values in formal pseudo-differential operators. We prove that the corresponding Zakharov-Shabat equations hold in this context, and we express one of our hierarchies as the minimization of a class of Yang-Mills action functionals on a space of pseudo-differential connections whose curvature takes values in the Dixmier ideal. We finish by comparing our Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchies in terms of the solutions that they produce to the KP-II equation: existence, uniqueness and formality.</description>

      <title>Correlation Function of Self-Conjugate Partitions: $q$-Difference Equation and Quasimodularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the uniform measure for the self-conjugate partitions. We derive the $q$-difference equation which is satisfied by the $n$-point correlation function related to the uniform measure. As applications, we give explicit formulas for the one-point and two-point functions, and study their quasimodularity. Motivated by this, we also prove the quasimodularity of the general $n$-point function using a combinatorial method. Finally, we derive the limit shape of self-conjugate partitions under the Gibbs uniform measure and compare it to the leading asymptotics of the one-point function.</description>

      <title>The discrete analogue of the Gaussian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper illustrates the utility of the heat kernel on $\mathbb{Z}$ as the discrete analogue of the Gaussian density function. It is the two-variable function $K_{\mathbb{Z}}(t,x)=e^{-2t}I_{x}(2t)$ involving a Bessel function and variables $x\in\mathbb{Z}$ and real $t\geq 0$. Like its classic counterpart it appears in many mathematical and physical contexts and has a wealth of applications. Some of these will be reviewed here, concerning Bessel integrals, trigonometric sums, hypergeometric functions and asymptotics of discrete models appearing in statistical and quantum physics. Moreover, we prove a new local limit theorem for sums of integer-valued random variables, obtain novel special values of the spectral zeta function of Bethe lattices, and provide a discussion on how $e^{-2t}I_{x}(2t)$ could be useful in differential privacy.</description>

      <title>A Bekenstein-type bound in QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let B be a spacetime region of width 2R &gt; 0, and \phi a vector state localized in B. We show that the vacuum relative entropy of \phi, on the local von Neumann algebra of B, is bounded by 2\pi R-times the energy of the state \phi in B. This bound is model-independent and rigorous; it follows solely from first principles in the framework of translation covariant, local Quantum Field Theory on the Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Jacobi algebroids and Jacobi sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The definition of an action functional for the Jacobi sigma models, known for Jacobi brackets of functions, is generalized to \emph{Jacobi bundles}, i.e., Lie brackets on sections of (possibly nontrivial) line bundles, with the particular case of contact manifolds. Different approaches are proposed, but all of them share a common feature: the presence of a \emph{homogeneity structure} appearing as a principal action of the Lie group $\mathbb{R}^{\times}=\mathrm{GL}(1;\mathbb{R})$. Consequently, solutions of the equations of motions are morphisms of certain \emph{Jacobi algebroids}, i.e., principal $\mathbb{R}^{\times}$-bundles equipped additionally with a compatible Lie algebroid structure. Despite the different approaches we propose, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the space of solutions of the different models. The definition can be immediately extended to \emph{almost Poisson} and \emph{almost Jacobi brackets}, i.e., to brackets that do not satisfy the Jacobi identity. Our sigma models are geometric and fully covariant.</description>

      <title>Constructing Nearby Commuting Matrices for Ogata's Theorem on Macroscopic Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolving a conjecture of von Neumann, Ogata's theorem in arXiv:1111.5933 showed the highly nontrivial result that arbitrarily many matrices corresponding to macroscopic observables with $N$ sites and a fixed site dimension $d$ are asymptotically nearby commuting observables as $N \to \infty$. We develop a method to construct nearby commuting matrices for normalized highly reducible representations of $su(2)$ whose multiplicities of irreducible subrepresentations exhibit a certain monotonically decreasing behavior. We then provide a constructive proof of Ogata's theorem for site dimension $d=2$ with explicit estimates for how close the nearby observables are. Moreover, motivated by the application to time-reversal symmetry explored in arXiv:1012.3494, our construction has the property that real macroscopic observables are asymptotically nearby real commuting observables.
  This thesis also contains an introduction to the prerequisite matrix analysis for understanding the proof of the results gotten, a primer on the functional analysis of $C^\ast$-algebras frequently used in the literature of almost commuting operators, a detailed discussion of the history and main results in the problem of almost commuting matrices, a review of the basics of measurement of observables in finite dimensional quantum mechanical systems, and a discussion of the uncertainty principle for non-commuting bounded operators with some results obtained for observables with nearby commuting approximants.</description>

      <title>Generalized boson and fermion operators with a maximal total occupation property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new generalization of the standard (anti-)commutation relations for creation and annihilation operators of bosons and fermions. These relations preserve the usual symmetry properties of bosons and fermions. Only the standard (anti-)commutator relation involving one creation and one annihilation operator is deformed by introducing fractional coefficients, containing a positive integer parameter $p$. The Fock space is determined by the classical definition. The new relations are chosen in such a way that the total occupation number in the system has the maximum value $p$. From the actions of creation and annihilation operators in the Fock space, a group theoretical framework is determined, and from here the correspondence with known particle statistics is established.</description>

      <title>$\bar{\partial}$-problem for focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and soliton shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider soliton gas solutions of the Focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, where the point spectrum of the Zakharov-Shabat linear operator condensate in a bounded domain $\mathcal{D}$ in the upper half-plane. We show that the corresponding inverse scattering problem can be formulated as a $\overline{\partial}$-problem on the domain. We prove the existence of the solution of this $\overline{\partial}$-problem by showing that the $\tau$-function of the problem (a Fredholm determinant) does not vanish. We then represent the solution of the NLS equation via the $\tau$ of the $\overline{\partial}$- problem. Finally we show that, when the domain $\mathcal{D}$ is an ellipse and the density of solitons is analytic, the initial datum of the Cauchy problem is asymptotically step-like oscillatory, and it is described by a periodic elliptic function as $x \to - \infty$ while it vanishes exponentially fast as $x \to +\infty$.</description>

      <title>Effective Dynamics of Local Observables for Extended Fermi Gases in the High-Density Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a rigorous derivation of the Hartree equation for the many-body dynamics of pseudo-relativistic Fermi systems at high density $\varrho \gg 1$, on arbitrarily large domains, at zero temperature. With respect to previous works, we show that the many-body evolution can be approximated by the Hartree dynamics locally, proving convergence of the expectation of observables that are supported in regions with fixed volume, independent of $\varrho$. The result applies to initial data describing fermionic systems at equilibrium confined in arbitrarily large domains, under the assumption that a suitable local Weyl-type estimate holds true. The proof relies on the approximation of the initial data through positive temperature quasi-free states, that satisfy strong local semiclassical bounds, which play a key role in controlling the growth of the local excitations of the quasi-free state along the many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>A categorical view of Bell's inequalities in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the description of Bell's inequalities in algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) to the context of locally covariant quantum field theory (LCQFT). We use the functorial formulation of the state space as proposed in the seminal work of Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch to show that for the suitable category Bell, which consists of all possible admissible quadruples, yields a category of states over such observables which satisfy the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Such inequality is trivially preserved under algebraic morphisms and functoriality of the state space asserts us that it is preserved under isometric embeddings between the globally hyperbolic spacetimes where the algebras are defined and which constitute the locally covariant QFT functor.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable Schr\"odinger operators related to the confluent equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our paper investigates one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators defined as closed operators on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ or $L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)$ that are exactly solvable in terms of confluent functions (or, equivalently, Whittaker functions). We allow the potentials to be complex. They fall into three families: Whittaker operators (or radial Coulomb Hamiltonians), Schr\"odinger operators with Morse potentials, and isotonic oscillators. For each of them, we discuss the corresponding basic holomorphic family of closed operators and the integral kernel of their resolvents. We also describe transmutation identities that relate these resolvents. These identities interchange spectral parameters with coupling constants across different operator families.
  A similar analysis is performed for one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators solvable in terms of Bessel functions (which are reducible to special cases of Whittaker functions). They fall into two families: Bessel operators and Schr\"odinger operators with exponential potentials.
  To make our presentation self-contained, we include a short summary of the theory of closed one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with singular boundary conditions. We also provide a concise review of special functions that we use.</description>

      <title>New slow-roll approximations for inflation in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06147v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new slow-roll approximations for inflationary models with the Gauss-Bonnet term. We find more accurate expressions of the standard slow-roll parameters as functions of the scalar field. To check the accuracy of approximations considered we construct inflationary models with quadratic and quartic monomial potentials and the Gauss-Bonnet term. Numerical analysis of these models indicates that the proposed inflationary scenarios do not contradict to the observation data. New slow-roll approximations show that the constructed inflationary models are in agreement with the observation data, whereas one does not get allowed observational parameters at the same values of parameters of the constructed models in the standard slow-roll approximation.</description>

      <title>$C^{0}$-inextendibility of FLRW spacetimes within a subclass of axisymmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the proof of the $C^0$-inextendibility of Schwarzschild by Sbierski, the past decade has seen renewed interest in showing low-regularity inextendibility for known spacetime models. Specifically, a lot of attention has been paid to FLRW spacetimes and there is an ever growing array of results in the literature. Apart from hoping to provide a concise summary of the state of the art we present an extension of work by Galloway and Ling on $C^0$-inextendibility of certain FLRW spacetimes within a subclass of spherically symmetric spacetimes, to $C^0$-inextendibility within a subclass of axisymmetric spacetimes. Notably our result works in the case of flat FLRW spacetimes with $a(t)\to 0$ for $t\to 0^+$, a setting where other known $C^0$-inextendibility results for FLRW spacetimes due to Sbierski do not apply.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of BPS Vacuum and Multi-vortices in Inhomogeneous Abelian Higgs Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BPS limit of the inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model is considered in $(1+2)$-dimensions. The second order Bogomolny equation is examined in the presence of an inhomogeneity expressed as a function of spatial coordinates. Assuming a physically reasonable upper bound on the $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ norm of the inhomogeneity function, we prove the existence and the uniqueness of nontrivial BPS vacuum solution of zero energy and topological BPS multi-vortex solutions of quantized positive energies.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of X-point collapse in an extended magnetohydrodynamics framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of X-point collapse in magnetic reconnection has witnessed extensive study in the context of space and laboratory plasmas. In this paper, a recently derived mathematical formulation of X-point collapse applicable in the regime of extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) is shown to possess a noncanonical Hamiltonian structure composed of five dynamical variables inherited from its parent model. The Hamiltonian and the noncanonical Poisson bracket are both derived, and the latter is shown to obey the requisite properties of antisymmetry and the Jacobi identity (an explicit proof of the latter is provided). In addition, the governing equations for the Casimir invariants are presented, and one such solution is furnished. The above features can be harnessed and expanded in future work, such as developing symplectic integrators for this dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Buoyancy-Driven Flows With Navier-Slip Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14230v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this dissertation two-dimensional buoyancy-driven flows are investigated. While usually the Navier-Stokes equations are equipped with no-slip boundary conditions here we focus on the Navier-slip conditions that, depending on the system at hand, better reflect the physical behavior. In particular, we study two systems, Rayleigh-B\'enard convection and a closely related problem without thermal diffusion. In the former, bounds on the vertical heat transfer, given by the Nusselt number, with respect to the strength of the buoyancy force, characterized by the Rayleigh number, are derived. These bounds hold for a broad range of applications, allowing for non-flat boundaries, any sufficiently smooth positive slip coefficient, and are valid over all ranges of the Prandtl number, a system parameter determined by the fluid. For the thermally non-diffusive system, regularity estimates are proven. Up to a certain order, these bounds hold uniformly in time, which, combined with estimates for their growth, provide insight into the long-time behavior. In particular, solutions converge to the hydrostatic equilibrium, where the fluid's velocity vanishes and the buoyancy force is balanced by the pressure gradient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Kundt solutions to vacuum Conformal Killing Gravity (CKG) proposed by Harada and find numerous solutions in four dimensions and in higher dimensions. In CKG theory the cosmological constant appears as an integration constant, and hence, is naturally embedded in the theory. However, by considering Kundt solutions to CKG we seemingly open Pandora's box: We find so many solutions so a selection criterium is needed in CKG to explain the current accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

Abstract: An integrable polygon is one whose interior angles are fractions of $\pi$; that is to say of the form $\frac \pi n$ for positive integers $n$. We consider the Laplace spectrum on these polygons with the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, and we obtain new spectral invariants for these polygons. This includes new expressions for the spectral zeta function and zeta-regularized determinant as well as a new spectral invariant contained in the short-time asymptotic expansion of the heat trace. Moreover, we demonstrate relationships between the short-time heat trace invariants of general polygonal domains (not necessarily integrable) and smoothly bounded domains and pose conjectures and further related directions of investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a singular Liouville equation, it is plausible that a non-simple blowup phenomenon occurs around a quantized singular pole. The presence of complex blowup profiles of bubbling solutions presents substantial challenges in applications. In this article, we demonstrate that under natural assumptions, non-simple blowup takes place only when the derivatives of certain coefficient functions approach zero. Our main result encompasses all previous findings and determines the vanishing order for any specific quantized singular source. Our theorems can be utilized not only to eliminate multiple non-simple blowup scenarios in applications but also to investigate blowup solutions with moving poles.</description>

      <title>Exact mean and variance of the squared Hellinger distance for random density matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hellinger distance between quantum states is a significant measure in quantum information theory, known for its Riemannian and monotonic properties. It is also easier to compute than the Bures distance, another measure that shares these properties. In this work, we derive the mean and variance of the Hellinger distance between pairs of density matrices, where one or both matrices are random. Along the way, we also obtain exact results for the mean affinity and mean square affinity. The first two cumulants of the Hellinger distance allow us to propose an approximation for the corresponding probability density function based on the gamma distribution. Our analytical results are corroborated through Monte Carlo simulations, showing excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Commutative algebras in Grothendieck-Verdier categories, rigidity, and vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a commutative algebra in a braided monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$; e.g., $A$ could be an extension of a vertex operator algebra (VOA) $V$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ of $V$-modules. We study when the category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ and its subcategory $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ of local modules inherit rigidity from $\mathcal{C}$, and then we find conditions for $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{C}_A$ to inherit rigidity from $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$. First, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ is a braided finite tensor category and prove rigidity of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ under conditions based on criteria of Etingof-Ostrik for $A$ to be an exact algebra in $\mathcal{C}$. As a corollary, we show that if $A$ is a simple $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$-graded VOA with a strongly rational vertex operator subalgebra $V$, then $A$ is strongly rational, without requiring the categorical dimension of $A$ as a $V$-module to be non-zero. Next, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ is a Grothendieck-Verdier category, i.e., $\mathcal{C}$ admits a weaker duality structure than rigidity. We first prove $\mathcal{C}_A$ is also a Grothendieck-Verdier category. Using this, we prove that if $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ is rigid, then so is $\mathcal{C}$ under conditions such as a mild non-degeneracy assumption on $\mathcal{C}$, an assumption that every simple object of $\mathcal{C}_A$ is local, and that induction from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{C}_A$ commutes with duality. These conditions are motivated by free field-like VOA extensions $V\subseteq A$ where $A$ is often an indecomposable $V$-module, so our result will make it more feasible to prove rigidity for many vertex algebraic monoidal categories. In a follow-up work, our result will be used to prove rigidity of the category of weight modules for the simple affine VOA of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear phase mixing for the gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system under an external Kepler potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Newtonian gravity, a self-gravitating collisionless gas around a massive object such as a star or a planet is modeled via the Vlasov--Poisson system with an external Kepler potential. The presence of this attractive potential allows for bounded trajectories along which the gas neither falls in towards the object nor escape to infinity.
  We study this system focusing on the regime with bounded trajectories. First, we prove quantitative linear phase mixing estimates in three dimensions outside symmetry. Second, our main result is a long-time nonlinear phase mixing theorem for spherically symmetric data with finite regularity. The mechanism is phenomenologically similar to Landau damping on a torus and our result applies to the same time scale (modulo logarithms) as the known results on Landau damping with finite regularity. However, in contrast with Landau damping, we need to contend with weaker linear estimates as well as use a system of dynamically defined action angle variables.</description>

Abstract: We consider corotational wave maps from Minkowski spacetime into the sphere and the equivariant Yang-Mills equation for all energy-supercritical dimensions. Both models have explicit self-similar finite time blowup solutions, which continue to exist even past the singularity. We prove the nonlinear asymptotic stability of these solutions in spacetime regions that approach the future light cone of the singularity. For this, we develop a general functional analytic framework in adapted similarity coordinates that allows to evolve the stable wave flow near a self-similar blowup solution in such spacetime regions.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the compressible Euler equations from the dynamics of interacting Bose gas in the hard-core limit regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of short-range interacting Bose gases with varying degrees of diluteness and interaction strength. By applying a combined mean-field and semiclassical space-time rescaling to the dynamics in both the Gross--Pitaevskii and hard-core limit regimes, we prove that the local one-particle mass, momentum, and energy densities of the many-body system can be quantitatively approximated by solutions to the compressible Euler system in the strong sense, up to the first blow-up time of the fluid description, as the number of particles tends to infinity. In the hard-core limit regime, two novel results are presented. First, we rigorously prove, for the first time, that the internal energy of the fluid takes the form $4\pi \mathfrak{c}_{0}\rho^{2}$ (equivalently, pressure $P=2\pi \mathfrak{c}_{0}\rho^{2}$), arising solely from the kinetic energy density of the many-body system, rather than the interaction energy density, marking a fundamental difference from the Gross--Pitaevskii and other mean-field regimes. Second, the newly discovered coupling constant $\mathfrak{c}_{0}$ is the electrostatic capacity of the interaction potential, corresponding to the scattering length of the hard-core potential. Furthermore, in other limiting regimes, including those beyond the Gross--Pitaevskii regime, we find that the limiting equation is described by an eikonal system, offering a rigorous first-principle justification for using the ``geometric optics approximation'' to describe the dynamics of ultracold Bose gases.</description>

      <title>On string functions of the generalized parafermionic theories, mock theta functions, and false theta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kac and Wakimoto introduced the admissible highest weight representations in order to classify all modular invariant representations of the Kac--Moody algebras. Ahn, Chung, and Tye studied the string functions of the admissible highest weight representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ and realized them as the characters of the generalized parafermionic theories. These string functions are allowed to have certain positive and negative rational levels, for integer levels they reduce to the well-studied string functions of the integrable highest weight representations of Kac and Peterson. In this paper we demonstrate that the mock modular part of $1/2$-level string functions can be evaluated in terms of Ramanujan's mock theta functions by using recent Hecke-type double-sum formulas of positive discriminant (Mortenson and Zwegers, 2023). We also present elegant mock theta conjecture-like identities and mixed mock modular properties for certain examples of $1/2$-level string functions. In addition, we show that the negative level string functions can be evaluated in terms of false theta functions by using recent Hecke-type double-sum formulas of negative discriminant (Mortenson, 2024).</description>

Abstract: We prove existence and multiplicity of Cantor families of small amplitude analytic in time periodic solutions of the completely resonant cubic nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation on $\mathbb{S}^3$ for an asymptotically full measure set of frequencies close to 1. The solutions are constructed by a Lyapunov-Schmidt decomposition and a Nash-Moser iterative scheme. We first find non-degenerate solutions of the Kernel equation. Then we solve the Range equation with a Nash-Moser iterative scheme to overcome small divisors problems.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Casimir Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the one-dimensional `classical' vacuum by a system of annihilating Brownian motions on $\mathbb{R}$ with pairwise immigration. A pair of reflecting or absorbing walls placed in such a vacuum at separation $L$ experiences an attractive force which decays exponentially with $L$. This phenomenon can be regarded as a purely classical Casimir effect for a system of interacting Brownian motions.</description>

      <title>Notes on invariant measures for loop groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09913v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let K denote a simply connected compact Lie group and let G denote its complexification. It is known that there exists an LK-biinvariant probability measure on a natural completion of the complex loop group LG. It is believed that there exist deformations which are positive line bundle valued and reproduce the unitary structure for (projective) positive energy representations of LK. These are notes which supplement lectures I have given on these measures, explaining a number of conjectures concerning how these measures are characterized, how they are computed, and how they are potentially useful for formulating quantum sigma models.</description>

Abstract: We study the fluctuations in equilibrium for a dynamics of rods with random length. This includes the classical hard rod elastic collisions, when rod lengths are constant and equal to a positive value. We prove that in the diffusive space-time scaling, an initial fluctuation of density of particles of velocity $v$, after recentering on its Euler evolution, evolve randomly shifted by a Brownian motion of variance $\mathcal D(v)$.</description>

      <title>What is the Magnus Expansion?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Magnus expansion, introduced by Wilhelm Magnus in 1954, is an infinite Lie series employed to express solutions for first-order homogeneous linear differential equations involving a linear operator. Since its discovery it has evolved into a pivotal tool used across diverse disciplines, including physics, chemistry, and engineering. Over the past 25 years, the Magnus expansion has undergone significant mathematical developments which revealed an intricate interplay between algebra, combinatorics, and geometry. By emphasizing a modern perspectives based on the use of pre- and post-Lie algebras, we discuss the Magnus expansion from the viewpoint of the notion of crossed morphism.</description>

      <title>The Racah Algebra of Rank 2: Properties, Symmetries and Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goals of this paper are threefold. First, we provide a new ''universal'' definition for the Racah algebra of rank 2 as an extension of the rank-1 Racah algebra where the generators are indexed by subsets and any three disjoint indexing sets define a subalgebra isomorphic to the rank-1 case. With this definition, we explore some of the properties of the algebra including verifying that these natural assumptions are equivalent to other defining relations in the literature. Second, we look at the symmetries of the generators of the rank-2 Racah algebra. Those symmetries allows us to partially make abstraction of the choice of the generators and write relations and properties in a different format. Last, we provide a novel representation of the Racah algebra. This new representation requires only one generator to be diagonal and is based on an expansion of the split basis representation from the rank-1 Racah algebra.</description>

      <title>Tube Formulae for Generalized von Koch Fractals through Scaling Functional Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a treatment of scaling functional equations in a general setting involving fractals arising from sufficiently nice self-similar systems in order to analyze the tube functions, tube zeta functions, and complex dimensions of relative fractal drums. Namely, we express the volume of a tubular neighborhood in terms of scaled copies of itself and a remainder term and then solve this expression by means of the tube zeta functions.
  We then apply our methods to analyze these generalized von Koch fractals, which are a class of fractals that allow for different regular polygons and scaling ratios to be used in the construction of the standard von Koch curve and snowflake. In particular, we describe the volume of an inner tubular neighborhoods and the possible complex dimensions of such fractal snowflakes.</description>

      <title>Learning the local density of states of a bilayer moir\'e material in one dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work of three of the authors showed that the operator which maps the local density of states of a one-dimensional untwisted bilayer material to the local density of states of the same bilayer material at non-zero twist, known as the twist operator, can be learned by a neural network. In this work, we first provide a mathematical formulation of that work, making the relevant models and operator learning problem precise. We then prove that the operator learning problem is well-posed for a family of one-dimensional models. To do this, we first prove existence and regularity of the twist operator by solving an inverse problem. We then invoke the universal approximation theorem for operators to prove existence of a neural network capable of approximating the twist operator.</description>

Abstract: We consider the discrete Schr\"odinger operators with potentials whose values are read along the orbits of a shift of finite type. We study a certain subset of the collection of energies at which the Lyapunov exponent is zero and prove monotonicity of this set with respect to the shift embeddings. Then we introduce a certain function ${\mathcal J}(A,\mu)$ determined by the position of these zeros and prove monotonicity of ${\mathcal J}(A,\mu)$ with respect to embeddings.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle solutions for the nonlocal NLSE with an anti-Hermitian term in semiclassical approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with the $n$-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE) with a cubic nonlocal nonlinearity and an anti-Hermitian term, which is widely used model for the study of open quantum system. We construct asymptotic solutions to the Cauchy problem for such equation within the formalism of semiclassical approximation based on the Maslov complex germ method. Our solutions are localized in a neighbourhood of few points for every given time, i.e. form some spatial pattern. The localization points move over trajectories that are associated with the dynamics of semiclassical quasiparticles. The Cauchy problem for the original NLSE is reduced to the system of ODEs and auxiliary linear equations. The semiclassical nonlinear evolution operator is derived for the NLSE. The general formalism is applied to the specific one-dimensional NLSE with a periodic trap potential, dipole-dipole interaction, and phenomenological damping. It is shown that the long-range interactions in such model, which are considered through the interaction of quasiparticles in our approach, can lead to drastic changes in the behaviour of our asymptotic solutions.</description>

Abstract: In a recent manuscript~[J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 235204 (2024)], a candidate Hamiltonian for the Hilbert-P\'olya Conjecture was introduced. Here, we elegantly demonstrate the existence of a well-defined similarity transformation of the candidate Hamiltonian, whose eigenfunctions are square-integrable and, crucially, whose eigenvalues are real. This represents a significant step toward proving the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>A highly accurate procedure for computing globally optimal Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A standard task in solid state physics and quantum chemistry is the computation of localized molecular orbitals known as Wannier functions. In this manuscript, we propose a new procedure for computing Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline materials. Our approach proceeds by first performing parallel transport of the Bloch functions using numerical integration. Then a simple analytically computable correction is introduced to yield the optimally localized Wannier function. The resulting scheme is rapidly convergent and proven to produce globally optimal Wannier functions. The analysis in this manuscript can also be viewed as a proof of the existence of exponentially localized Wannier functions in one dimension. We illustrate the performance of the scheme by a number of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Geometric Formula for 2d Ising Zeros: Examples &amp; Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A geometric formula for the zeros of the partition function of the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model was recently proposed in terms of the angles of 2d triangulations embedded in the flat 3d space. Here we proceed to an analytical check of this formula on the cubic graph, dual to a double pyramid, and provide a thorough numerical check by generating random 2d planar triangulations. Our method is to generate Delaunay triangulations of the 2-sphere then performing random local rescalings. For every 2d triangulations, we compute the corresponding Ising couplings from the triangle angles and the dihedral angles, and check directly that the Ising partition function vanishes for these couplings (and grows in modulus in their neighborhood). In particular, we lift an ambiguity of the original formula on the sign of the dihedral angles and establish a convention in terms of convexity/concavity. Finally, we extend our numerical analysis to 2d toroidal triangulations and show that the geometric formula does not work and will need to be generalized, as originally expected, in order to accommodate for non-trivial topologies.</description>

      <title>Gray categories with duals and their diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:1211.0529v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric and algebraic properties of Gray categories with duals are investigated by means of a diagrammatic calculus. The diagrams are three-dimensional stratifications of a cube, with regions, surfaces, lines and vertices labelled by Gray category data. These can be viewed as a generalisation of ribbon diagrams. The Gray categories present two types of duals, which are extended to functors of strict tricategories with natural isomorphisms, and correspond directly to symmetries of the diagrams. It is shown that these functors can be strictified so that the symmetries of a cube are realised exactly. A new condition on Gray categories with duals called the spatial condition is defined. A class of diagrams for which the evaluation for spatial Gray categories is invariant under homeomorphisms is exhibited. This relation between the geometry of the diagrams and structures in the Gray categories proves useful in computations and has potential applications in topological quantum field theory.</description>

Our techniques involve a twisted graph space, which we expect to generalize to yield wall-crossing formulas for general gauged linear sigma models.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Arnold's $J^+$-invariant for pairs of immersions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.04349v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the $J^{2+}$-invariant for oriented pairs of generic immersions. This invariant behaves like Arnold's $J^+$-invariant for generic immersions as it is invariant when going through inverse tangencies and triple points, but changes when traversing direct tangencies. It has several useful properties, for example its independence of the $J^{2+}$-invariants of the single immersions forming the pair. Also it is invariant under simultaneous orientation change. Therefore, one can define two $J^{2+}$-invariants for each pair depending on its orientation, those two invariants are not independent from each other. Furthermore, the invariant is extended to $J^{n+}$ for links of $n$ oriented immersions.</description>

      <title>Hyper-Dilaton Weyl Multiplet of 4D, ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ Conformal Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a new dilaton Weyl multiplet of ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ conformal supergravity in four dimensions. This is constructed by reinterpreting the equations of motion of an on-shell hypermultiplet as constraints that render some of the fields of the standard Weyl multiplet composite. The independent bosonic components include four scalar fields and a triplet of gauge two-forms. The resulting, so-called, hyper-dilaton Weyl multiplet defines a $24+24$ off-shell representation of the local ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ superconformal algebra. By coupling the hyper-dilaton Weyl multiplet to an off-shell vector multiplet compensator, we obtain one of the two minimal $32+32$ off-shell multiplets of ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ Poincar\'e supergravity constructed by M\"uller in 1986. On-shell, this contains the minimal ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ Poincar\'e supergravity multiplet together with a hypermultiplet where one of its physical scalars plays the role of a dilaton, while its three other scalars are dualised to a triplet of real gauge two-forms. Interestingly, a $BF$-coupling induces a scalar potential for the dilaton without a standard gauging.</description>

Abstract: 1) In 1976, looking at simple finite-dimensional complex Lie superalgebras, J.~Bernstein and I, and independently M.~Duflo, observed that certain divergence-free vectorial Lie superalgebras have deformations with odd parameters and conjectured that other simple Lie superalgebras have no such deformations (unpublished). Here, I prove this conjecture and overview the known classification of simple finite-dimensional complex Lie superalgebras, their presentations, realizations, and (very sketchily) relations with simple Lie (super)algebras over fields of positive characteristic.
  2) Any supermanifold which is a ringed space of the form (a manifold $M$, the sheaf of sections of the exterior algebra of a vector bundle over $M$) is called split. Gaw\c{e}dzki (1977) and Batchelor (1979) proved that every smooth supermanifolds is split. In 1982, P. Green and Palamodov showed that a~complex-analytic supermanifold can be non-split, i.e., not diffeomorphic to a split supermanifold. So far, researchers considered, mostly, even obstructions to splitness. This lead them to the conclusion that any supermanifolds of superdimension $m|1$ is split. I'll show that there are non-split supermanifolds of superdimension $m|1$; for example, certain $1|1$-dimensional superstrings, the obstructions to their splitness correspond to odd parameters.</description>

      <title>Edge universality of sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04723v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal A$ be the adjacency matrix of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi directed graph $\mathscr G(N,p)$. We denote the eigenvalues of $\mathcal A$ by $\lambda_1^{\cal A},...,\lambda^{\cal A}_N$, and $|\lambda_1^{\cal A}|=\max_i|\lambda_i^{\cal A}|$. For $N^{-1+o(1)}\leq p\leq 1/2$, we show that \[ \max_{i=2,3,...,N} \bigg|\frac{\lambda_i^{\mathcal A}}{\sqrt{Np(1-p)}}\bigg| =1+O(N^{-1/2+o(1)}) \] with very high probability. In addition, we prove that near the unit circle, the local eigenvalue statistics of ${\mathcal A}/\sqrt{Np(1-p)}$ coincide with those of the real Ginibre ensemble. As a by-product, we also show that all non-trivial eigenvectors of $\mathcal A$ are completely delocalized.
  For Hermitian random matrices, it is known that the edge statistics are sensitive to the sparsity: in the very sparse regime, one needs to remove many noise random variables (which affect both the mean and the fluctuation) to recover the Tracy-Widom distribution. Our results imply that, compared to their analogues in the Hermitian case, the edge statistics of non-Hermitian sparse random matrices are more robust.
  The edge of non-Hermitian matrices possesses the cusp singularity, which was believed to be a technical difficulty of the model. Our first novelty is the observation that the cusp singularity is in fact an advantage instead of an obstacle, and when used properly, it can make the computation easier for non-Hermitian matrices. The second novelty is an use of integration by parts formula inside the Girko's Hermitization, which completely avoids the study of the Green function at larger spectral scales. The third novelty is the self-similarity of the self-consistent equations of certain Green functions, which eliminates the effect of large expectations of the matrix entries.</description>

      <title>Fixed-magnetization Ising model with a slowly varying magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motivation for this paper is the analysis of the fixed-density Ising lattice gas in the presence of a gravitational field. This is a seen as a particular instance of an Ising model with a slowly varying magnetic field in the fixed magnetization ensemble. We first characterize the typical magnetization profiles in the regime in which the contribution of the magnetic field competes with the bulk energy term. We then discuss in more detail the particular case of a gravitational field and the arising interfacial phenomena. In particular, we identify the macroscopic profile and propose several conjectures concerning the interface appearing in the phase coexistence regime. The latter are supported by explicit computations in an effective model. Finally, we state some conjectures concerning equilibrium crystal shapes in the presence of a gravitational field, when the latter contributes to the energy only to surface order.</description>

      <title>On the kinetic description of the objective molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a multiscale hierarchy framework for objective molecular dynamics (OMD), a reduced order molecular dynamics with a certain symmetry, that connects it to the statistical kinetic equation, and the macroscopic hydrodynamic model. In the mesoscopic regime, we exploit two interaction scalings that lead, respectively, to either a mean-field type or to a Boltzmann type equation. It turns out that, under the special symmetry of OMD, the mean-field scaling results in vastly simplified dynamics that extinguishes the underlying molecular interaction rule, whereas the Boltzmann scaling yields a meaningful reduced model called the homo-energetic Boltzmann equation. At the macroscopic level, we derive the corresponding Euler and Navier-Stokes systems by conducting a detailed asymptotic analysis. The symmetry again significantly reduces the complexity of the resulting hydrodynamic systems.</description>

      <title>Metastability cascades and prewetting in the SOS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Glauber dynamics for the low temperature $(2+1)$D Solid-On-Solid model on a box of side-length $n$ with a floor at height $0$ (inducing entropic repulsion) and a competing bulk external field $\lambda$ pointing down (the prewetting problem). In 1996, Cesi and Martinelli showed that if the inverse-temperature $\beta$ is large enough, then along a decreasing sequence of critical points $(\lambda_c^{(k)})_{k=0}^{K_\beta}$ the dynamics is torpid: its inverse spectral gap is $O(1)$ when $\lambda \in (\lambda_c^{(k+1)},\lambda_c^{(k)})$ whereas it is $\exp[\Theta(n)]$ at each $\lambda_c^{(k)}$ for each $k\leq K_\beta$, due to a coexistence of rigid phases at heights $k+1$ and $k$. Our focus is understanding (a) the onset of metastability as $\lambda_n\uparrow\lambda_c^{(k)}$; and (b) the effect of an unbounded number of layers, as we remove the restriction $k\le K_\beta$, and even allow for $\lambda_n\to 0$ towards the $\lambda = 0$ case which has $O(\log n)$ layers and was studied by Caputo et al. (2014). We show that for any $k$, possibly growing with $n$, the inverse gap is $\exp[\tilde\Theta(1/|\lambda_n-\lambda_c^{(k)}|)]$ as $\lambda\uparrow \lambda_c^{(k)}$ up to distance $n^{-1+o(1)}$ from this critical point, due to a metastable layer at height $k$ on the way to forming the desired layer at height $k+1$. By taking $\lambda_n = n^{-\alpha}$ (corresponding to $k_n\asymp \log n$), this also interpolates down to the behavior of the dynamics when $\lambda =0$. We complement this by extending the fast mixing to all $\lambda$ uniformly bounded away from $(\lambda_c^{(k)})_{k=0}^\infty$. Together, these results provide a sharp understanding of the predicted infinite sequence of dynamical phase transitions governed by the layering phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Energy-Conserving Quantum Circuits with XY interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum circuits constructed from $\sqrt{iSWAP}$ gates and, more generally, from the entangling gates that can be realized with the XX+YY interaction alone. Such gates preserve the Hamming weight of states in the computational basis, which means they respect the global U(1) symmetry corresponding to rotations around the z axis. Equivalently, assuming that the intrinsic Hamiltonian of each qubit in the system is the Pauli Z operator, they conserve the total energy of the system. We develop efficient methods for synthesizing circuits realizing any desired energy-conserving unitary using XX+YY interaction with or without single-qubit rotations around the z-axis. Interestingly, implementing generic energy-conserving unitaries, such as CCZ and Fredkin gates, with 2-local energy-conserving gates requires the use of ancilla qubits. When single-qubit rotations around the z-axis are permitted, our scheme requires only a single ancilla qubit, whereas with the XX+YY interaction alone, it requires 2 ancilla qubits. In addition to exact realizations, we also consider approximate realizations and show how a general energy-conserving unitary can be synthesized using only a sequence of $\sqrt{iSWAP}$ gates and 2 ancillary qubits, with arbitrarily small error, which can be bounded via the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Our methods are also applicable for synthesizing energy-conserving unitaries when, rather than the XX+YY interaction, one has access to any other energy-conserving 2-body interaction that is not diagonal in the computational basis, such as the Heisenberg exchange interaction. We briefly discuss the applications of these circuits in the context of quantum computing, quantum thermodynamics, and quantum clocks.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of the elliptic relative equilibria for the restricted N-body problem: two special cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the elliptic relative equilibria of the restricted $N$-body problems, where the $N-1$ primaries form an Euler-Moulton collinear central configuration or a $(1+n)$-gon central configuration. We obtain the symplectic reduction to the general restricted $N$-body problem. For the first case, by analyzing the relationship between this restricted $N$-body problems and the elliptic Lagrangian solutions, we obtain the linear stability of the restricted $N$-body problem by the $\omega$-Maslov index. Via numerical computations, we also obtain conditions of the stability on the mass parameters under $N=4$ and the symmetry of the central configuration. For the second case, there exist three positions $S_1,S_2$ and $S_3$ of the massless body (up to rotations of angle $\frac{2\pi}{n}$). For ${m_0\over m}$ sufficiently large, we show that the elliptic relative equilibria is linearly unstable if the eccentricity $0\le e&lt;e_0$ and the massless body lies at $S_1$ or $S_2$; while the elliptic relative equilibria is linear stability if the massless body lies at $S_3$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement cost of realizing quantum processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, a peculiar connection between particles, underpins powerful technologies such as quantum computing and secure communication. However, quantifying the minimum entanglement required to prepare quantum states and implement quantum processes remains a significant challenge. We develop an efficiently computable tool that reliably estimates the amount of entanglement needed for realizing arbitrary quantum processes respecting certain physical principles. Our tool applies to the entanglement required to prepare a broad range of quantum states in the asymptotic regime, surpassing previous methods' limitations. We also confirm that entanglement, once consumed to realize the considered class of quantum operations, cannot be fully recovered, even asymptotically. This irreversible behavior is evident for full-rank entangled states and practically relevant amplitude damping channels, even under quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose. We showcase our approach's power through examples such as estimating entanglement requirements for realizing bipartite dephasing SWAP channels and solving Hamiltonian simulations under thermal interaction, highlighting its advantages over existing techniques. Our work provides a practical toolkit for benchmarking entanglement requirements for generic states and quantum dynamics, paving the way for assessing and optimizing the performances of quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: We study the super analogue of the Molev-Ragoucy reflection algebras, which we call twisted super Yangians of type AIII, and classify their finite-dimensional irreducible representations under certain conditions. These superalgebras are coideal subalgebras of the super Yangian $\mathscr{Y}(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$ and are associated with symmetric pairs of type AIII in Cartan's classification. We establish the Schur-Weyl type duality between degenerate affine Hecke algebras of type BC and twisted super Yangians.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Floer theory I: exponential integrals in finite and infinite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first of the series of papers devoted to our project ``Holomorphic Floer Theory" we discuss exponential integrals and related wall-crossing structures. We emphasize two points of view on the subject: the one based on the ideas of deformation quantization and the one based on the ideas of Floer theory. Their equivalence is a corollary of our generalized Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. In the case of exponential integrals this amounts to several comparison isomorphisms between local and global versions of de Rham and Betti cohomology. We develop the corresponding theories in particular generalizing Morse-Novikov theory to the holomorphic case. We prove that arising wall-crossing structures are analytic. As a corollary, perturbative expansions of exponential integrals are resurgent. Based on a careful study of finite-dimensional exponential integrals we propose a conjectural approach to infinite-dimensional exponential integrals. We illustrate this approach in the case of Feynman path integral with holomorphic Lagrangian boundary conditions as well as in the case of the complexified Chern-Simons theory. We discuss the arising perverse sheaf of infinite rank as well as analyticity of the corresponding ``Chern-Simons wall-crossing structure". We develop a general theory of quantum wave functions and show that in the case of Chern-Simons theory it gives an alternative description of the Chern-Simons wall-crossing structure based on the notion of generalized Nahm sum. We propose several conjectures about analyticity and resurgence of the corresponding perturbative series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We bound the time necessary to implement the shift unitary on a one-dimensional ring, both using local Hamiltonians and those with power-law interactions. This time is constrained by the Frobenius light cone; hence we prove that (for certain power law exponents) shift unitaries cannot be implemented in the same amount of time needed to prepare long-range Bell pairs. We note an intriguing similarity between the proof of our results, and the hardness of preparing symmetry-protected topological states with symmetry-preserving Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted classical capacities of some channels acting as radial multipliers on fermion algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15440v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a new class of unital quantum channels on $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$, acting as radial multipliers when we identify the matrix algebra $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$ with a finite-dimensional fermion algebra. Our primary contribution lies in the precise computation of the (optimal) rate at which classical information can be transmitted through these channels from a sender to a receiver when they share an unlimited amount of entanglement. Our approach relies on new connections between fermion algebras with the $n$-dimensional discrete hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$. Significantly, our calculations yield exact values applicable to the operators of the fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. This advancement not only provides deeper insights into the structure and behaviour of these channels but also enhances our understanding of Quantum Information Theory in a dimension-independent context.</description>

      <title>Many body gravity and the galaxy rotation curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel theory was proposed earlier to model systems with thermal gradients, based on the postulate that the spatial and temporal variation in temperature can be recast as a variation in the metric. Combining the variation in the metric due to the thermal variations and gravity, leads to the concept of thermal gravity in a 5-D space-time-temperature setting. When the 5-D Einstein field equations are projected to a 4-D space, they result in additional terms in the field equations. This may lead to unique phenomena such as the spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar particles in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This theory, originally conceived in a quantum mechanical framework, is now adapted to explain the galaxy rotation curves. A galaxy is not in a state of thermal equilibrium. A parameter called the "degree of thermalization" is introduced to model partially thermalized systems. The generalization of thermal gravity to partially thermalized systems, leads to the theory of many-body gravity. The theory of many-body gravity is now shown to be able to explain the rotation curves of the Milky Way and the M31 (Andromeda) galaxies, to a fair extent. The radial acceleration relation (RAR) for 63 galaxies, with their galactic masses spanning three orders of magnitude, has been replicated. Finally, the wide binary star (WBS) system is touched upon.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known since the work of Avakumov\'ic, H\"ormander and Levitan that, on any compact smooth Riemannian manifold, if $-\Delta_g \psi_\lambda = \lambda \psi_\lambda$, then $\|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^\infty} \leq C \lambda^{\frac{d-1}{4}} \|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^2}$. It is believed that, on manifolds of negative curvature, such a bound can be largely improved; however, only logarithmic improvements in $\lambda$ have been obtained so far. In the present paper, we obtain polynomial improvements over the previous bound in a generic setting, by adding a small random pseudodifferential perturbation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator.</description>

      <title>Optimal Coherent Quantum Phase Estimation via Tapering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation is one of the fundamental primitives that underpins many quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm for efficiently factoring large numbers. Due to its significance as a subroutine, in this work, we consider the coherent version of the phase estimation problem, where given an arbitrary input state and black-box access to unitaries $U$ and controlled-$U$, the goal is to estimate the phases of $U$ in superposition. Most existing phase estimation algorithms involve intermediary measurements that disrupt coherence. Only a couple of algorithms, including the standard quantum phase estimation algorithm, consider this coherent setting. However, the standard algorithm only succeeds with a constant probability. To boost this success probability, it employs the coherent median technique, resulting in an algorithm with optimal query complexity (the total number of calls to U and controlled-U). However, this coherent median technique requires a large number of ancilla qubits and a computationally expensive quantum sorting network.
  To address this, in this work, we propose an improved version of this standard algorithm called the tapered quantum phase estimation algorithm. It leverages tapering/window functions commonly used in signal processing. Our algorithm achieves the optimal query complexity without requiring the expensive coherent median technique to boost success probability. We also show that the tapering functions that we use are optimal by formulating optimization problems with different optimization criteria. Beyond the asymptotic regime, we also provide non-asymptotic query complexity of our algorithm, as it is crucial for practical implementation. Finally, we propose an efficient algorithm to prepare the quantum state corresponding to the optimal tapering function.</description>

      <title>A solvable non-unitary fermionic long-range model with extended symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a long-range version of the XX model, arising as the free-fermion point of the XXZ-type Haldane--Shastry (HS) chain. It has a description via non-unitary fermions, based on the free-fermion Temperley--Lieb algebra, and may also be viewed as an alternating $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Even and odd length behave very differently; we focus on odd length. The model is integrable, and we explicitly identify two commuting hamiltonians. While non-unitary, their spectrum is real by PT-symmetry. One hamiltonian is chiral and quadratic in fermions, while the other is parity-invariant and quartic. Their one-particle spectra have two linear branches, realising a massless relativistic dispersion on the lattice. The appropriate fermionic modes arise from 'quasi-translation' symmetry, which replaces ordinary translation symmetry. The model exhibits exclusion statistics, like the isotropic HS chain, with even more 'extended symmetry' and larger degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate localization in a many-body quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of extensive many-body Hamiltonians with few-body interactions and a many-body mobility edge: all eigenstates below a nonzero energy density are localized in an exponentially small fraction of "energetically allowed configurations" within Hilbert space. Our construction is based on quantum perturbations to a classical low-density parity check code. In principle, it is possible to detect this eigenstate localization by measuring few-body correlation functions in efficiently preparable mixed states.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty relations for quantum measurements from generalized equiangular tight frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current study aims to examine uncertainty relations for measurements from generalized equiangular tight frames. Informationally overcomplete measurements are a valuable tool in quantum information processing, including tomography and state estimation. The maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases are the most common case of such measurements. The existence of $d+1$ mutually unbiased bases is proved for $d$ being a prime power. More general classes of informationally overcomplete measurements have been proposed for various purposes. Measurements of interest are typically characterized by some inner structure maintaining the required properties. It leads to restrictions imposed on generated probabilities. To apply the considered measurements, these restrictions should be converted into information-theoretic terms. It is interesting that certain restrictions hold irrespectively to overcompleteness. To describe the amount of uncertainty quantitatively, we use the Tsallis and R\'{e}nyi entropies as well as probabilities of separate outcomes. The obtained results are based on estimation of the index of coincidence. The derived relations are briefly exemplified.</description>

      <title>Modulation theory of soliton-mean flow in KdV equation with box type initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the KdV equation with box type initial data, the interaction between a trial soliton and large-scale dispersive mean flow is studied theoretically and numerically. The pure box initial value can cause rarefaction wave and dispersive shock wave, and can create an area of soliton train. The key to the interaction of soliton and mean flow is that the dynamic evolutions of the mean flow and the local soliton can be described by the same modulation system. The soliton modulation system is derived from the degenerations of the two-genus Whitham modulation system. Considering the influence of rarefaction wave, dispersive shock wave and soliton train on the trial soliton, in the framework of Whitham modulation theory, the equation describing the soliton trajectory and the changes in amplitude and phase shift are given explicitly. The predicted results are compared with the numerical simulations, which verifies the corrections of the theoretical analysis. The exotic interaction phenomena between soliton and mean flow found in this work have broad applications to shallow water soliton propagations and real soliton experiments in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Relations in Twisted Quantum K-Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce twisted quantum $K$-rings, defined via twisted $K$-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants. We develop a toolkit for computing relations by adapting some results about ordinary quantum K rings to our setting, and discuss some applications, including Ruan-Zhang's quantum $K$-theory with level structure, and complete intersections inside projective space, confirming some predictions coming from physics.
  In addition, we formulate a ring-theoretic abelian/non-abelian correspondence conjecture, relating the quantum K-ring of a GIT quotient $X//G$ to a certain twist of the quantum K-ring of $X//T$, the quotient by the maximal torus. We prove this conjecture for the case of Grassmanians, and use this to give another proof of the Whitney relations of Mihalcea-Gu-Sharpe-Zhou.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the low temperature $(2+1)$D SOS interface above a hard floor with critical pinning potential $\lambda_w= \log (\frac{1}{1-e^{-4\beta}})$. At $\lambda&lt;\lambda_w$ entropic repulsion causes the surface to delocalize and be rigid at height $\frac1{4\beta}\log n+O(1)$; at $\lambda&gt;\lambda_w$ it is localized at some $O(1)$ height. We show that at $\lambda=\lambda_w$, there is delocalization, with rigidity now at height $\lfloor \frac1{6\beta}\log n+\frac13\rfloor$, confirming a conjecture of Lacoin.</description>

      <title>Adjusted Connections I: Differential Cocycles for Principal Groupoid Bundles with Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new perspective on principal bundles with connection as morphisms from the tangent bundle of the underlying manifold to a classifying dg-Lie groupoid. This groupoid can be identified with a lift of the inner homomorphisms groupoid arising in \v{S}evera's differentiation procedure of Lie quasi-groupoids. Our new perspective readily extends to principal groupoid bundles, but requires an adjustment, an additional datum familiar from higher gauge theory. We show that for Lie groupoids, the additional adjustment data amounts to a Cartan connection. The resulting adjusted connections naturally provide a global formulation of the kinematical data of curved Yang-Mills-Higgs theories as described by Kotov-Strobl (arXiv:1510.07654) and Fischer (arXiv:2104.02175).</description>

      <title>The spectral gap and principle eigenfunction of the random conductance model in a line segment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectral gap and principle eigenfunction of the random walk in the line segment $[1, N]$ with conductances $c^{(N)}(x, x+1)_{1\le x&lt;N}$ where $c^{(N)}(x, x+1)&gt;0$ is the rate of the random walk jumping from site $x$ to site $x+1$ and vice versa. Writing $r^{(N)}(x, x+1) := 1/c^{(N)}(x, x+1)$, under the assumption \begin{equation*}
  \limsup_{N\to \infty}\, \frac{1}{N}\sup_{1&lt; m \le N}\, \left| \sum_{x=2}^m r^{(N)}(x-1, x)- (m-1) \right|\;=\;0\,, \end{equation*} we prove that the spectral gap, denoted by $\mathrm{gap}_{N}$, of the process satisfies $\mathrm{gap}_{N}=(1+o(1))\pi^2/N^2$ and the principle eigenfunction $g_N$ with $g_N(1)=1$ corresponding to the spectral gap is well approximated by $h_N(x) := \cos\left( (x-1/2)\pi/N \right)$.</description>

      <title>Generating customized field concentration via virtual surface transmission resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for generating strong customized field concentration locally around the inhomogeneous medium inclusion via surface transmission resonance. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we show that for a given inclusion embedded in an otherwise uniformly homogeneous background space, we can design an incident field to generate strong localized field concentration at any specified places around the inclusion. The aforementioned customized field concentration is crucially reliant on the peculiar spectral and geometric patterns of certain transmission eigenfunctions. Secondly, we prove the existence of a sequence of transmission eigenfunctions for a specific wavenumber and they exhibit distinct surface resonant behaviors, accompanying strong surface-localization and surface-oscillation properties. These eigenfunctions as the surface transmission resonant modes fulfill the requirement for generating the field concentration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stationary measures of last passage percolation with geometric weights and the log-gamma polymer in a strip of the $\mathbb Z^2$ lattice are characterized in arXiv:2306.05983 using variants of Schur and Whittaker processes, called two-layer Gibbs measures. In this article, we prove contour integral formulas characterizing the multipoint joint distribution of two-layer Schur and Whittaker processes. We also express them as Doob transformed Markov processes with explicit transition kernels. As an example of application of our formulas, we compute the growth rate of the KPZ equation on $[0,L]$ with arbitrary boundary parameters.</description>

Abstract: The light rays trajectories in Kerr metric, resulting from Fermat's principle, are considered from the point of view of integrable systems. It is shown how the counterpart of Carter constant emerges as a result of coupling-constant metamorphosis.
