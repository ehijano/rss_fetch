      <title>Nobody needs equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equations are ubiquitous in most mathematical activities. Nevertheless, in this paper it is shown how to do standard mathematics without any equation at all. More than that, it is proven there is a foundational framework for standard mathematics where equations cannot be even written, in the sense they are not formulas. The proof of those claims is very simple, almost obvious. I use this framework to suggest a way to deal with certain notions of indiscernibility between `objects', with special emphasis on some aspects of quantum mechanics. Finally I compare this approach to quasi-set theory, an unnecessarily complicated formal work designed to deal with violation of Leibniz Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles.</description>

      <title>Reflection and Recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the Zermelo Fraenkel set theory with Choice (ZFC) enhanced by one of the (structural) reflection principles down to a small cardinal and/or Recurrence Axioms defined below. The strongest forms of reflection principles spotlight the three scenarios in which the size of the continuum is either $\aleph_1$, or $\aleph_2$, or very large, while the maximal setting of Recurrence Axioms points to the set-theoretic universe with the continuum of size $\aleph_2$.
  We discuss that both the Reflection Principles and Recurrence Axioms can be construed as preferable candidates of the extension of ZFC in terms of the criteria of G\"odel's Program. From this view point, the maximal possible (consistent) combination of these principles and axioms, or even some natural strengthening of the combination (which we want to call ``Laver-generic Maximum'' (LGM)) may be considered as the ultimate extension of ZFC (of course ``ultimate'' only for now -- because of the Incompleteness Theorems): LGM resolves the size of the continuum to be $\aleph_2$ and integrates practically all known statements consistent with ZFC in itself either as its consequences (as it is the case with Martin's Maximum$^{++}$) or as theorems holding in many grounds of the universe (as it is the case with Cicho\'n's Maximum).</description>

      <title>Sequent Calculi for some subintuitionistic Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Paper investigate sequent calculi for certain weak subintuitionistic logics. We establish that weakening and contraction are height-preserving admissible for each of these calculi, and we provide a syntactic proof for the admissibility of the cut rule for most of these sequent calculi. We also demonstrate the equivalence of these calculi to their corresponding axiomatic systems, thereby confirming their soundness and completeness with respect to neighbourhood semantics.</description>

      <title>More conservativity for weak K\H{o}nig's lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove conservativity results for weak K\H{o}nig's lemma that extend the celebrated result of Harrington (for $\Pi^1_1$-statements) and are somewhat orthogonal to the extension by Simpson, Tanaka and Yamazaki (for statements of the form $\forall X\exists!Y\psi$ with arithmetical $\psi$). In particular, we show that $\mathsf{WKL}_0$ is conservative over $\mathsf{RCA}_0$ for well-ordering principles. We also show that compactness (which characterizes weak K\H{o}nig's lemma) is dispensable for certain results about continuous functions with isolated singularities.</description>

      <title>Hybrid logic for strict betweenness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to modal properties of the ternary strict betweenness relation as used in the development of various systems of geometry. We show that such a relation is non-definable in a basic similarity type with a binary operator of possibility, and we put forward two systems of hybrid logic, one of them complete with respect to the class of dense linear betweenness frames without endpoints, and the other with respect to its subclass composed of Dedekind complete frames.</description>

      <title>Density cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How many permutations are needed so that every infinite-coinfinite set of natural numbers with asymptotic density can be rearranged to no longer have the same density? We prove that the density number $\mathfrak{dd}$, which answers this question, is equal to the least size of a non-meager set of reals, $\mathsf{non} (\mathcal{M})$. The same argument shows that a slight modification of the rearrangement number $\mathfrak{rr}$ of~\cite{BBBHHL20} is equal to $\mathsf{non} (\mathcal{M})$, and similarly for a cardinal invariant related to large-scale topology introduced by Banakh~\cite{Ba23}, thus answering a question of the latter. We then consider variants of $\mathfrak{dd}$ given by restricting the possible densities of the original set and / or of the permuted set, providing lower and upper bounds for these cardinals and proving consistency of strict inequalities. We finally look at cardinals defined in terms of relative density and of asymptotic mean, and relate them to the rearrangement numbers of~\cite{BBBHHL20}.</description>

      <title>Homotopy reflectivity is equivalent to the weak Vop\v{e}nka principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homotopical localizations with respect to (possibly proper) classes of maps are known to exist assuming the validity of a large-cardinal axiom from set theory called Vop\v{e}nka's principle. In this article, we prove that each of the following statements is equivalent to an axiom of lower consistency strength than Vop\v{e}nka's principle, known as weak Vop\v{e}nka's principle: (a) Localization with respect to any class of maps exists in the homotopy category of simplicial sets; (b) Localization with respect to any class of maps exists in the homotopy category of spectra; (c) Localization with respect to any class of morphisms exists in any presentable $\infty$-category; (d) Every full subcategory closed under products and fibres in a triangulated category with locally presentable models is reflective. Our results are established using Wilson's 2020 solution to a long-standing open problem concerning the relative consistency of weak Vop\v{e}nka's principle within the large-cardinal hierarchy.</description>

      <title>A jump operator on the Weihrauch degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A partial order $(P,\le)$ admits a jump operator if there is a map $j\colon P \to P$ that is strictly increasing and weakly monotone. Despite its name, the jump in the Weihrauch lattice fails to satisfy both of these properties: it is not degree-theoretic and there are functions $f$ such that $f\equiv_{\mathrm{W}} f'$. This raises the question: is there a jump operator in the Weihrauch lattice? We answer this question positively and provide an explicit definition for an operator on partial multi-valued functions that, when lifted to the Weihrauch degrees, induces a jump operator. This new operator, called the totalizing jump, can be characterized in terms of the total continuation, a well-known operator on computational problems. The totalizing jump induces an injective endomorphism of the Weihrauch degrees. We study some algebraic properties of the totalizing jump and characterize its behavior on some pivotal problems in the Weihrauch lattice.</description>

      <title>On SCC-recursiveness in Quantitative Argumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.08880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abstract argumentation is a reasoning model for evaluating arguments based on various semantics. SCC-recursiveness is a sophisticated property of semantics that provides a general schema for characterizing semantics through the decomposition along strongly connected components (SCCs). While this property has been extensively explored in various qualitative frameworks, it has been relatively neglected in quantitative argumentation. To fill this gap, we demonstrate that this property is well-suited to fuzzy extension semantics, which is a quantitative generalization of classical semantics in fuzzy argumentation frameworks (FAF). We tailor the SCC-recursive schema to enable the characterization of fuzzy extension semantics through the recursive decomposition of an FAF along its SCCs. Our contributions are twofold. Theoretically, we show that SCC-recursiveness provides an alternative approach to characterize fuzzy extension semantics, offering a deep understanding and better insight into these semantics. Practically, our schema provides a sound and complete algorithm for computing fuzzy extension semantics, which naturally reduces computational efforts when dealing with a large number of SCCs.</description>
