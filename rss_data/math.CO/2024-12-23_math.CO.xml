      <title>Rainbow Arborescence Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Ryser--Brualdi--Stein conjecture asserts that every $n \times n$ Latin square contains a partial transversal of size $n-1$. Since its appearance, the conjecture has attracted significant interest, leading to several generalizations. One of the most notable extensions is to matroid intersection given by Aharoni, Kotlar, and Ziv, focusing on the existence of a common independent transversal of the common independent sets of two matroids. In this paper, we study a special case of this setting, the Rainbow Arborescence Conjecture, which states that any graph on $n$ vertices formed by the union of $n-1$ spanning arborescences contains an arborescence using exactly one arc from each. We prove that the computational problem of testing the existence of such an arborescence with a fixed root is NP-complete, verify the conjecture in several cases, and explore relaxed versions of the problem.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic half-grid and full-grid minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every locally finite, quasi-transitive graph with a thick end whose cycle space is generated by cycles of bounded length contains the full-grid as an asymptotic minor and as a diverging minor. This in particular includes all locally finite Cayley graphs of finitely presented groups, and partially solves problems of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu and of Georgakopoulos and Hamann.
  Additionally, we show that every (not necessarily quasi-transitive) graph of finite maximum degree which has a thick end and whose cycle space is generated by cycles of bounded length contains the half-grid as an asymptotic minor and as a diverging minor.</description>

      <title>Shiftable Heffter spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shiftable Heffter arrays are naturally generalized to the shiftable Heffter spaces. We present a recursive construction which starting from a single shiftable Heffter space leads to infinitely many other shiftable Heffter spaces of the same degree. We also present a direct construction making use of pandiagonal magic squares leading to a shiftable $(16\ell^2,4l;3)$ Heffter space for any $\ell \geq 1$. Combining these constructions we obtain a shiftable $(16\ell^2mn, 4\ell n; 3)$ Heffter space for every triple of positive integers $(\ell,m,n)$ with $m \geq n$.</description>

      <title>On the number of connected edge cover sets in a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ G=(V,E) $ be a simple graph of order $ n $ and size $ m $. A connected edge cover set of a graph is a subset $S$ of edges such that every vertex of the graph is incident to at least one edge of $S$ and the subgraph induced by $S$ is connected. We initiate the study of the number of the connected edge cover sets of a graph $G$ with cardinality $i$, $ e_{c}(G,i) $ and consider the generating function for $ e_{c}(G,i) $ which is called the connected edge cover polynomial of $ G $. After obtaining some results for this polynomial, we investigate this polynomial for some certain graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\rm dim}(G)$ and $D(G)$ respectively denote the metric dimension and the distinguishing number of a graph $G$. It is proved that $D(G) \le {\rm dim}(G)+1$ holds for every connected graph $G$. Among trees, exactly paths and stars attain the bound, and among connected unicyclic graphs such graphs are $t$-cycles for $t\in \{3,4,5\}$. It is shown that for any $1\leq n&lt; m$, there exists a graph $G$ with $D(G)=n$ and ${\rm dim}(G)=m$. Using the bound $D(G) \le {\rm dim}(G)+1$, graphs with $D(G) = n(G)-2$ are classified.</description>

      <title>Structure of cycles in Minimal Strong Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work shows a study about the structure of the cycles contained in a Minimal Strong Digraph (MSD). The structure of a given cycle is determined by the strongly connected components (or strong components, SCs) that appear after suppressing the arcs of the cycle. By this process and by the contraction of all SCs into single vertices we obtain a Hasse diagram from the MSD. Among other properties, we show that any SC conformed by more than one vertex (non trivial SC) has at least one linear vertex (a vertex with indegree and outdegree equal to 1) in the MSD (Theorem 1); that in the Hasse diagram at least one linear vertex exists for each non trivial maximal (resp. minimal) vertex (Theorem 2); that if an SC contains a number $\lambda$ of vertices of the cycle then it contains at least $\lambda$ linear vertices in the MSD (Theorem 3); and, finally, that given a cycle of length $q$ contained in the MSD, the number $\alpha$ of linear vertices contained in the MSD satisfies $\alpha \geq \lfloor (q+1)/2 \rfloor$ (Theorem 4).</description>

      <title>Maximizing Satisfied Vertex Requests in List Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $G$ is a graph and $L$ is a list assignment for $G$. A request of $L$ is a function $r$ with nonempty domain $D\subseteq V(G)$ such that $r(v) \in L(v)$ for each $v \in D$. The triple $(G,L,r)$ is $\epsilon$-satisfiable if there exists a proper $L$-coloring $f$ of $G$ such that $f(v) = r(v)$ for at least $\epsilon|D|$ vertices in $D$. We say $G$ is $(k, \epsilon)$-flexible if $(G,L',r')$ is $\epsilon$-satisfiable whenever $L'$ is a $k$-assignment for $G$ and $r'$ is a request of $L'$. It is known that a graph $G$ is not $(k, \epsilon)$-flexible for any $k$ if and only if $\epsilon &gt; 1/ \rho(G)$ where $\rho(G)$ is the Hall ratio of $G$. The list flexibility number of a graph $G$, denoted $\chi_{\ell flex}(G)$, is the smallest $k$ such that $G$ is $(k,1/ \rho(G))$-flexible. A fundamental open question on list flexibility numbers asks: Is there a graph with list flexibility number greater than its coloring number?
  In this paper, we show that the list flexibility number of any complete multipartite graph $G$ is at most the coloring number of $G$. With this as a starting point, we study list epsilon flexibility functions of complete bipartite graphs which was first suggested by Kaul, Mathew, Mudrock, and Pelsmajer in 2024. Specifically, we completely determine the list epsilon flexibility function of $K_{m,n}$ when $m \in \{1,2\}$ and establish additional bounds. Our proofs reveal a connection to list coloring complete bipartite graphs with asymmetric list sizes which is a topic that was explored by Alon, Cambie, and Kang in 2021.</description>

      <title>Maximal independent sets in graphs with given matching number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a graph $G$, a maximal independent set $I$ is a set of vertices such that no two vertices are adjacent, and the addition of any vertex $v$ not in $I$ would result in a set that is no longer independent.
  An induced triangle matching in a graph is a set of vertex disjoint triangles forming an induced subgraph, with its size being the number of these triangles. Palmer and Patk\'{o}s [J. Graph Theory 104 (2023) 440--445] have made a significant contribution by establishing an upper bound on the number of maximal independent sets for graphs of given order that do not contain an induced triangle matching of size $t+1$. Building on their work, this paper extends the analysis to determine the maximum number of maximal independent sets in general graphs, connected graphs, triangle-free graphs, and connected triangle-free graphs with given matching number. Additionally, we characterize the corresponding extremal graphs that achieve this maximum.</description>

      <title>Stable cuts, NAC-colourings and flexible realisations of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A (2-dimensional) realisation of a graph $G$ is a pair $(G,p)$, where $p$ maps the vertices of $G$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$. A realisation is flexible if it can be continuously deformed while keeping the edge lengths fixed, and rigid otherwise. Similarly, a graph is flexible if its generic realisations are flexible, and rigid otherwise.
  We show that a minimally rigid graph has a flexible realisation with positive edge lengths if and only if it is not a $2$-tree. This confirms a conjecture of Grasegger, Legersk\'y and Schicho. Our proof is based on a characterisation of graphs with $n$ vertices and $2n-3$ edges and without stable cuts due to Le and Pfender. We also strengthen a result of Chen and Yu, who proved that every graph with at most $2n-4$ edges has a stable cut, by showing that every flexible graph has a stable cut.
  Additionally we investigate the number of NAC-colourings in various graphs. A NAC-colouring is a type of edge colouring introduced by Grasegger, Legersk\'y and Schicho, who showed that the existence of such a colouring characterises the existence of a flexible realisation with positive edge lengths. We provide an upper bound on the number of NAC-colourings for arbitrary graphs, and construct families of graphs, including rigid and minimally rigid ones, for which this number is exponential in the number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Some bounds on the spectral radius of connected threshold graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral radius of a graph is the spectral radius of its adjacency matrix. A threshold graph is a simple graph whose vertices can be ordered as $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$, so that for each $2 \le i \le n$, vertex $v_i$ is either adjacent or nonadjacent simultaneously to all of $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{i-1}$. Brualdi and Hoffman initially posed and then partially solved the extremal problem of finding the simple graphs with a given number of edges that have the maximum spectral radius. This problem was subsequently completely resolved by Rowlinson. Here, we deal with the similar problem of maximizing the spectral radius over the set of connected simple graphs with a given number of vertices and edges. As shown by Brualdi and Solheid, each such extremal graph is necessarily a threshold graph. We investigate the spectral radii of threshold graphs by relying on computations involving lazy walks. Furthermore, we obtain three lower bounds and one upper bound on the spectral radius of a given connected threshold graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a generalization of the topological Tverberg theorem. One special instance of our general theorem is the following: Let $\Delta$ denote the 8-dimensional simplex viewed as an abstract simplicial complex, and suppose that its vertices are arranged in a $3\times 3$ array. Then for any continuous map $f:\Delta \to \mathbb{R}^3$ it is possible to partition the rows or the columns of the vertex array into two parts, such that the disjoint faces $\sigma$ and $\tau$ induced by the two parts satisfy $f(\sigma)\cap f(\tau) \neq \emptyset$. Our result also has consequences for geometric transversals and topological Helly.</description>

Abstract: Identifying and mitigating the spread of fake information is a challenging issue that has become dominant with the rise of social media. We consider a generalization of the Domination problem that can be used to detect a set of individuals who, once immunized, can prevent the spreading of fake narratives. The considered problem, named {\em Distance Vector Domination} generalizes both distance and multiple domination, at individual (i.e., vertex) level. We study the parameterized complexity of the problem according to several standard and structural parameters. We prove the W[1]-hardness of the problem with respect to neighborhood diversity, even when all the distances are $1$. We also give fixed-parameter algorithms for some variants of the problem and parameter combinations.</description>

Abstract: With the rise of social media, misinformation has significant negative effects on the decision-making of individuals, organizations and communities within society. Identifying and mitigating the spread of fake information is a challenging issue. We consider a generalization of the Domination problem that can be used to detect a set of individuals who, through an awareness process, can prevent the spreading of fake narratives. The considered problem, named \textsc{$(d,r)$-Domination} generalizes both distance and multiple domination. We study the parameterized complexity of the problem according to standard and structural parameters. We give fixed-parameter algorithms as well as polynomial compressions/kernelizations for some variants of the problem and parameter combinations.</description>

      <title>Some New Modular Rank Three Nahm Sums from a Lift-Dual Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Around 2007, Zagier discovered some rank two and rank three Nahm sums, and their modularity have now all been confirmed. Zagier also observed that the dual of a modular Nahm sum is likely to be modular. This duality observation motivates us to discover some new modular rank three Nahm sums by a lift-dual operation. We first lift Zagier's rank two Nahm sums to rank three and then calculate their dual, and we show that these dual Nahm sums are indeed modular. We achieve this by establishing the corresponding Rogers--Ramanujan type identities, which express these Nahm sums as modular infinite products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rigid isotopy of real algebraic curves of a certain class is a path in the space of curves of this class. The paper's study completes the rigid isotopic classification of nonsingular real algebraic curves of bidegree (4,3) on a hyperboloid, begun by the author in earlier works. There are given the missing proofs of the uniqueness of the connected components for 16 classes of real algebraic curves of bidegree (4,3) having a single node or a cusp. The main technical tools are graphs of real trigonal curves on Hirzebruch surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the behavior of binary block-counting functions under addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathsf{s}(n)$ denote the sum of binary digits of an integer $n \geq 0$. In the recent years there has been interest in the behavior of the differences $\mathsf{s}(n+t)-\mathsf{s}(n)$, where $t \geq 0$ is an integer. In particular, Spiegelhofer and Wallner showed that for $t$ whose binary expansion contains sufficiently many blocks of $\mathtt{1}$s the inequality $\mathsf{s}(n+t) -\mathsf{s}(n) \geq 0$ holds for $n$ belonging to a set of asymptotic density $&gt;1/2$, partially answering a question by Cusick. Furthermore, for such $t$ the values $\mathsf{s}(n+t) - \mathsf{s}(n)$ are approximately normally distributed.
  In this paper we consider a natural generalization to the family of block-counting functions $N^w$, giving the number of occurrences of a block of binary digits $w$ in the binary expansion. Our main result show that for any $w$ of length at least $2$ the distribution of the differences $N^w(n+t) - N^w(n)$ is close to a Gaussian when $t$ contains many blocks of $\mathtt{1}$s in its binary expansion. This extends an earlier result by the author and Spiegelhofer for $w=\mathtt{11}$.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime. In this paper, we have determined the Hamming distances for constacyclic codes of length $2p^s$ over the finite commutative non-chain ring $\mathcal{R}=\frac{\mathbb{F}_{p^m}[u, v]}{\langle u^2, v^2, uv-vu\rangle}$.

      <title>The Frank number and nowhere-zero flows on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02133v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An edge $e$ of a graph $G$ is called deletable for some orientation $o$ if the restriction of $o$ to $G-e$ is a strong orientation. Inspired by a problem of Frank, in 2021 H\"orsch and Szigeti proposed a new parameter for $3$-edge-connected graphs, called the Frank number, which refines $k$-edge-connectivity. The Frank number is defined as the minimum number of orientations of $G$ for which every edge of $G$ is deletable in at least one of them. They showed that every $3$-edge-connected graph has Frank number at most $7$ and that in case these graphs are also $3$-edge-colourable the parameter is at most $3$. Here we strengthen both results by showing that every $3$-edge-connected graph has Frank number at most $4$ and that every graph which is $3$-edge-connected and $3$-edge-colourable has Frank number $2$. The latter also confirms a conjecture by Bar\'at and Bl\'azsik. Furthermore, we prove two sufficient conditions for cubic graphs to have Frank number $2$ and use them in an algorithm to computationally show that the Petersen graph is the only cyclically $4$-edge-connected cubic graph up to $36$ vertices having Frank number greater than $2$.</description>

      <title>Effective Bounds for Restricted $3$-Arithmetic Progressions in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a prime $p$, a restricted arithmetic progression in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ is a triplet of vectors $x, x+a, x+2a$ in which the common difference $a$ is a non-zero element from $\{0,1,2\}^n$. What is the size of the largest $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_p^n$ that is free of restricted arithmetic progressions? We show that the density of any such a set is at most $\frac{C}{(\log\log\log n)^c}$, where $c,C&gt;0$ depend only on $p$, giving the first reasonable bounds for the density of such sets. Previously, the best known bound was $O(1/\log^{*} n)$, which follows from the density Hales-Jewett theorem.</description>

      <title>Cumulant expansion for counting Eulerian orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An Eulerian orientation is an orientation of the edges of a graph such that every vertex is balanced: its in-degree equals its out-degree. Counting Eulerian orientations corresponds to the crucial partition function in so-called ``ice-type models'' in statistical physics and is known to be hard for general graphs. For all graphs with good expansion properties and degrees larger than $\log^{8} n$, we derive an asymptotic expansion for this count that approximates it to precision $O(n^{-c})$ for arbitrary large $c$, where $n$ is the number of vertices. The proof relies on a new tail bound for the cumulant expansion of the Laplace transform, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve the best known upper bounds on the density of corner-free sets over quasirandom groups from inverse poly-logarithmic to quasi-polynomial. We make similarly substantial improvements to the best known lower bounds on the communication complexity of a large class of permutation functions in the 3-player Number-on-Forehead model. Underpinning both results is a general combinatorial theorem that extends the recent work of Kelley, Lovett, and Meka (STOC'24), itself a development of ideas from the breakthrough result of Kelley and Meka on three-term arithmetic progressions (FOCS'23).</description>

      <title>Packing edge-colorings of subcubic outerplanar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a sequence $S = (s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k)$ of non-decreasing positive integers, an $S$-packing edge-coloring (S-coloring) of a graph $G$ is a partition of $E(G)$ into $E_1, E_2, \ldots, E_k$ such that the distance between each pair of distinct edges $e_1,e_2 \in E_i$, $1 \le i \le k$, is at least $s_i + 1$. In particular, a $(1^{\ell},2^k)$-coloring is a partition of $E(G)$ into $\ell$ matchings and $k$ induced matchings, and it can be viewed as intermediate colorings between proper and strong edge-colorings. Hocquard, Lajou, and Lu\v{z}ar conjectured that every subcubic planar graph has a $(1,2^6)$-coloring and a $(1^2,2^3)$-coloring.
  In this paper, we confirm the conjecture of Hocquard, Lajou, and Lu\v{z}ar for subcubic outerplanar graphs by showing every subcubic outerplanar graph has a $(1,2^5)$-coloring and a $(1^2,2^3)$-coloring. Our results are best possible since we found subcubic outerplanar graphs with no $(1,2^4)$-coloring and no $(1^2,2^2)$-coloring respectively. Furthermore, we explore the question "What is the largest positive integer $k_1$ and $k_2$ such that every subcubic outerplanar graph is $(1,2^4,k_1)$-colorable and $(1^2,2^2,k_2)$-colorable?". We prove $3 \le k_1 \le 6$ and $3 \le k_2 \le 4$. We also consider the question "What is the largest positive integer $k_1'$ and $k_2'$ such that every $2$-connected subcubic outerplanar graph is $(1,2^3,k_1')$-colorable and $(1^2,2^2,k_2')$-colorable?". We prove $k_1' = 2$ and $3 \le k_2' \le 11$.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on diagonal Ramsey numbers [after Campos, Griffiths, Morris, and Sahasrabudhe]</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ramsey's theorem states that if $N$ is sufficiently large, then no matter how one colors the edges among $N$ vertices with two colors, there are always $k$ vertices spanning edges in only one color. Given this theorem, it is natural to ask ``how large is sufficiently large?'' Ramsey's original proof showed that $N=k!$ is sufficient, and five years later Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres improved this bound to $N=4^k$. And then progress stalled for almost 90 years.
  In this survey, I present the history of the problem and discuss some of the ideas used in the recent breakthrough of Campos--Griffiths--Morris--Sahasrabudhe, who proved that $N=3.993^k$ is sufficient. In addition, I discuss the subsequent work of Balister, Bollob\'as, Campos, Griffiths, Hurley, Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba, who gave an alternative, and more conceptual, proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A poset $P$ is said to satisfy the finite antichain condition, or FAC for short, if it has no infinite antichain. It was conjectured by Aharoni and Korman in 1992 that any FAC poset $P$ possesses a chain $C$ and a partition into antichains such that $C$ meets every antichain of the partition. Our main results are twofold. We provide a counterexample to the conjecture in full generality, but, despite this, we also prove that the conjecture does hold true for a broad class of posets. In particular, we prove that the Aharoni-Korman conjecture holds for countable posets avoiding intervals $I$ such that either $I$ or its reverse $I^*$ is of the form $\bigoplus_{x\in\omega} Q_x$, where each $Q_x$ is infinite and co-wellfounded.
  In pursuit of these goals, we also investigate other facets of the structure of FAC posets. In particular, we consider strongly maximal chains in FAC posets, proving some results, and posing several questions and conjectures.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present a method for constructing directed strongly regular graphs with assumed action of an automorphism group. The application of this method leads to first examples of directed strongly regular graphs with parameters $(22,9,6,3,4)$. We have shown that an automorphism of prime order acting on such a graph can only be of order two or three. Furthermore, we have constructed $472$ directed strongly regular graphs with parameters $(22,9,6,3,4)$ and classified all these graphs with an automorphism of order three.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph of order $n$. A $\{P_{2},C_{3},P_{5},\mathcal{T}(3)\}$-factor of $G$ is a spanning subgraph of $G$ such that each component is isomorphic to a member in $\{P_{2},C_{3},P_{5},\mathcal{T}(3)\}$, where $\mathcal{T}(3)$ is a $\{1,2,3\}$-tree. The $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius of $G$ is denoted by $\rho_{\alpha}(G)$. In this paper, we obtain a lower bound on the size or the $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius for $\alpha\in[0,1)$ of $G$ to guarantee that $G$ has a $\{P_{2},C_{3},P_{5},\mathcal{T}(3)\}$-factor, and construct an extremal graph to show that the bound on $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius is optimal.</description>

Abstract: We introduce twisted triple crossing diagram maps, collections of points in projective space associated to bipartite graphs on the cylinder, and use them to provide geometric realizations of the cluster integrable systems of Goncharov and Kenyon constructed from toric dimer models. Using this notion, we provide geometric proofs that the pentagram map and the cross-ratio dynamics integrable systems are cluster integrable systems. We show that in appropriate coordinates, cross-ratio dynamics is described by geometric R-matrices, which solves the open question of finding a cluster algebra structure describing cross-ratio dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Let $P$ be a $k$-colored set of $n$ points in the plane, $4 \leq k \leq n$. We study the problem of deciding if $P$ contains a subset of four points of different colors such that its Rectilinear Convex Hull has positive area. We show this problem to be equivalent to deciding if there exists a point $c$ in the plane such that each of the open quadrants defined by $c$ contains a point of $P$, each of them having a different color. We provide an $O(n \log n)$-time algorithm for this problem, where the hidden constant does not depend on $k$; then, we prove that this problem has time complexity $\Omega(n \log n)$ in the algebraic computation tree model. No general position assumptions for $P$ are required.</description>

For outerplanar graphs $G$ with faces of arbitrary lengths (not necessarily 3) we establish a similar result, with the condition that the two exchanged edges share an end vertex or lie on a common face. These listings of spanning trees are obtained from a simple greedy algorithm that can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in time $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ per generated spanning tree, where $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$. Furthermore, the listings correspond to Hamilton paths on the 0/1-polytope that is obtained as the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of all spanning trees of $G$.</description>

      <title>RSK as a linear operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence (RSK) is a bijection between nonnegative integer matrices and pairs of Young tableaux. We study it as a linear operator on the coordinate ring of matrices, proving results about its diagonalizability, eigenvalues, trace, and determinant. Our criterion for diagonalizability involves the $ADE$ classification of Dynkin diagrams, as well as the diagram for $E_9$.</description>

      <title>Transfinite hypercentral iterated wreath product of integral domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting with an integral domain $D$ of characteristic $0$, we consider a class of iterated wreath product $W_n$ of $n$ copies of $D$. In order that $W_n$ be transfinite hypercentral, it is necessary to restrict to the case of wreath products defined by way of numerical polynomials. We also associate to each of these groups a Lie ring, providing a correspondence preserving most of the structure. This construction generalizes a result which characterizes the Lie algebras associated to the Sylow $p$-subgroups of the symmetric group $\mathrm{Sym}(p^n)$. As an application, we explore the normalizer chain $\lbrace\mathbf{N}_{i}\rbrace_{i\geq -1}$ starting from the canonical regular abelian subgroup $T$ of $W_n$. Finally, we characterize the regular abelian normal subgroups of $\mathbf{N}_0$ that are isomorphic to $D^n$.</description>
