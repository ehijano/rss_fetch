      <title>Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting with Optimized Feature Planes and Standard Video Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting is a recognized method for 3D scene representation, known for its high rendering quality and speed. However, its substantial data requirements present challenges for practical applications. In this paper, we introduce an efficient compression technique that significantly reduces storage overhead by using compact representation. We propose a unified architecture that combines point cloud data and feature planes through a progressive tri-plane structure. Our method utilizes 2D feature planes, enabling continuous spatial representation. To further optimize these representations, we incorporate entropy modeling in the frequency domain, specifically designed for standard video codecs. We also propose channel-wise bit allocation to achieve a better trade-off between bitrate consumption and feature plane representation. Consequently, our model effectively leverages spatial correlations within the feature planes to enhance rate-distortion performance using standard, non-differentiable video codecs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in data compactness while maintaining high rendering quality.

      <title>ConcealGS: Concealing Invisible Copyright Information in 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of 3D reconstruction technology, the widespread distribution of 3D data has become a future trend. While traditional visual data (such as images and videos) and NeRF-based formats already have mature techniques for copyright protection, steganographic techniques for the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) format have yet to be fully explored. To address this, we propose ConcealGS, an innovative method for embedding implicit information into 3D-GS. By introducing the knowledge distillation and gradient optimization strategy based on 3D-GS, ConcealGS overcomes the limitations of NeRF-based models and enhances the robustness of implicit information and the quality of 3D reconstruction. We evaluate ConcealGS in various potential application scenarios, and experimental results have demonstrated that ConcealGS not only successfully recovers implicit information but also has almost no impact on rendering quality, providing a new approach for embedding invisible and recoverable information into 3D models in the future.</description>

      <title>Visual question answering: from early developments to recent advances -- a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is an evolving research field aimed at enabling machines to answer questions about visual content by integrating image and language processing techniques such as feature extraction, object detection, text embedding, natural language understanding, and language generation. With the growth of multimodal data research, VQA has gained significant attention due to its broad applications, including interactive educational tools, medical image diagnosis, customer service, entertainment, and social media captioning. Additionally, VQA plays a vital role in assisting visually impaired individuals by generating descriptive content from images. This survey introduces a taxonomy of VQA architectures, categorizing them based on design choices and key components to facilitate comparative analysis and evaluation. We review major VQA approaches, focusing on deep learning-based methods, and explore the emerging field of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) that have demonstrated success in multimodal tasks like VQA. The paper further examines available datasets and evaluation metrics essential for measuring VQA system performance, followed by an exploration of real-world VQA applications. Finally, we highlight ongoing challenges and future directions in VQA research, presenting open questions and potential areas for further development. This survey serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the latest advancements and future</description>

      <title>PlanLLM: Video Procedure Planning with Refinable Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video procedure planning, i.e., planning a sequence of action steps given the video frames of start and goal states, is an essential ability for embodied AI. Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</description>
