      <title>Optomechanical method for characterizing thermal transport across van der Waals interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the development of nanoscale electronics and photonics using atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials, it is important to realize van der Waals (vdW) interfaces with low thermal resistance, to minimize performance reduction caused by heat accumulation. However, characterizing the thermal interface resistance between vdW materials is still a challenge. Here, we introduce a novel optomechanical methodology to characterize the thermal transport across interfaces in 2D heterostructures. We first determine the specific heat and thermal conductivity as the function of temperature for the upper and lower material layers separately and then extract the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of the heterostructure from its thermal time constant. We obtain a TBC of $2.41 \pm 1.03$ and $4.14 \pm 1.74$~\si{MW m^{2} K^{-1}} for FePS$_3$/WSe$_2$ and MoS$_2$/FePS$_3$ interfaces, respectively, which are comparable to values reported in the literature. Moreover, they agree with a Debye model including the acoustic impedance mismatch of flexural phonons. This work enables efficient thermal management down to the nanoscale and offers new insights into energy dissipation in vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Generating Thin-Film Conformal Metasurface for Backscattering Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, simulation, and experimental verification of a flexible thin-film conformal metasurface for backscattering control via orbital angular momentum (OAM) wave generation in the X-band (9.5-10.5 GHz). The metasurface comprises asymmetric square loop meta-atoms fabricated on an air-equivalent dielectric substrate with subwavelength thickness (lambda/15 at 10 GHz). Analytical modeling define the phase difference requirement (arg(ryy) - arg(rxx) = 180 +- 25 deg for spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion, enabling OAM mode l = +1 generation upon circularly polarized wave reflection. Full-wave EM simulations and antenna array theory predictions confirmed a characteristic radiation pattern null along the OAM propagation axis. Experimental prototypes were fabricated using adhesive-backed foil on foam-core substrates, demonstrating: 4 dB reflected power reduction for the OAM-generating metasurface compared to a uniform-phase reference, 7 dB reflected waves reduction versus solid metal including for various radii of rounding surfaces. The measured suppression bandwidth reached 1 GHz, though alignment sensitivity due to the narrow null zone was identified as a limitation. Additional radial phase gradients for beam defocusing reduced performance by 1-2 dB due to main lobe distortion. Discrepancies between analytical models and measurements underscored the importance of mutual coupling effects in complex phase distributions. This work confirms thin-film conformal metasurfaces as a viable solution for controllable backscattering.</description>

      <title>Fully Integrated Memristive Spiking Neural Network with Analog Neurons for High-Speed Event-Based Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for edge artificial intelligence to process event-based, complex data calls for hardware beyond conventional digital, von-Neumann architectures. Neuromorphic computing, using spiking neural networks (SNNs) with emerging memristors, is a promising solution, but existing systems often discard temporal information, demonstrate non-competitive accuracy, or rely on neuron designs with large capacitors that limit the scalability and processing speed. Here we experimentally demonstrate a fully integrated memristive SNN with a 128x24 memristor array integrated on a CMOS chip and custom-designed analog neurons, achieving high-speed, energy-efficient event-driven processing of accelerated spatiotemporal spike signals with high computational fidelity. This is achieved through a proportional time-scaling property of the analog neurons, which allows them to use only compact on-chip capacitors and train directly on the spatiotemporal data without special encoding by backpropagation through surrogate gradient, thus overcoming the speed, scalability and accuracy limitations of previous designs. We experimentally validated our hardware using the DVS128 Gesture dataset, accelerating each sample 50,000-fold to a 30 us duration. The system achieves an experimental accuracy of 93.06% with a measured energy efficiency of 101.05 TSOPS/W. We project significant future efficiency gains by leveraging picosecond-width spikes and advanced fabrication nodes. By decoupling the hardware's operational timescale from the data's natural timescale, this work establishes a viable pathway for developing neuromorphic processors capable of high-throughput analysis, critical for rapid-response edge computing applications like high-speed analysis of buffered sensor data or ultra-fast in-sensor machine vision.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Formalism and Analytical Optimization Criterion for Multiscale Geometric Design of Thermoelectric Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric (TE) generators can directly convert heat into electricity, but their performance is often constrained by limited temperature gradients. Here it is shown that width-modulated metamaterials with constrictions and expansions (constricted geometries) enhance temperature difference DT by reduced Transmissivity (Tr), a geometry-based parameter defined by the ratio of constriction to expansion cross-sections. A universal scaling behavior of transport and key TE efficiency metrics with Transmissivity is demonstrated, spanning from the nanoscale to the macroscale. Analytical formalism validated through finite element calculations for a range of modulation geometries reveals that DT, electrical and thermal resistances, efficiency, and power output are governed by a single scaling function, g(Tr), independent of carrier type, material, or operating conditions. This function represents the conductance of a constricted geometry relative to a uniform-width counterpart. The developed framework yields TE Performance Design Maps and an analytical criterion for optimal TE performance, with the maximum power density achieved at an optimal Transmissivity Tr_opt, determined by the condition that the functional g(Tr_opt) equals the Biot number, the dimensionless ratio hL/k of the convection coefficient h, the structure length L and the material thermal conductivity k. Transmissivity is established as a robust, multiscale design parameter - analogous to nature's hierarchical structures for optimized functionality. This work provides the theoretical framework for multiscale design and optimization of constricted geometries, thereby enabling systematic exploration of design strategies for next-generation TE modules based on advanced thermoelectric metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Fidelity-preserving enhancement of ptychography with foundational text-to-image models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ptychographic phase retrieval enables high-resolution imaging of complex samples but often suffers from artifacts such as grid pathology and multislice crosstalk, which degrade reconstructed images. We propose a plug-and-play (PnP) framework that integrates physics model-based phase retrieval with text-guided image editing using foundational diffusion models. By employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), our approach ensures consensus between data fidelity and artifact removal subproblems, maintaining physics consistency while enhancing image quality. Artifact removal is achieved using a text-guided diffusion image editing method (LEDITS++) with a pre-trained foundational diffusion model, allowing users to specify artifacts for removal in natural language. Demonstrations on simulated and experimental datasets show significant improvements in artifact suppression and structural fidelity, validated by metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and diffraction pattern consistency. This work highlights the combination of text-guided generative models and model-based phase retrieval algorithms as a transferable and fidelity-preserving method for high-quality diffraction imaging.</description>

      <title>Magnetorotational and convective instabilities in a thin layer of electrically conductive nanofluid under an external helical magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review summarizes recent advances in the theoretical analysis of the stability of magnetized flows in a non-uniformly rotating layer of electrically conductive nanofluid, incorporating the effects of Brownian diffusion and thermophoresis. In the absence of temperature gradients, different forms of magnetorotational instability (MRI): standard (SMRI), azimuthal (AMRI), and helical (HMRI) are investigated for nanofluid layers subjected to axial, azimuthal, and helical magnetic fields. The corresponding growth rates and instability regions are analyzed in relation to the rotation profile (quantified by the Rossby number $\textrm{Ro}$) and the radial wave number $k$. When temperature gradients and nanoparticle concentration effects are present, stationary convective modes in both axial and helical magnetic fields are examined under conditions of non-uniform rotation. Analytical expressions for the critical Rayleigh number $\textrm{Ra}_{st}$ are derived, and neutral stability curves are constructed as functions of the angular velocity profile, the azimuthal magnetic field inhomogeneity (magnetic Rossby number $\textrm{Rb}$), and the wave number $k$. The study identifies and discusses key mechanisms responsible for the stabilization or destabilization of stationary convection in axial and spiral magnetic field configurations, highlighting the role of nanoparticle-driven effects in modifying classical magnetoconvective behavior.</description>

      <title>High-pulse-energy integrated mode-locked lasers based on a Mamyshev oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast lasers have unlocked numerous advances across science and technology: they enable corneal surgery, reveal chemical reaction dynamics, and underpin optical atomic clocks. Over the past decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to developing photonic integrated circuit-based mode-locked lasers that are compact, scalable, and compatible with further on-chip functionalities. Yet, existing implementations fall short of pulse energies required for their subsequent uses in nonlinear applications. In this work, we demonstrate the first mode-locked laser that overcomes this limitation in low-loss erbium-doped silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits. The laser is based on the Mamyshev oscillator architecture, which employs alternating spectral filtering and self-phase modulation for mode-locking. It delivers a 176 MHz stream of pulses with nanojoule energy, comparable to fiber lasers and surpassing previous photonic integrated sources by more than two orders of magnitude. The output pulses exhibit excellent coherence, can be linearly compressed to 147 fs and directly drive a 1.5-octave-spanning supercontinuum in an integrated waveguide. Our work establishes a new generation of high-pulse-energy photonic integrated mode-locked lasers and paves the way for their widespread adoption.</description>

      <title>Laser-enhanced quantum sensing boosts sensitivity and dynamic range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetometers based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as the most important solid-state quantum sensors. However, ensembles are limited in optical contrast to typically a few percent and high-sensitivity variants usually possess only a few $\mathrm{\mu}$T dynamic range. Here, we demonstrate a laser threshold magnetometry-based NV system that avoids these limitations. By integrating the NV centers into a laser cavity and showing magnetic-field-dependent shifts of the laser threshold, we observe 100\,\% contrast with strong output signals up to 50\,mW. The resulting system exhibits a dynamic range of $\pm$280\,$\mathrm{\mu}$T with a photon-shot-noise-limited sensitivity of 670\,fT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, which we demonstrate to improve super-linearly with contrast. The ratio of these sensing-relevant parameters, that can be traded at the cost of each other, marks an improvement factor of 780 over typical fluorescence-based readout and vapor cell sensors. Such performance improvements open the door to new generations of sensors for applications including magnetoencephalography, magnetic navigation, and magnetic anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Embedding 1D BDI topological dynamics into continuous elastic plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents an approach that leverages the existing knowledge acquired in one-dimensional BDI class discrete metamaterials, such as mass-spring systems or acoustic resonators, and exploits it to realize fully continuous elastic two-dimensional topological waveguides. The design relies on the concept of evanescently coupled waveguides and defect resonances in order to reproduce the equivalent dynamics of prototypical BDI discrete systems, such as the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Starting with a continuous plate waveguide based on a periodic distribution of pillars, local resonators and waveguides are created by eliminating selected pillars and by exploiting the concept of point and line defects. The height of selected pillars is adjusted to tune the coupling strength between different resonators. The approach is validated by designing fully continuous elastic analogs of both the SSH chain and ladder systems. Numerical simulations and experimental results confirm the validity of the design by showing the emergence of topological edge modes at the interface of topologically distinct systems. In addition, the edge modes obtained in the elastic analog of the SSH ladder are shown to be Majorana-like modes.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of topological 3Q state in intercalated van der Waals antiferromagnet Cox-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets have opened a new avenue of opportunities encompassing various interesting phases. Co1/3TaS2-an intercalated metallic vdW antiferromagnet-is one of the latest additions to this growing list of materials due to its unique topologically nontrivial triple-Q (3Q) ground state. This 3Q tetrahedral structure, which critically depends on the Co content, yields the highest-density Skyrmion lattice with scalar spin chirality, resulting in a noticeable anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we demonstrate control of this topological phase via ionic gating. Using four CoxTaS2 devices with different Co compositions, we show that ionic gating can cover the entire 3Q topological phase and reveal the nature of the thermodynamically inaccessible phase space. Another striking finding in our data is the existence of an adiabatic discontinuity in the phase boundary between the 3Q and 1Q phases. Our work constitutes one of the first examples of electrical control of scalar spin chirality using an antiferromagnetic metal.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneously integrated lithium tantalate-on-silicon nitride modulators for high-speed communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by the prospects of higher bandwidths for optical interconnects, integrated modulators involving materials beyond those available in silicon manufacturing increasingly rely on the Pockels effect. For instance, wafer-scale bonding of lithium niobate films onto ultralow loss silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits provides heterogeneous integrated devices with low modulation voltages operating at higher speeds than silicon photonics. However, in spite of its excellent electro-optic modulation capabilities, lithium niobate suffers from drawbacks such as birefringence and long-term bias instability. Among other available electro-optic materials, lithium tantalate can overcome these shortcomings with its comparable electro-optic coefficient, significantly improved photostability, low birefringence, higher optical damage threshold, and enhanced DC bias stability. Here, we demonstrate wafer-scale heterogeneous integration of lithium tantalate films on low-loss silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits. With this hybrid platform, we implement modulators that combine the ultralow optical loss ($\sim$ 14.2 dB/m), mature processing and wide transparency of silicon nitride waveguides with the ultrafast electro-optic response of thin-film lithium tantalate. The resulting devices achieve a 6 V half-wave voltage, and support modulation bandwidths of up to 100 GHz. We use single intensity modulators and in-phase/quadrature (IQ) modulators to transmit PAM4 and 16-QAM signals reaching up to 333 and 581 Gbit/second net data rates, respectively. Our results demonstrate that lithium tantalate is a viable approach to broadband photonics sustaining extended optical propagation, which can uniquely contribute to technologies such as RF photonics, interconnects, and analog signal processors.</description>
