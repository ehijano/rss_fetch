      <title>Real-time Deformation Correction in Additively Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal phased arrays provide multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, which is typically limited by antenna aperture in rigid arrays. Silicon-based RF signal processing offers reliable, reconfigurable, multi-functional, and compact control for conformal phased arrays that can be used for on-the-move communication. While the lightweight, compactness, and shape-changing properties of the conformal phased arrays are attractive, these features result in dynamic deformation of the array during motion leading to significant dynamic beam pointing errors. We propose a silicon-based, compact, reconfigurable solution to self-correct these dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. Furthermore, additive printing is leveraged to enhance the flexibility of the conformal phased arrays, as the printed conductive ink is more flexible than bulk copper and can be easily deposited on flexible sheets using different printing tools, providing an environmentally-friendly solution for large-scale production. The inks such as conventional silver inks are expensive and copper-based printable inks suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. This work uses a low-cost molecular copper decomposition ink with reliable RF properties at different temperature and strain to print the proposed intelligent conformal phased array operating at 2.1 GHz. Proof-of-concept prototype $2\times2$ array self-corrects the deformation induces beampointing error with an error $&lt;1.25^\circ$. The silicon based array processing part occupying only 2.56 mm$^2$ area and 78.5 mW power per tile.</description>

      <title>GAPses: Versatile smart glasses for comfortable and fully-dry acquisition and parallel ultra-low-power processing of EEG and EOG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07903v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in head-mounted wearable technology are revolutionizing the field of biopotential measurement, but the integration of these technologies into practical, user-friendly devices remains challenging due to issues with design intrusiveness, comfort, and data privacy. To address these challenges, this paper presents GAPSES, a novel smart glasses platform designed for unobtrusive, comfortable, and secure acquisition and processing of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. We introduce a direct electrode-electronics interface with custom fully dry soft electrodes to enhance comfort for long wear. An integrated parallel ultra-low-power RISC-V processor (GAP9, Greenwaves Technologies) processes data at the edge, thereby eliminating the need for continuous data streaming through a wireless link, enhancing privacy, and increasing system reliability in adverse channel conditions. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the designed prototype through validation in a number of EEG-based interaction tasks, including alpha waves, steady-state visual evoked potential analysis, and motor movement classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate an EEG-based biometric subject recognition task, where we reach a sensitivity and specificity of 98.87% and 99.86% respectively, with only 8 EEG channels and an energy consumption per inference on the edge as low as 121 uJ. Moreover, in an EOG-based eye movement classification task, we reach an accuracy of 96.68% on 11 classes, resulting in an information transfer rate of 94.78 bit/min, which can be further increased to 161.43 bit/min by reducing the accuracy to 81.43%. The deployed implementation has an energy consumption of 24 uJ per inference and a total system power of only 16.28 mW, allowing for continuous operation of more than 12 h with a small 75 mAh battery.</description>

      <title>Compressive Beam Alignment for Indoor Millimeter-Wave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic nature of indoor environments poses unique challenges for next-generation millimeter-wave (mmwave) connectivity. These challenges arise from blockages due to mobile obstacles, mm-wave signal scattering caused by indoor surfaces, and imperfections in phased antenna arrays. Consequently, traditional compressed sensing (CS) techniques for beam alignment become ineffective in practice under such settings. This paper proposes a novel beam alignment technique suited for mm-wave systems operating in indoor environments. The proposed technique exploits the energy compaction property of the discrete cosine transform to compressively sense and identify the strongest cluster locations in the transform domain for robust beamforming. Experimental results at 60 GHz demonstrate successful beam alignment with limited measurements even in the presence of partial blockages during the beam training phase.</description>

      <title>Interference Analysis for Coexistence of UAVs and Civil Aircrafts Based on Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the advantages of high mobility and easy deployment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely applied in both military and civilian fields. In order to strengthen the flight surveillance of UAVs and guarantee the airspace safety, UAVs can be equipped with the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) system, which periodically sends flight information to other aircrafts and ground stations (GSs). However, due to the limited resource of channel capacity, UAVs equipped with ADS-B results in the interference between UAVs and civil aircrafts (CAs), which further impacts the accuracy of received information at GSs. In detail, the channel capacity is mainly affected by the density of aircrafts and the transmitting power of ADS-B. Hence, based on the three-dimensional poisson point process, this work leverages the stochastic geometry theory to build a model of the coexistence of UAVs and CAs and analyze the interference performance of ADS-B monitoring system. From simulation results, we reveal the effects of transmitting power, density, threshold and pathloss on the performance of the ADS-B monitoring system. Besides, we provide the suggested transmitting power and density for the safe coexistence of UAVs and CAs.</description>

      <title>CLDTA: Contrastive Learning based on Diagonal Transformer Autoencoder for Cross-Dataset EEG Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in non-invasive EEG technology have broadened its application in emotion recognition, yielding a multitude of related datasets. Yet, deep learning models struggle to generalize across these datasets due to variations in acquisition equipment and emotional stimulus materials. To address the pressing need for a universal model that fluidly accommodates diverse EEG dataset formats and bridges the gap between laboratory and real-world data, we introduce a novel deep learning framework: the Contrastive Learning based Diagonal Transformer Autoencoder (CLDTA), tailored for EEG-based emotion recognition. The CLDTA employs a diagonal masking strategy within its encoder to extracts full-channel EEG data's brain network knowledge, facilitating transferability to the datasets with fewer channels. And an information separation mechanism improves model interpretability by enabling straightforward visualization of brain networks. The CLDTA framework employs contrastive learning to distill subject-independent emotional representations and uses a calibration prediction process to enable rapid adaptation of the model to new subjects with minimal samples, achieving accurate emotion recognition. Our analysis across the SEED, SEED-IV, SEED-V, and DEAP datasets highlights CLDTA's consistent performance and proficiency in detecting both task-specific and general features of EEG signals related to emotions, underscoring its potential to revolutionize emotion recognition research.</description>

      <title>Bridging Simulation and Measurements through Ray-Launching Analysis: A Study in a Complex Urban Scenario Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid increase in mobile subscribers, there is a drive towards achieving higher data rates, prompting the use of higher frequencies in future wireless communication technologies. Wave propagation channel modeling for these frequencies must be considered in conjunction with measurement results. This paper presents a ray-launching (RL)-based simulation in a complex urban scenario characterized by an undulating terrain with a high density of trees. The simulation results tend to closely match the reported measurements when more details are considered. This underscores the benefits of using the RL method, which provides detailed space-time and angle-delay results.</description>

      <title>A Unified Pilot Design for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a unified pilot signal design in an orthogonal frequency division modulation (OFDM)-based integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system. The novel designed two-dimensional (2D) pilot signal is generated on the delay-Doppler (DD) plane for sensing, while its time-frequency (TF) plane transformation acts as the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) for the OFDM data. The well-designed pilot signal preserves orthogonality with the data in terms of resource occupancy in the TF plane and quasi-orthogonality in terms of codeword in the DD plane. Leveraging these nice properties, we are allowed to implement sensing detection in the DD plane using a simple 2D correlation, taking advantage of the favorable auto-correlation properties of the 2D pilot. In the communication part, the transformed pilot in the TF plane serves as a known DMRS for channel estimation and equalization. The 2D pilot design demonstrates good scalability and can adapt to different delay and Doppler resolution requirements without violating the OFDM data detection and can overcome the fractional Doppler with limited sensing resources. Experimental results show the effective sensing performance of the proposed pilot, with only a small fraction of power shared from the OFDM data,while maintaining satisfactory symbol detection performance in communication.</description>

      <title>Efficient Communication and Powering for Smart Contact Lens with Resonant Magneto-Quasistatic Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-coil wearable system is proposed for wireless communication and powering between a transmitter coil in a necklace and a receiver coil in a smart contact lens, where the necklace is invisible in contrast to coils embedded in wearables like spectacles or headbands. Magneto-quasistatic(MQS) field coupling facilitates communication between the transmitter in the necklace and the contact lens receiver, enabling AR/VR and health monitoring. As long as the receiver coil remains within the magnetic field generated by the transmitter, continuous communication is sustained through MQS field coupling despite the misalignments present. Resonant frequency tuning enhances system efficiency. The system's performance was tested for coil misalignments, showing a maximum path loss variation within $10 dB$ across scenarios, indicating robustness. Finite Element Method(FEM) analysis has been used to study the system for efficient wireless data transfer and powering. A communication channel capacity is $4.5 Mbps$ over a $1 MHz$ bandwidth. Simulations show negligible path loss differences with or without human tissues, as magnetic coupling remains unaffected at MQS frequencies below $30 MHz$ due to similar magnetic permeability of tissues and air. Therefore, the possibility of efficient communication and powering of smart contact lenses through a necklace is shown for the first time using resonant MQS coupling at an axial distance of $15cm$ and lateral distance of over $9cm$ to enable AR/VR and health monitoring on the contact lens.</description>

      <title>Sequential MAP Parametric OFDM Channel Estimation for Joint Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uplink sensing is still a relatively unexplored scenario in integrated sensing and communication which can be used to improve positioning and sensing estimates. We introduce a pilot-based maximum likelihood, and a maximum a posteriori parametric channel estimation procedure using an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform in uplink sensing. The algorithm is capable of estimating the multipath components of the channel, such as the angles of arrival, departure, path coefficient, and the delay and Doppler terms. As an advantage, when compared to other existing methods, the proposed procedure presents expressions for exact alternating coordinate updates, which can be further improved to achieve a competitive multipath channel estimation tool.</description>

      <title>Doppler-Robust Maximum Likelihood Parametric Channel Estimation for Multiuser MIMO-OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high directionality and intense Doppler effects of millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (subTHz) channels demand accurate localization of the users and a new paradigm of channel estimation. For orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms, estimating the geometric parameters of the radio channel can make these systems more Doppler-resistant and also enhance sensing and positioning performance. In this paper, we derive a multiuser, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), maximum likelihood, parametric channel estimation algorithm for uplink sensing, which is capable of accurately estimating the parameters of each multipath that composes each user's channel under severe Doppler shift conditions. The presented method is one of the only Doppler-robust currently available algorithms that does not rely on line search.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Energy-Saving Design for Double-Faced Active RIS Assisted Communications with Perfect/Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the emerging reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) paves a new way for next-generation wireless communications, it suffers from inherent flaws, i.e., double-fading attenuation effects and half-space coverage limitations. The state-of-the-art double-face active (DFA)-RIS architecture is proposed for significantly amplifying and transmitting incident signals in full-space. Despite the efficacy of DFA-RIS in mitigating the aforementioned flaws, its potential drawback is that the complex active hardware also incurs intolerable energy consumption. To overcome this drawback, in this paper we propose a novel dynamic energy-saving design for the DFA-RIS, called the sub-array based DFA-RIS architecture. This architecture divides the DFA-RIS into multiple sub-arrays, where the signal amplification function in each sub-array can be activated/deactivated dynamically and flexibly. Utilizing the above architecture, we develop the joint optimization scheme based on transmit beamforming, DFA-RIS configuration, and reflection amplifier (RA) operating pattern to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the DFA-RIS assisted multiuser MISO system considering the perfect/imperfect channel state information (CSI) case. Then, the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm and the constrained stochastic majorization-minimization (CSMM) based AO algorithm address non-convex problems in the perfect/imperfect CSI case, respectively. Simulation results verified that our proposed sub-array based DFA-RIS architecture can benefit the EE of the system more than other RIS architectures.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Safe Electromagnetic Radiation Emitted by 5G Active Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The careful planning and safe deployment of 5G technologies will bring enormous benefits to society and the economy. Higher frequency, beamforming, and small-cells are key technologies that will provide unmatched throughput and seamless connectivity to 5G users. Superficial knowledge of these technologies has raised concerns among the general public about the harmful effects of radiation. Several standardization bodies are active to put limits on the emissions which are based on a defined set of radiation measurement methodologies. However, due to the peculiarity of 5G such as dynamicity of the beams, network densification, Time Division Duplexing mode of operation, etc, using existing EMF measurement methods may provide inaccurate results. In this context, we discuss our experimental studies aimed towards the measurement of radiation caused by beam-based transmissions from a 5G base station equipped with an Active Antenna System(AAS). We elaborate on the shortcomings of current measurement methodologies and address several open questions. Next, we demonstrate that using user-specific downlink beamforming, not only better performance is achieved compared to non-beamformed downlink, but also the radiation in the vicinity of the intended user is significantly decreased. Further, we show that under weak reception conditions, an uplink transmission can cause significantly high radiation in the vicinity of the user equipment. We believe that our work will help in clearing several misleading concepts about the 5G EMF radiation effects. We conclude the work by providing guidelines to improve the methodology of EMF measurement by considering the spatiotemporal dynamicity of the 5G transmission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Multi-Modal Learning (FMML) is an emerging field that integrates information from different modalities in federated learning to improve the learning performance. In this letter, we develop a parameter scheduling scheme to improve personalized performance and communication efficiency in personalized FMML, considering the non-independent and nonidentically distributed (non-IID) data along with the modality heterogeneity. Specifically, a learning-based approach is utilized to obtain the aggregation coefficients for parameters of different modalities on distinct devices. Based on the aggregation coefficients and channel state, a subset of parameters is scheduled to be uploaded to a server for each modality. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the personalized performance of FMML.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and implementations onto FPGA device of an Expectation Propagation (EP)-based receiver for QPSK, 8-PSK, and 16-QAM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first for this kind of receiver. The receiver implements a Frequency Domain (FD) Self-Iterated Linear Equalizer (SILE), where EP is used to approximate the true posterior distribution of the transmitted symbols with a simpler distribution. Analytical approximations for the EP feedback generation process and the three constellations are applied to lessen the complexity of the soft mapper/demapper architectures. The simulation results demonstrate that the fixed-point version performs comparably to the floating-point. Moreover, implementation results show the efficiency in terms of FPGA resource usage of the proposed architecture.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Wideband Beam Training Based on Distance-Dependent Beam Split</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-field beam training is essential for acquiring channel state information in 6G extremely large-scale multiple input multiple output (XL-MIMO) systems. To achieve low-overhead beam training, existing method has been proposed to leverage the near-field beam split effect, which deploys true-time-delay arrays to simultaneously search multiple angles of the entire angular range in a distance ring with a single pilot. However, the method still requires exhaustive search in the distance domain, which limits its efficiency. To address the problem, we propose a distance-dependent beam-split-based beam training method to further reduce the training overheads. Specifically, we first reveal the new phenomenon of distance-dependent beam split, where by manipulating the configurations of time-delay and phase-shift, beams at different frequencies can simultaneously scan the angular domain in multiple distance rings. Leveraging the phenomenon, we propose a near-field beam training method where both different angles and distances can simultaneously be searched in one time slot. Thus, a few pilots are capable of covering the whole angle-distance space for wideband XL-MIMO. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are also displayed to verify the superiority of the proposed method on beamforming gain and training overhead.</description>

      <title>A Federated Online Restless Bandit Framework for Cooperative Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) have been widely utilized to address resource allocation problems with Markov reward processes (MRPs). Existing works often assume that the dynamics of MRPs are known prior, which makes the RMAB problem solvable from an optimization perspective. Nevertheless, an efficient learning-based solution for RMABs with unknown system dynamics remains an open problem. In this paper, we study the cooperative resource allocation problem with unknown system dynamics of MRPs. This problem can be modeled as a multi-agent online RMAB problem, where multiple agents collaboratively learn the system dynamics while maximizing their accumulated rewards. We devise a federated online RMAB framework to mitigate the communication overhead and data privacy issue by adopting the federated learning paradigm. Based on this framework, we put forth a Federated Thompson Sampling-enabled Whittle Index (FedTSWI) algorithm to solve this multi-agent online RMAB problem. The FedTSWI algorithm enjoys a high communication and computation efficiency, and a privacy guarantee. Moreover, we derive a regret upper bound for the FedTSWI algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on the case of online multi-user multi-channel access. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a fast convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T\log(T)})$ and better performance compared with baselines. More importantly, its sample complexity decreases with the number of agents.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Resource Allocation Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning for 5G-V2X HetNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes a semantic-aware resource allocation (SARA) framework with flexible duty cycle (DC) coexistence mechanism (SARADC) for 5G-V2X Heterogeneous Network (HetNets) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) proximal policy optimization (PPO). Specifically, we investigate V2X networks within a two-tiered HetNets structure. In response to the needs of high-speed vehicular networking in urban environments, we design a semantic communication system and introduce two resource allocation metrics: high-speed semantic transmission rate (HSR) and semantic spectrum efficiency (HSSE). Our main goal is to maximize HSSE. Additionally, we address the coexistence of vehicular users and WiFi users in 5G New Radio Unlicensed (NR-U) networks. To tackle this complex challenge, we propose a novel approach that jointly optimizes flexible DC coexistence mechanism and the allocation of resources and base stations (BSs). Unlike traditional bit transmission methods, our approach integrates the semantic communication paradigm into the communication system. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solution outperforms traditional bit transmission methods with traditional DC coexistence mechanism in terms of HSSE and semantic throughput (ST) for both vehicular and WiFi users.</description>

      <title>A Robust Pipeline for Classification and Detection of Bleeding Frames in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy using Swin Transformer and RT-DETR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the Auto WCEBleedGen Challenge V2 2024. Our solution combines the Swin Transformer for the initial classification of bleeding frames and RT-DETR for further detection of bleeding in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE), enhanced by a series of image preprocessing steps. These steps include converting images to Lab colour space, applying Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for better contrast, and using Gaussian blur to suppress artefacts. The Swin Transformer utilizes a tiered architecture with shifted windows to efficiently manage self-attention calculations, focusing on local windows while enabling cross-window interactions. RT-DETR features an efficient hybrid encoder for fast processing of multi-scale features and an uncertainty-minimal query selection for enhanced accuracy. The class activation maps by Ablation-CAM are plausible to the model's decisions. On the validation set, this approach achieves a classification accuracy of 98.5% (best among the other state-of-the-art models) compared to 91.7% without any pre-processing and an $\text{AP}_{50}$ of 66.7% compared to 65.0% with state-of-the-art YOLOv8. On the test set, this approach achieves a classification accuracy and F1 score of 87.0% and 89.0% respectively.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model(LLM) assisted End-to-End Network Health Management based on Multi-Scale Semanticization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network device and system health management is the foundation of modern network operations and maintenance. Traditional health management methods, relying on expert identification or simple rule-based algorithms, struggle to cope with the dynamic heterogeneous networks (DHNs) environment. Moreover, current state-of-the-art distributed anomaly detection methods, which utilize specific machine learning techniques, lack multi-scale adaptivity for heterogeneous device information, resulting in unsatisfactory diagnostic accuracy for DHNs. In this paper, we develop an LLM-assisted end-to-end intelligent network health management framework. The framework first proposes a Multi-Scale Semanticized Anomaly Detection Model (MSADM), incorporating semantic rule trees with an attention mechanism to address the multi-scale anomaly detection problem in DHNs. Secondly, a chain-of-thought-based large language model is embedded in downstream to adaptively analyze the fault detection results and produce an analysis report with detailed fault information and optimization strategies. Experimental results show that the accuracy of our proposed MSADM for heterogeneous network entity anomaly detection is as high as 91.31\%.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Joint Multi-User MISO Power Allocation and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of fifth generation (5G) wireless communication networks has led to an increased need for wireless resource management solutions that provide higher data rates, wide coverage, low latency, and power efficiency. Yet, many of existing traditional approaches remain non-practical due to computational limitations, and unrealistic presumptions of static network conditions and algorithm initialization dependencies. This creates an important gap between theoretical analysis and real-time processing of algorithms. To bridge this gap, deep learning based techniques offer promising solutions with their representational capabilities for universal function approximation. We propose a novel unsupervised deep learning based joint power allocation and beamforming design for multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system. The objective is to enhance the spectral efficiency by maximizing the sum-rate with the proposed joint design framework, NNBF-P while also offering computationally efficient solution in contrast to conventional approaches. We conduct experiments for diverse settings to compare the performance of NNBF-P with zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF), minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamforming, and NNBF, which is also our deep learning based beamforming design without joint power allocation scheme. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of NNBF-P compared to ZFBF, and MMSE while NNBF can have lower performances than MMSE and ZFBF in some experiment settings. It can also demonstrate the effectiveness of joint design framework with respect to NNBF.</description>

Abstract: Arrhythmia is just one of the many cardiovascular illnesses that have been extensively studied throughout the years. Using multi-lead ECG data, this research describes a deep learning (DL) pipeline technique based on convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms to detect cardiovascular lar arrhythmia in patients. The suggested model architecture has hidden layers with a residual block in addition to the input and output layers. In this study, the classification of the ECG signals into five main groups, namely: Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB), Atrial Premature Contraction (APC), Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC), and Normal Beat (N), are performed. Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, we assessed the suggested technique. The findings show that our suggested strategy classified 15,000 cases with a high accuracy of 98.2%</description>

      <title>MELEP: A Novel Predictive Measure of Transferability in Multi-Label ECG Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practical electrocardiography (ECG) interpretation, the scarcity of well-annotated data is a common challenge. Transfer learning techniques are valuable in such situations, yet the assessment of transferability has received limited attention. To tackle this issue, we introduce MELEP, which stands for Muti-label Expected Log of Empirical Predictions, a measure designed to estimate the effectiveness of knowledge transfer from a pre-trained model to a downstream multi-label ECG diagnosis task. MELEP is generic, working with new target data with different label sets, and computationally efficient, requiring only a single forward pass through the pre-trained model. To the best of our knowledge, MELEP is the first transferability metric specifically designed for multi-label ECG classification problems. Our experiments show that MELEP can predict the performance of pre-trained convolutional and recurrent deep neural networks, on small and imbalanced ECG data. Specifically, we observed strong correlation coefficients (with absolute values exceeding 0.6 in most cases) between MELEP and the actual average F1 scores of the fine-tuned models. Our work highlights the potential of MELEP to expedite the selection of suitable pre-trained models for ECG diagnosis tasks, saving time and effort that would otherwise be spent on fine-tuning these models.</description>

      <title>Co-learning-aided Multi-modal-deep-learning Framework of Passive DOA Estimators for a Heterogeneous Hybrid Massive MIMO Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to its excellent performance in rate and resolution, fully-digital (FD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna arrays has been widely applied in data transmission and direction of arrival (DOA) measurements, etc. But it confronts with two main challenges: high computational complexity and circuit cost. The two problems may be addressed well by hybrid analog-digital (HAD) structure. But there exists the problem of phase ambiguity for HAD, which leads to its low-efficiency or high-latency. Does exist there such a MIMO structure of owning low-cost, low-complexity and high time efficiency at the same time. To satisfy the three properties, a novel heterogeneous hybrid MIMO receiver structure of integrating FD and heterogeneous HAD ($\rm{H}^2$AD-FD) is proposed and corresponding multi-modal (MD)-learning framework is developed. The framework includes three major stages: 1) generate the candidate sets via root multiple signal classification (Root-MUSIC) or deep learning (DL); 2) infer the class of true solutions from candidate sets using machine learning (ML) methods; 3) fuse the two-part true solutions to achieve a better DOA estimation. The above process form two methods named MD-Root-MUSIC and MDDL. To improve DOA estimation accuracy and reduce the clustering complexity, a co-learning-aided MD framework is proposed to form two enhanced methods named CoMDDL and CoMD-RootMUSIC. Moreover, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the proposed $\rm{H}^2$AD-FD structure is also derived. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed four methods could approach the CRLB for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) &gt; 0 dB and the proposed CoMDDL and MDDL perform better than CoMD-RootMUSIC and MD-RootMUSIC, particularly in the extremely low SNR region.</description>

      <title>Interference Mitigation using Optimized Angle Diversity Receiver in LiFi Cellular Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.06025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-fidelity (LiFi) is an emerging technology for high-speed short-range mobile communications. Inter-cell interference (ICI) is an important issue that limits the system performance in an optical attocell network. Angle diversity receivers (ADRs) have been proposed to mitigate ICI. In this paper, the structure of pyramid receivers (PRs) and truncated pyramid receivers (TPRs) are studied. The coverage problems of PRs and TPRs are defined and investigated, and the lower bound of field of view (FOV) for each PD is given analytically. The impact of random device orientation and diffuse link signal propagation are taken into consideration. The performances of PRs and TPRs are compared and then optimized ADR structures are proposed. The performance comparison between the select best combining (SBC) and maximum ratio combining (MRC) is given under different noise levels. It is shown that SBC will outperform MRC in an interference limited system, otherwise, MRC is a preferred scheme. In addition, the double source system, where each LiFi AP consists of two sources transmitting the same information signals but with opposite polarity, is proved to outperform the single source (SS) system under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Graph Laplacian Learning with Exponential Family Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) is a prominent framework for analyzing signals on non-Euclidean domains. The graph Fourier transform (GFT) uses the combinatorial graph Laplacian matrix to reveal the spectral decomposition of signals in the graph frequency domain. However, a common challenge in applying GSP methods is that in many scenarios the underlying graph of a system is unknown. A solution in such cases is to construct the unobserved graph from available data, which is commonly referred to as graph or network inference. Although different graph inference methods exist, these are restricted to learning from either smooth graph signals or simple additive Gaussian noise. Other types of noisy data, such as discrete counts or binary digits, are rather common in real-world applications, yet are underexplored in graph inference. In this paper, we propose a versatile graph inference framework for learning from graph signals corrupted by exponential family noise. Our framework generalizes previous methods from continuous smooth graph signals to various data types. We propose an alternating algorithm that jointly estimates the graph Laplacian and the unobserved smooth representation from the noisy signals. We also extend our approach to a variational form to account for the inherent stochasticity of the latent smooth representation. Finally, since real-world graph signals are frequently non-independent and temporally correlated, we further adapt our original setting to a time-vertex formulation. We demonstrate on synthetic and real-world data that our new algorithms outperform competing Laplacian estimation methods that suffer from noise model mismatch.</description>

      <title>Improved Energy-Based Signal Detection for Ambient Backscatter Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) systems, passive tags connect to a reader by reflecting an ambient radio frequency (RF) signal. However, the reader may not know the channel states and RF source parameters. The traditional energy detector (TED) appears to be an ideal solution. However, it performs poorly under these conditions. To address this, we propose two new detectors: (1) A joint correlation-energy detector (JCED) based on the first-order correlation of the received samples and (2) An improved energy detector (IED) based on the p-th norm of the received signal vector. We compare the performance of IED and TED under the generalized noise model using McLeish distribution and derive a general analytical formula for the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Based on our results, both detectors outperform TED. For example, the probability of detection with a false alarm rate of 1\% for JCED and IED is 22.97\% and 5.41\% higher, respectively, compared to TED for a single-antenna reader. Using the direct interference cancellation (DIC) technique, these gains are 34.92\% and 3.7\%, respectively. With a four-antenna array at the reader and a 5\% false alarm rate, the JCED shows a significant BER improvement of 28.68\% without DIC and 48.21\% with DIC.</description>

Abstract: Traditional social learning frameworks consider environments with a homogeneous state, where each agent receives observations conditioned on that true state of nature. In this work, we relax this assumption and study the distributed hypothesis testing problem in a heterogeneous environment, where each agent can receive observations conditioned on their own personalized state of nature (or truth). We particularly focus on community structured networks, where each community admits their own true hypothesis. This scenario is common in various contexts, such as when sensors are spatially distributed, or when individuals in a social network have differing views or opinions. We show that the adaptive social learning strategy is a preferred choice for nonstationary environments, and allows each cluster to discover its own truth.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Superposition Coded Modulation for Hierarchical Semantic Communications over Broadcast Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider multi-user semantic communications over broadcast channels. While most existing works consider that each receiver requires either the same or independent semantic information, this paper explores the scenario where the semantic information desired by different receivers is different but correlated. In particular, we investigate semantic communications over Gaussian broadcast channels where the transmitter has a common observable source but the receivers wish to recover hierarchical semantic information in adaptation to their channel conditions. Inspired by the capacity achieving property of superposition codes, we propose a deep learning based superposition coded modulation (DeepSCM) scheme. Specifically, the hierarchical semantic information is first extracted and encoded into basic and enhanced feature vectors. A linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) decorrelator is then developed to obtain a refinement from the enhanced features that is uncorrelated with the basic features. Finally, the basic features and their refinement are superposed for broadcasting after probabilistic modulation. Experiments are conducted for two-receiver image semantic broadcasting with coarse and fine classification as hierarchical semantic tasks. DeepSCM outperforms the benchmarking coded-modulation scheme without a superposition structure, especially with large channel disparity and high order modulation. It also approaches the performance upperbound as if there were only one receiver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design of a time-division multiplexed capacitively-coupled chopper analog front-end (AFE) with a novel impedance boost loop (IBL) and a novel DC servo loop (DSL). The proposed IBL has two impedance booting loops for compensating leakage current due to parasitic capacitance from the ESD pad and external interconnections, and the chopper. By shifting the compensation node from the feedback pathway to the amplifier's inputs, this work realizes a higher-resolution compensation, boosting the input impedance of the AFE to several tens of G{\Omega}. The proposed DSL consists of a coarse DSL driven by DC supply voltages and a fine DSL driven by five phase-interleaving pulse-width modulated waveforms (PI-PWM). Avoiding the usage of delta-sigma CDAC, the energy efficiency is better than conventional DSLs. Designed in a 0.18-{\mu}m CMOS process, the AFE consumes 4.5 {\mu}A from a 1.2-V supply. The simulated input referred noise is 0.27 {\mu}Vrms from 0.5 to 100 Hz in the presence of a 384-mV EDO. With a 10-pF parasitic capacitance, the proposed AFE achieves an input impedance of more than 74.5 G{\Omega} at 1 Hz and 6.4 G{\Omega} at 50 Hz. The simulation results have been robust under 100 Monte-Carlo samples.</description>

Abstract: Non-Bayesian social learning is a framework for distributed hypothesis testing aimed at learning the true state of the environment. Traditionally, the agents are assumed to receive observations conditioned on the same true state, although it is also possible to examine the case of heterogeneous models across the graph. One important special case is when heterogeneity is caused by the presence of malicious agents whose goal is to move the agents toward a wrong hypothesis. In this work, we propose an algorithm that allows to discover the true state of every individual agent based on the sequence of their beliefs. In so doing, the methodology is also able to locate malicious behavior.</description>

      <title>Provably Robust Score-Based Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Plug-and-Play Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a great number of tasks in science and engineering, the goal is to infer an unknown image from a small number of measurements collected from a known forward model describing certain sensing or imaging modality. Due to resource constraints, this task is often extremely ill-posed, which necessitates the adoption of expressive prior information to regularize the solution space. Score-based diffusion models, due to its impressive empirical success, have emerged as an appealing candidate of an expressive prior in image reconstruction. In order to accommodate diverse tasks at once, it is of great interest to develop efficient, consistent and robust algorithms that incorporate unconditional score functions of an image prior distribution in conjunction with flexible choices of forward models.
  This work develops an algorithmic framework for employing score-based diffusion models as an expressive data prior in general nonlinear inverse problems. Motivated by the plug-and-play framework in the imaging community, we introduce a diffusion plug-and-play method (DPnP) that alternatively calls two samplers, a proximal consistency sampler based solely on the likelihood function of the forward model, and a denoising diffusion sampler based solely on the score functions of the image prior. The key insight is that denoising under white Gaussian noise can be solved rigorously via both stochastic (i.e., DDPM-type) and deterministic (i.e., DDIM-type) samplers using the unconditional score functions. We establish both asymptotic and non-asymptotic performance guarantees of DPnP, and provide numerical experiments to illustrate its promise in solving both linear and nonlinear image reconstruction tasks. To the best of our knowledge, DPnP is the first provably-robust posterior sampling method for nonlinear inverse problems using unconditional diffusion priors.</description>

      <title>Regime Learning for Differentiable Particle Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentiable particle filters are an emerging class of models that combine sequential Monte Carlo techniques with the flexibility of neural networks to perform state space inference. This paper concerns the case where the system may switch between a finite set of state-space models, i.e. regimes. No prior approaches effectively learn both the individual regimes and the switching process simultaneously. In this paper, we propose the neural network based regime learning differentiable particle filter (RLPF) to address this problem. We further design a training procedure for the RLPF and other related algorithms. We demonstrate competitive performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art algorithms on a pair of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Approximation properties relative to continuous scale space for hybrid discretizations of Gaussian derivative operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of properties of two hybrid discretization methods for Gaussian derivatives, based on convolutions with either the normalized sampled Gaussian kernel or the integrated Gaussian kernel followed by central differences. The motivation for studying these discretization methods is that in situations when multiple spatial derivatives of different order are needed at the same scale level, they can be computed significantly more efficiently compared to more direct derivative approximations based on explicit convolutions with either sampled Gaussian kernels or integrated Gaussian kernels.
  While these computational benefits do also hold for the genuinely discrete approach for computing discrete analogues of Gaussian derivatives, based on convolution with the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel followed by central differences, the underlying mathematical primitives for the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, in terms of modified Bessel functions of integer order, may not be available in certain frameworks for image processing, such as when performing deep learning based on scale-parameterized filters in terms of Gaussian derivatives, with learning of the scale levels.
  In this paper, we present a characterization of the properties of these hybrid discretization methods, in terms of quantitative performance measures concerning the amount of spatial smoothing that they imply, as well as the relative consistency of scale estimates obtained from scale-invariant feature detectors with automatic scale selection, with an emphasis on the behaviour for very small values of the scale parameter, which may differ significantly from corresponding results obtained from the fully continuous scale-space theory, as well as between different types of discretization methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal sensing policy with interference-model uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assume that an interferer behaves according to a parametric model but one does not know the value of the model parameters. Sensing enables to improve the model knowledge and therefore perform a better link adaptation. However, we consider a half-duplex scenario where, at each time slot, the communication system should decide between sensing and communication. We thus propose to investigate the optimal policy to maximize the expected sum rate given a finite-time communication. % the following question therefore arises: At a given time slot, should one sense or communicate? We first show that this problem can be modelled in the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. We then demonstrate that the optimal open-loop and closed-loop policies can be found significantly faster than the standard backward-induction algorithm.</description>
