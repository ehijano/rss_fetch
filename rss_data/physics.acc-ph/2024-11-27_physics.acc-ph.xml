      <title>Longitudinal tapering in meter-scale gas jets for increased efficiency of laser plasma accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern laser plasma accelerators (LPAs) often require meter-scale plasma waveguides to propagate a high-intensity drive laser pulse. Tapering the longitudinal gas density profile in meter-scale gas jets could allow for single stage laser plasma acceleration well beyond 10 GeV with current petawatt-class laser systems. Via simulation and interferometry measurements, we show density control by longitudinally adjusting the throat width and jet angle. Density profiles appropriate for tapering were calculated analytically and via particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, and were matched experimentally. These simulations show that tapering can increase electron beam energy using 19 J laser energy from $\sim$9 GeV to $&gt;$12 GeV in a 30 cm plasma, and the accelerated charge by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Cold Test Results of Pre-Production PIP-II SSR2 Cavities with High-Power Couplers in the Fermilab Spoke Test Cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the PIP-II project at Fermilab, a pre-production cryomodule featuring 325 MHz Single Spoke Resonator type 2 (SSR2) superconducting RF cavities is under construction. These SSR2 cavities are fabricated by industry partners and undergo initial cold testing at our collaborating institution, IJCLab in France, utilizing low-power coupler. Subsequently, the cavities are subjected to final qualification at Fermilab, complete with tuner and high-power coupler assemblies. This paper provides an overview of the ongoing efforts dedicated to high-power testing of jacketed SSR2 cavities in the Spoke Test Cryostat (STC) at Fermilab. Performance parameters obtained from these tests are presented, offering valuable insights into the cavities operational characteristics and readiness for integration into the PIP-II cryomodule.</description>

      <title>Virtual Pulse Reconstruction Diagnostic for Single-Shot Measurement of Free Electron Laser Radiation Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of radiation pulse profiles is crucial for optimizing beam quality and enhancing experimental outcomes in Free Electron Laser (FEL) research. In this paper, we present a novel approach that employs machine learning techniques for real-time virtual diagnostics of FEL radiation pulses. Our advanced artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic tool utilizes longitudinal phase space data obtained from the X-band transverse deflecting structure to reconstruct the temporal profile of FEL pulses in real time. Unlike traditional single-shot methods, this AI-driven solution provides a non-invasive, highly efficient alternative for pulse characterization. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models, our method facilitates precise single-shot measurements of FEL pulse power, offering significant advantages for FEL science research. This work outlines the conceptual framework, methodology, and validation results of our virtual diagnostic tool, demonstrating its potential to significantly impact FEL research.</description>

      <title>All-optical compact setup for generation of collimated multi-MeV proton beams with a "snail" target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work considers an optical scheme for collimation of high-energy proton beams using $\sim 10^5$ T scale magnetic fields induced in a miniature "snail" target by petawatt or multi-petawatt laser irradiation in ps or fs regime. Such magnetic fields are known to be frozen into hot plasma and exist on at least a hundred of picoseconds time-scale, allowing their use for control of charged particle beams. The high values of the magnetic field along with the compact size perfectly match conditions for an all-in-one optical setup, where first, the laser beam accelerates protons, by, e.g. Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) mechanism, and second, the closely positioned snail target is driven to guide the proton beam. An important issue is that the laser drivers for both proton acceleration schemes and the magnetic field generation in the considered targets may have the same properties, and even be parts of one splitted beam. Numerical simulations show that the considered setup can be used for efficient collimation of $\simeq 100$ MeV protons. The collimation effect weakly depends on the fine magnetic field structure and can be observed both for a simple magneto-dipole field profile and for a more complex coaxial-like profiles accounting for the intricate structure of electric currents in the interaction region. The obtained results are interesting for the development of intense laser-driven sources of charged particle beams with low divergence and high energy of accelerated particles.</description>
