      <title>Cryptocurrencies and Interest Rates: Inferring Yield Curves in a Bondless Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traditional financial markets, yield curves are widely available for countries (and, by extension, currencies), financial institutions, and large corporates. These curves are used to calibrate stochastic interest rate models, discount future cash flows, and price financial products. Yield curves, however, can be readily computed only because of the current size and structure of bond markets. In cryptocurrency markets, where fixed-rate lending and bonds are almost nonexistent as of early 2025, the yield curve associated with each currency must be estimated by other means. In this paper, we show how mathematical tools can be used to construct yield curves for cryptocurrencies by leveraging data from the highly developed markets for cryptocurrency derivatives.</description>

      <title>Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including \textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations), where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB, can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.</description>
