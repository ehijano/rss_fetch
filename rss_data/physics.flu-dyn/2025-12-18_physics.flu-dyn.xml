      <title>The spatial organization of wind turbine wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind turbine wakes play a central role in determining wind farm performance, yet their spatial organization remains only partially understood. Here, we apply a spatially localized multifractal analysis to quantify the strength of dependencies (local roughness) and extreme velocity fluctuations (local intermittency) in turbine wakes, and relate these properties to established metrics in wind energy research. Using two-dimensional nacelle-mounted LiDAR plan-position-indicator scans, we extract scale-invariant features that enable systematic comparisons across the wake without requiring time-resolved data. Designed to robustly handle irregular sampling, our analysis yields four main findings: i.) Four distinct wake zones are identified, each exhibiting unique patterns of roughness and intermittency. ii.) Coherent, strongly correlated patches emerge 2 to 5 rotor diameters D downstream, with intermittency strengthening periodically at multiple D positions and along the wake-free-flow interface. iii.) The classical "intermittency ring" is consequently redefined as a set of localized "intermittency bubbles", iv.) which interact dynamically with the ambient atmosphere through an inverse energy cascade, transferring energy from small to large scales. These findings, supported by concurrent cup anemometer observations under free-inflow conditions, demonstrate that local multifractal analysis provides a robust and cost-effective diagnostic framework for wake characterization and wake-model validation, with direct relevance for wind-farm design and control.</description>

      <title>Scaling law for the slow flow of an unstable mechanical system coupled to a nonlinear energy sink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper one first shows that the slow flow of a mechanical system with one unstable mode coupled to a Nonlinear Energy Sink (NES) can be reduced, in the neighborhood of a fold point of its critical manifold, to a normal form of the dynamic saddle-node bifurcation. This allows us to then obtain a scaling law for the slow flow dynamics and to improve the accuracy of the theoretical prediction of the mitigation limit of the NES previously obtained as part of a zeroth-order approximation. For that purpose, the governing equations of the coupled system are first simplified using a reduced-order model for the primary structure by keeping only its unstable modal coordinates. The slow flow is then derived by means of the complexification-averaging method and, by the presence of a small perturbation parameter related to the mass ratio between the NES and the primary structure, it appears as a fast-slow system. The center manifold theorem is finally used to obtain the reduced form of the slow flow which is solved analytically leading to the scaling law. The latter reveals a nontrivial dependence with respect to the small perturbation parameter of the slow flow dynamics near the fold point, involving the fractional exponents 1/3 and 2/3. Finally, a new theoretical prediction of the mitigation limit is deduced from the scaling law. In the end, the proposed methodology is exemplified and validated numerically using an aeroelastic aircraft wing model coupled to one NES.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Subgrid-Scale Model Based on Liutex Theory for Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling remains a major challenge in large eddy simulation (LES), particularly for wall-bounded turbulent flows with strong near-wall anisotropy. This study proposes a novel SGS model based on Liutex theory, featuring a dynamically adaptive model coefficient and a physics-based length-scale formulation. The magnitude of the Liutex vector is employed as the characteristic velocity scale, enabling a direct and objective quantification of local vortical intensity. The length scale is determined from local flow properties and reflects the physical nature of turbulent diffusion, which occurs predominantly in directions perpendicular to the rotation axis. The dynamic model coefficient adapts locally to variations in vortical structures and naturally vanishes at the wall. Importantly, this coefficient is free of empirical tuning, as it is derived rigorously from the triple decomposition. The model is validated through LES of turbulent channel flow at the friction Reynolds number of 544. Results show improved predictions of both normal and shear Reynolds stresses, particularly in near-wall regions, compared with other SGS models. The proposed model demonstrates competitive computational efficiency, with only a 4.21% overhead.</description>

      <title>AI-Accelerated Operator Learning Framework for Rarefied Microflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high computational cost of kinetic solvers such as DSMC remains a major challenge in rarefied flow simulations. This work presents a unified framework combining deep neural networks and neural operators to accelerate kinetic and hybrid solvers while preserving physical fidelity. GPU-native DNN surrogates eliminate costly moment-closure operations in Fokker Planck methods, achieving significant speedups without accuracy loss, while physics-guided and shock-aware DeepONet architectures enable accurate, data efficient modeling of multi regime micro nozzle, micro-step, and hypersonic flows. Extensions including ensemble uncertainty quantification and family-of-experts strategies further enhance robustness across wide Mach and Knudsen number ranges. Together, these results demonstrate a scalable and physics-consistent pathway toward real-time surrogate modeling in rarefied gas dynamics.</description>

      <title>Estimates for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations: the effects of forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical estimates for the Navier-Stokes equations are traditionally expressed in terms of the Grashof number, which is a dimensionless measure of the magnitude of the forcing and hence a control parameter of the system. However, experimental measurements and statistical theories of turbulence are based on the Reynolds number. Thus, a meaningful comparison between mathematical and physical results requires a conversion of the mathematical estimates to a Reynolds-dependent form. In two dimensions, this was achieved under the assumption that the second derivative of the forcing is square integrable. Nonetheless, numerical simulations have shown that the phenomenology of turbulence is sensitive to the degree of regularity of the forcing. Therefore, we extend the available estimates for the energy and enstrophy dissipation rates as well as the attractor dimension to forcings in the Sobolev space of order $s$; i.e. forcings whose Fourier coefficients decay with the wavenumber $k$ faster than $k^{-s-1}$. We consider the range $-1\leqslant s\leqslant 2$, where $s=2$ corresponds to the known estimates, and $s=-1$ is the smallest value of $s$ for which weak solutions are known to exist. The main result is the existence of three distinct regimes as a function of the regularity of the forcing.</description>

      <title>The study of coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering in multiple flow regimes using unified gas-kinetic scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering (CRBS) holds great promise for the characterization of gas properties and the investigation of gas kinetic processes. The CRBS spectrum exhibits a strong dependence on the Knudsen number (Kn), revealing its inherently multiscale nature. In the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), collisions are intrinsically coupled with free transport during flux construction, endowing the method with distinct multiscale capabilities. Specifically, the UGKS reduces to a Boltzmann solver when the relaxation time is greater than or equal to the time step, and to the gas-kinetic scheme (GKS)-a Navier-Stokes solver-when the relaxation time is much smaller than the time step, thereby accommodating flow regimes without constraints on the molecular mean free path or collision time. In this study, the UGKS is extended to simulate CRBS phenomena, with the governing equation formulated based on the BGK-Shakhov model. Detailed derivations are provided. To account for the additional perturbation source term, a second-order accurate numerical algorithm is developed using the Strang splitting method within the UGKS framework. The proposed model is validated against argon CRBS experiments, demonstrating excellent agreement. Building on this validated framework, the impact of incident signal intensity on CRBS spectra across a range of Knudsen numbers is systematically examined, accompanied by an in-depth analysis of the underlying physical mechanisms. This work broadens the applicability of CFD-based CRBS simulations and provides a reliable numerical foundation for exploring high-intensity, multiscale gas-kinetic phenomena in future research.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal analysis of sprays by using Phase Doppler Anemometry data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spray characterization often relies on empirical formulas, statistical distributions, and derived quantities. Deterministic spray behavior originates from physics-governed mechanisms of atomization, \emph{e.g.}, nozzle geometry, boundary conditions, and hydrodynamic instabilities. Due to the stochastic nature of the atomization process, which originates from turbulence, chaotic perturbations, and droplet--droplet interactions, the temporal characteristics of dynamic behavior are seldom investigated. The combination of these processes leads to droplet clustering, which is a spatio-temporal behavior that is the focus of the current paper for an airblast atomizer. The measurement data by Phase Doppler Anemometry include droplet size, velocity, and arrival time. Firstly, the theoretical and experimental interparticle time distributions are compared using a $\chi^2$ hypothesis test, which concluded multimodality. Secondly, \emph{k}-means clustering is applied to determine droplet clusters, whose number was determined by gap statistics. The above analysis was performed using an extensive database of various measurement positions, atomizing pressures, liquid preheating temperatures, and liquid types. It was found that cluster formation affects approximately 30\% of the droplets in a single data set. In conclusion, the unsteadiness in the central region is caused by clustering, while it is caused by mixing and droplet entrainment in the spray periphery. The centroids and the number of cluster values depend on the atomizing pressure and the spray position, and are independent of the liquid temperature. The dynamical behavior of the clusters is compared by their droplet size and velocity distributions, showing no significant difference, suggesting that unsteady spray modeling is necessary if temporal characteristics are critical.</description>

      <title>On bifurcations and traction forces on an obstacle in incompressible flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic numerical investigation of bifurcations in the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes flow past a confined circular cylinder. The results indicate that there is a qualitative correspondence between changes in the traction profiles of the steady Navier-Stokes equations and bifurcations of the long-time behavior of the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations. The bifurcations include the appearance of symmetry breaking, oscillations, and multiple steady solutions. The well-known planar Sch\"afer-Turek benchmark is considered with Reynolds numbers up to 1000. For the analysis of bifurcations and traction profiles, several numerical strategies are applied, including a duality method for computing traction profiles, deflation methods, and linear stability analysis. Long-time flow behavior is often explored through direct numerical simulation of the unsteady equations; an approach that is computationally demanding. The relations presented here indicate the possibility of a computationally inexpensive strategy to detect critical Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Latent-space variational data assimilation in two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from limited measurements of a turbulent flow, data assimilation (DA) attempts to estimate all the spatio-temporal scales of motion. Success is dependent on whether the system is observable from the measurements, or how much of the initial turbulent field is encoded in the available measurements. Adjoint-variational DA minimises the discrepancy between the true and estimated measurements by optimising the initial velocity or vorticity field (the `state space'). Here we propose to instead optimise in a lower-dimensional latent space which is learned by implicit rank minimising autoencoders. Assimilating in latent space, rather than state space, redefines the observability of the measurements and identifies the physically meaningful perturbation directions which matter most for accurate prediction of the flow evolution. When observing coarse-grained measurements of two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow at moderate Reynolds numbers, the proposed latent-space DA approach estimates the full turbulent state with a relative error improvement of two orders of magnitude over the standard state-space DA approach. The small scales of the estimated turbulent field are predicted more faithfully with latent-space DA, greatly reducing erroneous small-scale velocities typically introduced by state-space DA. These findings demonstrate that the observability of the system from available data can be greatly improved when turbulent measurements are assimilated in the right space, or coordinates.</description>

      <title>Mixing induced by Faraday surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how surface waves enhance mixing across the interface between two miscible fluids with a small density contrast. Imposing a vertical, time-periodic acceleration, we excite Faraday waves both experimentally and numerically. In systems with a shallow density gradient, these standing waves advect the interface and can trigger secondary instabilities. When driven beyond the linear regime, large Faraday crests collapse to form cavities, injecting bubbles and lighter fluid deep into the heavier layer. Together, these mechanisms gradually homogenize the upper layer, diminish the interfacial density jump, and drive the interface downward until it decouples from surface forcing. We report a non-monotonic mixing rate -- first increasing as the interfacial energy barrier lowers, then decreasing as less energy is injected into the weakened surface -- revealing a balance between barrier reduction and energy input. Based on these observations, we introduce a one-dimensional model incorporating a turbulent diffusivity coefficient that depends on depth and the internal Richardson number, which captures the qualitative evolution of the system.</description>

      <title>A reduced model for droplet dynamics with interfacial viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the phenomenological Maffettone-Minale (MM) model (P.L. Maffettone and M. Minale, J. Non-Newton. Fluid Mech. 78, 227-241 (1998)) to describe the time-dependent deformation of a droplet with interfacial viscosity in a shear flow. The droplet, characterised by surface tension $\sigma$, is spherical at rest with radius $R$ and deforms into an ellipsoidal shape under a shear flow of rate $G$, described by a symmetric second-order morphological tensor $\boldsymbol{S}$. In addition to surface tension, the extended MM (EMM) model incorporates interfacial shear and dilatational viscosities, $\mu_s$ and $\mu_d$, through the corresponding Boussinesq numbers $\mbox{Bq}_s=\mu_s/\mu R$ and $\mbox{Bq}_d=\mu_d/\mu R$, where $\mu$ is the bulk viscosity. A central goal of this work is to quantify the parameter range over which the EMM model provides a realistic description of droplet deformation, as a function of the capillary number Ca$=\mu R G/\sigma$ and the Boussinesq numbers. To this end, model predictions are systematically compared with fully resolved numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Wake instability past a sphere settling in a strongly stratified flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wake of a body moving across the isopycnals of a strongly stratified fluid is characterized by the presence of an intense jet which, under certain circumstances, may become unstable. To get insight into the phenomenology of this instability and the underlying mechanisms, we conduct fully-resolved three-dimensional time-dependent simulations of the flow past a rigid sphere settling steadily through a linearly stratified fluid over a wide range of flow parameters which include the case of salt-stratified water. Results reveal a rich dynamics characterized by distinct wake symmetries, vortical structures and transverse force signatures. Simulations evidence the existence of varicose and sinuous instability modes that arise from distinct physical mechanisms. Thanks to several metrics, we build a phase map delineating the bounds of each instability regime as a function of the three control parameters of the problem, namely the Froude, Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. We show that the instability mechanism results from a subtle interplay between baroclinic vorticity generation, vortex tilting and radial transport of the mean density gradient within the jet.</description>

      <title>On a mathematical definition of laminar and turbulent fluid flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As stated in the title, the present research proposes a mathematical definition of laminar and turbulent flows, i.e., a definition that may be used to conceive and prove mathematical theorems about such flows. The definition is based on an experimental truth long known to humans: Whenever one repeats a given flow, the results will not be the same if the flow is turbulent. Turbulent flows are not strictly repeatable. From this basic fact follows a more elaborate truth about turbulent flows: The mean flow obtained by averaging the results of a large number of repetitions is not a natural flow, that is, it is a flow that cannot occur naturally in any experiment. The proposed definition requires some preliminary mathematical notions, which are also introduced in the text: Proximity between functions, the ensemble of realisations, the method of averaging the flows, and the distinct properties of realisations (physical flows) and averages (mean flows). The notion of restricted nonlinearity is introduced and it is demonstrated that laminar flows can only exist in conditions of restricted nonlinearity, whereas turbulent flows are a consequence of general nonlinearity. The particular case of steady-state turbulent flow is studied, and an uncertainty is raised about the equality of ensemble average and time average. Two solved examples are also offered to illustrate the meaning and methods implied by the definitions: The von K\`arm\`an vortex street and a laminar flow with imposed white-noise perturbation.</description>

      <title>Plane-layer Rayleigh-B\'enard convection up to $Ra=10^{11}$: Near-wall fluctuations and role of initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection through direct numerical simulations in a three-dimensional plane layer of aspect ratio 4 for Rayleigh numbers $10^5 \leq Ra \leq 10^{11}$ and Prandtl number $Pr=0.7$. We summarize the height-dependent statistics of velocity and temperature fluctuations and corresponding scalings with the Rayleigh number. We include an analysis on the role of coherent and incoherent flow regions near the wall for global heat transfer. Furthermore, we investigate the dependence of turbulent transport on a finite-amplitude sinusoidal shear flow added at time $t=0$, which either freely decays in a long transient or remains existent when a steady sinusoidal volume forcing is added. In the latter case, weak logarithmic near-wall layers are formed, however, with von K\'arm\'an and offset constants that differ from standard values. The typical magnitude of both coefficients, and thus a full turbulent boundary layer of velocity and temperature, is re-established only for a switch from sinusoidal to constant pressure gradient driving of the flow. In all cases, except for the constant pressure gradient-driven flow, no enhancement of global turbulent heat and momentum transfer within error bars is detected, even though the sinusoidal amplitude is of the order of the characteristic free-fall velocity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study flows generated within a two-dimensional corner by the chemical activity of the confining boundaries. Catalytic reactions at the surfaces induce diffusioosmotic motion of the viscous fluid throughout the domain. The presence of chemically active sectors can give rise to steady eddies reminiscent of classical Moffatt vortices, which are mechanically induced in similar confined geometries. In our approach, an exact analytical solution of the diffusion problem in a wedge geometry is derived and coupled to the diffusioosmotic slip-velocity formulation, yielding the stream function of associated Stokes flow. In selected limiting cases, simple closed-form expressions provide clear physical insight into the underlying mechanisms. Our results open new perspectives for the design of microscale mixing strategies in dead-end pores and cornered microfluidic channels, and offer benchmarks for numerical simulations of confined (diffusio)osmotic systems.</description>

      <title>Influence of dissolved gas concentration on the lifetime of surface bubbles in volatile liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09436v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bubbles at the air-liquid interface are important for many natural and industrial processes. Factors influencing the lifetime of such surface bubbles have been investigated extensively, yet the impact of dissolved gas concentration remains unexplored. Here we investigate how the lifetime of surface bubbles in volatile liquids depends on the dissolved gas concentration. The bubble lifetime is found to decrease with the dissolved gas concentration. Larger microbubbles at increased gas concentration are found to trigger bubble bursting at earlier times. Combined with the thinning rate of the bubble cap thickness, a scaling law of the bubble lifetime is developed. Our findings may provide new insight on bubble and foam stability.</description>

      <title>Cross-Model Verification of Wall-Bounded Flows using Finite-JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of wall-bounded flows remains central to advancing both theoretical understanding and computational methods in fluid mechanics. In this study, we perform a numerical simulation of channel flow using a complementary approach: a high-performance, differentiable finite-difference solver developed in JAX (Finite-JAX), and an analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes Equations, also known as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The solver is applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, along with appropriate boundary conditions, to capture canonical flow features, including velocity profiles and pressure gradients. Cross-model verification is conducted by systematically comparing numerical results between Finite-JAX and the analytical solution, with a focus on velocity distributions. In addition, numerical results are benchmarked against analytical solutions for the laminar regime, allowing direct quantification of the verification accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that cross-model verification not only strengthens confidence in simulation fidelity but also provides a pathway for integrating differentiable solvers with established computational fluid dynamics platforms, paving the way for future fluid flow research. The performance of Finite-JAX on Wall-Bounded Flows is 0.014765 in the L2 norm.</description>

      <title>Behind the logarithmic growth of inner-scaled wall-pressure variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-Reynolds-number wall-bounded flows, including zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers, channels, and pipes, the inner-scaled wall-pressure variance follows a logarithmic increase with frictional Reynolds number of the form $\langle p_w^{+2}\rangle = B_{\mathcal{L}} + A_{\mathcal{Q}} \ln \delta^+$.
  We consider the two sources of the pressure Poisson equation: a linear (rapid) term linked to mean shear and a nonlinear (slow) term composed of quadratic velocity fluctuations. The goal of this paper is to provide a mechanistic link between the sources of the pressure Poisson equation and the coefficients in the inner-scaled variance form above. We tie the offset $B_{\mathcal{L}}$ to the linear source and connect the coefficient $A_{\mathcal{Q}}$ to the nonlinear source. The illustrative dataset is direct numerical simulation (DNS) at $\delta^+\approx 550$, although the principal contribution is the establishment of a mechanistic link to well-known high-$\delta^+$ scalings of wall-bounded turbulence.
  Through consideration of the spectral content of the sources and the integral solution method of the Poisson equation, we find that the linear source contribution sits predominantly in the buffer layer and maps to the near-wall cycle. This contribution becomes $\delta^+$ invariant under inner scaling, thus contributing the offset $B_{\mathcal{L}}$.
  The interfacial regions between uniform momentum zones characteristic of the log layer (vortical fissures) spatially localise strain and vorticity contributions in the log layer and contain an increasingly large proportion of the strain and vorticity. We show that fissures act as a compact carrier for the source terms, with the nonlinear term especially prominent in these regions. Then, by considering the inertial layer statistics, we associate the changing nonlinear contribution to $A_{\mathcal{Q}}\ln \delta^+$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2006.13578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of capillary rising in corners. Using Onsager principle, we derive a partial differential equation that describes the time evolution of meniscus profile. We obtain both numerical solutions and self-similar solutions to this partial differential equation. Our results show that the advance of the meniscus front follows a time-scaling of $t^{1/3}$, in agreement with the experimental results and theoretical conjecture of Ponomarenko et al.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium thermodynamics in driven macroscopic self-assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium statistical mechanics provides a robust framework for characterizing phase transitions in systems whose microsopic dynamics are time-reversible. Efforts to develop and validate theoretical frameworks for time-irreversible, non-equilibrium systems are constrained by experimental data that capture only partial measurements of the system dynamics. We herein overcome this limitation using a tunable macroscopic platform for non-equilibrium physics: millimetric spheres bound by capillary attractions at the fluid interface and driven out of equilibrium by a field of supercritical Faraday waves. The external driving induces correlated fluctuations in the particle trajectories, which in turn excite structural rearrangements between distinct metastable cluster topologies. By tracking all microstate transitions experimentally, we directly measure a non-zero entropy production rate reflecting broken detailed balance and quantifying the system's departure from equilibrium. The measured stochastic dynamics are in quantitative agreement with a many-body active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, thus establishing a bridge to a wider class of athermal, self-propelled systems at the microscale. These results invite parallel studies of non-equilibrium self-assembly kinetics using active colloids or passive particles immersed in bacterial baths whose dynamics and irreversibility are likewise governed by correlated active forces and tunable inter-particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Free Dynamics in Rotating Spherical Shell Convection Driven By Internal Heating and Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bulk properties of convection in stellar and giant planet interiors are often assumed to be independent of the molecular diffusivities, which are very small. By contrast, simulations of this process in rotating, spherical shells, which are typically driven by conductive boundary heat fluxes, generally yield results that depend on the diffusivity. This makes it challenging to extrapolate these simulation results to real objects. However, laboratory models and Cartesian-box simulations suggest that diffusion-free dynamics are more readily obtained if convection is driven using prescribed internal heating and cooling instead of boundary fluxes. Here, we apply this methodology to simulations of Boussinesq, hydrodynamic rotating spherical shell convection. We find that this set-up unambiguously yields diffusion-free behaviour for some bulk properties of the convection, such as the radial temperature contrast and the convective heat transport. Moreover, the transition from prograde to retrograde equatorial zonal flow is diffusion-free and only depends on the convective Rossby number. The diffusivity dependence of other bulk properties is regime-dependent. In simulations that are rotationally constrained, the convective velocities, and the strength and structure of the zonal flow, are diffusion-dependent, although the zonal flow appears to approach a diffusion-free state for sufficiently high supercriticality. In simulations that are uninfluenced by rotation, or are only influenced by rotation at large scales, diffusion-free convective velocities and zonal flows are obtained. The result that many aspects of our idealised simulations are diffusion-free has promising implications for the development of realistic stellar and giant planet convection models that can access diffusion-free regimes.</description>
