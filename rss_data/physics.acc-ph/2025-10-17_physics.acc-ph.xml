      <title>Three-Dimensional Simulation of the University of Hawai`i FEL Oscillator: Superradiant Emission and Cavity Desynchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate superradiant emission in a free-electron laser (FEL) oscillator using a comprehensive three-dimensional time-dependent simulation tool. Using beam parameters from the University of Hawai`i (UH) at M\=anoa FEL facility, our study shows that at nominal bunch length, the FEL radiation exhibits superradiant scaling in saturation. We then explore how cavity desynchronization enhances this regime by mitigating the laser lethargy effect in oscillators and improving overlap between the electron bunch and the radiation pulse, with peak power increased by more than a factor of five. Finally, we simulate a short-bunch operational mode with bunch length comparable to the slippage length, which accelerates saturation and further amplifies the FEL power. These findings highlight that the UH M\=anoa FEL oscillator has the potential to achieve superradiant emission at its nominal operating mode, and that short-bunch operation offers further enhancement while requiring additional optimization.</description>

      <title>Beam-commissioning-oriented optics study of HFRS Phase-I based on measured magnetic field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of the first phase of the High energy FRagment Separator (HFRS Phase-I) has already been completed and it is anticipated to start beam commissioning in autumn 2025. This paper presents the first order and higher order beam optics calculations for the HFRS Phase-I, using measured magnet data, and evaluates its experimental performance in preparation for beam commissioning. The first order optics of HFRS is calculated based on the sliced magnetic fields and the higher order aberrations are corrected using a self-compiled program. Monte Carlo particle tracking is employed to analyze the beam phase spaces on the focal planes. The experimental performance of the machine is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations. The beam phase spaces on the focal planes are thoroughly examined, demonstrating that the higher order aberrations have been well corrected. Moreover, the experimental performance of HFRS is evaluated based on the corrected higher order optics, yielding satisfactory results: the secondary beams of interest can be well separated and exhibit high transmission efficiency. This work provides valuable insights for the upcoming beam commissioning of HFRS Phase-I. The effective correction of higher order aberrations and optimized magnet settings lay a solid foundation for future experiments.</description>

      <title>High-brightness Graphite Photocathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A robust and infrared laser-excited photocathode with high quantum efficiency, high brightness, and low cost, operating under a moderate vacuum, has long been sought by the accelerator and microscopy communities. This study investigates various types of graphite photocathodes, including bulk, sheet, and flake graphite, in the regime of thermionically assisted photoemission by an irradiating infrared laser. Our experiment reveals that, under space-charge-limited photoemission, the flake-graphite photocathode with a dense population of nano-graphene fins on its surface exhibits the highest quantum efficiency, which is 770 times greater than that of a copper photocathode irradiated by the same infrared laser at 1064 nm. With our theory considering both thermionic and multiphoton emissions, we determine that the flake graphite photocathode is 200 times brighter than a copper photocathode irradiated by an infrared laser and is as bright as a LaB6 field emitter.</description>

      <title>Beam Energy Measurement using a Bayesian Approach with the Stacked Foil Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a practical method to measure the energy of proton beams at a medical cyclotron using the stacked foil technique in combination with a Bayesian inference method. By measuring the $^{48}$V activity induced in a stack of irradiated titanium foils, the proton energy can be inferred without relying on direct current or charge measurements, making the method suitable even for low-vacuum environments or air-exposed setups. This technique is further extended to configurations where the beam energy is degraded to levels around 8 MeV. A Bayesian fit of the measured activity profile allows not only for a robust energy estimation but also for a consistent treatment of uncertainties and nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to validate the underlying assumptions, including the impact of energy dispersion or cross-section uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that this method provides accurate beam energy measurements across several typical experimental setups used at the Bern Medical Cyclotron. Additionally, we evaluate the sensitivity of the method to the choice of nuclear cross-section data and assess how the number of foils in the stack affects the uncertainty in the inferred beam energy.</description>

      <title>A further study on the high-precision optics for HIAF-BRing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All equipment for the High Intensity heavy ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) has been installed and beam commissioning is currently underway. This paper presents a further study on the high-precision optics, namely slice optics, of the Booster Ring (BRing) at HIAF based on measured magnetic fields, focusing on two aspects: closed-orbit distortion and optical parameter variations caused by errors, and dynamic aperture. A detailed study is conducted on the closed-orbit distortion and changes in optical parameters caused by magnet alignment errors and dipole magnet field errors. Meanwhile, A detailed study is also conducted on the dynamic aperture of BRing. The results show that the sliced optics and the original optics are comparable in terms of the impact of these errors on the closed-orbit and optical parameters. Without chromaticity correction, the dynamic aperture of the sliced optics is superior to that of the original optics; after chromaticity correction, the sliced optics is also comparable to the original optics. This study provides valuable insights for accelerator tuning and optimization.</description>

      <title>Obvious and non-obvious aspects of digital Self-Excited-Loops for SRF cavity control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1978, Delayen showed how Self-Excited Loops (SEL) can be used to great advantage for controlling narrow-band SRF cavities. Its key capability is establishing closed-loop amplitude control early in the setup process, stabilizing Lorentz forces to allow cavity tuning and phase loop setup in a stable environment. As people around the world implement this basic idea with modern FPGA DSP technology, multiple variations and operational scenarios creep in that have both obvious and non-obvious ramifications for latency, feedback stability, and resiliency. This paper will review the key properties of a Delayen-style SEL when set up for open-loop, amplitude stabilized, and phase-stabilized modes. Then the original analog circuit will be compared and contrasted with the known variations of digital CORDIC-based implementations.</description>

      <title>FAIR Commissioning - Towards First Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The international Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) is under construction at the GSI Helmholtz Centre in Darmstadt. The first project stage includes the superconducting 100 Tm heavy-ion synchrotron SIS100, the Super Fragment Separator, and associated beam transport lines. Part of GSI's existing accelerator chain, comprising UNILAC and SIS18, will serve as injector. Installation work in the FAIR accelerator tunnels and supply buildings has been ongoing since early 2024. As progress continues, special attention is now on the start of commissioning, beginning in 2025 with the cryogenic plant. Commissioning of the transport line will follow at the end of 2025, and beam commissioning is scheduled for the second half of 2027. This paper outlines the current status of the project, commissioning strategy and timeline.</description>
