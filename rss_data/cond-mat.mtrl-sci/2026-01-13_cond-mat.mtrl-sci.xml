      <title>Fluoride doping into SiO2-MgO-CaO bioactive glass nanoparticles: bioactivity, biodegradation and biocompatibility assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, for the first time, the structure, bioactivity, biodegradation and biocompatibility of SiO2-MgO-CaO glasses doped with different levels of fluoride were studied. The glassy powder samples were synthesized by a coprecipitation method followed by calcination at 500 C, where amorphicity and fluoride incorporation were verified by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The in vitro biomineralization and biodegradation of the samples were also investigated by electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. These assessments revealed that there is an optimum level of fluoride doping to meet the highest bioactivity. Remarkably, the same level of incorporation presented the foremost biocompatibility with respect to osteoblast-like MG-63 human cells, as realized by the MTT assay and cell attachment studies.</description>

      <title>An assessment of mechanism-based plasticity models for polycrystalline magnesium alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to assess computationally efficient coarse-grained plasticity models against high-fidelity crystal plasticity simulations for magnesium polycrystals over a wide range of textures and grain sizes. A basic requirement is that such models are able to capture {\it evolving} plastic anisotropy and tension-compression asymmetry. To this end, two-surface and three-surface plasticity models are considered. The two-surface constitutive formulation separately accounts for slip and twinning, while the three-surface model further apportions the contributions of basal and nonbasal slip. Model identification is based on stress-strain responses for loading along six orientations under both tension and compression. The evolution of overall plastic anisotropy, as well as microscale relative activities of slip and twin systems, is analyzed in detail. The prospects of using coarse-grained plasticity models in guiding the development of physically sound damage models for magnesium alloys are discussed.</description>

      <title>Sizes of Ferroelectricity Appearance and Disappearence in Nanosized Hafnia-Zirconia:Landau-type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanosized hafnia-zirconia HfxZr1-xO2 in the form of thin films, multilayers and heterostructures are indispensable silicon-compatible ferroelectric materials for advanced electronic memories and logic devices. The distinctive feature of nanoscale hafnia-zirconia are the critical sizes of ferroelectricity appearance, whereas the critical sizes of ferroelectricity disappearance exist in other ferroelectrics. Using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional with higher powers, trilinear and biquadratic couplings of polar, nonpolar and antipolar order parameters, we calculated analytically the strain-dependent critical sizes of the ferroelectricity appearance and disappearance, analyzed how the size effect and mismatch strains influence the phase diagrams and polarization switching barrier in epitaxial HfO2 thin films and nano-islands with the out-of-plane spontaneous polarization. We have shown that the critical thickness/height of out-of-plane spontaneous polarization disappearance is determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects. The critical thickness/height of the ferroelectricity appearance is determined by the size dependence of the effective mismatch strain considering possible appearance of misfit dislocations and lateral relaxion of strains. Derived analytical expressions can be generalized for HfxZr1-xO2 solid solutions, providing that corresponding parameters of the free energy are known from the first principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic nanoscale spatial heterogeneity in a perovskite to brownmillerite topotactic phase transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions are omnipresent in modern condensed matter physics and its applications. In solids, phase transformations typically occur by nucleation and growth under non-equilibrium conditions. Under constant external conditions, $\textit{e.g.}$, constant heating temperature and pressure, the nucleation and growth dynamics are often thought of as spatially and temporally independent. Here, $\textit{in-situ}$ Bragg X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) reveals nanoscale spatial and dynamical heterogeneity in the perovskite to brownmillerite topotactic phase transformation in La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$CoO$_3$ (LSCO) thin films under constant reducing conditions over a time-span of multiple hours. Specifically, a timescale associated with domain growth remains stable, with a corresponding domain wall speed of $v_d = 6 \pm 0.5 \times10^{-4}$ nm/s ($2 \pm 0.2$ nm/h), while a slower timescale, associated with temperature driven de-pinning of domains, leads to accelerating dynamics with timescales following an aging power law with exponent $-2.2 \pm 0.5$. The experiment demonstrates that Bragg XPCS is a powerful tool to study nanoscale dynamics in phase transformations. The results are relevant for phase engineering of phase-change devices, as they show that nanoscale dynamics, linked to domain and domain-wall motion, can continuously evolve and speed up with time, even hours after the initiation of the phase transformation, with potential repercussions on electrical performance.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of alkali ionic transport in amorphous oxyhalides solid state conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous oxyhalides have attracted significant attention due to their relatively high ionic conductivity ($&gt;$1 mS cm$^{-1}$), excellent chemical stability, mechanical softness, and facile synthesis routes via standard solid-state reactions. These materials exhibit an ionic conductivity that is almost independent of the underlying chemistry, in stark contrast to what occurs in crystalline conductors. In this work, we employ an accurately fine-tuned machine learning interatomic potential to construct large-scale molecular dynamics trajectories encompassing hundreds of nanoseconds to obtain statistically converged transport properties. We find that the amorphous state consists of chain fragments of metal-anion tetrahedra of various lenght. By analyzing the residence time of alkali cations migrating around tetrahedrally-coordinated trivalent metal ions, we find that oxygen anions on the metal-anion tetrahedra limit alkali diffusion. By computing the full Einstein expression of the ionic conductivity, we demonstrate that the alkali transference number of these materials is strongly influenced by distinct-particles correlations, while at the same time they are characterized by an alkali Haven ratio close to one, implying that ionic transport is largely dictated by uncorrelated self-diffusion. Finally, by extending this analysis to chemical compositions $AMX_{2.5}\textsf{O}_{0.75}$, spanning different alkaline ($A$ = Li, Na, K), metallic ($M$ = Al, Ga, In), and halogen ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) species, we clarify why the diffusion properties of these materials remain largely insensitive to variations in atomic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Reaction-Diffusion Driven Patterns in Immiscible Alloy Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate local microstructural modification of thin films through film-substrate interactions. Metastable single-phase Ag-Cu thin films are deposited on Si substrates pre-patterned by FIB milling. During post-deposition annealing, localized film-substrate reaction around the milled patterns produces a distinct microstructure termed as the halo. It consists of copper silicide and almost pure Ag, while the far-field film forms a random mixture of Cu and Ag-rich domains through phase separation. We show that the extent of the halo can be controlled by varying the temperature and duration of annealing. However, its length scale does not follow the square-root time dependence typical of diffusional growth. We build a semi-analytical kinetic model of halo growth that incorporates species balance, diffusional transport and a modified Stefan condition. Predictions of the model agree well with the experimental findings and the species diffusivity through the film is obtained through an inverse optimization procedure.</description>

      <title>Weakly spin-dependent band structures of antiferromagnetic perovskite LaMO$_3$ (M = Cr, Mn, Fe)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin-dependent electronic states of antiferromagnetic (AFM) lanthanum chromite (LaCrO$_3$), lanthanum manganite (LaMnO$_3$), and lanthanum ferrite (LaFeO$_3$) using spin-polarized first-principles density functional theory (DFT) with Hubbard U correction. The band structures are calculated for 15 types of their different AFM structures. It is verified for these structures that there is a very simple rule to identify which wave number k exhibits spin splitting or degeneracy in the band structure. This rule uses the symmetry operations that map the up-spin atoms onto the down-spin atoms. The resulting spin splitting is very small for the most stable spin configuration of the most stable experimental structure. We discuss a plausible benefit of this characteristic, i.e., the direction-independence of the spin current, in electrode applications.</description>

      <title>The role of ZnO/ZnS nanostructures decoration of Ni foam on the electrochemical energy storage process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-cost and environmentally friendly electrochemical energy storage systems are crucial to address the increasing global energy demand. Nanomaterials can play a pivotal role in catalysing charge storage and/or exchange, still the underlying mechanism often remains poorly investigated, as for ZnO/ZnS nanostructures onto Ni foam. In this work, we investigate hydrothermally grown ZnO/ZnS nanostructures decorating Ni foam for energy storage application. Morphology, structure and composition are evaluated via electron microscopy-based methodologies. The electrochemical energy storage performance is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements with the aim to highlight the energy storage mechanism. When nickel foam (NF) is used as substrate, the system shows a predominant pseudocapacitive behaviour. By contrast, a modest and capacitive performance is measured on graphene paper (GP). Mott-Schottky (M-S) and open circuit potential (OCP) measurements suggests a key role of hole reservoir in ZnS decoration which boosts NF performances.</description>

      <title>Effect of substrate mismatch, orientation, and flexibility on heterogeneous ice nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous nucleation is the main path to ice formation on Earth. The ice nucleating ability of a certain substrate is mainly determined by both molecular interactions and the structural mismatch between the ice and the substrate lattices. We focus on the latter factor using molecular simulations of the mW model. Quantifying the effect of structural mismatch alone is challenging due to its coupling with molecular interactions. To disentangle both factors, we use a substrate composed of water molecules in such a way that any variation on the nucleation temperature can be exclusively ascribed to the structural mismatch. We find that a one per cent increase of structural mismatch leads to a decrease of approximately 4 K in the nucleation temperature. We also analyse the effect of the orientation of the substrate with respect to the liquid. The three main ice orientations (basal, primary prism and secondary prism) have a similar ice nucleating ability. We finally asses the effect of lattice flexibility by comparing substrates where molecules are immobile with others where a certain freedom to fluctuate around the lattice positions is allowed. Interestingly, we find that the latter type of substrate is more efficient in nucleating ice because it can adapt its structure to that of ice.</description>

      <title>On unconstrained solidification of spherical metallic drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solidification of metallic droplets into powder particles involves a complex interplay between heat diffusion, surface tension, and geometric constraints. In confined, curved systems -- such as those encountered in atomisation, abrasion, and micrometeorite formation -- positive curvature and finite boundaries significantly modify classical solidification dynamics. In this study, we systematically investigate the solidification of metallic spheres, focusing on how curvature and confinement influence nucleation pathways, growth kinetics, and interfacial stability. Two competing growth modes -- radial outward and circumferential -- are analysed using Stefan-type models under a quasi-steady approximation. A generalisation of Mullins--Sekerka stability theory is developed to account for finite spherical domains, revealing that particle size and curvature introduce new destabilising parameters that govern microstructural length scales. Experimental observations of dendritic and cellular morphologies are interpreted through this framework, demonstrating that the interaction between growth fronts, undercooling, and curvature collectively determines the final particle structure. These findings underscore the need to re-evaluate classical solidification theories in the context of curved geometries, with implications for both engineered and naturally occurring metal powders.</description>

      <title>Beyond Predicted ZT: Machine Learning Strategies for the Experimental Discovery of Thermoelectric Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-performance thermoelectric (TE) materials for advancing green energy harvesting from waste heat is an urgent need in the context of looming energy crisis and climate change. The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has accelerated the design of thermoelectric (TE) materials, yet a persistent "gap" remains between high-accuracy computational predictions and their successful experimental validation. While ML models frequently report impressive test scores (R^2 values of 0.90-0.98) for complex TE properties (zT, power factor, and electrical/thermal conductivity), only a handful of these predictions have culminated in the experimental discovery of new high-zT materials. In this review, we identify and discuss that the primary obstacles are poor model generalizability-stemming from the "small-data" problem, sampling biases in cross-validation, and inadequate structural representation-alongside the critical challenge of thermodynamic phase stability. Moreover, we argue that standard randomized validation often overestimates model performance by ignoring "hidden hierarchies" and clustering within chemical families. Finally, to bridge this gap between ML-predictions and experimental realization, we advocate for advanced validation strategies like PCA-based sampling and a synergetic active learning loop that integrates ML "fast filters" for stability (e.g., GNoME) with high-throughput combinatorial thin-film synthesis to rapidly map stable, high-zT compositional spaces.</description>

      <title>A Rechargeable Chromium Battery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivalent ions exchange multiple electrons during redox reactions, leading to the possibility of improved energy storage performance. A variety of multivalent ions, including zinc (Zn$^{2+}$), magnesium (Mg$^{2+}$), calcium (Ca$^{2+}$), aluminum (Al$^{3+}$), and indium (In$^{3+}$), have been deployed in rechargeable batteries with varying degrees of success \cite{1-9}. While chromium (Cr$^{3+}$) offers a superior volumetric capacity (approximately $11117\ \mathrm{mAh\ cm^{-3}}$) compared to the aforementioned cations, there is no report of a rechargeable chromium battery. This is because chromium metal spontaneously oxidizes to form a passivating oxide layer \cite{10} that blocks Cr$^{3+}$ ingress and egress. Here, we show that this fundamental limitation can be overcome by developing a chromium-rich high-entropy alloy. The alloy consists of five elements (Cr, bismuth (Bi), copper (Cu), tin (Sn), and nickel (Ni)), producing a multi-element native oxide rich in heterointerfaces. Some of these interfaces (such as Cr$_2$O$_3$/Bi$_2$O$_3$) exhibit a very low barrier for Cr$^{3+}$ diffusion, offering multiple pathways for efficient Cr$^{3+}$ insertion and extraction, while others (such as Cr$_2$O$_3$/CuO) block oxygen transport, thereby suppressing further oxidation. In a symmetric cell configuration, the chromium alloy supports approximately $10000$ hours (about $5000$ cycles) of reversible chromium insertion and extraction at an overpotential of only $20$ mV. The chromium-rich alloy anode was also successfully paired with a sulfur cathode to cycle reversibly in a full-cell configuration. These findings could stimulate fundamental studies on chromium-ion batteries and high-entropy alloy electrodes, opening new pathways for multivalent energy storage.</description>

      <title>Influence of Surface Functionalization on the Colloidal Stability and Magnetic Properties of Ferrite Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetite ferrite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles have attracted considerable interest due to their tunable physico-chemical properties and relevance in functional materials. In this work, uncoated Fe3O4 nanoparticles and surface-modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000) and citric acid (CA) were synthesized via a chemical co-precipitation method. The effect of surface functionalization on the structural, spectroscopic, magnetic, and colloidal properties of the nanoparticles was systematically investigated. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of phase-pure Fe3O4 with an inverse spinel structure for all the samples. Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy verified successful surface modification while preserving the Fe-O framework of the magnetite core. Dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements indicated improved dispersion and colloidal stability for the surface-modified nanoparticles. Magnetization studies performed at room temperature revealed superparamagnetic behaviour for all samples, accompanied by a coating-dependent reduction in saturation magnetization. Overall, the results emphasize the critical role of surface chemistry in tailoring the physicochemical, magnetic, and colloidal behaviour of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Keywords: Fe3O4 nanoparticles, PEG, Citric acid, Co-precipitation, Surface functionalization, Zeta potential, Colloidal stability, Magnetic properties</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnets (AFMs) hold promise for applications in digital logic. However, switching AFM domains is challenging, as magnetic fields do not couple to the bulk antiferromagnetic order parameter. Here we show that magnetic-field-driven switching of AFM domains can in many cases be enabled by a generic reduction of magnetic exchange at surfaces. We use statistical mechanics and Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that an inequivalence in magnetic exchange between top and bottom surface moments, combined with the enhanced magnetic susceptibility of surface spins, can enable deterministic selection of antiferromagnetic domains depending on the magnetic-field ramping direction. We further show that this mechanism provides a natural interpretation for experimental observations of hysteresis in magneto-optical response of the van der Waals AFM $\mathrm{MnBi_2Te_4}$. Our findings highlight the critical role of surface spins in responses of antiferromagnets to magnetic fields. Furthermore, our results suggest that antiferromagnetic domain selection via purely magnetic means may be a more common and experimentally accessible phenomenon than previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Onset and Progression of Spinodal Decomposition using Transient Grating Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinodal decomposition can degrade corrosion resistance and embrittle materials. The ability to quickly, conclusively, and non-destructively detect the onset of spinodal decomposition before catastrophic materials degradation would represent a significant advance in materials testing. We demonstrate that spinodal decomposition can be detected in binary Fe-Cr alloys via modulus stiffening using in situ and ex situ transient grating spectroscopy (TGS). The key mechanistic insight is the non-linearity in elastic moduli as function of Cr content renders a spinodally decomposed Fe-Cr alloy stiffer than an equivalent solid solution for a certain range of initial chromium compositions. We confirm the presence of spinodal decomposition in the 36 at.% chromium alloy using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), linked to known spinodal decomposition energetics, and show via atomistic simulations that elastic modulus stiffening is expected after spinodal decomposition in the 36 at.% chromium alloy. The results of this study suggest the potential use of TGS as a practical tool for non-destructive evaluation of key materials susceptible to such degradation.</description>

      <title>A phase field model of the effects of dislocation microstructure on grain boundary motion during recrystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal energy associated with the defect microstructure of strongly deformed crystals provides an important driving force for grain boundary motion during recrystallization. Typical dislocation microstructures are strongly heterogeneous and this heterogeneity affects the motion of recrystallization boundaries. In this study, a phase field model for microstructure evolution encompassing the evolution of both dislocation densities and grain order parameters is formulated. The model is employed to generate typical dislocation microstructures exhibiting multiscale features such as incidental and geometrically necessary dislocation walls. It is then used to study the motion of recrystallization boundaries in the associated complex defect energy 'landscape'. Results are compared to experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Higher order magnetoelasticity energy corrections in bcc and fcc systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelastic properties play a vital role in industrial applications. Despite being hidden behind either purely magnetic or elastic behavior, magnetoelasticity takes place in a wide range of devices as transducers, acoustic actuators, or fast response sensors. In this work, we inspect the impact of higher-order terms on the anisotropic magnetostriction behavior. Regarding ab-initio calculations, the anisotropic magnetostriction can be related to the strain dependence of the magnetocrystaline energy. Commonly, the description is restricted to a linear strain dependence in the magnetoelastic energy. Here, we derive higher-order terms in strain for bcc and fcc crystal structures. Using a simple parametrization, we show that the influence of the higher-order strain terms is negligible for the studied cubic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tantalum dioxide (TaO2) is a metastable tantalum compound. Here, we report the epitaxial stabilization of TaO2 on Al2O3 (1-102) (r-plane sapphire) substrates using suboxide molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) and thermal laser epitaxy (TLE), demonstrating single-oriented, monodomain growth of anisotropically strained thin films. Microstructural investigation is performed using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The tetravalent oxidation state of tantalum is confirmed using X-ray absorption and photoemission spectroscopy as well as electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Optical properties are investigated via spectroscopic ellipsometry and reveal a 0.3 eV Mott gap of the tantalum 5d electrons. Density-functional theory and group theoretical arguments are used to evaluate the limited stability of the rutile phase and reveal the potential to unlock a hidden metal-insulator transition concomitant with a structural phase transition to a distorted rutile phase, akin to NbO2. Our work expands the understanding of tantalum oxides and paves the way for their integration into next-generation electronic and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Influence of CaO and SiO2 additives on the sintering behavior of Cr,Ca:YAG ceramics prepared by solid-state reaction sintering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical ceramics of yttrium aluminum garnet (Y3-xCaxAl4.95Cr0.05O12) doped with 0.1 at.% of chromium ions and 0.5, 0.8, and 1.2 at.% of calcium ions were prepared by reactive sintering in vacuum at 1750 degrees C. The influence of SiO2 and CaO sintering aids on the optical properties and microstructure of Cr,Ca:YAG ceramics was investigated. A decrease in CaO concentration led to a reduction of Cr,Ca:YAG transparency from 81 to 0 percent at 1064 nm; moreover, ceramics with lower CaO content exhibited abnormal grains and high porosity. These features were attributed to interactions between silica and calcium oxide during vacuum sintering. Two mechanisms are proposed to explain the effect of CaO and SiO2 on the formation of Ca,Cr:YAG ceramics. The first involves the formation of a liquid phase due to the CaO-SiO2 interaction during the heating stage, resulting in abnormal grain growth. The second mechanism is the mutual consumption of Si4+ and Ca2+ ions during the isothermal stage of sintering, which leads to a decrease in Cr4+ concentration. Both mechanisms negatively affect the optical and laser properties of the ceramics.</description>

      <title>Electric field switching of altermagnetic spin-splitting in multiferroic skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are localized magnetic structures that retain their shape and stability over time, thanks to their topological nature. Recent theoretical and experimental progress has laid the groundwork for understanding magnetic skyrmions characterized by negligible net magnetization and ultrafast dynamics. Notably, skyrmions emerging in materials with altermagnetism, a novel magnetic phase featuring lifted Kramers degeneracy-have remained unreported until now. In this study, we demonstrate that BiFeO3, a multiferroic renowned for its strong coupling between ferroelectricity and magnetism, can transit from a spin cycloid to a Neel-type skyrmion under antidamping spin-orbit torque at room temperature. Strikingly, the altermagnetic spin splitting within BiFeO3 skyrmion can be reversed through the application of an electric field, revealed via the Circular photogalvanic effect. This quasiparticle, which possesses a neutral topological charge, holds substantial promise for diverse applications-most notably, enabling the development of unconventional computing systems with low power consumption and magnetoelectric controllability.</description>

      <title>Absence of magnetic order in epitaxial RuO2 revealed by X-ray linear dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the topic of altermagnetism has attracted tremendous attention and RuO2 have been demonstrated to be one of the most promising altermagnetic candidates. However, disputes still remain on the existence of magnetic order in RuO2. Here in this work, we employ X-ray linear dichroism (XLD), a widely utilized technique for characterizing antiferromagnets, in conjunction with photoemission electron microscopy and multiple scattering calculation to provide clear evidence of the absence of magnetic order in epitaxial RuO2 films. The observed XLD signal is nearly invariant with temperature and independent on cooling field direction, in stark contrast to the substantial magnetic order-related XLD signal predicted by multiple scattering calculation. This finding strongly suggests a nonmagnetic origin for RuO2. Furthermore, we observed significantly distinct XLD signals at the Ru M3 and O K edges in RuO2 films grown on TiO2 substrate with different surface orientations, which can be attributed to the low-symmetry crystal field. These results unequivocally demonstrate the absence of magnetic order in RuO2 and establishes XLD measurement as a robust technique for probing the low-symmetry magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Bgolearn: a Unified Bayesian Optimization Framework for Accelerating Materials Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient exploration of vast compositional and processing spaces is essential for accelerated materials discovery. Bayesian optimization (BO) provides a principled strategy for identifying optimal materials with minimal experiments, yet its adoption in materials science is hindered by implementation complexity and limited domain-specific tools. Here, we present Bgolearn, a comprehensive Python framework that makes BO accessible and practical for materials research through an intuitive interface, robust algorithms, and materials-oriented workflows. Bgolearn supports both single-objective and multi-objective Bayesian optimization with multiple acquisition functions (e.g., expected improvement, upper confidence bound, probability of improvement, and expected hypervolume improvement etc.), diverse surrogate models (including Gaussian processes, random forests, and gradient boosting etc.), and bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification. Benchmark studies show that Bgolearn reduces the number of required experiments by 40-60% compared with random search, grid search, and genetic algorithms, while maintaining comparable or superior solution quality. Its effectiveness is demonstrated not only through the studies presented in this paper, such as the identification of maximum-elastic-modulus triply periodic minimal surface structures, ultra-high-hardness high-entropy alloys, and high-strength, high-ductility medium-Mn steels, but also by numerous publications that have proven its impact in material discovery. With a modular architecture that integrates seamlessly into existing materials workflows and a graphical user interface (BgoFace) that removes programming barriers, Bgolearn establishes a practical and reliable platform for Bayesian optimization in materials science, and is openly available at https://github.com/Bin-Cao/Bgolearn.</description>

      <title>Nanoindentation induced plasticity in equiatomic MoTaW alloys by experimentally guided machine learning molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCA) exhibit exceptional strength and thermal stability, yet their plastic deformation mechanisms under complex contact loading remain insufficiently understood. Here, the nanoindentation response of an equiatomic MoTaW alloy is investigated through a combined experimental and atomistically resolved modeling approach. Spherical nanoindentation experiments are coupled with large scale molecular dynamics simulations employing a tabulated low dimensional Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), enabling near DFT accuracy. A physics based similarity criterion, implemented via PCA of load-displacement curves, is used to identify mechanically representative experimental responses for quantitative comparison with simulations. Indentation stress-strain curves are constructed yielding excellent agreement in the elastic regime between experiment and simulation, with reduced Young's moduli of approximately 270 GPa. Generalized stacking fault energy calculations reveal elevated unstable stacking- and twinning-fault energies in MoTaW relative to pure refractory elements, indicating suppressed localized shear and a preference for dislocation-mediated plasticity. Atomistic analyses demonstrate a strong crystallographic dependence of plastic deformation, with symmetric {110}&lt;111&gt; slip activation and four-fold rosette pile-ups for the [001] orientation, and anisotropic slip, strain localization, and enhanced junction formation for [011]. Local entropy and polyhedral template matching analyses further elucidate dislocation network evolution and deformation-induced local structural transformations. Overall, this study establishes a direct mechanistic link between fault energetics, orientation-dependent dislocation activity, and experimentally observed nanoindentation behavior in RCCA.</description>

      <title>Size Dependent Ternary Halide Solid Solutions in Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline solid solutions incorporate guest atoms by substituting host lattice sites up to a solubility limit dictated by solute host similarity. Solid solutions enable tuning various material properties, such as the optoelectronic behavior of halide perovskites. In bulk, incompatibility of Cl:I halide mixtures restricts exploration throughout the ternary halide Cl:Br:I compositional range. However, solubility is extended in nanocrystals which better accommodate a wider range of ions within their lattice. Through high throughput synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of over 3000 samples, along with density functional theory and cluster expansion models, we determine the solubility boundaries of ternary halide perovskite nanocrystals and demonstrate their extended size dependent miscibility. Smaller nanocrystals, with sufficient Br content, stabilize the Cl:Br:I solid solutions, suppress planar stacking fault defects and prevent halide segregation.</description>

      <title>Dislocation distribution near a wall within the framework of the continuum theory of curved dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently proposed generalised continuum theory of curved dislocations describes the spatial and temporal evolution of statistically stored and geometrically necessary dislocation densities as well as the curvature. The dynamics follow from a scalar plastic potential that constrains the allowed velocity fields and leads to a phase field like formulation with a nontrivial mobility function. Although conceptually related to strain gradient plasticity, the theory differs by introducing an intrinsic, evolving length scale given by the dislocation spacing.
  In this paper, we determine three key material independent parameters of this continuum theory by quantitatively comparing its predictions with discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations. To achieve this, we impose a narrow impenetrable wall inside the simulation volume, which blocks dislocation motion and generates characteristic spatial variations of the dislocation density fields under external loading. We show that for this geometry, the continuum equations reduce to a form that can be solved efficiently via direct numerical integration. The resulting stationary distributions of total and geometrically necessary dislocation densities are then compared to extensive 2D and 3D DDD simulations. This comparison allows us to extract the parameters that govern the back stress, the density gradient coupling, and the flow stress relation. Our results demonstrate that the continuum theory quantitatively captures the DDD observed structure of the dislocation pile up near the wall and therefore provides a reliable mesoscale description. The wall loading setup further serves as a benchmark problem to validate numerical implementations of the continuum theory in more general geometries.</description>

      <title>A survey of active learning in materials science: Data-driven paradigm for accelerating the research pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of materials composition, structure, and processing spaces is constrained by high dimensionality and the cost of data acquisition. While machine learning has supported property prediction and design, its effectiveness depends on labeled data, which remains expensive to generate via experiments or high-fidelity simulations. Improving data efficiency is thus a central concern in materials informatics.
  Active learning (AL) addresses this by coupling model training with adaptive data acquisition. Instead of static datasets, AL iteratively prioritizes candidates based on uncertainty, diversity, or task-specific objectives. By guiding data collection under limited budgets, AL offers a structured approach to decision-making, complementing physical insight with quantitative measures of informativeness.
  Recently, AL has been applied to computational simulation, structure optimization, and autonomous experimentation. However, the diversity of AL formulations has led to fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assessments. This Review provides a concise overview of AL methods in materials science, focusing on their role in improving data efficiency under realistic constraints. We summarize key methodological principles, representative applications, and persistent challenges, aiming to clarify the scope and limitations of AL as a practical tool within contemporary materials informatics.</description>

      <title>Case study of an exploratory high voltage NASICON-based Na$_4$NiCr(PO$_4$)$_3$ cathode material for sodium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a new NASICON-type Na$_4$NiCr(PO$_4$)$_3$ material designed for high-voltage and multi-electron reactions for the sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction pattern, using the R$\bar{3}$c space group, confirmed the stabilization of the rhombohedral NASICON framework. Furthermore, the Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are employed to probe the structure and chemical bonding. The core-level photoemission analysis reveals the Cr$^{3+}$ and mixed Ni$^{2+}$/Ni$^{3+}$ oxidation states in the sample. Moreover, the bond valence energy landscape (BVEL) analysis, based on the refined structure, revealed a three-dimensional network of well-connected sodium sites with a migration energy barrier of 0.468 eV. The material delivered a good charge capacity at around 4.5 V, but showed no sodium-ion intercalation during discharge, resulting in negligible discharge capacity. The post-mortem analysis confirmed that the crystal structure remained intact. The calculated energy barrier values indicated a reversal in sodium site stability after cycling, though the barriers can still permit feasible ion migration. This suggests that ion transport alone cannot explain the lack of reversibility, which likely arises from intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. These findings highlight key challenges in achieving stable, reversible capacity in this system and underscore the need for doping, structural modification, and electrolyte optimization to realize its full potential as a high-voltage SIB cathode.</description>

      <title>Percolation-Driven Magnetotransport due to Structural and Microstructural Evolution in Ultrathin Si/Fe Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in magnetic nanofilms is highly sensitive to the microstructural and magnetic homogeneity. However, the evolution of the microstructure and morphology near the percolation threshold, and its connection to the resulting magnetic and magnetotransport behavior in low-dimensional magnetic heterostructures, remain poorly understood. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport properties of Si/Fe bilayers by varying the Fe layer thickness. X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and magnetisation data reveal a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to percolative network structure of grains when tFe decreases below 30 Angstrom. Transport measurements involving longitudinal resistivity (rho), and the anomalous Hall resistivity (rho_A,h,s) show clear divergence near the percolation threshold. The purely electronic conduction channels (rho) evolve more gradually as compared to the combined electronic and magnetic ones rho_A,h,s. The percolative analysis of the structural, magnetic, and magnetotransport data yields a critical exponent in the range of 0.78 to 1.16, consistent with that of 2D-disordered systems. The AHE scaling relation between the rho_A,h,s and rho reveals a crossover of the AHE mechanism from a mixed intrinsic/side-jump contribution with a minor skew scattering component (n ~ 1.42) in the thick, low-resistive samples (tFe &gt; 30 Angstrom) to a skew-scattering-dominant mechanism (n = 0.62) in the high-resistive films (tFe &lt;= 30 Angstrom). This crossover coincides with the onset of structural and magnetic connectivity between the grains. Furthermore, these findings underscore the interlink between microstructure, morphology, magnetism, and Hall transport under a percolation framework.</description>

      <title>Hidden half-metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Half-metals, featuring ideal 100\% spin polarization, are widely regarded as key materials for spintronic and quantum technologies; however, the half-metallic state is intrinsically fragile, as it relies on a delicate balance of exchange splitting and band filling and is therefore highly susceptible to disorder, external perturbations, and thermal effects. Here we introduce the concept of hidden half-metallicity, whereby the global electronic structure of a symmetry-enforced net-zero-magnetization magnet is non-half-metallic, while each of its two symmetry-related sectors is individually half-metallic, enabling robust 100\% spin polarization through a layer degree of freedom. Crucially, the vanishing net magnetization of the entire system suppresses stray fields and magnetic instabilities, rendering the half-metallic functionality inherently more robust than in conventional ferromagnetic half-metals. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate this mechanism in a $PT$-symmetric bilayer $\mathrm{CrS_2}$, and further show that an external electric field drives the system into a seemingly forbidden fully compensated ferrimagnetic metal in which hidden half-metallicity persists. Finally, we briefly confirm the realization of hidden half-metallicity in altermagnets, establishing a general paradigm for stabilizing half-metallic behavior by embedding it in symmetry-protected hidden sectors and opening a new route toward the design and discovery of unprecedented half-metallic phases.</description>

      <title>Improvement of a focused ion beam fabricated diamond pillar for scanning ensemble nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry probe using an ultrapure diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning diamond nitrogen-vacancy probe microscopy (SNVM) is an important tool for studying nanoscale condensed-matter phenomena. Ga$^+$-ion-focused-ion-beam (FIB) milling has been introduced as an available method for fabricating SNVM, while the probe diameter is limited to a few micrometers due to the Ga$^+$-induced damage. We report a method for improving the SNVM probes' quality, with an 800-nm diameter probe of ultrapure diamond, through polyvinyl alcohol and Pt/Pd capping, followed by UV/ozone exposure. The effectiveness of the method is confirmed by NVs' spin-coherence property measurements and magnetic domain structure imaging with a few-hundred-nanometer resolution and a 6.7 $\mu$T/Hz$^{1/2}$ sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Driving Force Activated Phonon Scattering in InN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect related disorder during InN growth is a major challenge for making high performance electronic and optoelectronic devices. This is partly because film quality is often described using reactor specific settings instead of general physical variables. In this study, we show that plasma assisted MOCVD growth of InN can be described using a single thermodynamic driving force coordinate. This coordinate brings together growth kinetics, defect sensitive Raman response and structural coherence across different process conditions. When we use this coordinate, the incorporation rate follows a universal activated trend with a kinetic scale of about 0.08 eV. Raman measurements show a clear crossover between a defect sparse and a defect rich regime, a disorder activated Raman metric increases quickly after the crossover, while an A1-LO control metric stays mostly the same. This suggests that short range lattice disorder, not long range polar coupling, dominates the defect activation process. X-ray diffraction shows that the out of plane coherence length stays the same for samples with the same driving force, even if reactor settings are very different. This supports the idea that structural coherence is organized by thermodynamics in this growth window. Finally, a simple kinetic Monte Carlo model using driving force biased incorporation and defect activation events matches the observed exponential trends and the two regimes, supporting the driving force approach. These results show that a transferable driving force coordinate can be used for plasma assisted InN growth and offer a quantitative way to achieve defect sparse growth conditions.</description>

      <title>Emergent Cooperative Superstructures via Order-Disorder Kinetics in Molecule-Intercalated NbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of quantum states at heterointerfaces has enabled a variety of emergent phenomena. Among them, molecular intercalation superlattices have attracted attention as tunable hybrid materials, formed by inserting organic molecules into van der Waals crystals, where molecular structure and chemistry provide new degrees of freedom. Traditionally, the intercalated molecules have been regarded as inactive spacers, while possible molecular ordering and its impact on the host lattice have remained largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of a cooperative superstructure (CSS) phase in molecule intercalated NbSe2, where ordering of the guest molecules induce a concomitant superstructure in the NbSe2 host lattice, characterized by a moir\'e structure due to incommensurability between the molecular layer and the inorganic lattice. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals the emergence of CSS phase, accompanied by crystal symmetry lowering. Complementary resistivity and thermal-quench measurements show that the transition is governed by unusually slow order-disorder kinetics, so that the CSS phase can be selectively accessed under standard laboratory cooling rates. This kinetic behavior arises from slow molecular dynamics coupled to the host lattice, contrasting with fast charge or magnetic ordering in inorganic solids. Our findings establish molecular ordering as a route for engineering heterointerfaces, enabling thermally programmable superstructures.</description>

      <title>Effect of the parameters of bimodal microstructure on the mechanical properties of alumina: A case of sintering regime effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of sintering regimes on the density, microstructure parameters, and mechanical properties of Al2O3 and Al2O3 + 0.25%MgO ceramics has been investigated. The ceramics were sintered in three regimes: Regime I - heating at a constant rate (2.5, 5, 10, 20 C/min) up to the temperature T=1650C; Regime II - heating with a varied heating rate up to 1565C with the duration corresponding to sintering at the heating rate of 10 C/min in Regime I followed by a three-fold decrease in the shrinkage rate; Regime III - two-stage sintering: heating according to Regime II up to the temperature T1+1550C, then lowering the temperature down to T2 = 1300-1500C and holding for 3 h at the T2. The sintering regimes were chosen so that the ceramics had the relative density of 97-99% and a bimodal distribution of the microstructure parameters. The Al2O3 and Al2O3 + 0.25%MgO ceramics obtained in Regimes I-III had a microstructure with abnormally large grains in a fine-grained matrix. The sizes and volume fractions of the large grains depended on the sintering regime. Most abnormally large grains had elongated shapes that leads to deviations in the crack propagation trajectories from the straight line. The optimal parameters of the bimodal microstructure parameters distribution providing enhanced mechanical properties of the ceramics (hardness, indentation fracture toughness, ultimate strength) have been determined.</description>

Abstract: The article presents the results of corrosion-fatigue tests of industrial Al-Mg alloys were conducted in air and in a 3% NaCl aqueous solution. Fatigue curves can be characterized using the Basquin equation and the plastic deformation model at the crack tip. It has been demonstrated that the primary contributions to corrosion-fatigue failure in the Al-Mg alloys at low stresses are made by the process of pitting and intergranular corrosion, and by the plastic deformation at high stresses.</description>

      <title>High isothermal magnetocaloric effect in La(Fe,Si)13 based alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in LaFe_{11.6}Si_{1.4} and LaFe_{11.78}Mn_{0.41}Si_{1.32}H_{1.6} alloys under adiabatic {\Delta}T and isothermal {\Delta}Q conditions in a magnetic field of {\mu}_{0}H = 1.8 T. The studied samples exhibited high reproducibility of the {\Delta}Q-effect upon cyclic magnetic field application, which is of critical importance for magnetic cooling systems.The LaFe_{11.78}Mn_{0.41}Si_{1.32}H_{1.6} alloy demonstrate high values of the isothermal MCE, with a maximum {\Delta}Q = 3400 J/kg in a magnetic field of {\mu}0H = 1.8 T near the Curie temperature (TC) of 275 K. This value is 2.5 times higher than the well-known corresponding values for pure Gd at room temperature. Furthermore, the structural and magnetic properties of LaFe13-xSix-based alloys with Cr and Co additions were investigated using density functional theory calcula-tions. It was shown that the addition of Cr leads to a decrease in the equilibrium volume, i.e., to a com-pression of the crystal lattice, whereas Co addition causes its expansion. These changes are expected to increase or decrease the T_{C}, respectively.</description>

      <title>Structure-Property Relationship in Zinc Sulphide Nanoparticles Synthesized by Hydrothermal and Co-precipitation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zinc sulphide (ZnS) is a non-toxic, wide-bandgap II-VI semiconductor well known for its optoelectronic properties and environmental friendliness. Conventional syntheses of ZnS quantum dots (QDs) often involve high temperatures or toxic reagents. This study presents a comparative investigation of hydrothermal and co-precipitation synthesis routes for ZnS QDs, emphasizing scalable, environmentally friendly production under mild conditions. Using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) as capping agents, we achieved precise control over particle size, optical properties, and particle size distribution. Room temperature co-precipitation produced monodisperse ZnS QDs with crystallite size as small as 2.03 nm, while hydrothermal synthesis at elevated temperature yielded larger crystals exceeding ~6 nm. X-ray diffraction confirmed zinc-blende crystal structure in all samples, with lattice parameter shifts and peak broadening reflecting nanoscale effects. UV-Visible spectroscopy revealed tuneable optical band gaps from 3.60 eV to 3.80 eV, corresponding to strong quantum confinement in smaller particles. FTIR and DLS analyses verified effective surface capping and particle size distribution, with PVP providing greater growth suppression and stability than PEG. These results demonstrate that ambient, polymer-assisted co precipitation enables low-toxicity, energy-efficient synthesis of high-quality ZnS QDs, offering a viable route toward sustainable and scalable nanoparticle production for optoelectronic and nanomaterial applications</description>

      <title>Anisotropic anomalous Hall effect in distorted kagome GdTi3Bi4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological kagome magnets offer a rich landscape for exploring the intricate interplay of quantum interactions among geometry, topology, spin, and correlation. GdTi3Bi4 crystallizes in layered Ti based kagome nets intertwined with zigzag Gd chains along the a axis and orders antiferromagnetically below 15 K. Here, we present the temperature and field dependent electrical transport of GdTi3Bi4 in different directions. The material exhibits anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 410 S cm-1 at 2 K for B parallel c and it is completely absent for B parallel a, despite the similar magnetization observed in both orientations. This behavior is quite contradictory, as anomalous Hall effect (AHE) typically scales with the magnetization. Through first principles calculations, it is demonstrated that in the presence of time reversal symmetry broken by the Gd 4f sublattice and spin orbit coupling, the magnetization direction controls the orbital mixing in the Ti t2g bands, relocating Berry curvature hot spots and producing the observed orientation selective AHC. The results establish GdTi3Bi4 as platform for investigating new avenues of AHE, such as directional AHE, and thus shed new light on the intricate coupling between magnetic and electronic structures, paving the way for exploring novel quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>A density functional theory study of amino acids on Mg and Mg-based alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnesium (Mg) has mechanical properties similar to bone tissue, and Mg ions take part in the metabolism. This makes Mg of interest for biocompatible degradable body implants, provided that its high corrosion rate can be inhibited. Slightly alloying Mg and adding surface coatings can slow down the corrosion processes without significantly changing the mechanical properties. Use of coating molecules that are native to the body increase the likelihood of making the surface biocompatible, for example by use of amino acids. We here present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the adsorption on Mg(0001) of the amino acids glycine, L-proline, and L-hydroxyproline (Hyp), the main amino acid content of collagen. We investigate how binding of the functional groups of Hyp are affected when Mg(0001) is slightly alloyed with zinc, lithium or aluminium, and we also model the immersion of the systems in a water environment to see how this affects the binding.</description>

      <title>Noise2Void for Denoising Atomic Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Noise2Void technique is demonstrated for successful denoising of atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images. The technique is applied to denoising atomic resolution images and videos of gold adatoms on a graphene surface within a graphene liquid cell, with the denoised experimental data qualitatively demonstrating improved visibility of both the Au adatoms and the graphene lattice. The denoising performance is quantified by comparison to similar simulated data and the approach is found to significantly outperform both total variation and simple Gaussian blurring. Compared to other denoising methods, the Noise2Void technique has the combined advantages that it requires no manual intervention during training or denoising, no prior knowledge of the sample and is compatible with real time data acquisition rates of at least 45 frames per second.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic materials play a key role in the contemporary industry, providing unique features with a wide application potential. To study physical phenomena and design new materials, it is important to possess an appropriate tool, a model allowing simulation of desired behavior. Spin-lattice model simulations can be used to investigate spacious systems containing thousands of atoms, while complex phenomena arising from the interplay of lattice and spin dynamics can be modeled. One of the important phenomena that can be modeled in the spin lattice simulation is magnetoelastic behavior, offering direct conversion between the mechanical and magnetic energy. However, so far, only models for systems with cubic symmetry have been introduced. Therefore, here, a spin-lattice model for a system with tetragonal symmetry is proposed, where its strength is manifested by simulation of magnetoelastic properties of a characteristic representative L1$_{0}$ FePt system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is a central tool for studying the dynamical electronic structure of molecules and solids, yet aspects of its mathematical foundations remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we revisit the foundations of TDDFT within a finite-dimensional setting by developing a general geometric framework for Schr\"odinger dynamics subject to prescribed expectation values of selected observables. We show that multiple natural definitions of such constrained dynamics arise from the underlying geometry of the state manifold. The conventional TDDFT formulation emerges from demanding stationarity of the action functional, while an alternative, purely geometric construction leads to a distinct form of constrained Schr\"odinger evolution that has not been previously explored. This alternative dynamics may provide a more mathematically robust route to TDDFT and may suggest new strategies for constructing nonadiabatic approximations. Applying the theory to interacting fermions on finite lattices, we derive novel Kohn--Sham schemes in which the density constraint is enforced via an imaginary potential or, equivalently, a nonlocal Hermitian operator. Numerical illustrations for the Hubbard dimer demonstrate the behavior of these new approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new formulation of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) based on the geometric structure of the set of states constrained to have a fixed density. Orbital-free TDDFT is formulated using a hydrodynamics equation involving a new universal density-to-current functional map. In the corresponding Kohn--Sham equation, the density is reproduced using a non-local operator. Numerical simulations for one-dimensional soft-Coulomb systems are provided.</description>

      <title>PFT: Phonon Fine-tuning for Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with standard a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP (trained on Materials Project) by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast control of spin order by linearly polarized light in noncollinear antiferromagnetic metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-thermal optical control of magnetic order offers a promising route to ultrafast, energy-efficient information technologies. Although optical manipulation of magnetism in metals has been extensively studied, experimentally demonstrated effects have so far been limited to heat-driven dynamics or helicity-dependent mechanisms. Here, we report ultrafast non-thermal control of spin order in noncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn-based antiperovskite nitrides Mn3NiN and Mn3GaN, driven solely by the polarization orientation of linearly polarized femtosecond laser pulses. Using time-resolved magneto-optical pump-probe experiments based on the Voigt effect, we observe sub-picosecond changes in magnetic order followed by picosecond relaxation. The magneto-optical response depends on the relative orientation of the pump and probe polarization planes, with linear-polarization dependence reaching up to 95%, a value unprecedented in metallic magnets. This phenomenon is observed in two different materials and persists over a wide range of excitation wavelengths, fluences, and temperatures, demonstrating its robustness. Symmetry analysis and microscopic modeling indicate that optically induced torques alone cannot fully explain the observed dynamics. We therefore propose laser-induced formation of transient spin-spiral states as a possible excitation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Resolving the energy alignment between methylammonium lead iodide and C60: an in-situ photoelectron spectroscopy study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the energy level alignment at interfaces between lead halide perovskites and electron transport layers is crucial for optimizing charge extraction by minimizing recombination losses in high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. In this work, we investigated the energy level alignment of C60 on in-situ cleaved MAPbI3 single crystals in multiple repeat experiments using photoelectron spectroscopy aiming to resolve inconsistencies reported in earlier studies. Our results show that both materials remain chemically stable upon interface formation, the strong reactions typically seen when metals contact perovskites. By analyzing Pb 4f and C 1s core level positions in detail, we determined that C60 consistently exhibits a downward energy shift toward MAPbI3, which works against efficient charge extraction. The magnitude of this shift, however, is highly sensitive to the surface composition, highlighting that small variations may lead to significant differences in results. At higher C60 coverages of more than 5 monolayers, a constant HOMO-valence band offset of 0.52 eV was obtained. Assuming a 1.86 eV HOMO-LUMO gap, the C60 LUMO is 0.25 eV below the MAPbI3 conduction band, a value favorable for charge extraction. These findings underscore the decisive role of surface chemistry on interfacial energetics, explain performance variability in perovskite devices, and demonstrate the need to control and accurately measure surface properties. Furthermore, the observed energetic alignment can explain why further interface modification by charge blocking layers or surface passivation is needed for optimized device efficiencies.</description>

      <title>A DFT study of B-doped graphene as a metal-anchor: effects of oxidation and strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic DFT investigation of the interaction between B-doped graphene and four selected metals: Mg and Zn, relevant for next-generation metal-ion batteries, and Cu and Pt, important for single-atom catalysis. Three different boron doping concentrations were considered to elucidate how dopant density influences the binding strength, charge transfer, and electronic structure of the resulting systems. In addition, the effects of biaxial strain and surface oxidation were examined to assess their impact on the reactivity and stability of B-doped graphene. The results show that boron doping substantially enhances graphene's affinity toward metal adsorption, though the extent and nature of this effect depend strongly on the metal type and doping level. For some of the metals investigated, the interaction is found to be almost entirely charge-transfer driven, with minimal orbital hybridization. Mechanical strain is found to enable fine-tuning of the metal/substrate interaction, while surface oxidation introduces a more pronounced effect by enabling direct interaction between metal atoms and oxygen functional groups in most cases, thereby significantly altering adsorption geometry and strength. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of boron-doped graphene materials for energy conversion and storage applications.</description>

      <title>Co-doping of silicate bioceramics as a potential strategy to further enhance mono-doping consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicate bioceramics have attracted significant attention in medical applications, particularly in hard tissue regeneration, because of their controllable chemical, physical, and biological functionalities, while ensuring biocompatibility. The coordination of silicate bioceramics with mono-dopants has been extensively studied to enhance their osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and antibacterial activity. However, the concept of employing dual or multiple co-doping to further enhance these biomaterials still demands more attention. This review paper originally focuses on the effect of chemical interactions among co-dopants and the principal constituents of the silicates, on the bio-behavior of these bioceramics. Additionally, future prospects of co-doped silicate bioceramics are outlined, including in vivo studies, clinical trials, and potential commercialization.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of non-F\"{o}rster exciton transfer mechanisms in perylene diimide donor, phenylene bridge, and terrylene diimide acceptor systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rates of exciton transfer within dyads of perylene diimide and terrylene diimide connected by oligophenylene bridge units have been shown to deviate significantly from those of F\"{o}rster's resonance energy transfer theory, according to single molecule spectroscopy experiments. The present work provides a detailed computational and theoretical study investigating the source of such discrepancy. Electronic spectroscopy data are calculated by time-dependent density function theory and then compared with experimental results. Electronic couplings between exciton donor and acceptor are estimated based on both transition density cube method and transition dipole approximation. These results confirm that the delocalization of exciton to the bridge parts contribute to significant enhancement of donor-acceptor electronic coupling. Mechanistic details of exciton transfer are examined by estimating the contributions of the bridge electronic states, vibrational modes of the dyads commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor, inelastic resonance energy transfer mechanism, and dark exciton states. These analyses suggest that the contribution of common vibrational modes serves as the main source of deviation from F\"{o}rster's spectral overlap expression.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Tree Search for High-Dimensional Computational Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional design spaces underpin a wide range of physics-based modeling and computational design tasks in science and engineering. These problems are commonly formulated as constrained black-box searches over rugged objective landscapes, where function evaluations are expensive, and gradients are unavailable or unreliable. Conventional global search engines and optimizers struggle in such settings due to the exponential scaling of design spaces, the presence of multiple local basins, and the absence of physical guidance in sampling. We present a physics-informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that extends policy-driven tree-based reinforcement concepts to continuous, high-dimensional scientific optimization. Our method integrates population-level decision trees with surrogate-guided directional sampling, reward shaping, and hierarchical switching between global exploration and local exploitation. These ingredients allow efficient traversal of non-convex, multimodal landscapes where physically meaningful optima are sparse. We benchmark our approach against standard global optimization baselines on a suite of canonical test functions, demonstrating superior or comparable performance in terms of convergence, robustness, and generalization. Beyond synthetic tests, we demonstrate physics-consistent applicability to (i) crystal structure optimization from clusters to bulk, (ii) fitting of classical interatomic potentials, and (iii) constrained engineering design problems. Across all cases, the method converges with high fidelity and evaluation efficiency while preserving physical constraints. Overall, our work establishes physics-informed tree search as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for computational design and high-dimensional scientific optimization, bridging discrete decision-making frameworks with continuous search in scientific design workflows.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in epitaxial PtSb(0001) thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report superconductivity in epitaxial PtSb(0001) thin films grown on SrF2(111). Electrical transport measurements reveal a superconducting transition at $T_{\mathrm c}=1.72$ K. The field-induced broadening of the transition and the presence of finite upper critical fields are consistent with type-II superconductivity. We determine the resistively defined upper critical fields for magnetic fields applied perpendicular and parallel to the film plane and parameterize their temperature dependence using an anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau approach. For the thickest film ($d=50$ nm), this yields coherence lengths of $\xi_{ab}\approx 55$ nm and $\xi_c\approx 14$ nm. Current-voltage characteristics show sizeable critical currents, with a critical current density reaching $J_{\mathrm c}\approx 6e4$ A/cm$^2$ at 0.5 K. These results establish epitaxial PtSb as a superconducting thin-film platform compatible with lattice-matched heterostructures in the NiAs-type materials family.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments: A Hierarchical Taxonomy for Autonomous Large-Scale Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition from automated data collection to fully autonomous discovery requires a shared vocabulary to benchmark progress. While the automotive industry relies on the SAE J3016 standard, current taxonomies for autonomous science presuppose an owner-operator model that is incompatible with the operational rigidities of Large-Scale User Facilities. Here, we propose the Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments (BASE) Scale, a 6-level taxonomy (Levels 0-5) specifically adapted for these unique constraints. Unlike owner-operator models, User Facilities require zero-shot deployment where agents must operate immediately without extensive training periods. We define the specific technical requirements for each tier, identifying the Inference Barrier (Level 3) as the critical latency threshold where decisions shift from scalar feedback to semantic digital twins. Fundamentally, this level extends the decision manifold from spatial exploration to temporal gating, enabling the agent to synchronise acquisition with the onset of transient physical events. By establishing these operational definitions, the BASE Scale provides facility directors, funding bodies, and beamline scientists with a standardised metric to assess risk, define liability, and quantify the intelligence of experimental workflows.</description>

      <title>Cation Dominated but Negatively Charged Na2SO4,aq-Graphene Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of ions and their impact on the structure of electrolyte interfaces plays an important role in many applications. Interestingly, recent experimental studies have suggested the preferential accumulation of $SO_4^{2-}$ ions at the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interface in disagreement with the generally known tendency of cations to accumulate at graphene-electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we resolve the atomistic structure of the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interfaces in the 0.1-2.0 M concentration range using machine learning interatomic potential-based simulations and simulated sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra to reveal the molecular origins of the conundrum. Our results show that Na+ ions accumulate between the outermost and second water layers whereas $SO_4^{2-}$ ions accumulate within the second interfacial water layer indicating cation dominated interfaces. We find that the interfacial region (within ~10 ${\AA}$ of the graphene sheet) is negatively charged due to sub-stoichiometric $Na^+$/$SO_4^{2-}$ ratio at the interface. Our simulated SFG spectra show enhancement and a red-shift of the spectra in the hydrogen bonded region as a function of $Na_2SO_4$ concentration similar to measurements due to $SO_4^{2-}$-induced changes in the orientational order of water molecules in the second interfacial layer. Our study demonstrates that ion stratification and ion-induced water reorganization are key elements of understanding the electrolyte-graphene interface.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Insulator to Metal Transition in Non-Centrosymmetric Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering sublattice imbalance within the unit cell of bottom-up synthesized graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) represents a versatile tool for realizing custom-tailored quantum nanomaterials. The interaction between low-energy zero-modes (ZMs) not only contributes to frontier bands but can form the basis for magnetically ordered phases. Here, we present the bottom-up synthesis of a non-centrosymmetric GNR that places all ZMs on the majority sublattice sites. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy reveal that strong electron-electron correlation drives the system into a ferromagnetically ordered insulating ground state featuring a sizeable band gap of Eg ~ 1.2 eV. At higher temperatures, a chemical transformation induces an insulator-to-metal transition that quenches the ferro-magnetic order. Tight-binding (TB) and first-principles density functional theory calculations corroborate our experimental observations. This work showcases how control over molecular symmetry, sublattice polarization, and ZM hybridization in bottom-up synthesized nanographenes can open a path to the exploration of many-body physics in rationally designed quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Charge and Magnetic Orders in SmNiC$_2$ Mediated by Electron-Phonon Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) instabilities and ferromagnetism in SmNiC$_2$ using diffuse and inelastic x-ray scattering together with Raman spectroscopy. We identify a soft acoustic phonon driving the incommensurate CDW (I-CDW) and uncover a second Kohn anomaly at the wave vector of the commensurate CDW (C-CDW) stabilized in other $R$NiC$_2$ members ($R=$ rare earth). The marked softening of both phonons and their contrasting evolution with temperature reveal a competition between the two ordering tendencies. Alongside pronounced anomalies in the temperature dependence of the zone center and soft phonons, we observe the collective amplitude mode of the CDW, which collapses abruptly as ferromagnetism sets in. Surprisingly, the Kohn anomalies persist in the ferromagnetic state despite the degradation of Fermi-surface nesting conditions. Our experimental findings, supported by ab initio calculations, highlight the central role of the electron-phonon interaction in driving the CDW formation and tuning the balance between competing charge and magnetic orders.</description>

      <title>Simulated Annealing-based Candidate Optimization for Batch Acquisition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization with multi-objective acquisition functions such as q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) requires efficient candidate optimization to maximize acquisition function values. Traditional approaches rely on continuous optimization methods like Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) for candidate selection. However, these gradient-based methods can become trapped in local optima, particularly in complex or high-dimensional objective landscapes. This paper presents a simulated annealing-based approach for candidate optimization in batch acquisition functions as an alternative to conventional continuous optimization methods. We evaluate our simulated annealing approach against SLSQP across four benchmark multi-objective optimization problems: ZDT1 (30D, 2 objectives), DTLZ2 (7D, 3 objectives), Kursawe (3D, 2 objectives), and Latent-Aware (4D, 2 objectives). Our results demonstrate that simulated annealing consistently achieves superior hypervolume performance compared to SLSQP in most test functions. The improvement is particularly pronounced for DTLZ2 and Latent-Aware problems, where simulated annealing reaches significantly higher hypervolume values and maintains better convergence characteristics. The histogram analysis of objective space coverage further reveals that simulated annealing explores more diverse and optimal regions of the Pareto front. These findings suggest that metaheuristic optimization approaches like simulated annealing can provide more robust and effective candidate optimization for multi-objective Bayesian optimization, offering a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods for batch acquisition function optimization.</description>

      <title>Field-induced magnetic phase transitions and transport anomalies in GdAlSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials hosting non-zero Berry curvature have emerged as a focus of intensive research due to their exceptional magnetoelectric coupling phenomena and potential applications in next-generation spintronic devices. In this work, we successfully synthesized high-quality GdAlSi single crystals, a prototypical member of RAlX (R = rare earth elements; X = Si/Ge) family that has been theoretically predicted to sustain a non-trivial Weyl semimetal state. Through systematic investigations of magnetic and transport properties, we identified two successive antiferromagnetic transitions at critical temperatures TN1 31.9 K and TN2 31.1 K, as evidenced by temperature-dependent resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements. Notably, applied magnetic fields exceeding 8 T induce a third magnetic transition (TN3), generating a cascade of metamagnetic transitions that collectively form a dendritic phase diagram. This complex magnetic behavior is attributed to the interplay between localized Gd-4f moments and itinerant conduction electrons, possibly mediated by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Transport measurements revealed striking stepwise anomalies in magnetoresistance when crossing phase boundaries, accompanied by pronounced hysteresis loops arising from magnetic moment flopping processes. Our results not only establish GdAlSi as a rich platform for investigating correlated topological states, but also demonstrate its potential for engineering topological phase transitions through magnetic symmetry manipulation in Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Oxide Nanoelectronics by Tip-induced Electron Delocalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable oxide nanoelectronics, enabled by conductive atomic force microscope (cAFM) lithography, have established complex oxide interfaces as a promising platform for quantum engineering that harnesses emergent phenomena for advanced functionalities. However, this cAFM nanofabrication process can only occur in the air, with simultaneous device decay described under the "water-cycle" writing mechanism. These restrictions pose ongoing challenges for device optimization in the quantum regime at mK temperatures. Here, we demonstrate a "waterless" cAFM lithography approach that is compatible with vacuum and cryogenic environments. Through oxygen vacancy engineering at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, we have achieved nonvolatile and reconfigurable cAFM control of nanoscale interfacial polaron-electron liquid transition at mK temperatures with an ultrafine line resolution of 0.85 nm. Supported by first-principles calculations and drift-diffusion modeling, we show that tip-controlled oxygen vacancy electromigration plays a key role. This advancement bridges reconfigurable device fabrication and concurrent characterization in situ at mK temperatures, and establishes a versatile Hubbard toolbox for engineering programmable quantum phases in correlated oxides.</description>

      <title>Phase-field approximation of sharp-interface energies accounting for lattice symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a phase-field approximation of sharp-interface energies defined on partitions, designed for modeling grain boundaries in polycrystals. The independent variable takes values in the orthogonal group $\mathrm{O}(d)$ modulo a lattice point group $\mathcal{G}$, reflecting the crystallographic symmetries of the underlying lattice. In the sharp-interface limit, the surface energy exhibits a Read-Shockley-type behavior for small misorientation angles, scaling as $\theta|\log\theta|$. The regularized functionals are applicable to grain growth simulation and the reconstruction of grain boundaries from imaging data.</description>

      <title>Exciton coherence propagation measured with non-local four-wave mixing micro-spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherence transfer is a multi-disciplinary topic of interest, including chemistry, biology and physics. In quantum technologies, achieving non-local coherent coupling between solid-state qubits is of the utmost importance. Here, we demonstrate that excitons - i.e. electron-hole pairs bound by the Coulomb force within a quantum well - can act as a medium for mesoscopic optical coherence transfer in semiconductors. To this end, we use a femtosecond laser pulse to resonantly generate excitons within the light cone. These excitons can then either recombine radiatively or scatter out of the light cone, gaining an in-plane momentum in the process. In samples without disorder, such as the CdTe quantum wells used here, the resulting fast excitons can diffuse over mesoscopic distances before recombining radiatively. Using coherent nonlinear micro-spectroscopy, we carry out exciton time-of-flight measurements. Specifically, we monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of launched exciton wave packets, selectively observing their coherence or density on a scale of up to 10$\,\mu$m. Our proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates that free excitons inherit a phase modulation from the optical pulsed excitation and can generate coherent links within excitonic circuits, offerring a higher level of miniaturisation and compactness than photonic or polaritonic architectures.</description>

      <title>From perovskite to infinite-layer nickelates: hole concentration from x-ray absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The difficulty of determining cation concentrations and oxygen stoichiometry in infinite-layer nickelate thin films has so far prevented clear experimental identification of the nickel electron configuration in the superconducting phase. We used soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the successive changes in PrNiO$_x$ thin films at various intermediate stages of topotactic reduction with $x=2-3$. By comparing the Ni-$L$ edge spectra to single and double cluster ligand-field calculations, we find that none of our samples exhibit a pure $d^9$ configuration. Our quantitative analysis using the charge sum rule shows that even when films are maximally reduced, the averaged number of nickel $3d$ holes is 1.35. Superconducting samples have even higher values, calling into question the previously assumed limit of hole doping. Concomitant changes in the oxygen $K$-edge absorption spectra upon reduction indicate the presence of oxygen $2p$ holes, even in the most reduced films. Overall, our results suggest a complex interplay of hole doping mechanisms resulting from self-doping effects and oxygen non-stoichiometry.</description>

      <title>Ising Supercriticality and Universal Magnetocalorics in Spiral Antiferromagnet Nd$_3$BWO$_9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated analogy between the pressure-temperature phase diagram of a liquid-gas system and the field-temperature phase diagram of an Ising ferromagnet has long been a cornerstone for understanding universality in critical phenomena. Here we extend this analogy to a highly frustrated antiferromagnet, the kagome-layered spiral Ising compound Nd$_3$BWO$_9$. In its field-temperature phase diagram, we identify a critical endpoint (CEP) and an associated Ising supercritical regime (ISR). The CEP of the metamagnetic transition is located at ${\mu_0H_c} \simeq 1.04$ T and $T_c \simeq 0.3$ K. Above this point, the ISR emerges with supercritical crossover lines that adhere to a universal scaling law, as evidenced by the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Remarkably, we observe a universally divergent Grueneisen ratio near the emergent CEP, $\Gamma_H \propto 1/t^{\beta+\gamma-1}$, with ${\beta} + {\gamma} \simeq 1.563$ the critical exponents of the 3D Ising universality class and $t \equiv (T - T_c)/T_c$ the reduced temperature. Our adiabatic demagnetization measurements on Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ reveal a lowest temperature of 195 mK achieved from 2 K and 4 T. Our work opens new avenues for studying supercritical physics and efficient cooling in layered-kagome, rare-earth RE$_3$BWO$_9$ family and, more broadly, in Ising-anisotropic magnets like spin ices.</description>

      <title>High-Ti induced planar-fault transformation toward superlattice extrinsic stacking faults and microtwins in crept CoNi-based superalloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling planar fault shearing mechanisms is key for improving the high-temperature creep performance of gamma prime-strengthened high-temperature superalloys. This work examines how the Ti concentration in L12-strengthened CoNi-based alloys affects planar fault formation during creep. Interrupted compressive creep tests were conducted at 1223 K under air with a constant load stress of 241 MPa. We found, for the first time, that high Ti additions shift the dominant gamma prime shearing mode from antiphase boundaries (APBs) in Ti-free and low-Ti alloys to superlattice extrinsic stacking faults (SESFs). Systematic ab initio calculations show that in high-Ti alloys, the elevated APB energy renders APB-shearing mode unfavorable. Nevertheless, the SESF energy decreases relative to that in low-Ti compositions, and an increased ratio of complex intrinsic stacking fault (CISF) to SESF energy promote the transformation of high-energy CISFs into lower-energy SESFs. Chemical analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy further reveals that, SESFs in high-Ti alloys are enriched in Ti, Mo and W, yet no grid-like ordering is observed. Together with the ab initio calculations, Mo and W additions in high Ti alloys could facilitate the transformation from L12 structure to low-energy D024 structure, indicating Mo and W segregation along SESFs is energetically favourable. Furthermore, the successive SESF thickening facilitates microtwinning in the absence of D024 ordering along SESFs, as an additional big carrier for creep strain. These new findings clarify the role of Ti in controlling planar fault shearing mechanisms, providing new insights for optimizing the creep performance of next-generation CoNi-based superalloys.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Electrochemical CO$_2$ Capture on Redox-Active Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing climate change calls for action to control CO$_2$ pollution. Direct air and ocean capture offer a solution to this challenge. Making carbon capture competitive with alternatives, such as forestation and mineralisation, requires fundamentally novel approaches and ideas. One such approach is electrosorption, which is currently limited by the availability of suitable electrosorbents. In this work, we introduce a metal-organic copper-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$) metal-organic framework (MOF) that can act as electrosorbent for CO$_2$ capture, thereby expanding the palette of materials that can be used for this process. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ is the first MOF to switch its ability to capture and release CO$_2$ in aqueous electrolytes. By using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis, and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we demonstrate reversible CO$_2$ electrosorption. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide atomistic insights into the mechanism of electrosorption and conclude that efficient CO$_2$ capture is facilitated by a combination of redox-active copper atom and aromatic HHTP ligand within Cu3(HHTP)2. By showcasing the applicability of Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ -- with a CO$_2$ capacity of 2 mmol g$^{-1}$ and an adsorption enthalpy of -20 kJ mol$^{-1}$ - this study encourages further exploration of conductive redox-active MOFs in the search for superior CO$_2$ electrosorbents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) hinges on a comprehensive understanding of their nanostructures, yet traditional characterization methods often fall short, delivering incomplete structural snapshots. We introduce elastically filtered 3D Electron Diffraction (3D ED) as a ground-breaking technique bridging full reciprocal- and real-space structural analysis within a single transmission electron microscope (TEM). Using solvent-vapor annealed DRCN5T:PC71BM, 3D ED reproduces key structural parameters from GIWAXS including lattice spacings, coherence lengths, and mosaicity, while uniquely delivering true in-plane access and direct registration with high-resolution imaging, diffraction imaging and nano-spectroscopy on the same sample. A low-dose, distributed tilt strategy plus energy filtering yields high signal-to-background below damage thresholds. Extension to a second archetypal blend (P3HT:PC71BM; annealing evolution) demonstrates generality. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of 3D ED, particularly in analysing beam-sensitive organic thin films. This paves the way for new avenues in advanced correlative structural characterization of OSCs and holds potential for application to a multitude of other nanostructured materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organic-inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) are promising optoelectronic materials, but their instability under radiation environments restricts their durability and practical applications. Here we employ electron and synchrotron X-ray beams, individually, to investigate the radiation-induced instability of two types of OIHP single crystals (FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3). Under the electron beam, we observe that 3-point star-style cracks grow on the surface of FAPbBr3, and bricklayer-style cracks are formed on the surface of MAPbBr3. Under the X-ray beam, a new composition without organic components appears in both FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3. Such cracking and composition changes are attributed to the volatilization of organic components. We propose a volume-strain-based mechanism, in which the energy conversion results from the organic cation loss. Using nanoindentation, we reveal that beam radiations reduce the Youngs modulus and increase the hardness of both OIHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the structural and mechanical stabilities of OIHP single crystals in radiation environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first-principles approach for calculating phonon-polariton dispersion relations. In this approach, phonon-photon interaction is described by quantization of a Hamiltonian that describes harmonic lattice vibrations coupled with the electromagnetic field inside the material. All Hamiltonian parameters are obtained from first-principles calculations, with diagonalization leading to non-interacting polariton quasiparticles. This method naturally includes retardation effects and resolves non-analytical behavior and ambiguities in phonon frequencies at the Brillouin zone center, especially in non-cubic and optically anisotropic materials. Furthermore, by incorporating higher-order terms in the Hamiltonian, we also account for quasiparticle interactions and spectral broadening. Specifically, we show how anharmonic effects in phonon polaritons lead to a dielectric response that challenges traditional models. The accuracy and consequences of the approach are demonstrated on GaP and GaN as harmonic test systems and PbTe and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ as anharmonic test systems.</description>

      <title>Engineering Altermagnetism via Layer Shifts and Spin Order in Bilayer MnPS$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetic materials combine compensated magnetic order with momentum-dependent spin splitting, offering a fundamentally new route for spintronic functionality beyond conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. While most studies have focused on three-dimensional compounds, the emergence of altermagnetism in few-layer two-dimensional materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that bilayer MnPS$_3$, a prototypical 2D van der Waals magnet, can host stacking-induced altermagnetic phases. Using density-functional theory and spin-Laue symmetry analysis, we show that interlayer spin alignment and lateral displacement act as coupled symmetry control parameters that switch the system between Type II (collinear AFM) and Type III (altermagnetic) phases. Our systematic exploration reveals how specific stacking geometries enable momentum-dependent spin polarization without net magnetization, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. These results establish stacking engineering as a powerful, purely structural route for designing tunable altermagnetic states in 2D magnets, opening pathways toward symmetry-driven spintronic and magnetoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric power factors of defective scandium nitride nanostructures from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermoelectric properties of scandium nitride are strongly influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects and impurities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these microscopic features affect transport are not yet fully understood. Experiments show a large variability in the electronic transport properties, with a strong dependence on the experimental conditions, and attempts to improve thermoelectric efficiency often lead to conflicting effects. In this work, we employ the Landauer approach to analyze the effects of different kinds of structural defects and impurities on electronic transport in scandium nitride. This approach allows us to relate the transport mechanisms to the structural and electronic modifications introduced in the lattice, with atomistic resolution. In light of these new insights, we propose a rationale relating part of the experimental variability to its microscopic origin.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials Enable Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Doped MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first computational framework for molecular dynamics simulation of MoS2 doped with 25 elements spanning metals, non-metals, and transition metals using Meta's Universal Model for Atoms machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP). Benchmarking against density functional theory calculations demonstrates the accuracy of the MLIP for simulating doped-MoS2 systems and highlights opportunities for improvement. Using the MLIP, we perform heating-cooling simulations of doped-MoS2 supercells. The simulations capture complex phenomena including dopant clustering, MoS2 layer fracturing, interlayer diffusion, and chemical compound formation at orders-of-magnitude reduced computational cost compared to density functional theory. This work provides an open-source computational workflow for application-oriented design of doped-MoS2, enabling high-throughput screening of dopant candidates and optimization of compositions for targeted tribological, electronic, and optoelectronic performance. The MLIP bridges the accuracy-efficiency gap between first-principles methods and empirical potentials, and the framework offers unprecedented opportunities for large-scale materials discovery in two-dimensional doped material systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a novel class of collinear magnetic materials, exhibit unique spin-split band structures, yet topological insulating states in intrinsic altermagnetic systems are rare. Here, we identify monolayer Fe$_2X_2$O ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) as a new family of 2D altermagnetic real Chern insulators. These materials display robust $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering, semiconducting band gaps, and nontrivial real Chern numbers per spin channel, yielding spin-polarized topological corner modes. They also feature spin-polarized valleys with strong altermagnetism-valley-spin-lattice coupling, enabling valley-selective excitation via linear dichroism and strain-induced valley polarization. In multiferroic Fe$_2$Cl$_2$O, magnetism coexists with ferroelasticity, and an applied strain can switch the N\'eel vector. These findings position 2D iron oxyhalides as a promising platform for exploring altermagnetism and magnetic topological states for spintronics and valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Effective-Hamiltonian reconstruction through Bloch-wave interferometry in bulk GaAs driven by strong THz fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26028v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective Hamiltonians (EHs) are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter. Reconstructing an EH directly from experimental data is challenging due to the intricate relationship between EH parameters and observables. Complementary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for EH reconstruction (EHR). We reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole (e-h) Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG induced by quasi-cw NIR and THz lasers. We perform polarimetry of high-order sidebands while varying the wavelength and polarization of the NIR laser and the strength of the THz field, to systematically explore the information encoded in the sidebands. Based on previous understanding of HSG in GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry (BWI), an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the EH parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in GaAs are known from existing experiments, we show that the GaAs bandgap, two dephasing constants associated with two e-h species, and an EH parameter that determines the e-h reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through BWI. We demonstrate that full EHR can be achieved by combining HSG measurements with absorbance spectroscopy. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is about 10\,meV higher than the value inferred from previous absorbance measurements. Quantum-kinetic analysis suggests that the e-h energy in HSG may be renormalized through Fr\"ohlich interaction that is modified by a strong THz field. We show that the energy threshold for optical-phonon emission can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates.</description>

      <title>Density-dependent sodium-storage mechanisms in hard carbon materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the sodium-storage mechanism in hard carbon (HC) anodes is crucial for advancing sodium-ion battery (SIB) technology. However, the intrinsic complexity of HC microstructures and their interactions with sodium remain not fully elucidated. We present a multiscale methodology that integrates grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with a machine-learning interatomic potential based on the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework to investigate sodium insertion mechanisms in hard carbons with different levels of porosity, achieved by simulating structural models with densities ranging from 0.7 to 1.9 g cm$^{-3}$. Structural and thermodynamic analyses reveal the interplay between pore size and accessibility and the relative contributions of adsorption, intercalation, and pore filling to the overall storage capacity. Low-density carbons favor pore-filling, achieving extremely high capacities at near-zero voltages, whereas high-density carbons primarily store sodium through adsorption and intercalation, leading to lower but more stable capacities. Intermediate-density carbons ($1.3-1.6$ g cm$^{-3}$) provide the most balanced performance, combining moderate capacity (480 and 310 mAh g$^{-1}$), safe operating voltages, and minimal volume expansion ($&lt;10$\%). These findings establish a direct correlation between carbon density and electrochemical behavior, providing atomic-scale insight into how hard carbon morphology governs sodium-storage. The proposed framework offers a rational design principle for optimizing HC-based SIB anodes toward high energy density and long-term cycling stability.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Structures Database from Symmetry-aided High-Throughput Calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic structures, which play a central role in determining their physical properties, are known for only very limited compounds. Traditional theoretical methods based on first-principles calculations are fundamentally limited by the need to calculate a large space of input magnetic configurations. Here we introduce a symmetry-aided strategy based on Landau's phase transition theory. By utilizing the crystallographic space group and the Wyckoff positions of magnetic ions, we narrow down the initial magnetic configurations to a limited number of candidates via the analysis of the group representations. The magnetic ground state is subsequently determined by the lowest energy of those well-seleted magnetic configurations via first-principles calculations. Benchmarking calculations were performed on a subset of the MAGNDATA database with wave vector q=0 and fewer than 40 atoms per unit cell, comprising 302 materials. Our method successfully identified the magnetic structures for 212 of these materials. We further apply our highly efficient method to 7,520 stoichiometric transition metal compounds with fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and establish a magnetic structure database containing 2,900 magnetic materials. To demonstrate the utility of our database, we apply it to the systematic exploration of magnetic topological phases and altermagnets, leading to the identification of 1,070 and 392 instances, respectively.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. This study investigates ion-exchange kinetics within silicate glasses, operating under the Nernst-Planck binary interdiffusion regime. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</description>

      <title>Crystal Generation using the Fully Differentiable Pipeline and Latent Space Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a materials generation framework that couples a symmetry-conditioned variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a differentiable SO(3) power spectrum objective to steer candidates toward a specified local environment under the crystallographic constraints. In particular, we implement a fully differentiable pipeline to enable batch-wise optimization on both direct and latent crystallographic representations. Using the GPU acceleration, this implementation achieves about fivefold speed compared to our previous CPU workflow, while yielding comparable outcomes. In addition, we introduce the optimization strategy that alternatively performs optimization on the direct and latent crystal representations. This dual-level relaxation approach can effectively escape local minima defined by different objective gradients, thus increasing the success rate of generating complex structures satisfying the target local environments. This framework can be extended to systems consisting of multi-components and multi-environments, providing a scalable route to generate material structures with the target local environment.</description>

      <title>Scalable Dielectric Tensor Predictions for Inorganic Materials using Equivariant Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of dielectric tensors is essential for accelerating the discovery of next-generation inorganic dielectric materials. Existing machine learning approaches, such as equivariant graph neural networks, typically rely on specially-designed network architectures to enforce O(3) equivariance. However, to preserve equivariance, these specially-designed models restrict the update of equivariant features during message passing to linear transformations or gated equivariant nonlinearities. The inability to implicitly characterize more complex nonlinear structures may reduce the predictive accuracy of the model. In this study, we introduce a frame-averaging-based approach to achieve equivariant dielectric tensor prediction. We propose GoeCTP, an O(3)-equivariant framework that predicts dielectric tensors without imposing any structural restrictions on the backbone network. We benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art models and further employ it for large-scale virtual screening of thermodynamically stable materials from the Materials Project database. GoeCTP successfully identifies various promising candidates, such as Zr(InBr$_3$)$_2$ (band gap $E_g = 2.41$ eV, dielectric constant $\overline{\varepsilon} = 194.72$) and SeI$_2$ (anisotropy ratio $\alpha_r = 96.763$), demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency in accelerating the discovery of advanced inorganic dielectric materials.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new weberite-type antiferroelectric: La3NbO7</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferroelectrics are antipolar materials which possess an electric field-induced phase transition to a polar, ferroelectric phase and offer significant potential for sensing/actuation and energy-storage applications. Known antiferroelectrics are relatively scarce and mainly based on a limited set of perovskite materials and their alloys (e.g., PbZrO$_3$, AgNbO$_3$, NaNbO$_3$). Here, a new family of lead-free, weberite-type antiferroelectrics, identified through a large-scale, first-principles computational search is introduced. The screening methodology, which connects lattice dynamics to antipolar distortions, predicted that La$_3$NbO$_7$ could exhibit antiferroelectricity. We confirm the prediction through the synthesis and characterization of epitaxial La$_3$NbO$_7$ thin films, which display the signature double hysteresis loops of an antiferroelectric material as well as clear evidence of an antipolar ground state structure from transmission electron microscopy. The antiferroelectricity in La$_3$NbO$_7$ is simpler than most known antiferroelectrics and can be explained by a Kittel-type mechanism involving the movement of niobium atoms in an oxygen octahedron through a single phonon mode which results in a smaller change in the volume during the field-induced phase transition. Additionally, it is found that La$_3$NbO$_7$ combines a high threshold field with a high breakdown field ($\approx$ 6MV/cm) - which opens up opportunities for energy-storage applications. This new weberite-type family of materials offers many opportunities to tune electrical and temperature response especially through substitutions on the rare-earth site. Ultimately, this work demonstrates a successful data-driven theory-to-experiment discovery of an entirely new family of antiferroelectrics and provides a blueprint for the future design of ferroic materials.</description>

      <title>Anomalously High Phonon Thermal Conductivity Driven by Weak Electron-Phonon Coupling in Weyl Semimetals TaAs and TaP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In conventional metals, thermal transport is governed by electrons, with phonon contributions often considered negligible. Here, through rigorous first-principles calculations, we uncover a phonon-dominated thermal transport regime in the Weyl semimetals TaAs and TaP. Remarkably, although TaP is metallic, its phonon thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\text{ph}}$) reaches as high as 171 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, surpassing its electronic counterpart by more than a factor of five. This anomalously high $\kappa_{\text{ph}}$ is enabled by the unique electronic and phononic band structures, characterized by the Weyl nodes near the Fermi level, together with acoustic phonon bunching and a wide frequency gap in the phonon spectrum, which collectively suppress phonon-electron and phonon-phonon scattering processes. Due to the substantial phonon contribution, the derived Lorenz number deviates strongly from the conventional Wiedemann-Franz law. We further show that the significance of phonon thermal transport is universal across topological semimetals. Our work provides deeper insight into thermal transport mechanisms in topological semimetals and extends the scope for discovering materials with high thermal conductivity.</description>

Abstract: A codimension-two spiral spin-liquid is a correlated paramagnetic state with one-dimensional ground state degeneracy hosted within a three-dimensional lattice. Here, via neutron scattering experiments and numerical simulations, we establish the existence of a codimension-two spiral spin-liquid in the effective honeycomb-lattice compound Cs$_3$Fe$_2$Cl$_9$, which demonstrates a novel path to spiral spin-liquids by overcoming the long-standing impediment of weak further-neighbor interactions. In the long-range ordered regime, competing spiral and spin density wave orders emerge as a function of applied magnetic field, among which a possible order-by-disorder transition is identified.</description>

Abstract: We present a workflow that iteratively combines \textit{ab-initio} calculations with a machine-learning (ML) guided search for superconducting compounds with both dynamical stability and instability from imaginary phonon modes, the latter of which have been largely overlooked in previous studies. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) properties and critical temperature (T$_c$) of 417 boron, carbon, and borocarbide compounds have been calculated with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and isotropic Eliashberg approximation. Our study addresses T$_c$ convergence of Brillouin zone sampling with an ansatz test, stabilizing imaginary phonon modes for significant EPC contributions and comparing performance of two ML models especially when including compounds of dynamical instability. We predict a few promising superconducting compounds with formation energy just above the ground state convex hull, such as Ca$_5$B$_3$N$_6$ (35 K), TaNbC$_2$ (28.4 K), Nb$_3$B$_3$C (16.4 K), Y$_2$B$_3$C$_2$ (4.0 K), Pd$_3$CaB (7.0 K), MoRuB$_2$ (15.6 K), RuVB$_2$ (15.0 K), RuSc$_3$C$_4$ (6.6 K) among others.</description>

Abstract: We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose--Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose--Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. The chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion becomes the nonabelian Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. We argue that a chiral (pseudo-)spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of this Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall effect in Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.</description>

      <title>Low-loss Nb on Si superconducting resonators from a dual-use spintronics deposition chamber and with acid-free post-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities are known to degrade superconductivity. For this reason, physical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic materials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting resonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can be used for this purpose; with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for magnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (\SI{3}{\micro\meter} gap) coplanar waveguide resonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve this using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which results in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments. We also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better surface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing. These results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods, including a \SI{700}{\celsius} anneal. These results will inform nanofabrication for other superconducting materials and the integration of magnetic materials for hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Refractive Index, Its Chromatic Dispersion, and Thermal Coefficients of Four Less Common Glycols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report comprehensive measurements of the refractive index as a function of wavelength and temperature for four less commonly studied glycols: pentaethylene glycol, hexaethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol (mixture of isomers), and tripropylene glycol. The measurements cover the spectral range of 0.39-1.07 ${\mu}$m and temperatures from 1${\deg}$C to 45${\deg}$C. The data were modeled using a two-pole Sellmeier equation, with temperature dependence expressed through wavelength-dependent thermal coefficients. Four fitting models (Sellmeier and Cauchy) with different numbers of parameters were tested. For pentaethylene glycol, results from all models are shown; for the remaining glycols, only the two-pole Sellmeier fits are presented in tabular form. Thermal coefficient values for six wavelengths of practical importance are also tabulated. Experimental uncertainties in refractive index, wavelength, and temperature were rigorously evaluated and incorporated into the analysis. The influence of sample purity, including residual water content and manufacturer-reported impurities, was assessed and accounted for in the uncertainty estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset to systematically characterize both chromatic dispersion and thermal variation of the refractive index for these glycols over such a broad spectral and temperature range. The validated fitting equations and parameters are suitable for use in optical modeling, materials characterisation, and related applications. All raw data are available in a publicly accessible repository.</description>

      <title>The Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lee-Wick pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in the presence of a Chern-Simons term is studied in this paper. The paper starts with a non-local lagrangian density that sets the pseudo-Lee-Wick electrodynamics defined on a $1+2$ space-time added to a non-local Chern-Simons topological term. Thus, we obtain the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics as a most complete gauge invariant model that provides a light mass associated with the Chern-Simons parameter, and also includes a Lee-Wick heavy mass. We investigate classical aspects as the potential energy for the interaction of static charges through the gauge propagator. The causality of theory is discussed through the retarded Green function in the coordinate space. The gauge field of the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is minimally coupled to the fermions sector that includes new degree of freedoms, as a Lee-Wick heavy fermion partner of the electron. The perturbative approach for the theory is presented via effective action in which we obtain the Ward identities. We study the quantum corrections at one loop, as the electron self-energy, the vacuum polarization, and the $3$-vertex. We show that the Lee-Wick mass has a fundamental role in these results, where it works like a natural regulator of the ultraviolet divergences. The $g-2$ factor for the electron is obtained as function of the LW mass, and of the CS parameter. Through the optical theorem, the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is unitary at the tree level.</description>

      <title>TBPLaS 2.0: a Tight-Binding Package for Large-scale Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The common exact diagonalization-based techniques to solving tight-binding models suffer from O(N^2) and O(N^3) scaling with respect to model size in memory and CPU time, hindering their applications in large tight-binding models. On the contrary, the tight-binding propagation method (TBPM) can achieve linear scaling in both memory and CPU time, and is capable of handling large tight-binding models with billions of orbitals. In this paper, we introduce version 2.0 of TBPLaS, a package for large-scale simulation based on TBPM. This new version brings significant improvements with many new features. Existing Python/Cython modeling tools have been thoroughly optimized, and a compatible C++ implementation of the modeling tools is now available, offering efficiency enhancement of several orders. The solvers have been rewritten in C++ from scratch, with the efficiency enhanced by several times or even by an order of magnitude. The workflow of utilizing solvers has also been unified into a more comprehensive and consistent manner. New features include spin texture, Berry curvature and Chern number calculation, partial diagonalization for specific eigenvalues and eigenstates, analytical Hamiltonian, and GPU computing support. The documentation and tutorials have also been updated to the new version. In this paper, we discuss the revisions with respect to version 1.3 and demonstrate the new features. Benchmarks on modeling tools and solvers are also provided.</description>

      <title>A Universal Chern Model on Arbitrary Triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a triangulation of a closed orientable surface, we place single-mode resonators or single-orbital artificial atoms at its vertices, edges and facets, and we devise near-neighbor hopping terms derived from the boundary and Poincar\'e duality maps of the simplicial complex of the triangulation. Regardless of the surface or its triangulation, these terms always lead to tight-binding Hamiltonians with large and clean topological spectral gaps, carrying non-trivial Chern numbers in the limit of infinite refinement of the triangulation. We confirm this via numerical simulations, and demonstrate how these models enable topological edge modes at the surfaces of real-world objects. Furthermore, we describe a metamaterial whose dynamics reproduces that of the proposed model, thus bringing the topological metamaterials closer to real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Symbolic regression for defect interactions in 2D materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.</description>

      <title>MiST: Understanding the Role of Mid-Stage Scientific Training in Developing Chemical Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.</description>
