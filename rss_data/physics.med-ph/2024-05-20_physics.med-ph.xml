      <title>Aligner-induced tooth movements in three dimensions using clinical data of two patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of optically transparent aligners in orthodontic treatments should be quantified for the individual teeth. To this end, the tooth positions and orientation changes in the three-dimensional space were determined by means of registered, weekly obtained intraoral scans of two patients. The data show the movement and orientation changes of the individual crowns of the upper and lower jaws as the result of the forces generated by the series of aligners applied. During the first weeks, the canines and incisors are more affected than the premolars and molars. We detected an overall tooth movement of 1 mm related to a magnitude of extrusion/intrusion of 0.4 mm during a nine week treatment. The data on the orthodontic treatments indicate to what extent the actual tooth movement stays behind the planning represented by the used aligner shapes. The proposed procedure can not only be applied to quantify the clinical outcome of the therapy, but also to improve the planning of the orthodontic treatment for dedicated patients.</description>

      <title>Secondary spectrum after shieldings in x-ray rooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Calculating the characteristics of radiation emerging from radiation shielding to determine the level of safety in protected areas has been a widely studied topic in Radiation Protection due to its importance for the protection of the public and professionals. Methods: This work provides spatial distributions of energy spectra of emergent photons after shielding barriers. These distributions are obtained through Monte Carlo simulations using monoenergetic pencil photon beams incident on shielding barriers of different materials and thicknesses. The obtained results are applied to calculate the spectra of transmitted radiation in cases of polyenergetic beams similar to those encountered in clinical practice. Results: The significant contribution of secondary radiation in the radiation found behind shields is demonstrated across a wide range of energies, barrier thicknesses and barrier materials. Conclusion: It is shown that characterizing shields using their response to monoenergetic pencil beams provides a useful tool for characterizing radiation behind shields in a wide range of practical situations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Proton Therapy Using CBCT-Guided Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to develop a digital twin (DT) framework to enhance adaptive proton stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer. Prostate SBRT has emerged as a leading option for external beam radiotherapy due to its effectiveness and reduced treatment duration. However, interfractional anatomy variations can impact treatment outcomes. This study seeks to address these uncertainties using DT concept, with the goal of improving treatment quality, potentially revolutionizing prostate radiotherapy to offer personalized treatment solutions. Our study presented a pioneering approach that leverages DT technology to enhance adaptive proton SBRT. The framework improves treatment plans by utilizing patient-specific CTV setup uncertainty, which is usually smaller than conventional clinical setups. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of prostate radiotherapy, with ultimate goals of improving patient outcomes and life quality.</description>
