      <title>Direct Sum Structure of the Super Virasoro Algebra and a Fermion Algebra Arising from the Quantum Toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the $q$-deformed Virasoro algebra can be constructed from a certain representation of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ algebra. In this paper, we apply the same construction to the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ and study the properties of the resulting generators $W_i(z)$ ($i=1,2$). The algebra generated by $W_i(z)$ can be regarded as a $q$-deformation of the direct sum $\mathsf{F} \oplus \mathsf{SVir}$, where $\mathsf{F}$ denotes the free fermion algebra and $\mathsf{SVir}$ stands for the $N=1$ super Virasoro algebra, also referred to as the $N=1$ superconformal algebra or the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond algebra. Moreover, we find that the generators $W_i(z)$ admit two screening currents, whose degeneration limits coincide with the screening currents of $\mathsf{SVir}$. We also establish the quadratic relations satisfied by the $W_i(z)$ and show that they generate a pair of commuting $q$-deformed Virasoro algebras, which degenerate into two nontrivial commuting Virasoro algebras included in $\mathsf{F} \oplus \mathsf{SVir}$.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Extensions of Unitary Vertex Operator Algebras and Conformal Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $V$ be one of the following unitary strongly-rational VOAs: unitary WZW models, discrete series W-algebras of type ADE, even lattice VOAs, parafermion VOAs, their tensor products, and their strongly-rational cosets. Let $U$ be a (unitary) VOA extension of $V$, described by a Q-system $Q$.
  We prove that $U$ is strongly local. Let $\mathcal A_V,\mathcal A_U$ be the conformal nets associated to $V,U$ in the sense of Carpi-Kawahigashi-Longo-Weiner (CKLW). We prove that $\mathcal A_U$ is canonically isomorphic to the conformal net extension of $\mathcal A_V$ defined by the Q-system $Q$.
  We prove that all unitary $U$-modules are strongly integrable in the sense of Carpi-Weiner-Xu (CWX). We show that the CWX $*$-functor from the $C^*$-category of unitary $U$-modules to the $C^*$-category of finite-index $\mathcal A_U$-modules is naturally isomorphic to $*$-functor defined by $Q$.</description>

      <title>Shifted twisted Yangians and finite $W$-algebras of classical type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce parabolic presentations of twisted Yangians of types AI and AII, interpolating between the R-matrix presentation and the Drinfeld presentation. Then we formulate and provide parabolic presentations for the shifted twisted Yangians. We define quotient algebras known as truncated shifted twisted Yangians and equip them with baby comultiplications, generalizing the work of Brundan and Kleshchev. PBW bases for all (truncated) shifted twisted Yangians of type AI and AII are established along the way. Applying the theory of universal equivariant quantizations of conic symplectic singularities we show that the truncated twisted shifted Yangian is isomorphic to the finite $W$-algebra which quantizes a suitable Slodowy slice. This provides a presentation of the finite $W$-algebra associated with every even nilpotent element in type {\sf B} and {\sf C}, as well as every nilpotent element with two Jordan blocks in type {\sf D}. Finally we make a conjecture which would supply presentations in the remaining even cases in type {\sf D}.</description>

      <title>Homology of Yang-Baxter modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Yang-Baxter operator for the vector representation $V_m$ of the quantum group $U_q(sl_m)$. We consider the one-term Yang-Baxter homology with coefficients in $V_m$-modules and provide a direct sum decomposition of the one term Yang-Baxter chain complex. The homology is explicitly computed for some specific $V_m$-modules.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of affine Hecke algebras with unequal parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a $K$-theoretic realization of all affine Hecke algebras with two unequal parameters including exceptional types. This extends the celebrated work of Kazhdan and Lusztig, who gave a $K$-theoretic realization of affine Hecke algebras with equal parameters, and complements results of Kato, who extended this construction to the three-parameter affine Hecke algebra of type $C$. A key idea behind our new construction is to exploit the reducibility of the adjoint representation in small characteristic. We also show that under suitable geometric conditions, our construction leads to a Deligne-Langlands style classification of simple modules. We verify these geometric conditions for $G_2$ thereby obtaining a full geometric classification of the simple modules for the affine Hecke algebra of $G_2$ with two parameters away from roots of unities.</description>

      <title>Spectral dimension of $p$-adic integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of spectral dimension was introduced by Chakraborty and Pal in \cite{cp}. In this paper, we show that the spectral dimension of the ring of $p$-adic integers, $\mathbb{Z}_p$, is equal to its manifold dimension, which is $0$. Finally, we determine the $K$-groups of $\mathbb{Z}_p$, and show that the generators of $K_0(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ can be expressed as finite span of the characters of $\mathbb{Z}_p$.</description>

      <title>Self-distributive structures, braces &amp; the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is reviewed from a purely algebraic point of view. We recall certain algebraic structures called shelves, racks and quandles. These objects satisfy a self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We also recall that non-involutive solutions of the braid equation are obtained from shelf and rack solutions by a suitable parametric twist, whereas all involutive set-theoretic solutions are reduced to the flip map via a parametric twist. The notion of braces is also presented as the suitable algebraic structure associated to involutive set-theoretic solutions. The quantum algebra as well as the integrability of Baxterized involutive set-theoretic solutions is also discussed. The explicit form of the Drinfel'd twist is presented allowing the derivation of general set-theoretic solutions.</description>

      <title>On a specialization of Toda eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies rational functions $\mathfrak{J}_\alpha(q)$, which depend on a positive element $\alpha$ of the root lattice of a root system. These functions arise as Shapovalov pairings of Whittaker vectors in Verma modules of highest weight $-\rho$ for quantum groups and as Hilbert series of Zastava spaces, and are related to the Toda system. They are specializations of multivariate functions more commonly studied in the literature. We investigate the denominator of these rational functions and give an explicit combinatorial formula for the numerator in type A. We also propose a conjectural realization of the numerator as the Poincar\'e polynomial of a smooth variety in type A.</description>
