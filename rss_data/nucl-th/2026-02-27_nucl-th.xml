      <title>Impact of Geometric Inflation on Nucleon Size Sensitivity in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic transverse size of nucleons, parameterized by a Gaussian width $w$, is a critical yet uncertain input in the initial-state modeling of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Using a finite $w$ in standard initial geometry models introduces an unintentional ``geometric inflation'' that alters the initial nuclear density profile. In this study, we implement a self-consistent density correction to eliminate this artifact and investigate its impact on final-state observables. Through hybrid (viscous hydrodynamics + hadronic transport) simulations of $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb collisions at the LHC, we demonstrate that removing geometric inflation significantly modifies the sensitivity of observables to the nucleon width $w$. While elliptic flow and mean transverse momentum ($\langle [p_{\rm T}]\rangle$) become less sensitive to variations in $w$, the Pearson correlation coefficient $\rho(v_{n}^{2}, \delta p_{\rm T})$, $[p_{\rm T}]$ fluctuations, and triangular flow exhibit enhanced sensitivity to fluctuations in nucleon positions. Our results indicate that uncorrected geometric inflation can bias the extraction of nucleon structure and quark-gluon plasma properties. This underscores the necessity of a self-consistent initial-state geometry for reliable Bayesian inference in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>The shape of transverse momentum spectra in hybrid hydrodynamic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scaled transverse momentum spectra over a wide parameter space of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulation models in order to learn what information can be obtained from the shape of identified-particle spectra -- previously observed to be surprisingly universal across centrality and collision systems in both experimental data and hydrodynamic simulations. We study its sensitivity to each of 17 model parameters in the context of 4 different models for particlization when switching from the hydro description to the kinetic theory afterburner. We find that the strongest sensitivity is to parameters relating to bulk viscosity, free-streaming time, and the $\texttt{T$_\mathrm{R}$ENTo}$ nucleon width parameter $w$. However, we find that the model generally has surprisingly little flexibility in describing the scaled spectrum observable, despite the large number of parameters.
  Within this small range of parameter dependence, we further find significant tension in a simultaneous description of momentum-integrated observables. In particular, while the mean transverse momentum prefers a large value of the nucleon width parameter $w$, a small value is required to obtain scaled spectra that are consistent with experimental measurements. We speculate on the origin of these model tensions and possible missing physics in the commonly-used $\texttt{T$_\mathrm{R}$ENTo}$+free streaming+hydro+afterburner simulation model.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-imposed correlation in nuclear level statistics: The spin distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite long-term research, the origin of spin cutoff in the angular-momentum (spin) distribution of nuclear level densities remains incompletely elucidated. We demonstrate that this problem can be traced back to Bethe's assumption that nucleons in finite Fermi systems are independent random variables. By constructing a statistical ensemble that enforces rotational invariance through angular-momentum coupling, we obtain an analytical expression for the spin cutoff parameter, which includes a previously unidentified finite-population correction. Our results show that, even in the absence of interactions, nuclear many-body states exhibit non-negligible correlations arising from fermionic antisymmetry and angular-momentum coupling. From this perspective, spin cutoff may be interpreted as a quantitative measure of correlation imposed by symmetry in nuclear level statistics.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of non-flow correlations in pp and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the two-particle cumulant in pp, d-Au, and Au-Au collisions. The two-particle cumulant was treated as an event-by-event distribution, and its skewness and kurtosis were analyzed. The non-flow correlations, like jets and decays, constantly produced a skewed distribution, regardless of the model used. On the contrary, HYDJET++ produced a smooth Gaussian distribution at higher $\eta$ windows in fixed impact parameter collisions. The skewness increased consistently for higher $\eta$ windows in all non-QGP models like PYTHIA, PHOJET, QGSJET, and DPMJET. The kurtosis of the distribution also increased with $\eta$ windows in non-QGP models. The skewness and kurtosis of the distributions produced by HYDJET++ decreased with $\Delta\eta$ and eventually reached zero at higher $\Delta\eta$.</description>

      <title>Space-time regions of high baryon density and baryon stopping in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-volumes ($V_4=$ spatial-3-volume$\times$lifetime) are calculated within the model of three-fluid dynamics (3FD) and compared with those of the the JET AA Microscopic Transport Model (JAM). The calculations are performed for central Au+Au collisions at energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3 -- 19.6 GeV. These $V_4$ indicate optimal collision-energy ranges for realizing macroscopic high baryon-density matter. It is found that the 3FD four-volumes noticeably exceed those in the JAM, which indicates a stronger baryon stopping in the 3FD model as compared to that JAM. It is argued that this difference in the baryon stopping correlates with stiffness of the EoS implemented in these models. Contrary to JAM, the four-volume, where a baryon density ($n_B$) exceeds three times the normal nuclear density ($n_0$), does not exhibit a maximum as a function of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. It decreases monotonically with increasing $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, remaining at a fairly macroscopic level (i.e. $V_4\geq 5.5^4$ fm$^4$/c). For higher baryon densities, $V_4$ exhibits maxima in its dependence on $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. The optimal energy range for densities $n_B/n_0&gt;$ 4 is located at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3.2--8 GeV. Even for $n_B/n_0&gt;$ 6, the four-volume remains quite macroscopic ($V_4\geq 4^4$ fm$^4$/c) at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 4.5--9 GeV contrary to the JAM.</description>

      <title>CREX and PREX-II reconciled within energy-density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CREX and PREX-II measurements of the neutron-skin thickness of 48Ca and 208Pb challenge standard nuclear energy-density functional (EDF) descriptions of nuclei and nuclear matter. We show that the apparent tension arises from an implicit constraint in EDF theory, which ties the density dependence of the functional at the dilute nuclear surface to that of uniform matter near saturation. Relaxing this surface-bulk coupling and independently constraining the dilute-density sector, while preserving realistic saturation and high-density behavior, yields EDFs that simultaneously reproduce the neutron skins of both nuclei, their electric dipole polarizabilities, and neutron-star mass-radius relations. The established correlation between the neutron-skin thickness and the symmetry-energy slope parameter L at saturation is retained but becomes substantially broader. The results show that current neutron-skin data do not require extreme values of L and highlight an underconstrained degree of freedom associated with low-density nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Towards a microscopic description of 12C+12C fusion at stellar energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a fully microscopic description of the 12C+12C fusion reaction at stellar energies. Utilizing the multichannel Resonating Group Method (RGM), my model explicitly includes 12C+12C and alpha+20Ne reaction channels (with excited states). This approach provides a consistent, simultaneous, description of fusion, elastic scattering, and 24Mg spectroscopy. Results for 12C+12C elastic scattering show excellent agreement with experimental data, significantly improving the single-channel approximations. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that 24Mg states and resonances are highly mixed configurations, contradicting the concept of pure "molecular states." The calculated fusion S-factor is consistent with available experimental data and predicts both narrow and broad resonances near the Coulomb barrier. Main resonance widths originate primarily from the alpha+20Ne exit channels. The S-factor exhibits a decrease at low energies, providing a microscopic support for the hypothesis of fusion hindrance. This work is a first step towards a reliable theoretical extrapolation of the 12C+12C reaction to deep stellar burning temperatures. Future works should include the neutron and proton channels to provide a complete description of the 12C+12C fusion.</description>

      <title>The Delta-isobar masquerade: intrahadronic phase transitions and their quark-mimicking signatures in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which $\Delta(1232)$ isobars trigger a first-order phase transition within purely hadronic neutron-star matter, using the SW4L relativistic mean-field parametrization. For scalar-vector coupling differences $0.15 \lesssim x_{\sigma\Delta} - x_{\omega\Delta} \lesssim 0.2$ and $x_{\sigma\Delta} \gtrsim 1.3$, the onset of $\Delta^-$ resonances produces a van der Waals-like instability driven by a self-amplifying feedback in the scalar meson sector, in which the $\Delta^-$ particle fraction acts as the order parameter of a Landau-type transition. A Maxwell construction yields a sharp density discontinuity at baryon densities $n_b \sim (1.3$-$2)\,n_0$, separating a $\Delta$-free outer core from a $\Delta$-rich inner core. The resulting neutron-star sequences satisfy all current multimessenger constraints: maximum masses $M_{\rm max} \approx 2.15$-$2.25\,M_\odot$, radii $R_{1.4} \approx 11$-$12$ km, and tidal deformabilities $\Lambda_{1.4} \approx 190$-$480$, compatible with NICER observations and GW170817. We compute, for the first time for a $\Delta$-induced interface, the $\ell = 2$ composition $g$-mode eigenfrequencies, obtaining $\nu_g \sim 400$-$1100$ Hz with gravitational-wave damping times $\tau_g \sim 10^3$-$10^9$ s. These frequencies overlap quantitatively with those predicted for hadron-quark phase-transition interfaces, demonstrating that the mass-radius ``knee'', reduced tidal deformability, and $g$-mode spectrum conventionally regarded as signatures of quark deconfinement can be reproduced by a purely intrahadronic mechanism. This extends the masquerade problem from static observables to the domain of gravitational-wave asteroseismology, implying that a future detection of a discontinuity $g$-mode alone would not suffice to identify quark matter in neutron-star cores.</description>

      <title>Nuclear binding, correlations, and the $A$-dependence of the EMC effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurements of inclusive electron scattering from nuclear targets carried out at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in the mid 2000s have provided valuable novel information on the $A$-dependence of the modifications of nuclear structure functions known as EMC effect.We argue that these data are best described in terms of the scaling variable $\widetilde{y}$, designed to take into account dynamical effects in interacting many-particle systems, and analyse the $A$-dependence of the slope of the inclusive cross section ratios, $R_A = (\sigma_A/A)/(\sigma_2/2)$, providing a measure of the size of the EMC effect in the region where nuclear binding plays a leading role. The results of our study reveal a linear correlation between $dR_A(\widetilde{y})/d\widetilde{y}$ and the average nucleon removal energy $\langle E_A \rangle$. The role of correlation effects in the determination of $\langle E_A \rangle$ is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation for Hard Partons in a Gluonic Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a fluctuation dissipation relation connecting the drag and diffusion jet transport coefficients for an energetic light quark traversing a non-perturbative thermalized gluon plasma. The hard quark is taken to be close to on-shell, with an energy scale parametrically larger than the medium temperature. We introduce a general complex-valued function for each transport coefficient. Evaluating these in the deep Euclidean momentum region enables their expression in terms of local operators. Using contour-integration techniques, we relate these local operators, after vacuum subtraction, to the physical transport coefficients that arise along a branch cut, close to light-like dispersion. The derived relation relates the longitudinal drag coefficient to the longitudinal and transverse diffusion coefficients, a $4^{\rm th}$ order fluctuation, and the thermal gluon condensate.</description>

      <title>Flavorful Lepton Number Violation at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the prospects of detecting flavorful lepton number violation at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) through resonant production of heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), resulting in $e^- p \to \ell^+_\alpha + k\, j+X$, where $\alpha \in \{e, \mu, \tau \}$ and $k$ denotes the number of jets. We work in the $\nu$SMEFT framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory augmented with $n$ singlet HNLs, one of which is in the mass range $10-100$~GeV, within kinematic reach of the EIC. To explore the EIC sensitivity, we focus on the HNL production mechanism induced by mixing with light neutrinos. We study kinematic distributions for signal and backgrounds, including hadronization and detector effects, and suggest a set of cuts to minimize backgrounds. In the mass range considered, we find that the EIC with muon detection capabilities and an integrated luminosity of $100~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ can reach sensitivities comparable to the strongest direct (LHC) and indirect constraints, and is especially relevant in the $\nu$SMEFT framework beyond dimension four. Our study motivates further assessment of muon detection capabilities at the EIC and $\tau$ hadronic reconstruction, as well as a more general theoretical analysis involving production mechanisms mediated by higher-dimensional operators in the effective theory.</description>

      <title>The 2027-2034 Vision for Nuclear Physics in Canada, with an outlook to 2041</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Canadian subatomic physics community establishes its scientific, and thus funding, priorities through periodic Long-Range Plans (LRP). The community is now putting together a new LRP, which will be in effect from 2027 through 2034, with its scope extending through 2041. As part of this process, the Canadian Institute of Nuclear Physics (CINP) has put together a strategic report, following an extensive consultation process. The report describes the broad and ambitious research program undertaken by the Canadian nuclear physics research community, both onshore and abroad, touching on key questions regarding the origin, evolution, and structure of visible matter in the universe. This document provides a grid of different Canadian nuclear physics projects undertaken now and in the future, and their associated timelines. It concludes with specific recommendations for maximizing Canadian scientific output in nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Confined and Deconfined Phases of Qubit Regularized Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct simple qubit-regularized Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories formulated in the monomer--dimer--tensor-network (MDTN) basis that are free of sign problems in the pure gauge sector. These models naturally realize both confined and deconfined phases. Using classical Monte Carlo methods, we investigate the associated finite-temperature phase transitions and show that they exhibit the expected universality classes of conventional SU(N) lattice gauge theories in various spacetime dimensions. Furthermore, we argue that second-order quantum phase transitions separating the confined and deconfined phases are likely to exist. Such critical points would provide a nonperturbative route to defining continuum limits of qubit-regularized gauge theories, potentially allowing Yang--Mills theory and related continuum gauge theories to emerge from finite-dimensional lattice constructions.</description>

      <title>Universality in Space Time $\omega$ modes of Quarkyonic Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave $\omega$ mode spectrum presents a unique window into the dense interior of neutron stars, probing physics inaccessible to electromagnetic observations. This work investigates the $\omega$ modes of compact stars composed of quarkyonic matter. The quarkyonic model, which describes a cross-over transition between nucleonic and quark matter treated as quasi-particles, is formulated within the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) theory using the G3 and IOPB-I parameterizations. This core is surrounded by a mantle of hadronic matter, creating a multicomponent stellar interior. The overall Equation of State (EOS) is governed by two key parameters: the transition density ($n_t$), the QCD confinement scale ($\Lambda_{\rm cs}$), which are varied to construct models consistent with current astrophysical constraints on mass and radius. We compute the complex eigenfrequencies (damped oscillations) of the fundamental and first excited $\omega$ modes using the phase-amplitude method within a full general relativistic framework. Our simulations reveal that the admixed quarkyonic structure produces a unique $\omega$ mode signature, distinctly different from pure hadronic or hybrid stars. The spectrum exhibits a strong, degenerate dependence on the EOS, where the stiffening effect of the quarkyonic matter influences oscillation frequencies and damping times in a characteristic manner. We also demonstrate that $\omega$ mode frequencies for quarkyonic stars follow approximate universal relations, largely independent of the EOS.</description>

      <title>Form factors of the $\rho$ meson from effective field theory and the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calculation of resonance form factors in effective field theory as well as on the lattice is a highly challenging task. In a recent paper, we proposed a novel method based on the introduction of a background field and the Feynman-Hellmann theorem to address the problem, and applied it to a toy model. In the present work we use this method for the electromagnetic form factors of the $\rho$-meson. By matching the results to Chiral Perturbation Theory, we provide a first, crude estimate of all three form factors of the $\rho$-meson within the effective field theory. Contact contributions to these form factors turn out to be substantial. A procedure for lattice calculations is outlined, paving the way for an ab initio approach to the problem.</description>

      <title>Understanding the impact of nuclear effects on proton decay searches with the GiBUU model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton decay searches in the next generation of water Cherenkov detectors, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, are expected to probe the $10^{35}$-year lifetime regime where atmospheric neutrino backgrounds and systematic uncertainties begin to play an increasingly important role. In this study, we employ the GiBUU framework and reevaluate the proton decay search sensitivity for the $\textrm{p}\rightarrow\textrm{e}^{+}\pi^{0}$ channel by incorporating a typical event reconstruction performance in water Cherenkov detectors. Using sophisticated models implemented in GiBUU -- most notably the mean-field potential and Boltzmann transport -- which have been benchmarked against accelerator neutrino scattering data, in particular pion production, we find that the resulting proton decay signal detection efficiency and atmospheric neutrino background rate are comparable to those previously evaluated for the current and near future water Cherenkov experiments using $\textit{ad hoc}$ nuclear models. In addition to pion final-state interactions, we evaluate the impact of differences in the Fermi momentum distribution of nucleons in the nucleus, as a source of systematic uncertainty, on the signal detection efficiency and the expected background event rate. We find that the uncertainty associated with pion final-state interactions is moderate, whereas the choice of Fermi momentum distribution can significantly affect the estimated atmospheric neutrino background rate and constitutes the dominant contribution. Our study provides an independent and complementary characterisation of nuclear effects on proton decay searches and helps to refine sensitivity estimates in the regime where systematic uncertainties become more relevant.</description>

      <title>Universal and non-universal finite-volume effects in the vicinity of chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this proceeding, we discuss the finite-size scaling analysis of the order parameter related to the chiral phase transition in QCD with two massless quarks. We use data obtained in lattice QCD calculations performed with highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) for a range of light quark masses, $1/240 \leq m_\ell/m_s \leq 1/27$ for different spatial volumes ($N_\sigma$) on Euclidean lattices with temporal extent $N_\tau=8$, satisfying $3\,N_\tau \leq N_\sigma \leq 10\,N_\tau$. We observe that infinite volume extrapolated data for the order parameter agree reasonably well with the expected $O(2)$ scaling behavior even for physical ratios of the light-to-strange quark mass ratio. We quantify deviations from asymptotic scaling and perform a detailed analysis of the influence of finite-size effects in terms of temperature and quark masses at a fixed lattice cutoff. This is crucial for improving the reliability of the infinite-volume extrapolated estimate of the chiral order parameter and for a more precise determination of chiral phase transition temperature from direct Lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear causality of Israel-Stewart theory with diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first fully nonlinear causality constraints in $D = 3 + 1$ dimensions for Israel-Stewart theory in the presence of energy and number diffusion in the Eckart and Landau hydrodynamic frames, respectively. These constraints are algebraic inequalities that make no assumption on the underlying geometry of the spacetime or the equation of state. In order to highlight the distinct physical and structural behavior of the two hydrodynamic frames, we discuss the special ultrarelativistic ideal gas equation of state considered in earlier literature in $D = 1 + 1$ dimensions, and show that our general $D = 3 + 1$ constraints reduce to their results upon an appropriate choice of angles. For this equation of state in both $D = 1 + 1$ and $D = 3 + 1$ dimensions one can show that: (i) there exists a region allowed by nonlinear causality in which the baryon current transitions into a spacelike vector in the Landau frame, and (ii) an analogous argument shows that the solutions of the Eckart frame equations of motion never violate the dominant energy condition, assuming nonlinear causality holds. We then compare our results with those from linearized Israel-Stewart theory and show that the linear causality bounds fail to capture the new physical constraints on energy and number diffusion that are successfully obtained through our nonlinear causality approach.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric coefficients of two-flavor quark matter from the Kubo formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hot quark matter created in heavy-ion collision experiments can exhibit strong temperature and chemical-potential gradients, which in turn can generate electric fields through thermoelectric effects. In this work, we investigate two relevant thermoelectric coefficients -- the thermopower (Seebeck coefficient) and the Thomson coefficient -- of two-flavor quark matter using the Kubo formalism and the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model as an effective description of dense, finite-temperature QCD. The required two-point equilibrium correlation functions are evaluated using the Matsubara formalism of thermal field theory, applying a 1/Nc expansion to the relevant multi-loop Feynman diagrams. We employ previously derived quark spectral functions obtained from one--meson-exchange diagrams above the Mott transition temperature. Our numerical results show that both thermoelectric coefficients increase approximately linearly with temperature and decrease with increasing chemical potential. We also estimate the magnitude of the electric fields that can be generated in heavy-ion collisions by thermal gradients via the Seebeck effect.</description>

      <title>Neutron skins probed in proton knockout from neutron-rich nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton-induced quasifree knockout reactions provide a powerful probe of nuclear single-particle structure and reaction dynamics in both stable and neutron-rich nuclei. In this work we develop a unified theoretical framework for the calculation of inclusive (p,2p) and sequential (p,3p) reaction cross sections and fragment momentum distributions at intermediate and relativistic energies. The approach is based on a probabilistic extension of Glauber multiple-scattering theory combined with microscopic nuclear densities obtained from Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations using Skyrme energy-density functionals. We focus in particular on the sensitivity of total cross sections and longitudinal momentum dispersions to neutron-skin thickness along isotopic chains. Our results indicate that both (p,2p) and (p,3p) reactions exhibit a systematic decrease of cross section and momentum width with increasing neutron excess, reflecting enhanced attenuation and surface bias induced by neutron skins. The effect is significantly stronger for two-proton removal, suggesting that (p,3p) reactions may offer enhanced sensitivity to isovector nuclear structure. These findings establish proton-induced knockout reactions as complementary hadronic probes of neutron skins and the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy.</description>

Abstract: We present disperon QED, a method to deal with data input in loop processes in Monte Carlo codes. It relies on dispersion relations, automated tools such as OpenLoops, effective field theory methods and a threshold subtraction. We motivate this method and apply it to the process $ee\to\pi\pi$ in McMule to deal with hadronic vacuum polarisation insertions in two-loop contributions as well as the vector form factor of the pion within the form-factor scalar QED approximation. The generality of this method for more complicated processes is emphasised.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group Evolution for In-medium Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principles analysis of the renormalization group (RG) evolution of the two-point energy-energy correlator (EEC) in light-quark and gluon jets propagating through nuclear matter. Our work focuses on the analytic structure of the RG equations in the thin-medium regime, highlighting how collinear emissions in the presence of a dense QCD medium reshape the EEC observables. We work in the opacity expansion of the SCET$_{\rm G}$ formalism, where the propagating quarks and gluons interact with the medium via Glauber gluon exchanges. We compute the corresponding one-loop jet functions using the medium-induced splitting kernels at first order in opacity and perform resummation at leading logarithmic (LL) order. In particular, we identify an experimentally accessible regime of jet energies and EEC angles where one can directly investigate the medium-induced scale evolution and extract the corresponding opacity-one correction to the anomalous dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically, using the method of regions, the Coulomb-logarithmic enhancement regulated by plasma screening for EEC. We compare our theoretical predictions with experimental data in $p$-Pb collisions and make projections for O-O collisions to test whether energy correlators could serve as sensitive probe of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) dynamics in small collision systems, offering a robust and model-independent avenue for constraining jet evolution in QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Three-body molecular states composed of $D^{(*)}$ and two nucleons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the three-body systems $DNN$ and $D^{*}NN$ within a hadronic molecular framework by combining a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction with a $D^{(*)}N$ potential constrained by heavy-quark symmetry. The three-body Schr\"odinger equation is solved with the Gaussian Expansion Method, and the analytic structure of the spectrum is investigated using the Complex Scaling Method. We find that the $DNN$ system supports a robust and compact bound state in the $I(J^{P})=\tfrac{1}{2}(1^-)$ channel over a broad range of cutoff values, even when the corresponding $DN$ subsystem is weakly bound or unbound. For $D^{*}NN$, the spin-$1$ nature of the heavy meson and the associated spin-dependent forces generate a clear spin hierarchy: deeply bound states appear in both $0^-$ and $2^-$ channels, while the $1^-$ channel exhibits a characteristic two-branch pattern with a strongly bound compact branch and a more weakly bound, spatially extended branch. The root-mean-square radii indicate pronounced spatial compression compared with the deuteron scale, highlighting the cooperative roles of realistic $NN$ correlations, the $D^{(*)}N$ interactions, and heavy-quark symmetry in forming compact heavy-flavor few-body bound states. No three-body resonances under complex scaling are found in the explored parameter space. Our results provide quantitative benchmarks for future experimental searches for such charmed-meson-nuclear bound states.</description>

      <title>2025 EIC-France Workshop: Physics Highlights and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This document presents a synthesis of the theory contributions and discussions from the 2nd EIC-France Workshop, held at IJCLab (Orsay) on 1-3 December 2025. The workshop brought together members of the French hadron-physics community to review recent theoretical developments relevant to the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and to coordinate national efforts in preparation for its early physics program. The report first summarizes the collider's initial running conditions and luminosity performance, as outlined in the EIC Early Science Matrix. It then provides concise overviews of the theoretical presentations on inclusive, semi-inclusive, exclusive, heavy-flavor, and small-x physics.
  Based on these discussions, two measurements emerged as especially well suited for early EIC operation and strongly aligned with areas of established French expertise: inclusive diffraction and inclusive quarkonium production. These channels offer clean signatures, robust theoretical interpretability, and direct sensitivity to fundamental QCD phenomena such as gluon saturation, heavy-quark dynamics, and the small-x structure of hadrons and nuclei.
  In addition, the workshop identified longer-term physics opportunities that will benefit from the full capabilities of the EIC after its ramp-up phase. These include accessing the three-dimensional structure of the pion through the Sullivan process and a broader program of exclusive three-body final states, both of which represent high-impact avenues for exploring hadronic structure and non-perturbative QCD. Together, the elements summarized in this report provide a coherent overview of the strategic priorities and scientific ambitions shaping the French community's contribution to the EIC physics program.</description>
