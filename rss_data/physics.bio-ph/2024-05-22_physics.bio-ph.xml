      <title>Coarse-graining conformational dynamics with multi-dimensional generalized Langevin equation: how, when, and why</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A data-driven ab initio generalized Langevin equation (AIGLE) approach is developed to learn and simulate high-dimensional, heterogeneous, coarse-grained conformational dynamics. Constrained by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, the approach can build coarse-grained models in dynamical consistency with all-atom molecular dynamics. We also propose practical criteria for AIGLE to enforce long-term dynamical consistency. Case studies of a toy polymer, with 20 coarse-grained sites, and the alanine dipeptide, with two dihedral angles, elucidate why one should adopt AIGLE or its Markovian limit for modeling coarse-grained conformational dynamics in practice.</description>

      <title>Segmentation of dense and multi-species bacterial colonies achieved using models trained on synthetic microscopy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of microbial infections is governed by the self-organization of bacteria on surfaces. Limitations of live imaging techniques make collective behaviors in clinically relevant systems challenging to quantify. Here, we develop novel experimental and image analysis techniques for high-fidelity single-cell segmentation of bacterial colonies. Machine learning-based segmentation models are trained solely using synthetic microscopy images that are processed to look realistic using state-of-the-art image-to-image translation methods, requiring no biophysical modeling. Accurate single-cell segmentation is achieved for densely packed single-species colonies and multi-species colonies of common pathogenic bacteria, even under suboptimal imaging conditions and for both brightfield and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The resulting data provide quantitative insights into the self-organization of bacteria on soft surfaces. Thanks to their high adaptability and relatively simple implementation, these methods promise to greatly facilitate quantitative descriptions of bacterial infections in varied environments.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production by Underdamped Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy production (EP) is a central quantity in nonequilibrium physics as it monitors energy dissipation, reversibility, and free energy differences during thermodynamic transformations. Estimating EP, however, is challenging both theoretically and experimentally due to limited access to the system dynamics. For overdamped Langevin dynamics and Markov jump processes it was recently proposed that, from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TUR), short-time cumulant currents can be used to estimate EP without knowledge of the dynamics. Yet, estimation of EP in underdamped Langevin systems remains an active challenge. To address this, we derive a modified TUR that relates the statistics of two specific novel currents -- one cumulant current and one stochastic current -- to a system's EP. These two distinct but related currents are used to constrain EP in the modified TUR. One highlight is that there always exists a family of currents such that the uncertainty relations saturate, even for long-time averages and in nonsteady-state scenarios. Another is that our method only requires limited knowledge of the dynamics -- specifically, the damping-coefficient to mass ratio and the diffusion constant. This uncertainty relation allows estimating EP for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We validate the method numerically, through applications to several underdamped systems, to underscore the flexibility in obtaining EP in nonequilibrium Langevin systems.</description>

      <title>Determining the purity of single-helical proteins from electronic specific heat measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the electronic specific heat (ESH) at constant volume (Cv) of single-helical proteins modeled within the tight-binding (TB) framework. We study the effects of helical symmetry, long-range hopping, environment and biological defects on thermal properties. We employ a general TB model to incorporate all parameters relevant to the helical structure of the protein. In order to provide additional insights into our results for the ESH, we also study the electronic density of states for various disorder strengths. We observe that the variation of the specific heat with disorder is very different in low and high temperature regimes, though the variation of ESH with temperature possesses a universal pattern upon varying disorder strengths related to environmental effects. Lastly, we propose an interesting application of the ESH spectra of proteins. We show that by studying the ESH of single-helical proteins, one can distinguish a defective sample from a pure one. This observation can serve as the basis of a screening technique that can be applied prior to a whole genome testing, thereby saving valuable time &amp; resources.</description>

      <title>Metacognitive particles, mental action and the sense of agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper articulates metacognition using the language of statistical physics and Bayesian mechanics. Metacognitive beliefs, defined as beliefs about beliefs, find a natural description within this formalism, which allows us to define the dynamics of 'metacognitive particles', i.e., systems possessing metacognitive beliefs. We further unpack this typology of metacognitive systems by distinguishing passive and active metacognitive particles, where active particles are endowed with the capacity for mental actions that update the parameters of other beliefs. We provide arguments for the necessity of this architecture in the emergence of a subjective sense of agency and the experience of being separate from the environment. The motivation is to pave the way towards a mathematical and physical understanding of cognition -- and higher forms thereof -- furthering the study and formalization of cognitive science in the language of mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Statistical Field Theory and Neural Structures Dynamics IV: Field-Theoretic Formalism for Interacting Collective States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the findings presented in the first three papers of this series, we formulate an effective field theory for interacting collective states. These states consist of a large number of interconnected neurons and are distinguished by their intrinsic activity. The field theory encompasses an infinite set of fields, each of which characterizes the dynamics of a specific type of collective state. Interaction terms within the theory drive transitions between various collective states, allowing us to describe processes such as activation, association, and deactivation of these states.</description>

      <title>Detection of diffusion anisotropy from an individual short particle trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In parallel with advances in microscale imaging techniques, the fields of biology and materials science have focused on precisely extracting particle properties based on their diffusion behavior. Although the majority of real-world particles exhibit anisotropy, their behavior has been studied less than that of isotropic particles. In this study, we introduce a new method for estimating the diffusion coefficients of individual anisotropic particles using short-trajectory data on the basis of a maximum likelihood framework. Traditional estimation techniques often use mean-squared displacement (MSD) values or other statistical measures that inherently remove angular information. Instead, we treated the angle as a latent variable and used belief propagation to estimate it while maximizing the likelihood using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Compared to conventional methods, this approach facilitates better estimation of shorter trajectories and faster rotations, as confirmed by numerical simulations and experimental data involving bacteria and quantum rods. Additionally, we performed an analytical investigation of the limits of detectability of anisotropy and provided guidelines for the experimental design. In addition to serving as a powerful tool for analyzing complex systems, the proposed method will pave the way for applying maximum likelihood methods to more complex diffusion phenomena.</description>
