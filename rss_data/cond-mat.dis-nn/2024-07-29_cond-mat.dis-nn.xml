      <title>Thermodynamics-Consistent Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose excess Gibbs free energy graph neural networks (GE-GNNs) for predicting composition-dependent activity coefficients of binary mixtures. The GE-GNN architecture ensures thermodynamic consistency by predicting the molar excess Gibbs free energy and using thermodynamic relations to obtain activity coefficients. As these are differential, automatic differentiation is applied to learn the activity coefficients in an end-to-end manner. Since the architecture is based on fundamental thermodynamics, we do not require additional loss terms to learn thermodynamic consistency. As the output is a fundamental property, we neither impose thermodynamic modeling limitations and assumptions. We demonstrate high accuracy and thermodynamic consistency of the activity coefficient predictions.</description>

      <title>Disentangling competing interactions in disordered materials using interaction space modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and manipulating the relationship between intentionally introduced disorder and material properties necessitates efficient characterization techniques. For example, single crystal diffuse scattering experiments provide insights into the driving forces behind local order phenomena. In this work, we present a time- and resource-efficient approach based on mean field theory, that quantifies local interaction energies but unlike other techniques does not require computationally expensive supercell models. The method is employed to quantify competing interactions in functionally disordered materials such as disordered rock salt cathode materials and Prussian blue analogs that share an underlying face-centred lattice.</description>

      <title>Machine learning analysis of dimensional reduction conjecture for nonequilibrium Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the recently proposed dimensional reduction conjecture in driven disordered systems using a machine learning technique. The conjecture states that a static snapshot of a disordered system driven at a constant velocity is equal to a space-time trajectory of its lower-dimensional pure counterpart. This suggests that the three-dimensional (3D) random field XY model exhibits the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition when driven out of equilibrium. To verify the conjecture directly by observing configurations of the system, we utilize the capacity of neural networks to detect subtle features of images. Specifically, we train neural networks to differentiate snapshots of the 3D driven random field XY model from space-time trajectories of the two-dimensional pure XY model. Our results demonstrate that the network cannot distinguish between the two, confirming the dimensional reduction conjecture.</description>

      <title>From Architectures to Applications: A Review of Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension with system size, the simulation of quantum many-body systems has remained a persistent challenge until today. Here, we review a relatively new class of variational states for the simulation of such systems, namely neural quantum states (NQS), which overcome the exponential scaling by compressing the state in terms of the network parameters rather than storing all exponentially many coefficients needed for an exact parameterization of the state. We introduce the commonly used NQS architectures and their various applications for the simulation of ground and excited states, finite temperature and open system states as well as NQS approaches to simulate the dynamics of quantum states. Furthermore, we discuss NQS in the context of quantum state tomography.</description>

      <title>Odd Dipole Screening in Radial Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inflation of an inner radial (or spherical) cavity in an amorphous solids confined in a disk (or a sphere), served as a fruitful case model for studying the effects of plastic deformations on the mechanical response. It was shown that when the field associated with Eshelby quadrupolar charges is non-uniform, the displacement field is riddled with dipole charges that screen elasticity, reminiscent of Debye monopoles screening in electrostatics. In this paper we look deeper into the screening phenomenon, taking into account the consequences of irreversibility that are associated with the breaking of Chiral symmetry. We consider the equations for the displacement field with the presence of ``Odd Dipole Screening", solve them analytically and compare with numerical simulations. Suggestions how to test the theory in experiments are provided.</description>

      <title>Quantum memories for squeezed and coherent superpositions in a driven-dissipative nonlinear oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum oscillators with nonlinear driving and dissipative terms have gained significant attention due to their ability to stabilize cat-states for universal quantum computation. Recently, superconducting circuits have been employed to realize such long-lived qubits stored in coherent states. We present a generalization of these oscillators, which are not limited to coherent states, in the presence of different nonlinearities in driving and dissipation, exploring different degrees. Specifically, we present an extensive analysis of the asymptotic dynamical features and of the storage of squeezed states. We demonstrate that coherent superpositions of squeezed states are achievable in the presence of a strong symmetry, thereby allowing for the storage of squeezed cat-states. In the weak symmetry regime, accounting for linear dissipation, we investigate the potential application of these nonlinear driven-dissipative resonators for quantum computing and quantum associative memory and analyze the impact of squeezing on their performance.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in non-Fermi liquid phases of nodal-point semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review, we survey the current progress in computing transport properties in semimetals which harbour non-Fermi liquid phases. We first discuss the widely-used Kubo formalism, which can be applied to the effective theory describing the stable non-Fermi liquid phase obtained via a renormalization group procedure and, hence, is applicable for temperatures close to zero (e.g., optical conductivity). For finite-temperature regimes, which apply to the computations of the generalized DC conductivity tensors, we elucidate the memory matrix approach. This approach is based on an effective hydrodynamic description of the system, and is especially suited for tackling transport calculations in strongly-interacting quantum field theories, because it does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles. As a concrete example, we apply these two approaches to find the response of the so-called \textit{Luttinger-Abrikosov-Benelavskii phase} of isotropic three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals, which arises under the effects of long-ranged (unscreened) Coulomb interactions, with the chemical potential fine-tuned to cut exactly the nodal point. In particular, we focus on the electric conductivity tensors, thermal and thermoelectric response, Raman response, free energy, entropy density, and shear viscosity.</description>
