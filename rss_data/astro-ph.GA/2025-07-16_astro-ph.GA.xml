      <title>The ALMA-CRISTAL survey: Resolved kinematic studies of main sequence star-forming galaxies at 4&lt;z&lt;6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed kinematic study of a sample of 32 massive ($9.5\leqslant\log(M_*/{\rm M_{\odot}})\leqslant10.9$) main-sequence star-forming galaxies (MS SFGs) at $4&lt;z&lt;6$ from the ALMA-CRISTAL program. The data consist of deep (up to 15hr observing time per target), high-resolution ($\sim1$kpc) ALMA observations of the [CII]158$\mu$m line emission. This data set enables the first systematic kpc-scale characterisation of the kinematics nature of typical massive SFGs at these epochs. We find that $\sim50\%$ of the sample are disk-like, with a number of galaxies located in systems of multiple components. Kinematic modelling reveals these main sequence disks exhibit high-velocity dispersions ($\sigma_0$), with a median disk velocity dispersion of $\sim70{\rm kms^{-1}}$ and $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_0\sim2$, and consistent with dominant gravity driving. The elevated disk dispersions are in line with the predicted evolution based on Toomre theory and the extrapolated trends from $z\sim0$-$2.5$ MS star-forming disks. The inferred dark matter (DM) mass fraction within the effective radius $f_{\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\rm e})$ for the disk systems decreases with the central baryonic mass surface density, and is consistent with the trend reported by kinematic studies at $z\lesssim3$; roughly half the disks have $f_{\rm DM}(&lt;R_{\rm e})\lesssim30\%$. The CRISTAL sample of massive MS SFGs provides a reference of the kinematics of a representative population and extends the view onto typical galaxies beyond previous kpc-scale studies at $z\lesssim3$.</description>

      <title>Unmixed metals: Variations in the enrichment of z~4 sub-damped Lyman alpha systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical abundance patterns of near-pristine objects provide important constraints on the properties of the first generations of stars in the Universe. We present the chemical abundances of five very metal-poor ([M/H]&lt;-2.5) sub damped Lyman alpha systems (subDLAs) covering the redshift range $3.6&lt;z&lt;4.3$, identified with the XQ-100 survey. We find that the subDLAs in our sample show consistent chemical abundance patterns (in particular [C/O], [Al/O], and [Fe/O]) with those of very metal-poor DLAs. Based on Voigt profile fitting, the chemical abundance ratios [C/O], [Al/O], and [Si/O] of individual velocity components in at least three of the subDLAs shows some intrinsic scatter. In order to verify these chemical inhomogeneities in absorption components, we present a novel method for computing ionization corrections (ICs) on a component-by-component basis and show that ICs alone cannot explain the variations in [C/O], [Al/O], and [Si/O] between components of the same absorber at ~2 sigma significance. Comparing the observed abundance ratios to the simulated core-collapse supernovae yields of early stellar populations, we find that all individual components of the subDLAs appears to be enriched by progenitor masses of &lt;30 M_sol. The observed inhomogeneities between components can be reproduced by differences in the progenitor mass or supernova explosion energy. As such, the observed chemical inhomogeneities between components can be explained by poorly mixed gas from different nucleosynthetic events.</description>

      <title>THOR: a GPU-accelerated and MPI-parallel radiative transfer code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission and absorption line features are important diagnostics for the physics underlying extragalactic astronomy. The interpretation of observed signatures involves comparing against forward modeled spectra from galaxy formation simulations as well as more simplified geometries, while including the complex scattering radiative transfer (RT) of resonant emission lines. Here, we present thor, a modern C++ radiative transfer code focused initially on resonant emission lines. thor is a high-performance, distributed memory MPI-parallel, multi-target code, running on CPUs, GPUs and other accelerators, yielding large $\sim 10-50\rm{x}$ speed-ups compared to previous CPU-only codes. We support multiple grid-based and gridless data structures, enabling comparisons across different hydrodynamical codes as well as toy model geometries. We demonstrate its science capabilities with a number of example use cases across scales: (i) Lyman-alpha RT on simple shell-like gas distributions; (ii) Lyman-alpha RT applied to a high-resolution, high-redshift $z \sim 6$ cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation; (iii) Lyman-alpha and Magnesium-II halos, i.e. scattering and emission from the circumgalactic medium of $z \simeq 1-2$ galaxies drawn from cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations; (iv) the large-scale cosmic web in gas emission, a $6144^3$ volume-element RT scaling calculation; and (v) synthetic absorption spectra of the Lyman-alpha forest. Extensive verification and benchmarking validates our approach and its computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>High-redshift AGN population in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) have long been recognized as key probes of early black hole growth and galaxy evolution. However, modeling this population remains difficult due to the wide range of luminosities and black hole masses involved, and the high computational costs of capturing the hydrodynamic response of gas and evolving radiation fields on-the-fly. In this study, we present a new suite of simulations based on the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation framework, enhanced with on-the-fly radiative transfer, to examine AGN at high redshift (z &gt; 5) in a protocluster environment extracted from the MillenniumTNG simulation. We focus on the co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies, as well as the radiative impact on surrounding intergalactic gas. The model predicts that black holes form in overdense regions and lie below the local black hole-stellar mass relation, with stellar mass assembly preceding significant black hole accretion. Ionizing photons are primarily produced by stars, which shape the morphology of ionized regions and drive reionization. Given the restrictive black hole growth in the original IllustrisTNG model, we reduce the radiative efficiency from 0.2 to 0.1, resulting in higher accretion rates for massive black holes, more bursty growth, and earlier AGN-driven quenching. However, the resulting AGN remain significantly fainter than observed high-redshift quasars. As such, to incorporate this missing population, we introduce a quasar boosted model, in which we artificially boost the AGN luminosity. This results in strong effects on the surrounding gas, most notably a proximity effect, and large contributions to He ionization.</description>

      <title>Stephenson 2 DFK 52: Discovery of an exotic red supergiant in the massive stellar cluster RSGC2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations at 1.3mm have recently revealed surprising complexity in the circumstellar environment of DFK 52, a red supergiant (RSG) located in the Stephenson 2 massive open cluster. We provide an initial characterisation of the star's mass-loss properties by studying its circumstellar emission in continuum, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and SiO rotational lines. We find that DFK 52 is surrounded by an extremely large outflow (up to 50,000 au in radius) that shows complex morphologies in both its molecular and dust emission. The size of the circumstellar medium is unprecedented, even when compared with other known extreme RSGs, and its lower luminosity indicates that its mass ejection mechanism may be unique among this population. The molecular emission can be partially reproduced by a two-component model consisting of a fast (27 km/s) detached equatorial component with $M{\sim}0.05$ $M_{\odot}$ and a slow (10 km/s) spherical envelope with $\dot{M}\sim3\times10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. This suggests that DFK 52 underwent a dramatic mass-loss event $\sim$4000 years ago, but has since transitioned into having a slower more symmetric mass loss. We conservatively estimate a total mass of $0.1-1$ $M_{\odot}$ in the complex extended regions of the outflow. The uncertain nature of the dramatic mass loss warrants extensive follow-up of this likely supernova progenitor.</description>

      <title>COS-EDGES: Co-rotation and Kinematic Stratification of the Multi-Phase CGM Around Edge-On Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results from the COS-EDGES survey, targeting the kinematic connection between the ISM and multi-phase circumgalactic medium (CGM) in nine isolated, edge-on galaxies at z~0.2, each probed along its major axis by a background quasar at impact parameters of 13-38kpc. Using VLT/UVES and HST/COS quasar spectra, we analyse MgI, MgII, HI, CII, CIII, and OVI absorption relative to galaxy rotation curves from Keck/LRIS and Magellan/MagE spectra. We find that at lower $D/R_{vir}$ ($D/R_{vir}\leq 0.2$), over 80% of absorption in all ions lies on the side of systemic velocity matching disk rotation, and the optical-depth-weighted median velocity ($v_{abs}$) is consistent with the peak rotation speed. At higher $D/R_{vir}$ ($D/R_{vir} &gt; 0.2$), the kinematics diverge by ionisation state: For low ionisation gas, the amount of co-rotating absorption remains &gt;80%, yet $v_{abs}$ drops to 60% of the galaxy rotation speed. For high ionisation gas (OVI), only 60% of the absorption is consistent with co-rotation and $v_{abs}$ drops to 20% of the rotation speed. Furthermore, the velocity widths, corresponding to 50% of the total optical depth ($\Delta v_{50}$) for low ionisation gas is 1.8 times larger in the inner halo than at larger radii, while for CIII and OVI $\Delta v_{50}$ remains unchanged with distance. These results suggest a radially dependent CGM kinematic structure: the inner halo hosts cool, dynamically broad gas tightly coupled to disk rotation, whereas beyond 0.2$R_{vir}$, particularly traced by OVI and HI, the CGM shows weaker rotational alignment and lower velocity dispersion. Therefore, low-ionisation gas likely traces extended co-rotating gas, inflows and/or recycled accretion, while high-ionisation gas reflects a mixture of co-rotating, lagging, discrete collisionally ionised structures, indicating a kinematic stratification of the multi-phase CGM.

      <title>DELVE-ing into the Milky Way's Globular Clusters: Assessing extra-tidal features in NGC 5897, NGC 7492, and testing detectability with deeper photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extra-tidal features around globular clusters (GCs) are tracers of their disruption, stellar stream formation, and their host's gravitational potential. However, these features remain challenging to detect due to their low surface brightness. We conduct a systematic search for such features around 19 GCs in the DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) survey Data Release 2, discovering a new extra-tidal envelope around NGC 5897 and find tentative evidence for an extended envelope surrounding NGC 7492. Through a combination of dynamical modeling and analyzing synthetic stellar populations, we demonstrate these envelopes may have formed through tidal disruption. We use these models to explore the detectability of these features in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), finding that while LSST's deeper photometry will enhance detection significance, additional methods for foreground removal like proper motions or metallicities may be important for robust stream detection. Our results both add to the sample of globular clusters with extra-tidal features and provide insights on interpreting similar features in current and upcoming data.</description>

      <title>CLASSY XIV: Nitrogen Enrichment Shaped by Gas Density and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the chemical evolution of N/O using a sample of 45 local star-forming galaxies (SFGs) from the CLASSY survey. This sample spans a wide range of galaxy properties, with robust determinations of nitrogen and oxygen abundances via the direct-$T_{\rm e}$ method. We explore how N/O relates to density structure, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar age, compactness, and gas kinematics. In addition, we compare our results with those of galaxies at $z =2-10$ where N/O ratios were derived from optical or UV nitrogen lines, aiming to identify chemical enrichment pathways across cosmic time. Our analysis shows that the N/O-O/H relation in CLASSY galaxies aligns with the trends seen in local galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, and that galaxies at $z = 2-6$ exhibit similar N/O values, indicating no significant redshift evolution in N/O. We identify a significant correlation between electron density $n_{\rm e}$([S II]) and N/O, suggesting that density structure contributes to the scatter in the N/O-O/H relation. The CLASSY galaxies with high SFRs or compact star formation show elevated N/O, though no strong correlation with stellar mass is found. We also find that high-velocity outflows (v$_{out}$ &gt; 350 km/s) and low mass-loading factors are linked to elevated N/O, indicating that feedback plays a significant role. These results highlight the importance of density, star formation, and feedback from young stellar populations in shaping N/O enrichment and provide key insights for interpreting high-$z$ galaxies observed with JWST.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of Circumgalactic O VI Gas and Disk Rotation of $z\approx0.2$ Star-forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasar sightline observations reveal that low-ionization-state gas corotates with the galaxy disk and often at sub-centrifugal velocities, suggesting that the gas is spiraling towards the galaxy disk. However, while observations ubiquitously detect O VI absorption around low-redshift, $\sim L^*$ star-forming galaxies, the relationship between O VI and the galaxy disk, especially the kinematics, is not well-established. This work focuses on the O VI kinematics and its comparison with that of the low ions and galactic disk rotation. We present observations of 18 pairs of quasars and $z\approx0.2$ star-forming galaxies. All quasar sightlines intersect the circumgalactic medium (CGM) within 45$^\circ$ from the galaxy major axes. We show that while individual O VI velocity components do not correlate with disk rotation, the bulk of O VI gas in individual sightlines rarely counter-rotates. We then match O VI velocity components with those of low ions by minimizing the difference of their velocity centroids. The O VI velocity components with successful low-ion matches are typically found at small sightline impact parameters and are more likely to corotate with the disk. We suggest that the low-ion-matched O VI velocity components trace the gas co-spatial with the low ions near the extended disk plane in the inner CGM, whereas those without low-ion matches represent the gas at large 3D radii. While the gas at large radii is theoretically expected to kinematically correlate with the disk angular momentum, this correlation is expected to be weaker due to the higher turbulent to mean rotation velocity ration at large radii, consistent with our results.</description>

      <title>The evolution of a supermassive binary black hole in an non-spherical nuclear star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) We consider a secular orbital evolution of a supermassive binary black hole (SBBH) with unequal masses $M_p$ and $M_s &lt; M_p$ in a central part of a non-spherical nuclear star cluster (NSC). When the mass of NSC inside the orbit is smaller than $M_{s}$ dynamical friction becomes inefficient. The subsequent orbital evolution of SBBH is largely governed by perturbing tidal potential of NSC arising from its non-sphericity. When the perturbing potential is mainly determined by quadrupole harmonics with azimuthal number $|m|=2$ the secular dynamics of the SBBH does not conserve any components of the angular momentum and can lead to the formation of highly eccentric orbits. Such orbits can experience an efficient circularization due to emission of gravitational waves (GW). In this Paper we consider this situation in some detail. We study analytically and numerically the orbital evolution taking into account the important effect of Einstein apsidal precession and estimate the largest possible value of $e$, which can be obtained. We then estimate a possibility of fast orbital circularization through emission of gravitation waves on a highly eccentric orbit, with circularization timescale of the order of the orbital period. We find that our mechanism could result in such events on a time scale of the order of or smaller than a few Gyr. It is stressed that for particular values of the model parameters such events may sometimes be distinguished from the ones expected in more standard scenarios, since in our case the eccentricity may remain substantial all the way down to the final merger. It is also noted that our results can be applied to other astrophysical settings, e.g. to study the orbital evolution of a binary star or a proto planetary system inside a massive deformed gas cloud.</description>

      <title>Galaxy image simplification using Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern digital sky surveys have been acquiring images of billions of galaxies. While these images often provide sufficient details to analyze the shape of the galaxies, accurate analysis of such high volumes of images requires effective automation. Current solutions often rely on machine learning annotation of the galaxy images based on a set of pre-defined classes. Here we introduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative AI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them into a ``skeletonized" form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements of the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined set of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images acquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data are publicly available. The method was applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images, and the catalog of the simplified images is publicly available.</description>

      <title>The Galactic Bulge exploration VI.: Gaia Enceladus/Sausage RR Lyrae stars in the inner-central stellar halo of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a view of the stellar halo in the inner-central regions of the Milky Way (R &lt;~ 10 kpc) mapped by RR Lyrae stars. The combined BRAVA-RR/APOGEE RR Lyrae catalog is used to obtain a sample of 281 RR Lyrae stars located in the bulge region of the Galaxy, but with orbits indicating they belong to the inner-central halo. The RR Lyrae stars in the halo are more metal-poor than the bulge RR Lyrae stars and have pulsation properties more consistent with an accreted population. We use the Milky Way-like zoom-in cosmological simulation Auriga to compare the properties of the RR Lyrae stars to those expected from the "Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage" (GES) merger. The integrals of motions and eccentricities of the RR Lyrae stars are consistent with a small fraction of 6-9 +- 2 % of the inner-central halo RR Lyrae population having originated from GES. This fraction, lower than what is seen in the solar neighborhood, is consistent with trends seen in the Auriga simulation, where a GES-like merger would have a decreasing fraction of GES stars at small Galactocentric radii compared to other accreted populations. Very few of the Auriga inner Galaxy GES-18 particles have properties consistent with belonging to a bulge population with (z_max &lt; 1.1 kpc), indicating that no (or very few) RR Lyrae stars with bulge orbits should have originated from GES.</description>

      <title>DESI EDR: Calibrating the Tully-Fisher Relationship with the DESI Peculiar Velocity Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calibrate the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) with data from the DESI Peculiar Velocity (PV) Survey taken during the Survey Validation (SV) period of the DESI galaxy redshift survey. Placing spectroscopic fibers on the centers and major axes of spatially-extended spiral galaxies identified in the 2020 Siena Galaxy Atlas using the DESI Legacy Surveys, we measure the rotational velocities at 0.33R26 for 1163 (1136 + 27 dwarf) spiral galaxies observed during SV. Using 41 spiral galaxies observed in the Coma Cluster, we find a slope for the TFR of -7.96+/-0.13 AB mag in the r-band, with a scatter about the TFR of 1.07+/-0.02 AB mag. We calibrate the zero-point of the TFR using galaxies with independent distances measured using type Ia supernovae via the cosmological distance ladder. From the SN Ia distances, we measure a zero-point of -19.34(+0.30,-0.29) AB mag in the r-band. We produce a public catalog of the distances to these 1136 spiral galaxies observed during DESI SV as part of the DESI PV Survey with our calibrated TFR. This is, to our knowledge, the first catalog of TFR distances produced with velocities measured at a single point in the disk.</description>

      <title>Two intersecting radio shells: relics of galaxy merger shocks ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of two intersecting radio shells, likely radio relics, surrounding a compact galaxy group dominated by a massive elliptical galaxy. The shells present as partial, edge-brightened rings with diameters of about 240" (720 kpc) each and resemble a pair of odd radio circles. The central galaxy, WISEA J184105.19-654753.8, which shows signs of interactions, is radio bright, has a stellar mass of 3.1 x 10^11 Msun (for a redshift of zphot = 0.18) and is located in the intersect region. The double radio shell system, which we refer to as ORC J1841-6547 (also known as ORC 6), was detected in 944 MHz radio continuum images obtained with Phased Array Feeds on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). The more prominent, north-western shell may be associated with an X-ray detection, while the weaker, south-eastern shell has no counterpart at non-radio wavelength. We propose outwards moving shocks from galaxy mergers driving into the intragroup medium, re-energising relic radio lobes, as a possible formation scenario for the observed radio shells. We conclude that at least some ORCs are shock-energised relics in the outskirts of galaxy groups, which originate during the merger evolution of the brightest group galaxy.</description>

      <title>Identifying a protocluster formation at z $\sim$ 4.5 in the COSMOS field: an extension of Taralay protocluster, traced by Ly-alpha emitters surrounding a submm galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a large-scale structure containing multiple overdensities at $z= 4.54 \pm 0.03$ in the COSMOS field, with the most prominent one likely infalling towards the recently identified Taralay protocluster. We use combined wide-band and narrow-band optical photometry to identify Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) within a 21 cMpc radius from the submm source J1000+0234, at $z= 4.54$, to identify typical star-forming galaxies that may trace an underlying structure. Our approach selects line emitters as narrow-band excess objects and we use the COSMOS2020 photometric redshift catalog to eliminate potential low-redshift interlopers whose line emission (e.g. [OIII] at $z\sim 0.3$) might be responsible for the observed excess in the narrow band. In comparison with the LAE density in the field, our results point to a mean LAE number overdensity of $\bar\delta = 3$ spanning a region of $27 \times 20 \times 36$ cMpc$^3$, probably evolving into a moderate-mass cluster ($3 - 10 \times 10^{14} \, M_\odot$) at $z\sim 0$. This work supports the idea that submm sources, although offset from the major overdensity peaks, serve as traces of moderately massive, potentially infalling structures.</description>

      <title>Fine-structure Line Atlas for Multi-wavelength Extragalactic Study (FLAMES) II: Photoionization Model View of Ionized to Neutral Gas Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Far-infrared (FIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) fine-structure lines (FSLs) provide key diagnostics of physical conditions in the interstellar medium (ISM). Building on empirical relations established in our previous work, we use photoionization models to systematically investigate the emission from both ionized and neutral gas phases in a coherent structure. By applying power-law fits to model parameters, we quantitatively capture how key FIR FSL ratios scale with physical properties such as density, radiation field strength and hardness, and elemental abundances. Our analysis confirms the primary dependencies behind most observed empirical trends and establishes certain FIR FSL ratios as tracers of physical parameters, while revealing that parameter marginalization-particularly in density and the O/H-$U$-$Q_1/Q_0$ relation-plays a crucial role in shaping tight correlations seen in galaxies. We also identify persistent challenges, including degeneracies between ionization parameter and radiation field hardness, uncertainties in neutral gas density, and difficulties in modeling dusty H II regions. We outline the fundamental observational and theoretical limitations of current FIR FSL diagnostics, and highlight prospects for advancing the field through comprehensive, multi-wavelength studies of diverse galaxy populations.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE: A first look at MIGHTEE quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study a robust, $K_s$-band complete, spectroscopically-confirmed sample of 104 unobscured (Type-1) quasars within the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields of the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) Survey, at 0.60 &lt; $z$ &lt; 3.41. The quasars are selected via $gJK_s$ colour-space and, with 1.3-GHz flux-densities reaching rms ~ 3.0$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, we find a radio-loudness fraction of 5 per cent. Thanks to the deep, multiwavelength datasets that are available over these fields, the properties of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars can be studied in a statistically-robust way, with the emphasis of this work being on the active-galactic-nuclei (AGN)-related and star-formation-related contributions to the total radio emission. We employ multiple star-formation-rate estimates for the analysis so that our results can be compared more-easily with others in the literature, and find that the fraction of sources that have their radio emission dominated by the AGN crucially depends on the SFR estimate that is derived from the radio luminosity. When redshift dependence is not taken into account, a larger fraction of sources is classed as having their radio emission dominated by the AGN. When redshift dependence $is$ considered, a larger fraction of our sample is tentatively classed as 'starbursts'. We also find that the fraction of (possible) starbursts increases with redshift, and provide multiple suggestions for this trend.</description>

      <title>No evidence for Keplerian taper of far-out galactic rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical analysis of the 175 SPARC galactic rotation curves to test the hypothesis of whether the Keplerian velocity tapering at large radii ($v(r)\propto 1/\sqrt{r}$) of the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo model agrees with observational data. The null hypothesis is Rubin's flat-rotation curve, $v(r)=\text{constant}$ -such as can be obtained from a spherical, isothermal-like density profile, or alternatively with a very prolate halo-. To decide whether we adopt the null (Rubin behaviour) or alternative (NFW behaviour) hypothesis, we evaluate the derivative in each galaxy of $v(r)$ with its last data points. We conclude that the data is presently compatible with the null hypothesis -no taper off, no decline of $v(r)$ is seen.</description>

      <title>The effect of non-uniformity density structure on the molecular cloud-cores magnetic braking in the ideal MHD framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of magnetic braking is one of the significant physical effects of the magnetic field in rotating molecular clouds. The physical characteristics of the core can affect on the core rotation rate. and one of the important parameter is the core density structure. According to observation, by regarding the power-law density distribution, $r^{-p}$, for molecular cloud cores, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation, the results show that the increasing of density steepness (i.e., larger $p$) leads to the intensity of the toroidal components of the magnetic field and as a result larger $B_{\phi}$-components lead to more transfer of angular momentum to the outward. Thus, results show that the magnetic braking being stronger with increasing density slope in non-uniform molecular core. For example, the rotation of the system can approximately decrease by fifty percent from $p=0.2$ to $p=1.8$ for a non-uniform system.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the galactic baryon cycle process by an empirical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an empirical model to describe and constrain the baryon cycle process during galaxy evolution. This model utilizes the evolution of star formation rate, derived from the stellar mass-halo mass relations (SHMRs) across different redshifts, and the cold gas content, derived from the NeutralUniverseMachine model, to constrain gas accretion and recycle of gas outflow in the model galaxy. Additionally, through detailed modeling of each cycle process, particularly the recycling process, and utilizing the gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z=0$ as a constraint, our model establishes a relation between the recycle fraction and halo mass. It is found that the fraction of gas recycled from the outflow is a function of halo mass, with a value of $25\%$ in galaxies with halo mass $\sim10^{10.4}M_{\rm \odot}$, increasing to $75\%$ in halos with mass $\sim 10^{12}M_{\rm \odot}$. We also find that the mass loading factor from the FIRE-2 simulation matches well with the constraints from both observational data and our model. Furthermore, using the gas content and metallicity of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) obtained from hydrodynamical simulations as constraints, our model predicts that on average $70\%$ of universal baryon accretion is accreted to the halo and $80\%$ of the non-recycled gas in the outflow has escaped from the galaxy, entering the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, we note that future observational data are needed to finally constrain the mass and metal exchange between the CGM and the IGM.</description>

      <title>The Interstellar Medium in I Zw 18 seen with JWST/MIRI: III. Spatially Resolved Three Ionization State Oxygen Abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of the nearby extremely metal-poor galaxy I Zw 18 using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) Integral Field Spectrographs (IFS). From optical and mid-IR oxygen emission lines, we measured direct-method abundances for three ionic states of oxygen, including O$^{3+}$/H$^+$. In contrast to previous studies of I Zw 18, the high spatial resolution afforded by KCWI and MIRI/MRS revealed chemical inhomogeneities on 60 pc scales in the form of metal-poor pockets and metal-enriched gas. These are located outside I Zw 18's star-forming complexes having possibly been dispersed beyond these regions via stellar feedback effects. We found that metallicities derived using a single low-ionization density tracer, and T$_{\rm e}$([O II]) derived from a temperature relationship commonly used in high-$z$ galaxy studies, exhibited the largest scatter and underestimated the metallicity compared to those derived using multi-ion densities and estimated T$_{\rm e}$([N II]). Finally, we compared O$^{3+}$/H$^+$ abundances from a theoretical ionization correction factor (ICF) against observed values and found that the oxygen ICF underestimates the O$^{3+}$/H$^+$ abundance by a factor of 2, indicating that either additional ionizing sources are needed or standard stellar population models are unable to produce the requisite ionizing flux.</description>

      <title>The role of young and evolved stars in the heating of dust in local galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Dust is a fundamental component of the interstellar medium (ISM) and plays a critical role in galaxy evolution. Dust grains influence the ISM by cooling the gas, altering its chemistry, and absorbing stellar radiation, re-emitting it at longer wavelengths in the far-infrared (FIR) and sub-millimeter regimes. The cold dust component, which dominates the dust mass, is primarily heated by stellar radiation, including both young, massive stars and the diffuse emission from older stars. Understanding dust heating is essential to trace the connection between stellar populations and their environments.
  Aims. We aim to identify the dominant heating mechanisms of the cold dust in typical nearby spiral galaxies and explore the contributions of young and evolved stars to dust heating.
  Methods. Using 18 large, face-on spiral galaxies from the DustPedia project, we apply two complementary approaches: (1) correlation analysis between dust temperature (T_dust), SFR surface density (Sigma_SFR), and stellar mass surface density (Sigma_Mstar); and (2) study of the relationship between T_dust and dust mass surface density (Sigma_dust).
  Results. T_dust peaks at ~24 K in galaxy centers and drops to ~15 K at large radii. Galaxies with and without AGNs show similar T_dust profiles. For ~72% of the sample, both methods agree on the dominant heating source. Overall, we find that both young and evolved stars contribute to dust heating, with their relative roles varying between galaxies.</description>

      <title>Road through Dark$\nu$ess: Probing dark matter-neutrino interactions using KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: KM3NeT has recently reported an event where a muon of energy $120^{+110}_{-60}$ PeV was observed at its ARCA detector, which can stem from a very high-energy neutrino interaction in the vicinity of the detector. Besides revolutionizing our understanding of high-energy neutrino sources, this event can serve as a valuable probe for studying Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) interactions of neutrinos. In this work, we study the dark matter (DM)-neutrino interaction by assuming the neutrino for the event KM3-230213A is originated from a blazar. The flux of such neutrinos, traveling through DM distributed across astrophysical and cosmological scales, can get attenuated due to DM interactions. The detection of such event by KM3NeT allows us to place constraints on the interaction cross section at highest-ever neutrino energy. We derive both conservative constraints-neglecting flux attenuation from the host halo-and optimistic ones by including host halo contributions. Our results show that the energy-independent constraints are weaker than previous bounds. For energy-dependent case, the extreme energy of the event allows us to set some of the strongest limits on scattering cross sections. In future, more such neutrino events with well-understood origin will be essential in constraining or potentially discovering DM-neutrino interactions.</description>

Abstract: In the 1960s and 1970s a series of observations and theoretical developments highlighted the presence of several anomalies which could, in principle, be explained by postulating one of the following two working hypotheses: (i) the existence of dark matter, or (ii) the modification of standard gravitational dynamics in low accelerations. In the years that followed, the dark matter hypothesis as an explanation for dark matter phenomenology attracted far more attention compared to the hypothesis of modified gravity, and the latter is largely regarded today as a non-viable alternative. The present article takes an integrated history and philosophy of science approach in order to identify the reasons why the scientific community mainly pursued the dark matter hypothesis in the years that followed, as opposed to modified gravity. A plausible answer is given in terms of three epistemic criteria for the pursuitworthiness of a hypothesis: (a) its problem-solving potential, (b) its compatibility with established theories and the feasibility of incorporation, and (c) its independent testability. A further comparison between the problem of dark matter and the problem of dark energy is also presented, explaining why in the latter case the situation is different, and modified gravity is still considered a viable possibility.</description>

Abstract: The dark matter may consist of multiple species that interact differently. We show that a species that is cosmologically subdominant but highly collisional can pile up and become dominant in deep gravitational wells, such as those of white dwarfs and neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On July 1st 2025 the third interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS or C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), was discovered, with an eccentricity of $e=6.15 \pm 0.01$ and perihelion of $q=1.357\pm0.001$ au. We report our initial visible to near-infrared (420-1000 nm) spectrophotometry of 3I/ATLAS using both the Palomar 200 inch telescope and Apache Point Observatory. We measure 3I/ATLAS to have a red spectral slope of 19 %/100 nm in the 420-700 nm range, and a more neutral 6 %/100 nm slope over 700-1000 nm. We detect no notable emission features such as from C$_2$.</description>

      <title>The origin of the most recently ejected OB runaway star from the R136 cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\sim 60\,000$ solar-mass (\MSun) star-cluster R136 (NGC~2070) in the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud is the host of at least 55 massive stars ($M \apgt 10$\,\MSun) which move away from the cluster at projected velocities $\gteq 27.5$\,km/s \cite{2024Natur.634..809S}. The origin of the high velocities of such runaway stars have been debated since the 1960s, resulting either from dynamical ejections \citep{1961BAN....15..265B,1961BAN....15..291B} or from supernova explosions \citep{1983ApJ...267..322H}. Due to the Gaia satellite's outstanding precision, we can now retrace the most recently ejected binary star, Mel 34, back to the center of R136 and reconstruct the events that 52\,000 years ago let to its removal from R136, i.e., we establish its dynamical interaction and ejection history. We find that this ejection requires the participation of 5 stars in a strong interaction between a triple composed of the tight massive binary Mel~39 orbited by the star VFTS~590, and the binary star Mel~34. The participation of 5 stars is unexpected because runaway stars were not expected to result from triple interactions \cite{2011Sci...334.1380F}. The deterministic nature of the Newtonian dynamics in the scattering enables us to reconstruct the encounter that ejected Mel~34. We then predict that Mel~39 is a binary star with an 80\,\Msun\, companion star that orbits within $\sim 1^\circ$ in the same plane as Mel~34, and escapes the cluster with a velocity of $\sim 64$\,km/s. The five stars will undergo supernova explosions in the coming 5\,Myr at a distance of $\sim 180$\,pc to $\sim 332$\,pc from their birth location (R\,136). The resulting black hole binaries, however, are not expected to merge within a Hubble time.</description>

      <title>Is the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Alien Technology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At this early stage of its passage through our Solar System, 3I/ATLAS, the recently discovered interstellar interloper, has displayed various anomalous characteristics, determined from photometric and astrometric observations. As largely a pedagogical exercise, in this paper we present additional analysis into the astrodynamics of 3I/ATLAS, and hypothesize that this object could be technological, and possibly hostile as would be expected from the 'Dark Forest' resolution to the 'Fermi Paradox'. We show that 3I/ATLAS approaches surprisingly close to Venus, Mars and Jupiter, with a probability of $\lesssim 0.005$\%. Furthermore the low retrograde tilt of 3I/ATLAS's orbital plane to the ecliptic offers various benefits to an Extra-terrestrial Intelligence (ETI), since it allows the object access to our planet with relative impunity. The eclipse by the Sun from Earth of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion, would allow it to conduct a clandestine reverse Solar Oberth Manoeuvre, an optimal high-thrust strategy for interstellar spacecraft to brake and stay bound to the Sun. An optimal intercept of Earth would entail an arrival in late November/early December of 2025, and also, a non-gravitational acceleration of $\sim{5.9} \times 10^{-5}$ au day$^{-2}$, normalized at 1 au from the Sun, would indicate an intent to intercept the planet Jupiter, not far off its path, and a strategy to rendezvous with it after perihelion.</description>

      <title>Near-Discovery Observations of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar Objects are comets and asteroids that formed around other stars but were ejected before they could accrete into exoplanets. They therefore represent a rare opportunity to compare the building blocks of planets in the Solar System to those in other stellar systems. The third Interstellar Object, 3I/ATLAS, is the newest, brightest, potentially largest, and fastest member of this population. We report observations of 3I/ATLAS taken on 2025 July 3 and 4 with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility just days after its discovery. In r'-band imaging with 'Opihi, we see no obvious lightcurve variability and derive a g'-i' color of 1.06+/-0.11 which is consistent in spectral slope to recent work by D.Z. Seligman et al. (2025) and C. Opitom (2025). We obtained the first near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectrum of 3I/ATLAS with SpeX. The visible color and NIR spectrum show a linear, red visible slope, a somewhat less red slope between 0.7 and 1.1 $\mu{m}$, and a neutral or slightly blue slope at longer wavelengths. Challenges in modeling the reflectivity of 3I may indicate that this comet has a complex grain size distribution, grain compositions unlike Solar system comets, or both. Like 2I/Borisov, there are no obvious signatures of water ice in the coma of 3I/ATLAS. Observations closer to perihelion will help elucidate whether 3I has less water than anticipated or whether the Interstellar Objects might retain and release their ices somewhat differently than Solar System comets do.</description>

      <title>The $R$-Process Alliance: Enrichment of $r$-process Elements in a Simulated Milky Way-like Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation of stars with varying amounts of heavy elements synthesized by the rapid neutron-capture process ($r$-process) based on our detailed cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with an $N$-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, ASURA. Most stars with no overabundance in $r$-process elements, as well as the strongly $r$-process enhanced $r$-II stars ([Eu/Fe] $&gt;+0.7$), are formed in dwarf galaxies accreted by the Milky Way within the 6 Gyr after the Big Bang. In contrast, over half of the moderately enhanced $r$-I stars ($+0.3 &lt;$ [Eu/Fe] $\leq +0.7$) are formed in the main in-situ disk after 6 Gyr. Our results suggest that the fraction of $r$-I and $r$-II stars formed in disrupted dwarf galaxies is larger the higher their [Eu/Fe] is. Accordingly, the most strongly enhanced $r$-III stars ([Eu/Fe] $&gt; +2.0$) are formed in accreted components. These results suggest that non-$r$-process-enhanced stars and $r$-II stars are mainly formed in low-mass dwarf galaxies that hosted either none or a single neutron star merger, while the $r$-I stars tend to form in the well-mixed in-situ disk. We compare our findings with high-resolution spectroscopic observations of $r$-process-enhanced metal-poor stars in the halo and dwarf galaxies, including those collected by the R-Process Alliance. We conclude that observed [Eu/Fe] and [Eu/Mg] ratios can be employed in chemical tagging of the Milky Way's accretion history.</description>

Abstract: In models of dark matter composed of feebly interacting ultralight bosons in the state of Bose-Einstein condensate, the dynamical friction force acting on circularly moving globular clusters modelled as Plummer spheres is determined. Analytic expressions for both radial and tangential components of the dynamical friction force are given. We reveal that the dynamical friction force for the Plummer sphere deviates from that for a point probe of the same mass for a significantly large ratio of the Plummer sphere radius to its orbital radius, as well as for large values of the Mach number.</description>

      <title>The XMAGNET exascale MHD simulations of SMBH feedback in galaxy groups and clusters: Overview and preliminary cluster results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present initial results from extremely well-resolved 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of idealized galaxy clusters, conducted using the AthenaPK code on the Frontier exascale supercomputer. These simulations explore the self-regulation of galaxy groups and cool-core clusters by cold gas-triggered active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback incorporating magnetized kinetic jets. Our simulation campaign includes simulations of galaxy groups and clusters with a range of masses and intragroup and intracluster medium properties. In this paper we present results that focus on a Perseus-like cluster. We find that the simulated clusters are self-regulating, with the cluster cores staying at a roughly constant thermodynamic state and AGN jet power staying at physically reasonable values ($\simeq 10^{44}-10^{45}$~erg/s) for billions of years without a discernible duty cycle. These simulations also produce significant amounts of cold gas, with calculations having strong magnetic fields generally both promoting cold gas formation and allowing cold gas out to much larger clustercentric radii ($\simeq 100$~kpc) than simulations with weak or no fields ($\simeq 10$~kpc), and also having more filamentary cold gas morphology. We find that AGN feedback significantly increases the strength of magnetic fields at the center of the cluster. We also find that the magnetized turbulence generated by the AGN results in turbulence where the velocity power spectra are tied to AGN activity whereas the magnetic energy spectra are much less impacted after reaching a stationary state.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots as the Very First Activity of Black Hole Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope has detected massive black holes (BHs) with masses of $\sim 10^{6-8}~M_\odot$ within the first billion years of the universe. One of the remarkable findings is the identification of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs), a unique class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with distinct characteristics representing a key phase in the formation and growth of early BHs. Here, we analyze the occurrence rate of LRDs, which emerge around redshifts $z \sim 6-8$ and sharply decline at $z &lt; 4$. We find that this trend follows a log-normal distribution, commonly observed in phenomena driven by stochastic and random factors. We propose a hypothesis that the first one or two AGN events associated with newly-formed seed BHs are observed as LRDs and their unique features fade in the subsequent episodes. This naturally explains the cosmic evolution of AGN abundance over $0 &lt; z &lt; 5$, which follows $\propto (1+z)^{-5/2}$ due to the cumulative effect of recurring AGN activity. The unique characteristics of LRDs are likely linked to the dense gas environments around the seed BHs, which create strong absorption features in the broad-line emission and enable super-Eddington accretion bursts, ultimately yielding the observed overmassive nature of BHs compared to the local relationship. An analytical expression for the redshift evolution of LRD abundance is provided for direct comparison with future observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Narrow absorption lines from intervening material in supernovae. II. Galaxy properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) has a number of tracers such as the Na I D 5890, 5896 AA absorption lines that are evident in the spectra of galaxies but also in those of individual astrophysical sources such as stars, novae or quasars. Here, we investigate narrow absorption features in the spectra of nearby supernovae (SNe) and compare them to local (&lt; 0.5 kpc) and global host galaxy properties. With a large and heterogeneous sample of spectra, we are able to recover the known relations of ISM with galaxy properties: larger columns of ISM gas are found in environments that are more massive, more actively star-forming, younger and viewed from a more inclined angle. Most trends are stronger for local than global properties, and we find that the ISM column density decreases exponentially with the offset from the host galaxy centre, as expected for a gas distribution following an exponential radial profile. We also confirm trends for the velocity of galactic outflows increasing with radius. The current study demonstrates the capability of individual light sources to serve as ubiquitous tracers of ISM properties across various environments and galaxies.</description>

      <title>Fe Abundances of Early Galaxies at $z=9-12$ Derived with Deep JWST Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive Fe-abundance ratios of 7 galaxies at $z=9-12$ with $-22&lt;M_{\mathrm{UV}}&lt;-19$ whose JWST/NIRSpec spectra achieve very high signal-to-noise ratios, $\mathrm{SNR}=60-320$, at the rest-frame UV wavelength. We fit stellar population synthesis model spectra to these JWST spectra, masking out nebular emission lines, and obtain Fe-abundance ratios of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-1-0$ for 5 galaxies and upper limits of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\sim-2-0$ for 2 galaxies. We compare these [Fe/H] values with the oxygen abundances of these galaxies ($7.4&lt;12+\log{\mathrm{(O/H)}}&lt;8.4$) in the same manner as previous studies of $z\sim2-6$ galaxies, and derive oxygen-to-iron abundance ratios [O/Fe]. We find that 2 out of 7 galaxies, GS-z11-0 and GN-z11, show Fe enhancements relative to O ($\mathrm{[O/Fe]}&lt;0$), especially GS-z11-0 ($z=11.12$) with a Fe enhancement ($\mathrm{[O/Fe]}=-0.68_{-0.55}^{+0.37}$) beyond the solar-abundance ratio at $\sim2\sigma$. Because, unlike GS-z11-0, GN-z11 ($z=10.60$) may be an AGN, we constrain [O/Fe] via FeII emission under the assumption of AGN and confirm that the Fe enhancement is consistent even in the case of AGN. While [O/Fe] values of most galaxies are comparable to those of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) yields, the Fe enhancements of GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 are puzzling. We develop chemical evolution models, and find that the Fe enhancements in GS-z11-0 and GN-z11 can be explained by 1) pair-instability supernovae/bright hypernovae with little contribution of CCSNe or 2) Type-Ia supernovae with short delay time ($\sim30-50$ Myr) with a top-light initial mass function.</description>

Abstract: The GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy) Sample is a thorough compilation of the 'brightest' radio sources in the southern sky (Declination &lt; 30 deg), as measured at 151 MHz (S &gt; 4.0 Jy) with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), through the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) Survey. In addition to flux-density measurements, the G4Jy catalogue provides host-galaxy identifications (through careful visual-inspection) and four sets of spectral indices. Despite their brightness in the radio, many of these sources are poorly-studied, with the vast majority lacking a spectroscopic redshift in published work. This is crucial for studying the intrinsic properties of the sources, and so we conduct a multi-semester observing campaign on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), with optical spectroscopy enabling us to provide new redshifts to the astronomical community. Initial results show that not all of the host galaxies exhibit emission-line spectra in the optical (~4500-7500 Ang), which illustrates the importance of radio-frequency selection (rather than optical selection) for creating an unbiased sample of active galactic nuclei. By combining SALT redshifts with those from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we calculate radio luminosities and linear sizes for 299 G4Jy sources (which includes one newly-discovered giant radio-galaxy, G4Jy 604). Furthermore, with the highest redshift acquired (so far) being z ~ 2.2 from SDSS, we look forward to evolution studies of this complete sample, as well as breaking degeneracies in radio properties with respect to, for example, the galaxy environment.</description>

      <title>Morphology and stellar populations of a candidate ultra-diffuse galaxy in early Euclid and Rubin imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present multi-wavelength imaging and analysis of a low surface brightness (LSB) dwarf galaxy in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS), SMDG0333094-280938, with particular emphasis on data from the Euclid space telescope and from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The galaxy is clumpy and blue, and appears to host globular clusters (GCs), suggesting a distance of ~50-60 Mpc which would make the dwarf an ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG). We carry out spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting from the far-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, in order to estimate the galaxy age and metallicity. We infer a recent peak of star formation that may have led to the formation of the UDG through feedback-driven expansion. This early analysis illustrates how Euclid and Rubin are poised to identify and characterize many thousands of UDGs and other LSB galaxies in the near future, including their GCs and stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Statistical nuclear spin ratios of deuterated ammonia in the pre-stellar core L1544</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determined the ortho/para (o/p) ratios of NH2D and NHD2 in the archetypical pre-stellar core L1544. The core was observed in the two lowest rotational lines of ortho- and para-NH2D using the APEX and the IRAM 30 m telescopes. The ground-state lines of ortho- and para-NHD2 were observed with APEX. The distributions of chemical abundances in the core were predicted using a gas-grain chemistry model with two different scenarios concerning proton transfer reactions in the gas. One of the scenarios, the so-called full scrambling (FS), allows protons and deuterons to be completely mixed in the intermediate reaction complex before dissociation, whereas the other describes these reactions as proton or deuteron hops (PH). We also tested assumed abundance profiles independent of the chemistry models. Radiative transfer calculations were used to simulate the observed NH2D and NHD2 lines from the predicted and assumed abundance profiles. Our modelling efforts suggest that the ground-state lines of NH2D and NHD2 at the wavelength 0.9 mm that are observable with the same beam and in the same spectrometer band are the most reliable probes of the o/p ratios. Simulations using the PH reaction scheme show systematically better agreement with the observations than simulations with the FS model. Simulations using a broken power law abundance profile as a function of the gas density give spin ratios that are close to the predictions of the PH scenario: o/p-NH2D=2.85+-0.05, o/p-NHD2=2.10+-0.06 (1 sigma). The o/p ratios predicted by the PH scenario in the gas phase correspond to the nuclear spin statistical weights, that is, o/p-NH2D=3, o/p-NHD2=2. In view of the fact that H and D atom addition reactions on grain surfaces also result in these ratios, it is reasonable to assume that the spin ratios of interstellar ammonia and its deuterated forms are in general equal to their statistical values.</description>

      <title>Polarization-shape alignment of IllustrisTNG star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In star-forming disk galaxies, the radio continuum emission (1-10 GHz) powered by star formation has an integral polarization direction imperfectly aligned with the apparent disk minor axis. This polarization-shape alignment effect was previously observed in a small sample of local spirals. If this is prevalent for disk galaxies out to cosmological redshifts, novel measurements of cosmic birefringence and cosmic shear will be enabled by leveraging radio continuum surveys such as the Square Kilometre Array synergized with galaxy shape measurements. We calculate the polarization-shape misalignment angle for star-forming galaxies in the IllustrisTNG50 simulation at 0 &lt; z &lt; 2, assuming that additional polarized radio emission from an active galactic nucleus is negligible in at least a sizable fraction of the star-forming galaxies. The alignment found for z = 0 is consistent with local spiral data, but significantly deteriorates as redshift increases. Moreover, it degrades toward lower frequencies due to internal Faraday depolarization. Thanks to cosmic redshifting, observing higher-z galaxies at a fixed frequency greatly mitigates degradation due to reduced Faraday depolarization at the source-frame frequency. We present analytic fits to the non-Gaussian misalignment angle distribution, and evaluate Fisher information per galaxy for measuring a polarization rotation angle induced by cosmic birefringence. For observation at 4.8 GHz, the effective root-mean-square misalignment angle is 18{\deg}, 23{\deg}, and 33{\deg} at z = 0, 1 and 2, respectively. As accurate observation-driven models are not yet available for cosmological galaxy samples, our results motivate pilot observations to empirically characterize polarization-shape alignment, and can facilitate forecasts of cosmology and fundamental physics applications that exploit this effect.</description>

      <title>Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE): A Census of Star Formation and Cold Gas Properties in Massive protoclusters at 1.5&lt;z&lt;4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive protoclusters at z~1.5-4, the peak of the cosmic star formation history, are key to understanding the formation mechanisms of massive galaxies in today's clusters. However, studies of protoclusters at these high redshifts remain limited, primarily due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous selection criteria. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of the star formation and cold gas properties of member galaxies of eight massive protoclusters in the COSMOS field, using the statistical and homogeneously selected sample from the Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE). Our analysis reveals a steep increase in the star formation rates per halo mass ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR} /M_{\rm halo}$) with redshifts in these intensively star-forming protoclusters, reaching values one to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed in the field at z&gt;2. We further show that, instead of an enhancement of starbursts, this increase is largely driven by the concentration of massive and gas-rich star-forming galaxies in the protocluster cores. The member galaxies still generally follow the same star formation main sequence as in the field, with a moderate enhancement at the low mass end. Notably, the most massive protocluster galaxies ($M_\star$&gt;8$\times$10$^{10}$M$_\odot$) exhibit higher $f_{\rm gas}$ and $\tau_{\rm gas}$ than their field counterparts, while remaining on the star forming main sequence. These gas-rich, massive, and star-forming galaxies are predominantly concentrated in the protocluster cores and are likely progenitors of massive ellipticals in the center of today's clusters. These results suggest that the formation of massive galaxies in such environments is sustained by substantial gas reservoirs, which support persistent star formation and drive early mass assembly in forming cluster cores.</description>

      <title>What's kickin' in partial tidal disruption events?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stars partially destroyed by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a partial tidal disruption event (TDE) can be ejected from the SMBH. Previous investigations attributed this positive-energy/velocity kick to asymmetries in the mass lost by the star near pericenter. We propose that asymmetric mass loss is not predominantly responsible for "kicking" the star, and that these kicks instead arise from the combination of a) the reformation of the core following an initial phase of quasi-ballistic motion, and b) the differential shear between the unbound and marginally bound (to the SMBH) material during this phase. We predict that the kick speed $v_{\rm kick}$ is weakly dependent on the stellar properties, and for SMBH masses $M_{\bullet} \gtrsim 10^{3} M_{\odot}$, $v_{\rm kick}$ is independent of SMBH mass, is not limited to the stellar escape speed $v_{\rm esc}$, and is related to the surviving core mass $M_{\rm c}$ approximately as $v_{\rm kick} \simeq 0.45 \left(M_{\rm c}/M_{\star}\right)^{-1/3}$, where $M_{\star}$ is the original stellar mass. For $M_{\bullet} \lesssim 10^{3} M_{\odot}$, we find that the maximum-attainable kick speed depends on SMBH mass, satisfies $v_{\rm kick, max} \simeq 0.4 \, v_{\rm esc}\left(M_{\bullet}/M_{\star}\right)^{1/6}$, and is reached for core masses that satisfy $M_{\rm c}/M_{\star} \lesssim 1.7\left(M_{\bullet}/M_{\star}\right)^{-1/2}$. This model predicts that massive stars with $M_{\star}\gtrsim few\times 10 M_{\odot}$ could be ejected at speeds $\gtrsim (1-2)\times 10^3$ km s$^{-1}$ if stripped of $\gtrsim 50\%$ of their mass.</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Lens Caustics with Gravitational Waves: A Uniform Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework for modeling gravitational wave diffraction near fold caustics using the Uniform Approximation (UA), focusing on binary mass lenses - axially asymmetric systems with complex caustic structures. Full-wave methods based on the Kirchhoff integral become impractical in this regime due to highly oscillatory integrands. The UA provides a robust and accurate description of the wave field near folds, resolving the breakdown of Geometrical Optics at caustics and improving upon Transitional Asymptotics - based on Airy function approximations - which lack global validity. Central to our approach is the concept of the caustic width, $d_c$, a characteristic length scale defining the region where diffraction significantly alters wave propagation. We find that $d_c$ scales universally with the gravitational wavelength as ~ $ \lambda^{2/3}$ and inversely with the redshifted lens mass as ~ $ M_{Lz}^{-2/3}$. The wave amplification near the fold grows as ~ $ d_c^{-1/4}$, substantially enhancing the signal and potentially playing a key role in the detection of gravitational waves lensed near caustics. Notably, for lens masses below the galactic scale, the caustic width for gravitational waves is not negligible compared to the Einstein radius - as it is in electromagnetic lensing - making the UA essential for accurately capturing wave effects.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic alignment demographics for next-generation lensing: Revealing galaxy property trends with DESI Y1 direct measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present direct measurements of the intrinsic alignments (IA) of over 2 million spectroscopic galaxies using DESI Data Release 1 and imaging from four lensing surveys: DES, HSC, KiDS, and SDSS. In this uniquely data-rich regime, we take initial steps towards a more tailored IA modelling approach by building a library of IA measurements across colour, luminosity, stellar mass, and redshift. We map the dependence between galaxy type -- in terms of rest-frame colour, strength of the 4000 Angstrom break, and specific star formation rate -- and IA amplitude; the bluest galaxies have an alignment consistent with zero, across low ($0.05&lt;z&lt;0.5$) and high ($0.8&lt;z&lt;1.55$) redshifts. In order to construct cosmic shear samples that are minimally impacted by IA but maintain maximum sample size and statistical power, we map the dependence of alignment with colour purity. Red, quenched galaxies are strongly aligned and the amplitude of the signal increases with luminosity, which is tightly correlated with stellar mass in our catalogues. For DESI galaxies between $0&lt;z&lt;1.5$, trends in luminosity and colour alone are sufficient to explain the alignments we measure -- with no need for an explicit redshift dependence. In a companion paper (Jeffrey et al., in prep), we perform detailed modelling of the IA signals with significant detections, including model comparison. Finally, to direct efforts for future IA measurements, we juxtapose the colour-magnitude-redshift coverage of existing IA measurements against modern and future lensing surveys.</description>
