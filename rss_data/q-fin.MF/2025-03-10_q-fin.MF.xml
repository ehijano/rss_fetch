      <title>Distortion risk measures of sums of two counter-monotonic risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will show that under certain conditions, associated to any fixed distortion function $g$, the distortion risk measure of a sum of two counter-monotonic risks can be expressed as the sum of two related distortion risk measures of the marginals involved, one associated to the original distortion function $g$ and the other associated to the dual distortion function of $g$. This result extends some of the work in \cite{Chaoubi et al. (2020)} and \cite{HLD} since the class of distortion risk measures includes the risk measure of VaR and TVaR as special cases.</description>

      <title>Multi-asset optimal trade execution with stochastic cross-effects: An Obizhaeva-Wang-type framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a continuous-time optimal trade execution problem in multiple assets where the price impact and the resilience can be matrix-valued stochastic processes that incorporate cross-impact effects. In addition, we allow for stochastic terminal and running targets. Initially, we formulate the optimal trade execution task as a stochastic control problem with a finite-variation control process that acts as an integrator both in the state dynamics and in the cost functional. We then extend this problem continuously to a stochastic control problem with progressively measurable controls. By identifying this extended problem as equivalent to a certain linear-quadratic stochastic control problem, we can use established results in linear-quadratic stochastic control to solve the extended problem. This work generalizes [Ackermann, Kruse, Urusov; FinancStoch'24] from the single-asset setting to the multi-asset case. In particular, we reveal cross-hedging effects, showing that it can be optimal to trade in an asset despite having no initial position. Moreover, as a subsetting we discuss a multi-asset variant of the model in [Obizhaeva, Wang; JFinancMark'13].</description>

      <title>The Risk-Neutral Equivalent Pricing of Model-Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing approaches to asset-pricing under model-uncertainty adapt classical utility-maximisation frameworks and seek theoretical comprehensiveness. We move toward practice by considering binary model-uncertainties and by switching attention from 'preference' to 'constraints'. Economic asset-pricing in this setting is found to decompose into the viable pricing of model-risk and of non-model risk separately such that the former has a unique and intuitive risk-neutral equivalent formulation with convenient properties. Its parameter, a dynamically conserved constant of model-risk inference, allows an integrated representation of ex-ante risk-pricing and bias, such that their ex-post price-effects can be disentangled, through well-known price anomalies such as Moment and Low-Risk.</description>
