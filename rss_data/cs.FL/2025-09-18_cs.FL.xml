      <title>How Concise are Chains of co-B\"uchi Automata?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chains of co-B\"uchi automata (COCOA) have recently been introduced as a new canonical model for representing arbitrary omega-regular languages. They can be minimized in polynomial time and are hence an attractive language representation for applications in which normally, deterministic omega-automata are used. While it is known how to build COCOA from deterministic parity automata, little is currently known about their relationship to automaton models introduced earlier than COCOA.
  In this paper, we analyze the conciseness of chains of co-B\"uchi automata. We show that even in the case that all automata in the chain are deterministic, chains of co-B\"uchi automata can be exponentially more concise than deterministic parity automata. We then answer the question if this conciseness is retained when performing Boolean operations (such as disjunction and conjunction) over COCOA by showing that there exist families of languages for which these operations lead to an exponential growth of the sizes of the automata. The families have the property that when representing them using deterministic parity automata, taking the disjunction or conjunction of them only requires a polynomial blow-up, which shows that Boolean operations over COCOA do not retain their conciseness in general.</description>

      <title>Exploring Major Transitions in the Evolution of Biological Cognition With Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transitional accounts of evolution emphasise a few changes that shape what is evolvable, with dramatic consequences for derived lineages. More recently it has been proposed that cognition might also have evolved via a series of major transitions that manipulate the structure of biological neural networks, fundamentally changing the flow of information. We used idealised models of information flow, artificial neural networks (ANNs), to evaluate whether changes in information flow in a network can yield a transitional change in cognitive performance. We compared networks with feed-forward, recurrent and laminated topologies, and tested their performance learning artificial grammars that differed in complexity, controlling for network size and resources. We documented a qualitative expansion in the types of input that recurrent networks can process compared to feed-forward networks, and a related qualitative increase in performance for learning the most complex grammars. We also noted how the difficulty in training recurrent networks poses a form of transition barrier and contingent irreversibility -- other key features of evolutionary transitions. Not all changes in network topology confer a performance advantage in this task set. Laminated networks did not outperform non-laminated networks in grammar learning. Overall, our findings show how some changes in information flow can yield transitions in cognitive performance.</description>

      <title>An Automaton-based Characterisation of First-Order Logic over Infinite Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study First Order Logic (FO)  over (unordered) infinite trees and its connection with branching-time temporal logics. More specifically, we provide an automata-theoretic characterisation of FO interpreted over infinite trees. To this end, two different classes of hesitant tree automata are introduced and proved to capture precisely the expressive power of two branching time temporal  logics, denoted polcCTLp and cCTL*[f], which are, respectively, a restricted version of counting CTL with past and counting CTL* over finite paths, both of which have been previously shown equivalent to FO over infinite trees. The two automata characterisations naturally lead to normal forms for the two temporal logics, and highlight the fact that FO can only express properties of the tree branches which are either safety or co-safety in nature.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Generalized HyperLTL with Stuttering and Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We settle the complexity of satisfiability and model-checking for generalized HyperLTL with stuttering and contexts, an expressive logic for the specification of asynchronous hyperproperties. Such properties cannot be specified in HyperLTL, as it is restricted to synchronous hyperproperties. Nevertheless, we prove that satisfiability is $\Sigma_1^1$-complete and thus not harder than for HyperLTL. On the other hand, we prove that model-checking is equivalent to truth in second-order arithmetic, and thus much harder than the decidable HyperLTL model-checking problem. The lower bounds for the model-checking problem hold even when only allowing stuttering or only allowing contexts.</description>
