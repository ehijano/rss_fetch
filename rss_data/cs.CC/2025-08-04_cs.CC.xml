      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Inapproximability of E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Maxmin E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration problem, we are given a satisfiable $k$-CNF formula $\varphi$ where each clause contains exactly $k$ literals, along with a pair of its satisfying assignments. The objective is transform one satisfying assignment into the other by repeatedly flipping the value of a single variable, while maximizing the minimum fraction of satisfied clauses of $\varphi$ throughout the transformation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the optimal approximation factor for Maxmin E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration is $1 - \Theta\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$. On the algorithmic side, we develop a deterministic $\left(1-\frac{1}{k-1}-\frac{1}{k}\right)$-factor approximation algorithm for every $k \geq 3$. On the hardness side, we show that it is $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-hard to approximate this problem within a factor of $1-\frac{1}{10k}$ for every sufficiently large $k$. Note that an ``$\mathsf{NP}$ analogue'' of Maxmin E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration is Max E$k$-SAT, whose approximation threshold is $1-\frac{1}{2^k}$ shown by H\r{a}stad (JACM 2001). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reconfiguration problem whose approximation threshold is (asymptotically) worse than that of its $\mathsf{NP}$ analogue. To prove the hardness result, we introduce a new ``non-monotone'' test, which is specially tailored to reconfiguration problems, despite not being helpful in the PCP regime.</description>

      <title>Are controlled unitaries helpful?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many quantum algorithms, to compute some property of a unitary $U$, require access not just to $U$, but to $cU$, the unitary with a control qubit. We show that having access to $cU$ does not help for a large class of quantum problems. For a quantum circuit which uses $cU$ and $cU^\dagger$ and outputs $|\psi(U)\rangle$, we show how to ``decontrol'' the circuit into one which uses only $U$ and $U^\dagger$ and outputs $|\psi(\varphi U)\rangle$ for a uniformly random phase $\varphi$, with a small amount of time and space overhead. When we only care about the output state up to a global phase on $U$, then the decontrolled circuit suffices. Stated differently, $cU$ is only helpful because it contains global phase information about $U$.
  A version of our procedure is described in an appendix of Sheridan, Maslov, and Mosca [SMM09]. Our goal with this work is to popularize this result by generalizing it and investigating its implications, in order to counter negative results in the literature which might lead one to believe that decontrolling is not possible. As an application, we give a simple proof for the existence of unitary ensembles which are pseudorandom under access to $U$, $U^\dagger$, $cU$, and $cU^\dagger$.</description>

      <title>Proof complexity of Mal'tsev CSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) form a broad class of combinatorial problems, which can be formulated as homomorphism problems between relational structures. The CSP dichotomy theorem classifies all such problems over finite domains into two categories: NP-complete and polynomial-time, see Zhuk (2017), Bulatov (2017). Polynomial-time CSPs can be further subdivided into smaller subclasses. Mal'tsev CSPs are defined by the property that every relation in the problem is invariant under a Mal'tsev operation, a ternary operation $\mu$ satisfying $\mu(x, y, y) = \mu(y, y, x) = x$ for all $x, y$. Bulatov and Dalmau proved that Mal'tsev CSPs are solvable in polynomial time, presenting an algorithm for such CSPs (2006). The negation of an unsatisfiable CSP instance can be expressed as a propositional tautology. We formalize the algorithm for Mal'tsev CSPs within bounded arithmetic $V^1$, which captures polynomial-time reasoning and corresponds to the extended Frege proof system. We show that $V^1$ proves the soundness of Mal'tsev algorithm, implying that tautologies expressing the non-existence of a solution for unsatisfiable instances of Mal'tsev CSPs admit short extended Frege proofs. In addition, with small adjustments, we achieved an analogous result for Dalmau's algorithm that solves generalized majority-minority CSPs -- a common generalization of near-unanimity operations and Mal'tsev operations.</description>

      <title>Finding One Local Optimum Is Easy -- But What about Two?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The class PLS (Polynomial Local Search) captures the complexity of finding a solution that is locally optimal and has proven to be an important concept in the theory of local search. It has been shown that local search versions of various combinatorial optimization problems, such as Maximum Independent Set and Max Cut, are complete for this class. Such computational intractability typically arises in local search problems allowing arbitrary weights; in contrast, for unweighted problems, locally optimal solutions can be found in polynomial time under standard settings. In this paper, we pursue the complexity of local search problems from a different angle: We show that computing two locally optimal solutions is NP-hard for various natural unweighted local search problems, including Maximum Independent Set, Minimum Dominating Set, Max SAT, and Max Cut. We also discuss several tractable cases for finding two (or more) local optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Verification Cost Asymmetry in Cognitive Warfare: A Complexity-Theoretic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human verification under adversarial information flow operates as a cost-bounded decision procedure constrained by working memory limits and cognitive biases. We introduce the Verification Cost Asymmetry (VCA) coefficient, formalizing it as the ratio of expected verification work between populations under identical claim distributions. Drawing on probabilistically checkable proofs (PCP) and parameterized complexity theory, we construct dissemination protocols that reduce verification for trusted audiences to constant human effort while imposing superlinear costs on adversarial populations lacking cryptographic infrastructure. We prove theoretical guarantees for this asymmetry, validate the framework through controlled user studies measuring verification effort with and without spot-checkable provenance, and demonstrate practical encoding of real-world information campaigns. The results establish complexity-theoretic foundations for engineering democratic advantage in cognitive warfare, with immediate applications to content authentication, platform governance, and information operations doctrine.</description>
