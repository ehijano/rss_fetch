      <title>Some density results for hyperk\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangian fibrations of hyperk\"ahler manifolds are induced by semi-ample line bundles which are isotropic with respect to the Beauville-Bogomolov-Fujiki form. For a non-isotrivial family of hyperk\"ahler manifolds over a complex manifold $S$ of positive dimension, we prove that the set of points in $S$, for which there is an isotropic class in the Picard lattice of the corresponding hyperk\"ahler manifold represented as a fiber over that point, is analytically dense in $S$. We also prove the expected openness and density of the locus of polarised hyperk\"ahler manifolds that admit a nef algebraic isotropic line bundle.</description>

      <title>Fibrations on the 6-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Z$ be a compact, connected $3$-dimensional complex manifold with vanishing first and second Betti numbers and non-vanishing Euler characteristic. We prove that there is no holomorphic mapping from $Z$ onto any $2$-dimensional complex space. Combining this with a result of Campana-Demailly-Peternell, a corollary is that any holomorphic mapping from the $6$-dimensional sphere $S^6$, endowed with any hypothetical complex structure, to a strictly lower-dimensional complex space must be constant. In other words, there does not exist any holomorphic fibration on $S^6$.</description>

      <title>Seiberg-like duality for resolutions of determinantal varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the genus-zero Gromov-Witten theory of two natural resolutions of determinantal varieties, termed the PAX and PAXY models. We realize each resolution as lying in a quiver bundle, and show that the respective quiver bundles are related by a quiver mutation. We prove that generating functions of genus-zero Gromov-Witten invariants for the two resolutions are related by a specific cluster change of variables. Along the way, we obtain a quantum Thom-Porteous formula for determinantal varieties and prove a Seiberg-like duality statement for certain quiver bundles.</description>

Abstract: We study degenerations of complex projective spaces $\mathbb P^n$ into normal projective klt varieties $X$. If the tangent sheaf of $X$ is semi-stable, we show that $X$ itself is a projective space. If $X$ is a threefold with canonical singularities, we show that there are only three varieties which satisfy all the conditions.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mirror symmetry and Frobenius structure theorem via Gromov-Witten theory of root stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using recent results of Battistella, Nabijou, Ranganathan and the author, we compare candidate mirror algebras associated with certain log Calabi-Yau pairs constructed by Gross-Siebert using log Gromov-Witten theory and Tseng-You using orbifold Gromov- Witten theory of root stacks. Although the structure constants used to defined these mirror algebras do not typically agree, we show that any given structure constant involved in the construction the algebra of Gross and Siebert can be computed in terms of structure constants of the algebra of Tseng and You after a sequence of log blowups. Using this relation, we provide another proof of associativity of the log mirror algebra, and a proof of the weak Frobenius Structure Theorem in full generality. Along the way, we introduce a class of twisted punctured Gromov-Witten invariants of generalized root stacks induced by log \'etale modifications, and use this to study the behavior of log Gromov-Witten invariants under ramified base change.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give new Taylor approximative formulae for the area of the egg-shaped parts of H\"ugelsch\"affer curves. Based on a parametrization of the H\"ugelsch\"affer curve, a formula for the area of the egg-shaped part of such a curve is derived via elliptic integrals of the first and second kind. Furthermore, new approximative formulae for calculating this area derived from standard and double Taylor approximations are given. A representation of the value $\frac{1}{\pi}$ was also obtained using an appropriate series.</description>

      <title>On Abelian extensions in mixed characteristic and ramification in codimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theorem of Paul Roberts states that the integral closure of a regular local ring in a generically abelian extension is Cohen-Macaulay, provided the characteristic of the residue field does not divide the order of the Galois group. An example of Koh shows the conclusion is false in the modular case. After a modification to the statement concerning ramification over $p$ in codimension one, we give an extension of Roberts's theorem to the modular case for unramified regular local rings in mixed characteristic when the $p$-torsion of the Galois group is annihilated by $p$.</description>

      <title>One-loop Double Copy Relation from Twisted (Co)homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a geometric relation between closed and open string amplitudes at one-loop. After imposing a homological splitting on the world-sheet torus twisted intersection theory is used to establish a one-loop double copy relation. The latter expresses a closed string amplitude by a pair of open string amplitudes and twisted intersection numbers. These inner products on the vector space of allowed differential forms are related to the twisted homology and cohomology groups associated with the Riemann-Wirtinger integral.</description>

Abstract: We give a proof of the Zilber--Pink conjecture for $n$-fold self-products of a curve $X$ inside the self-product of its Jacobian, when $X$ has appropriate bad reduction, its Jacobian has no extra endomorphisms, and $n$ is sufficiently small. The strategy of proof follows the work of Katz, Rabinoff and Zureick-Brown on explicit Manin--Mumford bounds.</description>

      <title>Koszul complexes and spectra of projective hypersurfaces with isolated singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1081</link>
      <description>arXiv:1212.1081v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a projective hypersurface $Z$ with isolated singularities, we generalize some well-known assertions in the nonsingular case due to Griffiths, Scherk, Steenbrink, Varchenko, and others about the relations between the Steenbrink spectrum, the Poincar\'e polynomial of the Jacobian ring, and the roots of Bernstein-Sato polynomial for a defining polynomial $f$ up to sign forgetting the multiplicities. We have to use the pole order spectrum and the alternating sum of the Poincar\'e series of certain subquotients of the Koszul cohomologies, and study the pole order spectral sequence. We show sufficient conditions for vanishing or non-vanishing of the differential $d_1$ of the spectral sequence, which are useful in many applications. We prove also symmetries of the dimensions of the subquotients of Koszul cohomologies, which are crucial for computing the roots of BS polynomials. We can deduce that the roots of BS polynomial whose absolute values are larger than $n-1-n/d$ are determined by the ``torsion part" of the Jacobian ring (modulo the roots of BS polynomial for $Z$) if all the singularities of $Z$ are weighted homogeneous. Here $d=\deg f$ and $n$ is the dimension of the ambient affine space.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-type invariants and cohomology jump loci for complex smooth quasi-projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.03356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let X be a complex smooth quasi-projective variety with a fixed epimorphism $\nu\colon\pi_1(X)\twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{Z}$. In this paper, we consider the asymptotic behaviour of invariants such as Betti numbers with all possible field coefficients and the order of the torsion part of singular integral homology associated to $\nu$, known as the $L^2$-type invariants. At homological degree one, we give concrete formulas for these limits by the geometric information of $X$ when $\nu$ is orbifold effective. The proof relies on a study about cohomological degree one jump loci of $X$. We extend part of Arapura's result for cohomological degree one jump loci of $X$ with complex field coefficients to the one with positive characteristic field coefficients. As an application, when $X$ is a hyperplane arrangement complement, a combinatoric upper bound is given for the number of parallel positive dimensional components in cohomological degree one jump loci with complex coefficients. Another application is that we give a positive answer to a question posed by Denham and Suciu for hyperplane arrangement.</description>

      <title>V-filtrations and minimal exponents for locally complete intersection singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study a notion of minimal exponent for a locally complete intersection subscheme $Z$ of a smooth complex algebraic variety $X$, extending the invariant defined by Saito in the case of hypersurfaces. Our definition is in terms of the Kashiwara-Malgrange $V$-filtration associated to $Z$. We show that the minimal exponent describes how far the Hodge filtration and order filtration agree on the local cohomology $H^r_Z({\mathcal O}_X)$, where $r$ is the codimension of $Z$ in $X$. We also study its relation to the Bernstein-Sato polynomial of $Z$. Our main result describes the minimal exponent of a higher codimension subscheme in terms of the invariant associated to a suitable hypersurface; this allows proving the main properties of this invariant by reduction to the codimension $1$ case. A key ingredient for our main result is a description of the Kashiwara-Malgrange $V$-filtration associated to any ideal $(f_1,\ldots,f_r)$ in terms of the microlocal $V$-filtration associated to the hypersurface defined by $\sum_{i=1}^rf_iy_i$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any quiver $Q$ and dimension vector $v$, Le Bruyn--Procesi proved that the invariant ring for the action of the change of basis group on the space of representations $\textrm{Rep}(Q,v)$ is generated by the traces of matrix products associated to cycles in the quiver. We generalise this to allow for vertices where the group acts trivially, and we give relations between the generators of the invariant algebra for quivers with relations. As a geometric application, we prove for $n\geq 1$ that the Hilbert scheme of $n$-points on an ADE surface singularity is isomorphic to a Nakajima quiver variety. This allows us to generalise the well known theorem of [Fogarty] by showing that the Hilbert scheme of $n$-points on a normal surface with canonical singularities is a normal variety of dimension $2n$ with canonical singularities. In addition, we show that if $S$ has symplecic singularities over $\mathbb{C}$, then so does the Hilbert scheme of $n$-points on $S$, thereby generalising a result of Beauville.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work exhibits that the essential image of the derived pushforward along a proper surjective morphism of Noetherian schemes generates the targets derived category of bounded complexes with coherent cohomology. There are two primary consequences to our work. First, we show that classical generators in the bounded derived category are preserved by derived pushforward along a proper surjective morphism of Noetherian schemes. Secondly, the bounded derived category coincides with the thick subcategory generated by perfect complexes and structure sheaves of closed integral subschemes supported in the singular locus of the ambient scheme. Additionally, our results apply to objects studied in derived algebraic geometry (i.e. derived schemes), and related observations are established.</description>
