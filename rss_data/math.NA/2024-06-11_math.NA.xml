      <title>High-order exponential time differencing multi-resolution alternative finite difference WENO methods for nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the finite difference approximation of nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations, a special class of parabolic equations where the viscous term vanishes in certain regions. This vanishing gives rise to additional challenges in capturing sharp fronts, beyond the restrictive CFL conditions commonly encountered with explicit time discretization in parabolic equations. To resolve the sharp front, we adopt the high-order multi-resolution alternative finite difference WENO (A-WENO) methods for the spatial discretization. To alleviate the time step restriction from the nonlinear stiff diffusion terms, we employ the exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta (ETD-RK) methods, a class of efficient and accurate exponential integrators, for the time discretization. However, for highly nonlinear spatial discretizations such as high-order WENO schemes, it is a challenging problem how to efficiently form the linear stiff part in applying the exponential integrators, since direct computation of a Jacobian matrix for high-order WENO discretizations of the nonlinear diffusion terms is very complicated and expensive. Here we propose a novel and effective approach of replacing the exact Jacobian of high-order multi-resolution A-WENO scheme with that of the corresponding high-order linear scheme in the ETD-RK time marching, based on the fact that in smooth regions the nonlinear weights closely approximate the optimal linear weights, while in non-smooth regions the stiff diffusion degenerates. The algorithm is described in detail, and numerous numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of such a treatment and the good performance of our method. The stiffness of the nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) is resolved well, and large time-step size computations are achieved.</description>

      <title>On a class of multi-fidelity methods for the semiclassical Schr\"odinger equation with uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the semiclassical Schr\"odinger equation with random parameters and develop several robust multi-fidelity methods. We employ the time-splitting Fourier pseudospectral (TSFP) method for the high-fidelity solver, and consider different low-fidelity solvers including the meshless method like frozen Gaussian approximation (FGA) and the level set (LS) method for the semiclassical limit of the Schr\"odinger equation. With a careful choice of the low-fidelity model, we obtain an error estimate for the bi-fidelity method. We conduct numerous numerical experiments and validate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed multi-fidelity methods, by comparing the performance of a class of bi-fidelity and tri-fidelity approximations.</description>

      <title>Spectral Prescribed Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider prescribed mean curvature equations whose solutions are minimal surfaces, constant mean curvature surfaces, or capillary surfaces. We consider both Dirichlet boundary conditions for Plateau problems and nonlinear Neumann boundary conditions for capillary problems and we consider domains in $\mathbf{R}^2$ to be rectangles, disks, or annuli.
  We present spectral methods for approximating solutions of the associated boundary value problems. These are either based on Chebyshev or Chebyshev-Fourier methods depending on the geometry of the domain. The non-linearity in the prescribed mean curvature equations is treated with a Newton method. The algorithms are designed to be adaptive; if the prescribed tolerances are not met then the resolution of the solution is increased until the tolerances are achieved. 22</description>

      <title>A Structure-Preserving Domain Decomposition Method for Data-Driven Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a domain decomposition strategy for developing structure-preserving finite element discretizations from data when exact governing equations are unknown. On subdomains, trainable Whitney form elements are used to identify structure-preserving models from data, providing a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map which may be used to globally construct a mortar method. The reduced-order local elements may be trained offline to reproduce high-fidelity Dirichlet data in cases where first principles model derivation is either intractable, unknown, or computationally prohibitive. In such cases, particular care must be taken to preserve structure on both local and mortar levels without knowledge of the governing equations, as well as to ensure well-posedness and stability of the resulting monolithic data-driven system. This strategy provides a flexible means of both scaling to large systems and treating complex geometries, and is particularly attractive for multiscale problems with complex microstructure geometry. While consistency is traditionally obtained in finite element methods via quasi-optimality results and the Bramble-Hilbert lemma as the local element diameter $h\rightarrow0$, our analysis establishes notions of accuracy and stability for finite h with accuracy coming from matching data. Numerical experiments and analysis establish properties for $H(\operatorname{div})$ problems in small data limits ($\mathcal{O}(1)$ reference solutions).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an arbitrary order discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for solving the fourth-order curl problem using a reconstructed discontinuous approximation method. It is based on an arbitrarily high-order approximation space with one unknown per element in each dimension. The discrete problem is based on the symmetric IPDG method. We prove a priori error estimates under the energy norm and the L^2 norm and show numerical results to verify the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Quality of Approximate Balanced Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model reduction is a powerful tool in dealing with numerical simulation of large scale dynamic systems for studying complex physical systems. Two major types of model reduction methods for linear time-invariant dynamic systems are Krylov subspace-based methods and balanced truncation-based methods. The methods of the second type are much more theoretically sound than the first type in that there is a fairly tight global error bound on the approximation error between the original system and the reduced one. It is noted that the error bound is established based upon the availability of the exact controllability and observability Gramians. However, numerically, the Gramians are not available and have to be numerically calculated, and for a large scale system, a viable option is to compute low-rank approximations of the Gramians from which an approximate balanced truncation is then performed. Hence, rigorously speaking, the existing global error bound is not applicable to any reduced system obtained via approximate Gramians. The goal of this paper is to address this issue by establishing global error bounds for reduced systems via approximate balanced truncation.</description>

      <title>A Low Rank Neural Representation of Entropy Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new representation of entropy solutions to nonlinear scalar conservation laws with a smooth convex flux function in a single spatial dimension. The representation is a generalization of the method of characteristics and posseses a compositional form. While it is a nonlinear representation, the embedded dynamics of the solution in the time variable is linear. This representation is then discretized as a manifold of implicit neural representations where the feedforward neural network architecture has a low rank structure. Finally, we show that the low rank neural representation with a fixed number of layers and a small number of coefficients can approximate any entropy solution regardless of the complexity of the shock topology, while retaining the linearity of the embedded dynamics.</description>

      <title>Randomized Quaternion UTV Decomposition and Randomized Quaternion Tensor UTV Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the quaternion matrix UTV (QUTV) decomposition and quaternion tensor UTV (QTUTV) decomposition are proposed. To begin, the terms QUTV and QTUTV are defined, followed by the algorithms. Subsequently, by employing random sampling from the quaternion normal distribution, randomized QUTV and randomized QTUTV are generated to provide enhanced algorithmic efficiency. Furthermore, theoretical analysis is discussed. Specifically, upper bounds for approximating QUTV and QTUTV are provided, followed by deterministic error bounds and average-case error bounds for the randomized situations. Finally, numerous numerical experiments are presented to verify that the proposed algorithms work more efficiently and with similar relative errors compared to other comparable decomposition methods. This indicates that they could be used in computer vision and other related fields.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of a PDE arising from prediction with expert advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the online machine learning problem of prediction with expert advice in an adversarial setting through numerical analysis of, and experiments with, a related partial differential equation. The problem is a repeated two-person game involving decision-making at each step informed by $n$ experts in an adversarial environment. The continuum limit of this game over a large number of steps is a degenerate elliptic equation whose solution encodes the optimal strategies for both players. We develop numerical methods for approximating the solution of this equation in relatively high dimensions ($n\leq 10$) by exploiting symmetries in the equation and the solution to drastically reduce the size of the computational domain. Based on our numerical results we make a number of conjectures about the optimality of various adversarial strategies, in particular about the non-optimality of the COMB strategy.</description>

      <title>The Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch equation: Unique existence and finite element approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch equation (LLBE) describes the evolution of magnetic spin field in a ferromagnet at high temperatures. We consider a viscous (pseudo-parabolic) regularisation of the LLBE for temperatures higher than the Curie temperature, which we call the $\epsilon$-LLBE. Variants of the $\epsilon$-LLBE are applicable to model pattern formation, phase transition, and heat conduction for non-simple materials, among other things. In this paper, we show well-posedness of the $\epsilon$-LLBE and the convergence of the solution $\boldsymbol{u}^\epsilon$ of the regularised equation to the solution $\boldsymbol{u}$ of the LLBE as $\epsilon\to 0^+$. As a by-product of our analysis, we show the existence and uniqueness of regular solution to the LLBE for temperatures higher than the Curie temperature. Furthermore, we propose a linear fully discrete conforming finite element scheme to approximate the solution of the $\epsilon$-LLBE. Error analysis is performed to show unconditional stability and optimal uniform-in-time convergence rate for the schemes. Several numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Boundary corrections for splitting methods in the time integration of multidimensional parabolic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers two boundary correction techniques to mitigate the reduction in the temporal order of convergence in PDE sense (i.e., when both the space and time resolutions tend to zero independently of each other) of $d$ dimension space-discretized parabolic problems on a rectangular domain subject to time dependent boundary conditions. We make use of the MoL approach (method of lines) where the space discretization is made with central differences of order four and the time integration is carried out with $s$-stage AMF-W-methods. The time integrators are of ADI-type (alternating direction implicit by using a directional splitting) and of higher order than the usual ones appearing in the literature which only reach order 2. Besides, the techniques here explained also work for most of splitting methods, when directional splitting is used. A remarkable fact is that with these techniques, the time integrators recover the temporal order of PDE-convergence at the level of time-independent boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise fast and provably accurate algorithms to transform between an $N\times N \times N$ Cartesian voxel representation of a three-dimensional function and its expansion into the ball harmonics, that is, the eigenbasis of the Dirichlet Laplacian on the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Given $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, our algorithms achieve relative $\ell^1$ - $\ell^\infty$ accuracy $\varepsilon$ in time $O(N^3 (\log N)^2 + N^3 |\log \varepsilon|^2)$, while their dense counterparts have time complexity $O(N^6)$. We illustrate our methods on numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithm for the oscillatory matrix functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient algorithm for computing the general oscillatory matrix functions. These computations are crucial for solving second-order semi-linear initial value problems. The method is exploited using the scaling and restoring technique based on a quadruple angle formula in conjunction with a truncated Taylor series. The choice of the scaling parameter and the degree of the Taylor polynomial relies on a forward error analysis. Numerical experiments show that the new algorithm behaves in a stable fashion and performs well in both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Two-level Nonlinear Preconditioning Methods for Flood Models Posed on Perforated Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on the numerical solution of the Diffusive Wave equation posed in a domain containing a large number of polygonal perforations. These numerous perforations represent structures in urban areas and this model problem is used to model urban floods. This article relies on the work done in a previous article by the same authors, in which we introduced low-dimensional coarse approximation space for the linear Poisson equation based on a coarse polygonal partitioning of the domain. Similarly to other multi-scale numerical methods, this coarse space is spanned by locally discrete harmonic basis functions. We show that this coarse space also lends itself to the linearized diffusive wave problem that is obtained at each iteration of Newton's method. Furthermore, we present nonlinear preconditioning techniques, including a two-level RASPEN and Two-step method, which can significantly reduce the number of iterations compared to the traditional Newton's method. Numerical examples illustrating the performance of the proposed methods include a large-scale test case based on topographical data from the city of Nice.</description>

      <title>Global-in-time energy stability analysis for the exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta scheme for the phase field crystal equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global-in-time energy estimate is derived for the second-order accurate exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta (ETDRK2) numerical scheme to the phase field crystal (PFC) equation, a sixth-order parabolic equation modeling crystal evolution. To recover the value of stabilization constant, some local-in-time convergence analysis has been reported, and the energy stability becomes available over a fixed final time. In this work, we develop a global-in-time energy estimate for the ETDRK2 numerical scheme to the PFC equation by showing the energy dissipation property for any final time. An a priori assumption at the previous time step, combined with a single-step $H^2$ estimate of the numerical solution, is the key point in the analysis. Such an $H^2$ estimate recovers the maximum norm bound of the numerical solution at the next time step, and then the value of the stabilization parameter can be theoretically justified. This justification ensures the energy dissipation at the next time step, so that the mathematical induction can be effectively applied, by then the global-in-time energy estimate is accomplished. This paper represents the first effort to theoretically establish a global-in-time energy stability analysis for a second-order stabilized numerical scheme in terms of the original free energy functional. The presented methodology is expected to be available for many other Runge-Kutta numerical schemes to the gradient flow equations.</description>

      <title>Schwarz preconditioner with $H_k$-GenEO coarse space for the indefinite Helmholtz problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GenEO (`Generalised Eigenvalue problems on the Overlap') is a method from the family of spectral coarse spaces that can efficiently rely on local eigensolves in order to build a robust parallel domain decomposition preconditioner for elliptic PDEs. When used as a preconditioner in a conjugate gradient, this method is extremely efficient in the positive-definite case, yielding an iteration count completely independent of the number of subdomains and heterogeneity. In a previous work this theory was extended to the cased of convection--diffusion--reaction problems, which may be non-self-adjoint and indefinite, and whose discretisations are solved with preconditioned GMRES. The GenEO coarse space was then defined here using a generalised eigenvalue problem based on a self-adjoint and positive definite subproblem. The resulting method, called $\Delta$-GenEO becomes robust with respect to the variation of the coefficient of the diffusion term in the operator and depends only very mildly on variations of the other coefficients. However, the iteration number estimates get worse as the non-self-adjointness and indefiniteness of the operator increases, which is often the case for the high frequency Helmholtz problems. In this work, we will improve on this aspect by introducing a new version, called $H_k$-GenEO, which uses a generalised eigenvalue problem based directly on the indefinite operator which will lead to a robust method with respect to the increase in the wave-number. We provide theoretical estimates showing the dependence of the size of the coarse space on the wave-number.</description>

      <title>VS-PINN: A Fast and efficient training of physics-informed neural networks using variable-scaling methods for solving PDEs with stiff behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a promising way to compute the solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep neural networks. However, despite their significant success in various fields, it remains unclear in many aspects how to effectively train PINNs if the solutions of PDEs exhibit stiff behaviors or high frequencies. In this paper, we propose a new method for training PINNs using variable-scaling techniques. This method is simple and it can be applied to a wide range of problems including PDEs with rapidly-varying solutions. Throughout various numerical experiments, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for these problems and confirm that it can significantly improve the training efficiency and performance of PINNs. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), we will provide theoretical evidence for this phenomenon and show that our methods can indeed improve the performance of PINNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a seeding experiment where a fibrous scaffold material is colonized by two types of cell populations. The specific application that we have in mind is related to the idea of meniscus tissue regeneration. In order to support the development of a promising replacement material, we discuss certain rate equations for the densities of human mesenchymal stem cells and chondrocytes and for the production of collagen-containing extracellular matrix. For qualitative studies, we start with a system of ordinary differential equations and refine then the model to include spatial effects of the underlying nonwoven scaffold structure. Numerical experiments as well as a complete set of parameters for future benchmarking are provided.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Stochastic Optimisation for Large-Scale Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic optimisation algorithms are the de facto standard for machine learning with large amounts of data. Handling only a subset of available data in each optimisation step dramatically reduces the per-iteration computational costs, while still ensuring significant progress towards the solution. Driven by the need to solve large-scale optimisation problems as efficiently as possible, the last decade has witnessed an explosion of research in this area. Leveraging the parallels between machine learning and inverse problems has allowed harnessing the power of this research wave for solving inverse problems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive account of the state-of-the-art in stochastic optimisation from the viewpoint of inverse problems. We present algorithms with diverse modalities of problem randomisation and discuss the roles of variance reduction, acceleration, higher-order methods, and other algorithmic modifications, and compare theoretical results with practical behaviour. We focus on the potential and the challenges for stochastic optimisation that are unique to inverse imaging problems and are not commonly encountered in machine learning. We conclude the survey with illustrative examples from imaging problems to examine the advantages and disadvantages that this new generation of algorithms bring to the field of inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Parametric kernel low-rank approximations using tensor train decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing low-rank approximations of kernel matrices is an important problem with many applications in scientific computing and data science. We propose methods to efficiently approximate and store low-rank approximations to kernel matrices that depend on certain hyperparameters. The main idea behind our method is to use multivariate Chebyshev function approximation along with the tensor train decomposition of the coefficient tensor. The computations are in two stages: an offline stage, which dominates the computational cost and is parameter-independent, and an online stage, which is inexpensive and instantiated for specific hyperparameters. A variation of this method addresses the case that the kernel matrix is symmetric and positive semi-definite. The resulting algorithms have linear complexity in terms of the sizes of the kernel matrices. We investigate the efficiency and accuracy of our method on parametric kernel matrices induced by various kernels, such as the Mat\'ern kernel, through various numerical experiments. Our methods have speedups up to $200\times$ in the online time compared to other methods with similar complexity and comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis and Numerical Algorithm for PDE Approximation with Hidden-Layer Concatenated Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the hidden-layer concatenated physics informed neural network (HLConcPINN) method, which combines hidden-layer concatenated feed-forward neural networks, a modified block time marching strategy, and a physics informed approach for approximating partial differential equations (PDEs). We analyze the convergence properties and establish the error bounds of this method for two types of PDEs: parabolic (exemplified by the heat and Burgers' equations) and hyperbolic (exemplified by the wave and nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations). We show that its approximation error of the solution can be effectively controlled by the training loss for dynamic simulations with long time horizons. The HLConcPINN method in principle allows an arbitrary number of hidden layers not smaller than two and any of the commonly-used smooth activation functions for the hidden layers beyond the first two, with theoretical guarantees. This generalizes several recent neural-network techniques, which have theoretical guarantees but are confined to two hidden layers in the network architecture and the $\tanh$ activation function. Our theoretical analyses subsequently inform the formulation of appropriate training loss functions for these PDEs, leading to physics informed neural network (PINN) type computational algorithms that differ from the standard PINN formulation. Ample numerical experiments are presented based on the proposed algorithm to validate the effectiveness of this method and confirm aspects of the theoretical analyses.</description>

      <title>A Novel Coupled bES-FEM Formulation with SUPG stabilization for Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical Analysis in Saturated Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two primary types of numerical instabilities often occur in low-order finite element method (FEM) analyses of thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) phenomena: (1) pressure oscillations arising improper interpolation of pressure and displacement fields; and (2) spatial oscillations induced by nonlinear convection terms in convection-dominated scenarios. In response to these issues, this paper proposes a novel stabilized edge-based smoothed FEM with a bubble function (bES-FEM) for THM analysis within saturated porous media. In the proposed framework, a cubic bubble function is first incorporated into ES-FEM to efficiently mitigate pressure oscillations that breach the Inf-Sup condition, and then the Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) scheme is adopted in bES-FEM to effectively reduce the spurious oscillations in convection-dominated heat transfer scenarios. The accuracy of the bES-FEM with SUPG formulation for THM coupled problems is validated through a series of five benchmark tests. Moreover, the simulations of open-loop ground source energy systems demonstrate the proposed method's exceptional capability in tackling complex THM challenges in real-world applications. All the obtained results showcase the superiority of proposed bES-FEM with SUPG in eliminating the spatial and pressure oscillations, marking it as a promising tool for the exploration of coupled THM issues.</description>

      <title>Elastic Full-Waveform Inversion : How the physics of problem improves data-driven techniques?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a nonlinear iterative seismic imaging technique that, by reducing the misfit between recorded and predicted seismic waveforms, can produce detailed estimates of subsurface geophysical properties. Nevertheless, the strong nonlinearity of FWI can trap the optimization in local minima. This issue arises due to factors such as improper initial values, the absence of low frequencies in the measurements, noise, and other related considerations. To address this challenge and with the advent of advanced machine-learning techniques, data-driven methods, such as deep learning, have attracted significantly increasing attention in the geophysical community. Furthermore, the elastic wave equation should be included in FWI to represent elastic effects accurately. The intersection of data-driven techniques and elastic scattering theories presents opportunities and challenges. In this paper, by using the knowledge of elastic scattering (Physics of problem) and integrating it with deep learning techniques, we propose methods for the solution of time-harmonic FWI to enhance accuracy compared to pure data-driven approaches. Moreover, by modifying the structure of the Variational Autoencoder, we introduce a probabilistic deep learning method based on the physics of the problem that enables us to explore the uncertainties of the solution. According to the limited availability of datasets in this field and to assess the performance and accuracy of the proposed methods, we create a comprehensive dataset close to reality and conduct a comparative analysis of the presented approaches to it.</description>

      <title>Superstep wavefield propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes how to propagate wavefields for arbitrary numbers of traditional time steps in a single step, called a superstep. We show how to construct operators that accomplish this task for finite-difference time domain schemes, including temporal first-order schemes in isotropic, anisotropic and elastic media, as well as temporal second-order schemes for acoustic media. This task is achieved by implementing a computational tradeoff differing from traditional single step wavefield propagators by precomputing propagator matrices for each model location for k timesteps (a superstep) and using these propagator matrices to advance the wavefield k time steps at once. This tradeoff separates the physics of the propagator matrix computation from the computer science of wavefield propagation and allows each discipline to provide their optimal modular solutions.</description>

      <title>Numerically robust square root implementations of statistical linear regression filters and smoothers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, square-root formulations of the statistical linear regression filter and smoother are developed. Crucially, the method uses QR decompositions rather than Cholesky downdates. This makes the method inherently more numerically robust than the downdate based methods, which may fail in the face of rounding errors. This increased robustness is demonstrated in an ill-conditioned problem, where it is compared against a reference implementation in both double and single precision arithmetic. The new implementation is found to be more robust, when implemented in lower precision arithmetic as compared to the alternative.</description>

      <title>Extremization to Fine Tune Physics Informed Neural Networks for Solving Boundary Value Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for fast and accurate training of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to find solutions to boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial boundary value problems (IBVPs). By combining the methods of training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), we develop a model which has the expressivity of DNNs with the fine-tuning ability of ELMs. We showcase the superiority of our proposed method by solving several BVPs and IBVPs which include linear and non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), partial differential equations (PDEs) and coupled PDEs. The examples we consider include a stiff coupled ODE system where traditional numerical methods fail, a 3+1D non-linear PDE, Kovasznay flow and Taylor-Green vortex solutions to incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and pure advection solution of 1+1 D compressible Euler equation.
  The Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) is used to exactly impose initial and boundary conditions (IBCs) of (I)BVPs on PINNs. We propose a modification to the TFC framework named Reduced TFC and show a significant improvement in the training and inference time of PINNs compared to IBCs imposed using TFC. Furthermore, Reduced TFC is shown to be able to generalize to more complex boundary geometries which is not possible with TFC. We also introduce a method of applying boundary conditions at infinity for BVPs and numerically solve the pure advection in 1+1 D Euler equations using these boundary conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the transient scattered and transmitted fields generated when an incident electromagnetic wave impinges on a dielectric scatterer or a coated conductor embedded in an infinite space. By applying a boundary-field equation method, we reformulate the problem in the Laplace domain using the electric field equation inside the scatterer and a system of boundary integral equations for the scattered electric field in free space. To analyze this nonlocal boundary problem, we replace it by an equivalent boundary value problem. Existence, uniqueness and stability of the weak solution to the equivalent BVP are established in appropriate function spaces in terms of the Laplace transformed variable. The stability bounds are translated into time-domain estimates which determine the regularity of the solution in terms of the regularity of the problem data. These estimates can be easily converted into error estimates for a numerical discretization on the convolution quadrature for time evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discretization of Cartan's exterior calculus of differential forms has been fruitful in a variety of theoretical and practical endeavors: from computational electromagnetics to the development of Finite-Element Exterior Calculus, the development of structure-preserving numerical tools satisfying exact discrete equivalents to Stokes' theorem or the de Rham complex for the exterior derivative have found numerous applications in computational physics. However, there has been a dearth of effort in establishing a more general discrete calculus, this time for differential forms with values in vector bundles over a combinatorial manifold equipped with a connection. In this work, we propose a discretization of the exterior covariant derivative of bundle-valued differential forms. We demonstrate that our discrete operator mimics its continuous counterpart, satisfies the Bianchi identities on simplicial cells, and contrary to previous attempts at its discretization, ensures numerical convergence to its exact evaluation with mesh refinement under mild assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepOnets) have revolutionized the domain of scientific machine learning for the solution of the inverse problem for dynamical systems. However, their implementation necessitates optimizing a high-dimensional space of parameters and hyperparameters. This fact, along with the requirement of substantial computational resources, poses a barrier to achieving high numerical accuracy. Here, inpsired by DeepONets and to address the above challenges, we present Random Projection-based Operator Networks (RandONets): shallow networks with random projections that learn linear and nonlinear operators. The implementation of RandONets involves: (a) incorporating random bases, thus enabling the use of shallow neural networks with a single hidden layer, where the only unknowns are the output weights of the network's weighted inner product; this reduces dramatically the dimensionality of the parameter space; and, based on this, (b) using established least-squares solvers (e.g., Tikhonov regularization and preconditioned QR decomposition) that offer superior numerical approximation properties compared to other optimization techniques used in deep-learning. In this work, we prove the universal approximation accuracy of RandONets for approximating nonlinear operators and demonstrate their efficiency in approximating linear nonlinear evolution operators (right-hand-sides (RHS)) with a focus on PDEs. We show, that for this particular task, RandONets outperform, both in terms of numerical approximation accuracy and computational cost, the ``vanilla" DeepOnets.</description>

Abstract: We set up, at the abstract Hilbert space setting, the general question on when an inverse linear problem induced by an operator of Friedrichs type admits solutions belonging to (the closure of) the Krylov subspace associated to such operator. Such Krylov solvability of abstract Friedrichs systems allows to predict when, for concrete differential inverse problems, truncation algorithms can or cannot reproduce the exact solutions in terms of approximants from the Krylov subspace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volume-preserving hyperelastic materials are widely used to model near-incompressible materials such as rubber and soft tissues. However, the numerical simulation of volume-preserving hyperelastic materials is notoriously challenging within this regime due to the non-convexity of the energy function. In this work, we identify the pitfalls of the popular eigenvalue clamping strategy for projecting Hessian matrices to positive semi-definiteness during Newton's method. We introduce a novel eigenvalue filtering strategy for projected Newton's method to stabilize the optimization of Neo-Hookean energy and other volume-preserving variants under high Poisson's ratio (near 0.5) and large initial volume change. Our method only requires a single line of code change in the existing projected Newton framework, while achieving significant improvement in both stability and convergence speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our eigenvalue projection scheme on a variety of challenging examples and over different deformations on a large dataset.</description>

      <title>Continuum Attention for Neural Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers, and the attention mechanism in particular, have become ubiquitous in machine learning. Their success in modeling nonlocal, long-range correlations has led to their widespread adoption in natural language processing, computer vision, and time-series problems. Neural operators, which map spaces of functions into spaces of functions, are necessarily both nonlinear and nonlocal if they are universal; it is thus natural to ask whether the attention mechanism can be used in the design of neural operators. Motivated by this, we study transformers in the function space setting. We formulate attention as a map between infinite dimensional function spaces and prove that the attention mechanism as implemented in practice is a Monte Carlo or finite difference approximation of this operator. The function space formulation allows for the design of transformer neural operators, a class of architectures designed to learn mappings between function spaces, for which we prove a universal approximation result. The prohibitive cost of applying the attention operator to functions defined on multi-dimensional domains leads to the need for more efficient attention-based architectures. For this reason we also introduce a function space generalization of the patching strategy from computer vision, and introduce a class of associated neural operators. Numerical results, on an array of operator learning problems, demonstrate the promise of our approaches to function space formulations of attention and their use in neural operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) for a dynamic description of the traffic behavior in road networks. These equations are coupled to a Hawkes process that models traffic accidents taking into account their self-excitation property which means that accidents are more likely in areas in which another accident just occurred. We discuss how both model components interact and influence each other. A data analysis reveals the self-excitation property of accidents and determines further parameters. Numerical simulations using risk measures underline and conclude the discussion of traffic accident effects in our model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to address two issues of integral equations for the scattering of time-harmonic electromagnetic waves by a perfect electric conductor with Lipschitz continuous boundary: ill-conditioned {boundary element Galerkin matrices} on fine meshes and instability at spurious resonant frequencies. The remedy to ill-conditioned matrices is operator preconditioning, and resonant instability is eliminated by means of a combined field integral equation. Exterior traces of single and double layer potentials are complemented by their interior counterparts for a purely imaginary wave number. We derive the corresponding variational formulation in the natural trace space for electromagnetic fields and establish its well-posedness for all wave numbers. A Galerkin discretization scheme is employed using conforming edge boundary elements on dual meshes, which produces well-conditioned discrete linear systems of the variational formulation. Some numerical results are also provided to support the numerical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a version of the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm for solving systems of linear equations where the iterates are confined to the solution space of a selected subsystem. We show that the subspace constraint leads to an accelerated convergence rate, especially when the system has approximately low-rank structure. On Gaussian-like random data, we show that it results in a form of dimension reduction that effectively increases the aspect ratio of the system. Furthermore, this method serves as a building block for a second, quantile-based algorithm for solving linear systems with arbitrary sparse corruptions, which is able to efficiently utilize external knowledge about corruption-free equations and achieve convergence in difficult settings. Numerical experiments on synthetic and realistic data support our theoretical results and demonstrate the validity of the proposed methods for even more general data models than guaranteed by the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16167v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an end-to-end adaptive sampling neural network (MMPDE-Net) based on the moving mesh method, which can adaptively generate new sampling points by solving the moving mesh PDE. This model focuses on improving the quality of sampling points generation. Moreover, we develop an iterative algorithm based on MMPDE-Net, which makes the sampling points more precise and controllable. Since MMPDE-Net is a framework independent of the deep learning solver, we combine it with physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to propose moving sampling PINN (MS-PINN) and demonstrate its effectiveness by error analysis under some assumptions. Finally, we demonstrate the performance improvement of MS-PINN compared to PINN through numerical experiments of four typical examples, which numerically verify the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New convergence bounds are presented for weighted, preconditioned, and deflated GMRES for the solution of large, sparse, non-Hermitian linear systems. These bounds are given for the case when the Hermitian part of the coefficient matrix is positive definite, the preconditioner is Hermitian positive definite, and the weight is equal to the preconditioner. The new bounds are a novel contribution in and of themselves. In addition, they are sufficiently explicit to indicate how to choose the preconditioner and the deflation space to accelerate the convergence. One such choice of deflating space is presented, and numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of such space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel eXtended virtual element method, an extension of the conforming virtual element method. The XVEM is formulated by incorporating appropriate enrichment functions in the local spaces. The method is designed to handle highly generic enrichment functions, including singularities arising from fractured domains. By achieving consistency on the enrichment space, the method is proven to achieve arbitrary approximation orders even in the presence of singular solutions. The paper includes a complete convergence analysis under general assumptions on mesh regularity, and numerical experiments validating the method's accuracy on various mesh families, demonstrating optimal convergence rates in the $L^2$- and $H^1$-norms on fractured or L-shaped domains.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Problems Approach to Pulse Wave Analysis in the Human Brain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiac pulsations in the human brain have received recent interest due to their possible role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Further interest stems from their possible application as an endogenous signal source that can be utilized for brain imaging in general. The (pulse-)wave describing the blood flow velocity along an intracranial artery consists of a forward (anterograde) and a backward (retrograde, reflected) part, but measurements of this wave usually consist of a superposition of these components. In this paper, we provide a mathematical framework for the inverse problem of estimating the pulse wave velocity, as well as the forward and backward component of the pulse wave separately from MRI measurements on the middle cerebral artery. After a mathematical analysis of this problem, we consider possible reconstruction approaches, and derive an alternate direction approach for its solution. The resulting methods provide estimates for anterograde/retrograde wave forms and the pulse wave velocity under specified assumptions on a cerebrovascular model system. Numerical experiments on simulated and experimental data demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Collocation methods for nonlinear differential equations on low-rank manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce new methods for integrating nonlinear differential equations on low-rank manifolds. The methods are based on oblique projectors onto the tangent spaces of low-rank manifolds with an interpolation property that collocates the differential equation on the manifold. These projections yield evolution equations that enable low-rank time integration of any vectorfield that can be evaluated entry-wise. The proposed methods do not require the vectorfield to have a low-rank structure, thus overcoming significant limitations of dynamical low-rank approximation based on orthogonal projection. To construct the oblique projectors, we devise a sparse tensor sampling algorithm based on the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) that parameterizes tensor train manifolds and their tangent spaces with cross interpolation. Using these projectors we propose two time integration schemes on low-rank tensor train manifolds. The first is based on a time-dependent tensor cross interpolation representation of the solution and the second is a direct generalization of the well-known orthogonal projector-splitting integrator to a oblique projectors. We demonstrate the proposed methods with applications to several tensor differential equations arising from the discretization of partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the equation $-\Delta u+\mu u=f$ on high-dimensional spaces $\mathbb{R}^m$, where the right-hand side $f(x)=F(Tx)$ is composed of a separable function $F$ with an integrable Fourier transform on a space of a dimension $n&gt;m$ and a linear mapping given by a matrix $T$ of full rank and $\mu\geq 0$ is a constant. For example, the right-hand side can explicitly depend on differences $x_i-x_j$ of components of $x$. We show that the solution of this equation can be expanded into sums of functions of the same structure and develop in this framework an equally simple and fast iterative method for its computation. The method is based on the observation that in almost all cases and for large problem classes the expression $\|T^ty\|^2$ deviates on the unit sphere $\|y\|=1$ the less from its mean value the higher the dimension $m$ is, a concentration of measure effect. The higher the dimension $m$, the faster the iteration converges.</description>

      <title>A semi-implicit second-order temporal scheme for solving the pressure head-based form of Richards' and advection-dispersion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, a novel semi-implicit second-order temporal scheme combined with the finite element method for space discretization is proposed to solve the coupled system of infiltration and solute transport in unsaturated porous media. The Richards equation is used to describe unsaturated flow, while the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) is used for modeling solute transport. The proposed approach is used to linearize the system of equations in time, eliminating the need of iterative processes. A free parameter is introduced to ensure the stability of the scheme. Numerical tests are conducted to analyze the accuracy of the proposed method in comparison with a family of second-order iterative schemes. The proposed numerical technique based on the optimal free parameter is accurate and performs better in terms of efficiency since it offers a considerable gain in computational time compared to the other methods. For reliability and effectiveness evaluation of the developed semi-implicit scheme, four showcase scenarios are used. The first two numerical tests focus on modeling water flow in heterogeneous soil and transient flow in variably saturated zones. The last numerical tests are carried out to simulate the salt and nitrate transport through unsaturated soils. The simulation results are compared with reference solutions and laboratory data, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in simulating infiltration and solute transport through unsaturated soils.</description>

      <title>Estimation of uncertainties in the density driven flow in fractured porous media using MLMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Multi Level Monte Carlo method to estimate uncertainties in a Henry-like salt water intrusion problem with a fracture. The flow is induced by the variation of the density of the fluid phase, which depends on the mass fraction of salt. We assume that the fracture has a known fixed location but an uncertain aperture. Other input uncertainties are the porosity and permeability fields and the recharge. In our setting, porosity and permeability vary spatially and recharge is time-dependent. For each realisation of these uncertain parameters, the evolution of the mass fraction and pressure fields is modelled by a system of non-linear and time-dependent PDEs with a jump of the solution at the fracture. The uncertainties propagate into the distribution of the salt concentration, which is an important characteristic of the quality of water resources. We show that the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method is able to reduce the overall computational cost compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. This is achieved by balancing discretisation and statistical errors. Multiple scenarios are evaluated at different spatial and temporal mesh levels. The deterministic solver ug4 is run in parallel to calculate all stochastic scenarios.</description>

Abstract: This paper analyzes a full discretization of a three-dimensional stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with multiplicative noise. The discretization uses the Euler scheme for temporal discretization and the finite element method for spatial discretization. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a novel stability estimate for a discrete stochastic convolution, which plays a crucial role in establishing pathwise uniform convergence estimates for fully discrete approximations of nonlinear stochastic parabolic equations. By using this stability estimate in conjunction with the discrete stochastic maximal $L^p$-regularity estimate, the study derives a pathwise uniform convergence rate that concerns the general spatial $L^q$-norms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the inverse problem of retrieving the initial value of a time-fractional fourth order parabolic equation from source and final time observation. The considered problem is an {\it ill-posed problem.} We obtain regularized approximations for the sought initial value by employing the quasi-boundary value method, its modified version and by Fourier truncation method(FTM). We provide both the apriori and aposteriori parameter choice strategies and derive the error estimates for all these methods under some {\it source conditions} involving some Sobolev smoothness. As an important implication of the obtained rates, we observe that for both the apriori and aposteriori cases, the rates obtained by all these three methods are same for some source sets. Moreover, we observe that in both the apriori and aposteriori cases, the FTM is free from the so-called {\it saturation effect}, whereas both the quasi-boundary value method and its generalizations possesses the saturation effect for both the cases. Further, we observe that the rates obtained by the FTM is always order optimal for all the considered source sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of stochastic systems, the committor function describes the probability that a system starting from an initial configuration $x$ will reach a set $B$ before a set $A$. This paper introduces an efficient and interpretable algorithm for approximating the committor, called the "fast committor machine" (FCM). The FCM uses simulated trajectory data to build a kernel-based model of the committor. The kernel function is constructed to emphasize low-dimensional subspaces which optimally describe the $A$ to $B$ transitions. The coefficients in the kernel model are determined using randomized linear algebra, leading to a runtime that scales linearly in the number of data points. In numerical experiments involving a triple-well potential and alanine dipeptide, the FCM yields higher accuracy and trains more quickly than a neural network with the same number of parameters. The FCM is also more interpretable than the neural net.</description>

Abstract: The majority of real-world processes are spatiotemporal, and the data generated by them exhibits both spatial and temporal evolution. Weather is one of the most essential processes in this domain, and weather forecasting has become a crucial part of our daily routine. Weather data analysis is considered the most complex and challenging task. Although numerical weather prediction models are currently state-of-the-art, they are resource-intensive and time-consuming. Numerous studies have proposed time series-based models as a viable alternative to numerical forecasts. Recent research in the area of time series analysis indicates significant advancements, particularly regarding the use of state-space-based models (white box) and, more recently, the integration of machine learning and deep neural network-based models (black box). The most famous examples of such models are RNNs and transformers. These models have demonstrated remarkable results in the field of time-series analysis and have demonstrated effectiveness in modelling temporal correlations. It is crucial to capture both temporal and spatial correlations for a spatiotemporal process, as the values at nearby locations and time affect the values of a spatiotemporal process at a specific point. This self-contained paper explores various regional data-driven weather forecasting methods, i.e., forecasting over multiple latitude-longitude points (matrix-shaped spatial grid) to capture spatiotemporal correlations. The results showed that spatiotemporal prediction models reduced computational costs while improving accuracy. In particular, the proposed tensor train dynamic mode decomposition-based forecasting model has comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art models without the need for training. We provide convincing numerical experiments to show that the proposed approach is practical.</description>

      <title>Mitigating spectral bias for the multiscale operator learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10890</link>

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful tool for learning the mapping between infinite-dimensional parameter and solution spaces of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we focus on multiscale PDEs that have important applications such as reservoir modeling and turbulence prediction. We demonstrate that for such PDEs, the spectral bias towards low-frequency components presents a significant challenge for existing neural operators. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical attention neural operator (HANO) inspired by the hierarchical matrix approach. HANO features a scale-adaptive interaction range and self-attentions over a hierarchy of levels, enabling nested feature computation with controllable linear cost and encoding/decoding of multiscale solution space. We also incorporate an empirical $H^1$ loss function to enhance the learning of high-frequency components. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that HANO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for representative multiscale problems.</description>

      <title>A mechanical analogue of electromagnetic induction for waves in a chiral elastic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical Faraday's law on electromagnetic induction states that a change of magnetic field through a coil wire induces a current in the wire. A mechanical analogue of the Lorentz force, induced by a magnetic field on an electric charge, is the gyroscopic force. Here, we demonstrate a mechanical analogy with a chiral elastic waveguide subjected to gyroscopic forcing. We study waves in an infinite mass-spring `gyrocore helix', which consists of a helix and a central line (gyroscopic elastic core). The helicoidal geometric chirality is considered in conjunction with a physical chirality, induced by gyroscopic forces. It is shown that the interplay between these two chiral inputs leads to the breaking of symmetry of the associated dispersion diagram, resulting in a unidirectional waveform with the direction of propagation being tunable through the gyricity.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators with Localized Integral and Differential Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators learn mappings between function spaces, which is practical for learning solution operators of PDEs and other scientific modeling applications. Among them, the Fourier neural operator (FNO) is a popular architecture that performs global convolutions in the Fourier space. However, such global operations are often prone to over-smoothing and may fail to capture local details. In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNN) can capture local features but are limited to training and inference at a single resolution. In this work, we present a principled approach to operator learning that can capture local features under two frameworks by learning differential operators and integral operators with locally supported kernels. Specifically, inspired by stencil methods, we prove that we obtain differential operators under an appropriate scaling of the kernel values of CNNs. To obtain local integral operators, we utilize suitable basis representations for the kernels based on discrete-continuous convolutions. Both these approaches preserve the properties of operator learning and, hence, the ability to predict at any resolution. Adding our layers to FNOs significantly improves their performance, reducing the relative L2-error by 34-72% in our experiments, which include a turbulent 2D Navier-Stokes and the spherical shallow water equations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Regularized Nonnegative Scale-invariant Low-rank Approximation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regularized nonnegative low-rank approximations such as sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization or sparse Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition are an important branch of dimensionality reduction models with enhanced interpretability. However, from a practical perspective, the choice of regularizers and regularization coefficients, as well as the design of efficient algorithms, is challenging because of the multifactor nature of these models and the lack of theory to back these choices. This paper aims at improving upon these issues. By studying a more general model called the Homogeneous Regularized Scale-Invariant, we prove that the scale-invariance inherent to low-rank approximation models causes an implicit regularization with both unexpected beneficial and detrimental effects. This observation allows to better understand the effect of regularization functions in low-rank approximation models, to guide the choice of the regularization hyperparameters, and to design balancing strategies to enhance the convergence speed of dedicated optimization algorithms. Some of these results were already known but restricted to specific instances of regularized low-rank approximations. We also derive a generic Majorization Minimization algorithm that handles many regularized nonnegative low-rank approximations, with convergence guarantees. We showcase our contributions on sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, ridge-regularized Canonical Polyadic decomposition and sparse Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition.</description>

      <title>Predicting Open-Hole Laminates Failure Using Support Vector Machines With Classical and Quantum Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02903</link>

Abstract: Modeling open hole failure of composites is a complex task, consisting in a highly nonlinear response with interacting failure modes. Numerical modeling of this phenomenon has traditionally been based on the finite element method, but requires to tradeoff between high fidelity and computational cost. To mitigate this shortcoming, recent work has leveraged machine learning to predict the strength of open hole composite specimens. Here, we also propose using data-based models but to tackle open hole composite failure from a classification point of view. More specifically, we show how to train surrogate models to learn the ultimate failure envelope of an open hole composite plate under in-plane loading. To achieve this, we solve the classification problem via support vector machine (SVM) and test different classifiers by changing the SVM kernel function. The flexibility of kernel-based SVM also allows us to integrate the recently developed quantum kernels in our algorithm and compare them with the standard radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Finally, thanks to kernel-target alignment optimization, we tune the free parameters of all kernels to best separate safe and failure-inducing loading states. The results show classification accuracies higher than 90% for RBF, especially after alignment, followed closely by the quantum kernel classifiers.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed deep learning and compressive collocation for high-dimensional diffusion-reaction equations: practical existence theory and numerics</title>

Abstract: On the forefront of scientific computing, Deep Learning (DL), i.e., machine learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), has emerged a powerful new tool for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.</description>

      <title>Latent Neural Operator for Solving Forward and Inverse PDE Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators effectively solve PDE problems from data without knowing the explicit equations, which learn the map from the input sequences of observed samples to the predicted values. Most existed works build the model in the original geometric space, leading to high computational costs when the number of sample points is large. We present the Latent Neural Operator (LNO) solving PDEs in the latent space. In particular, we first propose Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA) transforming representation from the geometric space to the latent space, then learn the operator in the latent space, and finally recover the real-world geometric space via the inverse PhCA map. Our model retains flexibility that can decode values in any position not limited to locations defined in training set, and therefore can naturally perform interpolation and extrapolation tasks particularly useful for inverse problems. Moreover, the proposed LNO improves in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments show that LNO reduces the GPU memory by 50%, speeds up training 1.8 times, and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on four out of six benchmarks for forward problems and a benchmark for inverse problem.</description>
