      <title>Intraday Functional PCA Forecasting of Cryptocurrency Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Functional PCA (FPCA) forecasting method in application to functions of intraday returns on Bitcoin. We show that improved interval forecasts of future return functions are obtained when the conditional heteroscedasticity of return functions is taken into account. The Karhunen-Loeve (KL) dynamic factor model is introduced to bridge the functional and discrete time dynamic models. It offers a convenient framework for functional time series analysis. For intraday forecasting, we introduce a new algorithm based on the FPCA applied by rolling, which can be used for any data observed continuously 24/7. The proposed FPCA forecasting methods are applied to return functions computed from data sampled hourly and at 15-minute intervals. Next, the functional forecasts evaluated at discrete points in time are compared with the forecasts based on other methods, including machine learning and a traditional ARMA model. The proposed FPCA-based methods perform well in terms of forecast accuracy and outperform competitors in terms of directional (sign) of return forecasts at fixed points in time.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric "rich covariates" without saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two nonparametric approaches to ensure that instrumental variables estimators of a linear equation satisfy the rich-covariates condition emphasized by Blandhol et al. (2025), even when the instrument is not unconditionally randomly assigned and the model is not saturated. Both approaches start with a nonparametric estimate of the expectation of the instrument conditional on the covariates, and ensure that the rich-covariates condition is satisfied either by using as the instrument the difference between the original instrument and its estimated conditional expectation, or by adding the estimated conditional expectation to the set of regressors. We derive asymptotic properties of our instrumental variables estimators, and assess their finite sample performance relative to existing approaches using Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Conditional Method Confidence Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Conditional Method Confidence Set (CMCS) which allows to select the best subset of forecasting methods with equal predictive ability conditional on a specific economic regime. The test resembles the Model Confidence Set by Hansen et al. (2011) and is adapted for conditional forecast evaluation. We show the asymptotic validity of the proposed test and illustrate its properties in a simulation study. The proposed testing procedure is particularly suitable for stress-testing of financial risk models required by the regulators. We showcase the empirical relevance of the CMCS using the stress-testing scenario of Expected Shortfall. The empirical evidence suggests that the proposed CMCS procedure can be used as a robust tool for forecast evaluation of market risk models for different economic regimes.</description>

      <title>Covariate-Adjusted Deep Causal Learning for Heterogeneous Panel Data Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the task of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in causal panel data models, in the presence of covariate effects. We propose a novel Covariate-Adjusted Deep Causal Learning (CoDEAL) for panel data models, that employs flexible model structures and powerful neural network architectures to cohesively deal with the underlying heterogeneity and nonlinearity of both panel units and covariate effects. The proposed CoDEAL integrates nonlinear covariate effect components (parameterized by a feed-forward neural network) with nonlinear factor structures (modeled by a multi-output autoencoder) to form a heterogeneous causal panel model. The nonlinear covariate component offers a flexible framework for capturing the complex influences of covariates on outcomes. The nonlinear factor analysis enables CoDEAL to effectively capture both cross-sectional and temporal dependencies inherent in the data panel. This latent structural information is subsequently integrated into a customized matrix completion algorithm, thereby facilitating more accurate imputation of missing counterfactual outcomes. Moreover, the use of a multi-output autoencoder explicitly accounts for heterogeneity across units and enhances the model interpretability of the latent factors. We establish theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the estimated counterfactuals, and demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed method using extensive simulation studies and a real data application.</description>

      <title>Debiased Ill-Posed Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In various statistical settings, the goal is to estimate a function which is restricted by the statistical model only through a conditional moment restriction. Prominent examples include the nonparametric instrumental variable framework for estimating the structural function of the outcome variable, and the proximal causal inference framework for estimating the bridge functions. A common strategy in the literature is to find the minimizer of the projected mean squared error. However, this approach can be sensitive to misspecification or slow convergence rate of the estimators of the involved nuisance components. In this work, we propose a debiased estimation strategy based on the influence function of a modification of the projected error and demonstrate its finite-sample convergence rate. Our proposed estimator possesses a second-order bias with respect to the involved nuisance functions and a desirable robustness property with respect to the misspecification of one of the nuisance functions. The proposed estimator involves a hyper-parameter, for which the optimal value depends on potentially unknown features of the underlying data-generating process. Hence, we further propose a hyper-parameter selection approach based on cross-validation and derive an error bound for the resulting estimator. This analysis highlights the potential rate loss due to hyper-parameter selection and underscore the importance and advantages of incorporating debiasing in this setting. We also study the application of our approach to the estimation of regular parameters in a specific parameter class, which are linear functionals of the solutions to the conditional moment restrictions and provide sufficient conditions for achieving root-n consistency using our debiased estimator.</description>

      <title>Learning Individual Behavior in Agent-Based Models with Graph Diffusion Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are powerful tools for studying emergent properties in complex systems. In ABMs, agent behaviors are governed by local interactions and stochastic rules. However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable, limiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus integration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches, our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining diffusion models and graph learning for data-driven ABM simulation.</description>

      <title>Comparing Experimental and Nonexperimental Methods: What Lessons Have We Learned Four Decades After LaLonde (1986)?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1986, Robert LaLonde published an article comparing nonexperimental estimates to experimental benchmarks (LaLonde 1986). He concluded that the nonexperimental methods at the time could not systematically replicate experimental benchmarks, casting doubt on their credibility. Following LaLonde's critical assessment, there have been significant methodological advances and practical changes, including (i) an emphasis on the unconfoundedness assumption separated from functional form considerations, (ii) a focus on the importance of overlap in covariate distributions, (iii) the introduction of propensity score-based methods leading to doubly robust estimators, (iv) methods for estimating and exploiting treatment effect heterogeneity, and (v) a greater emphasis on validation exercises to bolster research credibility. To demonstrate the practical lessons from these advances, we reexamine the LaLonde data. We show that modern methods, when applied in contexts with sufficient covariate overlap, yield robust estimates for the adjusted differences between the treatment and control groups. However, this does not imply that these estimates are causally interpretable. To assess their credibility, validation exercises (such as placebo tests) are essential, whereas goodness-of-fit tests alone are inadequate. Our findings highlight the importance of closely examining the assignment process, carefully inspecting overlap, and conducting validation exercises when analyzing causal effects with nonexperimental data.</description>

      <title>On Extrapolation of Treatment Effects in Multiple-Cutoff Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regression discontinuity (RD) designs typically identify the treatment effect at a single cutoff point, which may not always be the primary interest. When and how, then, can we learn about treatment effects away from the cutoff? This paper addresses this question within a multiple-cutoff RD framework. We begin by examining the plausibility of the constant bias assumption proposed by Cattaneo, Keele, Titiunik, and Vazquez-Bare (2021) through the lens of rational decision-making behavior. We argue that this assumption is indeed plausible when the groups defined by different cutoffs consist of similar agents and the running variable is effort-invariant, that is, not influenced by the agents' effort (e.g., family income level). However, this positive conclusion no longer holds when the running variable is effort-contingent, meaning it depends on agents' effort (e.g., test scores). In such settings, extrapolated effects based on the constant bias assumption can be biased, even when all other features remain identical except for the cutoff position. To address this issue, we introduce an alternative set of assumptions grounded in empirical motivations and develop a novel partial identification strategy. We illustrate the usefulness and practical relevance of the proposed bounds through empirical examples. In this application, we also find that extrapolation under the constant bias assumption performs reasonably well when the running variable is effort-invariant and some similarity between groups is expected.</description>
