      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of confined cell migration -- modeling and inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motility of eukaryotic cells is strongly influenced by their environment, with confined cells often developing qualitatively different motility patterns from those migrating on simple two-dimensional substrates. Recent experiments, coupled with data-driven methods to extract a cell's equation of motion, showed that cancerous MDA-MB-231 cells persistently hop in a limit cycle when placed on two-state adhesive micropatterns (two large squares connected by a narrow bridge), while they remain stationary on average in rectangular confinements. In contrast, healthy MCF10A cells migrating on the two-state micropattern are bistable, i.e., they settle into either basin on average with only noise-induced hops between the two states. We can capture all these behaviors with a single computational phase field model of a crawling cell, under the assumption that contact with non-adhesive substrate inhibits the cell front. Our model predicts that larger and softer cells are more likely to persistently hop, while smaller and stiffer cells are more likely to be bistable. Other key factors controlling cell migration are the frequency of protrusions and their magnitude of noise. Our results show that relatively simple assumptions about how cells sense their geometry can explain a wide variety of different cell behaviors, and show the power of data-driven approaches to characterize both experiment and simulation.</description>

      <title>The morphology of cell spheroids in simple shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell spheroids are a widely used model to investigate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in a 3D microenvironment in vitro. Most research on cell spheroids has been focused on their response to various stimuli under static conditions. Recently, the effect of flow on cell spheroids has been investigated in the context of tumor invasion in interstitial space. In particular, microfluidic perfusion of cell spheroids embedded in a collagen matrix has been shown to modulate cell-cell adhesion and to represent a possible mechanism promoting tumor invasion by interstitial flow. However, studies on the effects of well-defined flow fields on cell spheroids are lacking in the literature. Here, we apply simple shear flow to cell spheroids in a parallel plate apparatus while observing their morphology by optical microscopy. By using image analysis techniques, we show that cell spheroids rotate under flow as rigid particles. As time goes on, cells from the outer layer detach from the sheared cell spheroids and are carried away by the flow. Hence, the size of cell spheroids declines with time at a rate increasing with the external shear stress, which can be used to estimate cell-cell adhesion. The technique proposed in this work allows one to correlate flow-induced effects with microscopy imaging of cell spheroids in a well-established shear flow field, thus providing a method to obtain quantitative results which are relevant in the general field of mechanobiology.</description>

      <title>Actionable forecasting as a determinant of function in noisy biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous adaptation to variable environments is crucial for the survival of living organisms. Here, we analyze how adaptation, forecasting, and resource mobilization towards a target state, termed actionability, interact to determine biological function. We develop a general theory and show that it is possible for organisms to continuously track their optimal state in a dynamic environment by adapting towards an actionable target that incorporates just current information on the optimal state and its rate of change. If the environmental information is precise and readily actionable, it is possible to implement perfect tracking without anticipatory mechanisms, irrespective of the adaptation rate. In contrast, predictive functions, like those of circadian rhythms, are beneficial if sensing the environment is slow or unreliable, as they allow better adaptation with fewer resources. To explore potential actionable forecasting mechanisms, we develop a general approach that implements the adaptation dynamics with forecasting through a dynamics-informed neural network.</description>
