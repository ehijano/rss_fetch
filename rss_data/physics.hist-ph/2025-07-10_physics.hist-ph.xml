      <title>Wave Mechanics and C-equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that de Broglie's wave, as it is introduced in his Thesis, is not a wave on a given space, but on the contrary itself determines a system in which Special Relativity is locally valid. This local system is a physical object, that defines its own units of length and time. C-equivalence provides a natural framework both for its mathematical description and its physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Where Photons Have Been: Nowhere Without All Components of Their Wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nested interferometer experiment by Danan et al (2013) is discussed and some ontological implications explored, primarily in the context of time-symmetric interpretations of quantum theory. It is pointed out that photons are supported by all components of their wavefunctions, not selectively truncated "first order" portions of them, and that figures representing both a gap in the photon's path and signals from the cut-off path are incorrect. It is also noted that the Transactional Formulation (traditionally known as the Transactional Interpretation) readily accounts for the observed phenomena.</description>

      <title>A refinement of the Lorentz local field expression with impact on the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01993v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 19th century Mossotti and Clausius developed an expression linking the electrical permittivity of a dielectric to the product of molecular polarizability and number density. Lorenz and Lorentz later extended this framework to encompass the refractive index of the dielectric. These classical expressions have proven remarkably successful in describing how permittivity and refractive index vary with number density, under the assumption that molecular polarizability remains relatively constant. While these models have stood the test of time and continue to offer valuable insights, their derivation relies on an approximation of the local electric field within a spherical cavity that simulates the molecular environment, excluding the field generated by the molecule or molecules themselves. For regimes of higher number densities, such as those encountered in densified dielectrics, employing an exact solution for the local field becomes increasingly important. This refinement extends the applicability of the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz equations and leads to more accurate estimates of molecular polarizability in general.</description>
