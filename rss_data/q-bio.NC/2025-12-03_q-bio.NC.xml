      <title>Characterizing Continuous and Discrete Hybrid Latent Spaces for Structural Connectomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural connectomes are detailed graphs that map how different brain regions are physically connected, offering critical insight into aging, cognition, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, these connectomes are high-dimensional and densely interconnected, which makes them difficult to interpret and analyze at scale. While low-dimensional spaces like PCA and autoencoders are often used to capture major sources of variation, their latent spaces are generally continuous and cannot fully reflect the mixed nature of variability in connectomes, which include both continuous (e.g., connectivity strength) and discrete factors (e.g., imaging site). Motivated by this, we propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a hybrid latent space that jointly models the discrete and continuous components. We analyze a large dataset of 5,761 connectomes from six Alzheimer's disease studies with ten acquisition protocols. Each connectome represents a single scan from a unique subject (3579 females, 2182 males), aged 22 to 102, with 4338 cognitively normal, 809 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 614 with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Each connectome contains 121 brain regions defined by the BrainCOLOR atlas. We train our hybrid VAE in an unsupervised way and characterize what each latent component captures. We find that the discrete space is particularly effective at capturing subtle site-related differences, achieving an Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of 0.65 with site labels, significantly outperforming PCA and a standard VAE followed by clustering (p &lt; 0.05). These results demonstrate that the hybrid latent space can disentangle distinct sources of variability in connectomes in an unsupervised manner, offering potential for large-scale connectome analysis.</description>

      <title>The brain-AI convergence: Predictive and generative world models for general-purpose computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in general-purpose AI systems with attention-based transformers offer a potential window into how the neocortex and cerebellum, despite their relatively uniform circuit architectures, give rise to diverse functions and, ultimately, to human intelligence. This Perspective provides a cross-domain comparison between the brain and AI that goes beyond the traditional focus on visual processing, adopting the emerging perspecive of world-model-based computation. Here, we identify shared computational mechanisms in the attention-based neocortex and the non-attentional cerebellum: both predict future world events from past inputs and construct internal world models through prediction-error learning. These predictive world models are repurposed for seemingly distinct functions -- understanding in sensory processing and generation in motor processing -- enabling the brain to achieve multi-domain capabilities and human-like adaptive intelligence. Notably, attention-based AI has independently converged on a similar learning paradigm and world-model-based computation. We conclude that these shared mechanisms in both biological and artificial systems constitute a core computational foundation for realizing diverse functions including high-level intelligence, despite their relatively uniform circuit structures. Our theoretical insights bridge neuroscience and AI, advancing our understanding of the computational essence of intelligence.</description>

      <title>Individual-specific precision neuroimaging of learning-related plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying learning-related plasticity is central to understanding the acquisition of complex skills, for example learning to master a musical instrument. Over the past three decades, conventional group-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have advanced our understanding of how humans' neural representations change during skill acquisition. However, group-based fMRI studies average across heterogeneous learners and often rely on coarse pre- versus post-training comparisons, limiting the spatial and temporal precision with which neural changes can be estimated. Here, we outline an individual-specific precision approach that tracks neural changes within individuals by collecting high-quality neuroimaging data frequently over the course of training, mapping brain function in each person's own anatomical space, and gathering detailed behavioral measures of learning, allowing neural trajectories to be directly linked to individual learning progress. Complementing fMRI with mobile neuroimaging methods, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), will enable researchers to track plasticity during naturalistic practice and across extended time scales. This multi-modal approach will enhance sensitivity to individual learning trajectories and will offer more nuanced insights into how neural representations change with training. We also discuss how findings can be generalized beyond individuals, including through statistical methods based on replication in additional individuals. Together, this approach allows researchers to design highly informative longitudinal training studies that advance a mechanistic, personalized account of skill learning in the human brain.</description>

      <title>Translating Measures onto Mechanisms: The Cognitive Relevance of Higher-Order Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order information theory has become a rapidly growing toolkit in computational neuroscience, motivated by the idea that multivariate dependencies can reveal aspects of neural computation and communication that are invisible to pairwise analyses. Yet functional interpretations of synergy and redundancy often outpace principled arguments for how statistical quantities map onto mechanistic cognitive processes. Here we review the main families of higher-order measures with the explicit goal of translating mathematical properties into defensible mechanistic inferences. First, we systematize Shannon-based multivariate metrics and demonstrate that higher-order dependence is parsimoniously characterized by two largely independent axes: interaction strength and redundancy-synergy balance. We argue that balanced layering of synergistic integration and redundant broadcasting optimizes multiscale complexity, formalizing a computation-communication tradeoff. We then examine the partial information decomposition and outline pragmatic considerations for its deployment in neural data. Equipped with the relevant mathematical essentials, we connect redundancy-synergy balance to cognitive function by progressively embedding their mathematical properties in real-world constraints, starting with small synthetic systems before gradually building up to neuroimaging. We close by identifying key future directions for mechanistic insight: cross-scale bridging, intervention-based validation, and thermodynamically grounded unification of information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Generalized BCIs: Benchmarking 340,000+ Unique Algorithmic Configurations for EEG Mental Command Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust decoding and classification of brain patterns measured with electroencephalography (EEG) remains a major challenge for real-world (i.e. outside scientific lab and medical facilities) brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to well documented inter- and intra-participant variability. Here, we present a large-scale benchmark evaluating over 340,000+ unique combinations of spatial and nonlinear EEG classification. Our methodological pipeline consists in combinations of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), Riemannian geometry, functional connectivity, and fractal- or entropy-based features across three open-access EEG datasets. Unlike prior studies, our analysis operates at the per-participant level and across multiple frequency bands (8-15 Hz and 8-30 Hz), enabling direct assessment of both group-level performance and individual variability. Covariance tangent space projection (cov-tgsp) and CSP consistently achieved the highest average classification accuracies. However, their effectiveness was strongly dataset-dependent, and marked participant-level differences persisted, particularly in the most heterogeneous of the datasets. Importantly, nonlinear methods outperformed spatial approaches for specific individuals, underscoring the need for personalized pipeline selection. Our findings highlight that no universal 'one-size-fits-all' method can optimally decode EEG motor imagery patterns across all users or datasets. Future work will require adaptive, multimodal, and possibly novel approaches to fully address neurophysiological variability in practical BCI applications where the system can automatically adapt to what makes each user unique.</description>

      <title>Seizure-NGCLNet: Representation Learning of SEEG Spatial Pathological Patterns for Epileptic Seizure Detection via Node-Graph Dual Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex spatial connectivity patterns, such as interictal suppression and ictal propagation, complicate accurate drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) seizure detection using stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) and traditional machine learning methods. Two critical challenges remain:(1)a low signal-to-noise ratio in functional connectivity estimates, making it difficult to learn seizure-related interactions; and (2)expert labels for spatial pathological connectivity patterns are difficult to obtain, meanwhile lacking the patterns' representation to improve seizure detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel node-graph dual contrastive learning framework, Seizure-NGCLNet, to learn SEEG interictal suppression and ictal propagation patterns for detecting DRE seizures with high precision. First, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy guided by centrality metrics is developed to generate seizure-related brain networks. Second, a dual-contrastive learning approach is integrated, combining global graph-level contrast with local node-graph contrast, to encode both spatial structural and semantic epileptogenic features. Third, the pretrained embeddings are fine-tuned via a top-k localized graph attention network to perform the final classification. Extensive experiments on a large-scale public SEEG dataset from 33 DRE patients demonstrate that Seizure-NGCLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average accuracy of 95.93%, sensitivity of 96.25%, and specificity of 94.12%. Visualizations confirm that the learned embeddings clearly separate ictal from interictal states, reflecting suppression and propagation patterns that correspond to the clinical mechanisms. These results highlight Seizure-NGCLNet's ability to learn interpretable spatial pathological patterns, enhancing both seizure detection and seizure onset zone localization.</description>

      <title>Emergent Bayesian Behaviour and Optimal Cue Combination in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.</description>

      <title>Brain-aligning of semantic vectors improves neural decoding of visual stimuli</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15176v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of algorithms to accurately decode neural information has long been a research focus in the field of neuroscience. Brain decoding typically involves training machine learning models to map neural data onto a preestablished vector representation of stimulus features. These vectors are usually derived from image- and/or text-based feature spaces. Nonetheless, the intrinsic characteristics of these vectors might fundamentally differ from those that are encoded by the brain, limiting the ability of decoders to accurately learn this mapping. To address this issue, we propose a framework, called brain-aligning of semantic vectors, that fine-tunes pretrained feature vectors to better align with the structure of neural representations of visual stimuli in the brain. We trained this model with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and then performed zero-shot brain decoding on fMRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG), and electrocorticography (ECoG) data. fMRI-based brain-aligned vectors improved decoding performance across all three neuroimaging datasets when accuracy was determined by calculating the correlation coefficients between true and predicted vectors. Additionally, when decoding accuracy was determined via stimulus identification, this accuracy increased in specific category types; improvements varied depending on the original vector space that was used for brain-alignment, and consistent improvements were observed across all neuroimaging modalities.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional structure underlying individual differences in naturalistic visual experience</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do different brains create unique visual experiences from identical sensory input? While neural representations vary across individuals, the fundamental architecture underlying these differences remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal that individual visual experience emerges from a high-dimensional neural geometry across the visual cortical hierarchy. Using spectral decomposition of fMRI responses during naturalistic movie viewing, we find that idiosyncratic neural patterns persist across multiple orders of magnitude of latent dimensions. Remarkably, each dimensional range encodes qualitatively distinct aspects of individual processing, and this multidimensional neural geometry predicts subsequent behavioral differences in memory recall. These fine-grained patterns of inter-individual variability cannot be reduced to those detected by conventional intersubject correlation measures. Our findings demonstrate that subjective visual experience arises from information integrated across an expansive multidimensional manifold. This geometric framework offers a powerful new lens for understanding how diverse brains construct unique perceptual worlds from shared experiences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary output of the nervous system is movement and behavior. While recent advances have democratized pose tracking during complex behavior, kinematic trajectories alone provide only indirect access to the underlying control processes. Here we present MIMIC-MJX, a framework for learning biologically-plausible neural control policies from kinematics. MIMIC-MJX models the generative process of motor control by training neural controllers that learn to actuate biomechanically-realistic body models in physics simulation to reproduce real kinematic trajectories. We demonstrate that our implementation is accurate, fast, data-efficient, and generalizable to diverse animal body models. Policies trained with MIMIC-MJX can be utilized to both analyze neural control strategies and simulate behavioral experiments, illustrating its potential as an integrative modeling framework for neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of action potential generation using Markov models of voltage-gated sodium channel isoforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a conductance-based neuron model to explore how voltage-gated ion channel isoforms influence action-potential generation. The model combines a six-state Markov representation of NaV channels with a first-order KV3.1 model, allowing us to vary maximal sodium and potassium conductances and compare nine NaV isoforms. Using bifurcation theory and local stability analysis, we map regions of stable limit cycles and visualize excitability landscapes via heatmap-based diagrams. These analyses show that isoforms NaV1.3, NaV1.4 and NaV1.6 support broad excitable regimes, while isoforms NaV1.7 and NaV1.9 exhibit minimal oscillatory behavior. Our findings provide insights into the role of channel heterogeneity in neuronal dynamics and may help to guide the design of synthetic excitable systems by narrowing the parameter space needed for robust action-potential trains.</description>

      <title>Convolution goes higher-order: a biologically inspired mechanism empowers image classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to image classification inspired by complex nonlinear biological visual processing, whereby classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are equipped with learnable higher-order convolutions. Our model incorporates a Volterra-like expansion of the convolution operator, capturing multiplicative interactions akin to those observed in early and advanced stages of biological visual processing. We evaluated this approach on synthetic datasets by measuring sensitivity to testing higher-order correlations and performance in standard benchmarks (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and Imagenette). Our architecture outperforms traditional CNN baselines, and achieves optimal performance with expansions up to 3rd/4th order, aligning remarkably well with the distribution of pixel intensities in natural images. Through systematic perturbation analysis, we validate this alignment by isolating the contributions of specific image statistics to model performance, demonstrating how different orders of convolution process distinct aspects of visual information. Furthermore, Representational Similarity Analysis reveals distinct geometries across network layers, indicating qualitatively different modes of visual information processing. Our work bridges neuroscience and deep learning, offering a path towards more effective, biologically inspired computer vision models. It provides insights into visual information processing and lays the groundwork for neural networks that better capture complex visual patterns, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>Do Large Language Models Think Like the Brain? Sentence-Level Evidences from Layer-Wise Embeddings and fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) and the human brain converge on similar computational principles remains a fundamental and important question in cognitive neuroscience and AI. Do the brain-like patterns observed in LLMs emerge simply from scaling, or do they reflect deeper alignment with the architecture of human language processing? This study focuses on the sentence-level neural mechanisms of language models, systematically investigating how layer-wise representations in LLMs align with the dynamic neural responses during human sentence comprehension. By comparing hierarchical embeddings from 14 publicly available LLMs with fMRI data collected from participants, who were exposed to a naturalistic narrative story, we constructed sentence-level neural prediction models to identify the model layers most significantly correlated with brain region activations. Results show that improvements in model performance drive the evolution of representational architectures toward brain-like hierarchies, particularly achieving stronger functional and anatomical correspondence at higher semantic abstraction levels. These findings advance our understanding of the computational parallels between LLMs and the human brain, highlighting the potential of LLMs as models for human language processing.</description>
