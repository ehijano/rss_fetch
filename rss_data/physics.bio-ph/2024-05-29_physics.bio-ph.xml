      <title>Mechanistic insights into Z-ring formation and stability: A Langevin dynamics approach to FtsZ self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tubulin-like protein FtsZ is crucial for cytokinesis in bacteria and many archaea, forming a ring-shaped structure called the Z-ring at the site of cell division. Despite extensive research, the formation of Z-rings is not entirely understood. We propose a theoretical model based on FtsZ's known filament structures, treating them as semiflexible polymers with specific mechanical properties and lateral inter-segment attraction that can stabilize ring formations. Our Langevin dynamics simulations reveal various morphological phases, including open helices, chains, rings, and globules, capturing experimental observations in the fission yeast model using FtsZ from different bacterial species or mutants of Escherichia coli. Using the theoretical model, we explore how treadmilling activity affects Z-ring stability and identify a spooling mechanism of ring formation. The active ring produces contractile, shear, and rotational stresses, which intensify before the Z-ring transitions to an open helix at high activity.</description>

      <title>Mathematical models of the Arabidopsis circadian oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the construction and evolution of mathematical models of the Arabidopsis circadian clock, structuring the discussion into two distinct historical phases of modeling strategies: extension and reduction. The extension phase explores the bottom-up assembly of regulatory networks introducing as many components and interactions as possible in order to capture the oscillatory nature of the clock. The reduction phase deals with functional decomposition, distilling complex models to their essential dynamical repertoire. Current challenges in this field, including the integration of spatial considerations and environmental influences like light and temperature, are also discussed. The review emphasizes the ongoing need for models that balance molecular detail with practical simplicity.</description>

      <title>Lattice ultrasensitivity produces large gain in E. coli chemosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E. coli use a regular lattice of receptors and attached kinases to detect and amplify faint chemical signals. Kinase output is characterized by precise adaptation to a wide range of background ligand levels and large gain in response to small relative changes in ligand concentration. These characteristics are well described by models which achieve their gain through equilibrium cooperativity. But these models are challenged by two experimental results. First, neither adaptation nor large gain are present in receptor binding assays. Second, in cells lacking adaptation machinery, fluctuations can sometimes be enormous, with essentially all kinases transitioning together. Here we introduce a far-from equilibrium model in which receptors gate the spread of activity between neighboring kinases. This model achieves large gain through a mechanism we term lattice ultrasensitivity (LU). In our LU model, kinase and receptor states are separate degrees of freedom, and kinase kinetics are dominated by chemical rates far-from-equilibrium rather than by equilibrium allostery. The model recapitulates the successes of past models, but also matches the challenging experimental findings. Importantly, unlike past lattice critical models, our LU model does not require parameters to be fine tuned for function.</description>

      <title>Learning a conserved mechanism for early neuroectoderm morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphogenesis is the process whereby the body of an organism develops its target shape. The morphogen BMP is known to play a conserved role across bilaterian organisms in determining the dorsoventral (DV) axis. Yet, how BMP governs the spatio-temporal dynamics of cytoskeletal proteins driving morphogenetic flow remains an open question. Here, we use machine learning to mine a morphodynamic atlas of Drosophila development, and construct a mathematical model capable of predicting the coupled dynamics of myosin, E-cadherin, and morphogenetic flow. Mutant analysis shows that BMP sets the initial condition of this dynamical system according to the following signaling cascade: BMP establishes DV pair-rule-gene patterns that set-up an E-cadherin gradient which in turn creates a myosin gradient in the opposite direction through mechanochemical feedbacks. Using neural tube organoids, we argue that BMP, and the signaling cascade it triggers, prime the conserved dynamics of neuroectoderm morphogenesis from fly to humans.</description>

      <title>The significance of fuzzy boundaries of the barrier regions in single-molecule measurements of failed barrier crossing attempts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent experimental study reports on measuring the temporal duration and the spatial extent of failed attempts to cross an activation barrier (i.e., "loops") for a folding transition in a single molecule and for a Brownian particle trapped within a bistable potential. Within the model of diffusive dynamics, however, both of these quantities are, on the average, exactly zero because of the recrossings of the barrier region boundary. That is, an observer endowed with infinite spatial and temporal resolution would find that finite loops do not exist (or, more precisely, form a set of measure zero). Here we develop a description of the experiment that takes finite experimental resolution into account and show how the experimental uncertainty of localizing the point, in time and space, where the barrier is crossed leads to observable distributions of loop times and sizes. Although these distributions generally depend on the experimental resolution, this dependence, in certain cases, may amount to a simple resolution-dependent factor and thus the experiments do probe inherent properties of barrier crossing dynamics.</description>

      <title>Elucidating nanostructural organisation and photonic properties of butterfly wing scales using hyperspectral microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biophotonic nanostructures in butterfly wing scales remain fascinating examples of biological functional materials, with intriguing open questions in regards to formation and evolutionary function. One particularly interesting butterfly species, Erora opisena (Lycaenidae: Theclinae), develops wing scales that contain three-dimensional photonic crystals that closely resemble a single gyroid geometry. Unlike most other gyroid forming butterflies, E. opisena develops discrete gyroid crystallites with a pronounced size gradient hinting at a developmental sequence frozen in time. Here, we use a hyperspectral (wavelength-resolved) microscopy technique to investigate the ultrastructural organisation of these gyroid crystallites in dry, adult wing scales. We show that reflectance corresponds to crystallite size, where larger crystallites reflect green wavelengths more intensely; this relationship could be used to infer size from the optical signal. We further successfully resolve the red-shifted reflectance signal from wing scales immersed in refractive index oils with varying refractive index, including values similar to water or cytosol. Such photonic crystals with lower refractive index contrast may be similar to the hypothesized nanostructural forms in the developing butterfly scales. The ability to resolve these fainter signals hints at the potential of this facile light microscopy method for in vivo analysis of nanostructure formation in developing butterflies.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the strain-induced softening behaviour in hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Usually, the strain-induced softening behaviour observed in the differential modulus $K(T,\gamma)$ of hydrogels has been attributed to the breakage of internal structures of the network, such as the cross-links that bind together the polymer chains. Here we consider a stress-strain relationship that we have recently derived from a coarse-grained model to demonstrate that no rupture of the network is needed for rubber-like gels to present such behaviour. In particular, we show that, in some cases, the decreasing of $K(T,\gamma)$ as a function of the strain $\gamma$ is closely related to the energy-related contribution to the elastic modulus that has been experimentally observed, e.g., for tetra-PEG hydrogels. Thus, our results suggest that, instead of the breakage of structures, the softening behaviour can be also related to the effective interaction between the chains in the network and their neighbouring solvent molecules. Comparison to experimental data determined for several hydrogels is included to illustrate that behaviour and to validate our approach.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous flows in active smectics with dislocations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a hydrodynamic theory of active smectics A in two-dimensional space, including the creation/annihilation and motility of dislocations with Burgers' number $\pm1$. We derive analytical criteria on the set of parameters that lead to flows. We show that the motility of dislocations can lead to flow transitions with distinct features from the previously reported active Helfrich--Hurault shear instability with, notably, a first-order transition in the velocity from quiescence to turbulence.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the where and when of coarse-grained entropy production: General theory meets single-molecule experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics apply to biophysical systems on the nanoscale as described by the framework of stochastic thermodynamics. This theory provides universal, exact relations for quantities like work, which have been verified in experiments where a fully resolved description allows direct access to such quantities. Complementary studies consider partially hidden, coarse-grained descriptions, in which the mean entropy production typically is not directly accessible but can be bounded in terms of observable quantities. Going beyond the mean, we introduce a fluctuating entropy production that applies to individual trajectories in a coarse-grained description under time-dependent driving. Thus, this concept is applicable to the broad and experimentally significant class of driven systems in which not all relevant states can be resolved. We provide a paradigmatic example by studying an experimentally verified protein unfolding process. As a consequence, the entire distribution of the coarse-grained entropy production rather than merely its mean retains spatial and temporal information about the microscopic process. In particular, we obtain a bound on the distribution of the physical entropy production of individual unfolding events.</description>

      <title>Short-time expansion of one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations with heterogeneous diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a short-time expansion for one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations with spatially dependent diffusion coefficients, derived from stochastic processes with Gaussian white noise, for general values of the discretization parameter $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$ of the stochastic integral. The kernel of the Fokker-Planck equation (the propagator) can be expressed as a product of a singular and a regular term. While the singular term can be given in closed form, the regular term can be computed from a Taylor expansion whose coefficients obey simple ordinary differential equations. We illustrate the application of our approach with examples taken from statistical physics and biophysics. Further, we show how our formalism allows to define a class of stochastic equations which can be treated exactly. The convergence of the expansion cannot be guaranteed independently from the discretization parameter $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Emerging double power-law through dynamical complex networks in motility-induced phase separation in Active Brownian Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of active Brownian particles (ABP) within a temporal complex network framework approach. We focused on the node degree distribution, average path length, and average clustering coefficient across the P\'eclet number and packing fraction region. In the single phase or gas region, particle interactions mirror a random graph, and the average number of unique interactions display a non-monotonic behavior with the packing fraction. As we ventured toward the Motility-Phase Separation (MIPS) frontier, a hybrid distribution with a time-evolving pattern emerged, combining Gaussian and power law components. Moreover, we discovered a double power-law distribution in the phase-separated region, with two characteristic slopes symbolizing the emerging gas and solid regions. Our approach involved various numerical and theoretical analyses to capture the role of the packing fraction and P\'eclet number in the topological properties of the dynamical complex network that arises during the ABP dynamics. These findings provide a robust understanding of a phase transition between two states and how this transition manifests as a random to scale-free behavior.</description>
