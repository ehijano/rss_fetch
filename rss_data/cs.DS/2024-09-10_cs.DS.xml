      <title>Subexponential Parameterized Algorithms for Hitting Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite set $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, the $\mathcal{F}$-Hitting problem aims to compute, for a given graph $G$ (taken from some graph class $\mathcal{G}$) of $n$ vertices (and $m$ edges) and a parameter $k\in\mathbb{N}$, a set $S$ of vertices in $G$ such that $|S|\leq k$ and $G-S$ does not contain any subgraph isomorphic to a graph in $\mathcal{F}$. As a generic problem, $\mathcal{F}$-Hitting subsumes many fundamental vertex-deletion problems that are well-studied in the literature. The $\mathcal{F}$-Hitting problem admits a simple branching algorithm with running time $2^{O(k)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$, while it cannot be solved in $2^{o(k)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time on general graphs assuming the ETH.
  In this paper, we establish a general framework to design subexponential parameterized algorithms for the $\mathcal{F}$-Hitting problem on a broad family of graph classes. Specifically, our framework yields algorithms that solve $\mathcal{F}$-Hitting with running time $2^{O(k^c)}\cdot n+O(m)$ for a constant $c&lt;1$ on any graph class $\mathcal{G}$ that admits balanced separators whose size is (strongly) sublinear in the number of vertices and polynomial in the size of a maximum clique. Examples include all graph classes of polynomial expansion and many important classes of geometric intersection graphs. Our algorithms also apply to the \textit{weighted} version of $\mathcal{F}$-Hitting, where each vertex of $G$ has a weight and the goal is to compute the set $S$ with a minimum weight that satisfies the desired conditions.
  The core of our framework is an intricate subexponential branching algorithm that reduces an instance of $\mathcal{F}$-Hitting (on the aforementioned graph classes) to $2^{O(k^c)}$ general hitting-set instances, where the Gaifman graph of each instance has treewidth $O(k^c)$, for some constant $c&lt;1$ depending on $\mathcal{F}$ and the graph class.</description>

      <title>Centralized Selection with Preferences in the Presence of Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the scenario in which there are multiple institutions, each with a limited capacity for candidates, and candidates, each with preferences over the institutions. A central entity evaluates the utility of each candidate to the institutions, and the goal is to select candidates for each institution in a way that maximizes utility while also considering the candidates' preferences. The paper focuses on the setting in which candidates are divided into multiple groups and the observed utilities of candidates in some groups are biased--systematically lower than their true utilities. The first result is that, in these biased settings, prior algorithms can lead to selections with sub-optimal true utility and significant discrepancies in the fraction of candidates from each group that get their preferred choices. Subsequently, an algorithm is presented along with proof that it produces selections that achieve near-optimal group fairness with respect to preferences while also nearly maximizing the true utility under distributional assumptions. Further, extensive empirical validation of these results in real-world and synthetic settings, in which the distributional assumptions may not hold, are presented.</description>

      <title>FPT approximations for Capacitated Sum of Radii and Diameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Capacitated Sum of Radii problem involves partitioning a set of points $P$, where each point $p\in P$ has capacity $U_p$, into $k$ clusters that minimize the sum of cluster radii, such that the number of points in the cluster centered at point $p$ is at most $U_p$. We begin by showing that the problem is APX-hard, and that under gap-ETH there is no parameterized approximation scheme (FPT-AS). We then construct a $\approx5.83$-approximation algorithm in FPT time (improving a previous $\approx7.61$ approximation in FPT time). Our results also hold when the objective is a general monotone symmetric norm of radii. We also improve the approximation factors for the uniform capacity case, and for the closely related problem of Capacitated Sum of Diameters.</description>

      <title>Adjacency Labeling Schemes for Small Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph class admits an implicit representation if, for every positive integer $n$, its $n$-vertex graphs have a $O(\log n)$-bit (adjacency) labeling scheme, i.e., their vertices can be labeled by binary strings of length $O(\log n)$ such that the presence of an edge between any pair of vertices can be deduced solely from their labels. The famous Implicit Graph Conjecture posited that every hereditary (i.e., closed under taking induced subgraphs) factorial (i.e., containing $2^{O(n \log n)}$ $n$-vertex graphs) class admits an implicit representation. The conjecture was recently refuted [Hatami and Hatami, FOCS '22], and does not even hold among monotone (i.e., closed under taking subgraphs) factorial classes [Bonnet et al., ICALP '24]. However, monotone small (i.e., containing at most $n! c^n$ many $n$-vertex graphs for some constant $c$) classes do admit implicit representations.
  This motivates the Small Implicit Graph Conjecture: Every hereditary small class admits an $O(\log n)$-bit labeling scheme. We provide evidence supporting the Small Implicit Graph Conjecture. First, we show that every small weakly sparse (i.e., excluding some fixed bipartite complete graph as a subgraph) class has an implicit representation. This is a consequence of the following fact of independent interest proved in the paper: Every weakly sparse small class has bounded expansion (hence, in particular, bounded degeneracy). Second, we show that every hereditary small class admits an $O(\log^3 n)$-bit labeling scheme, which provides a substantial improvement of the best-known polynomial upper bound of $n^{1-\varepsilon}$ on the size of adjacency labeling schemes for such classes. This is a consequence of another fact of independent interest proved in the paper: Every small class has neighborhood complexity $O(n \log n)$.</description>

      <title>A new approach to bipartite stable matching optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a common generalization of previously solved optimization problems concerning bipartite stable matchings, we describe a strongly polynomial network flow based algorithm for computing $\ell$ disjoint stable matchings with minimum total cost. The major observation behind the approach is that stable matchings, as edge sets, can be represented as certain cuts of an associated directed graph. This allows us to use results on disjoint cuts directly to answer questions about disjoint stable matchings. We also provide a construction that represents stable matchings as maximum-size antichains in a partially ordered set (poset), which enables us to apply the theorems of Dilworth, Mirsky, Greene and Kleitman directly to stable matchings. Another consequence of these approaches is a min-max formula for the minimum number of stable matchings covering all stable edges.</description>

      <title>A Performance Bound for the Greedy Algorithm in a Generalized Class of String Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple performance bound for the greedy scheme in string optimization problems that obtains strong results. Our approach vastly generalizes the group of previously established greedy curvature bounds by Conforti and Cornu\'{e}jols (1984). We consider three constants, $\alpha_G$, $\alpha_G'$, and $\alpha_G''$ introduced by Conforti and Cornu\'{e}jols (1984), that are used in performance bounds of greedy schemes in submodular set optimization. We first generalize both of the $\alpha_G$ and $\alpha_G''$ bounds to string optimization problems in a manner that includes maximizing submodular set functions over matroids as a special case. We then derive a much simpler and computable bound that allows for applications to a far more general class of functions with string domains. We prove that our bound is superior to both the $\alpha_G$ and $\alpha_G''$ bounds and provide a counterexample to show that the $\alpha_G'$ bound is incorrect under the assumptions in Conforti and Cornu\'{e}jols (1984). We conclude with two applications. The first is an application of our result to sensor coverage problems. We demonstrate our performance bound in cases where the objective function is set submodular and string submodular. The second is an application to a social welfare maximization problem with black-box utility functions.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Learning Markov Random Fields from Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important task in high-dimensional statistics is learning the parameters or dependency structure of an undirected graphical model, or Markov random field (MRF). Much of the prior work on this problem assumes access to i.i.d. samples from the MRF distribution and state-of-the-art algorithms succeed using $n^{\Theta(k)}$ runtime, where $n$ is the dimension and $k$ is the order of the interactions. However, well-known reductions from the sparse parity with noise problem imply that given i.i.d. samples from a sparse, order-$k$ MRF, any learning algorithm likely requires $n^{\Omega(k)}$ time, impeding the potential for significant computational improvements. In this work, we demonstrate that these fundamental barriers for learning MRFs can surprisingly be completely circumvented when learning from natural, dynamical samples. We show that in bounded-degree MRFs, the dependency structure and parameters can be recovered using a trajectory of Glauber dynamics of length $O(n \log n)$ with runtime $O(n^2 \log n)$. The implicit constants depend only on the degree and non-degeneracy parameters of the model, but not the dimension $n$. In particular, learning MRFs from dynamics is $\textit{provably computationally easier}$ than learning from i.i.d. samples under standard hardness assumptions.</description>

      <title>Group Testing for Accurate and Efficient Range-Based Near Neighbor Search for Plagiarism Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an adaptive group testing framework for the range-based high dimensional near neighbor search problem. Our method efficiently marks each item in a database as neighbor or non-neighbor of a query point, based on a cosine distance threshold without exhaustive search. Like other methods for large scale retrieval, our approach exploits the assumption that most of the items in the database are unrelated to the query. However, it does not assume a large difference between the cosine similarity of the query vector with the least related neighbor and that with the least unrelated non-neighbor. Following a multi-stage adaptive group testing algorithm based on binary splitting, we divide the set of items to be searched into half at each step, and perform dot product tests on smaller and smaller subsets, many of which we are able to prune away. We show that, using softmax-based features, our method achieves a more than ten-fold speed-up over exhaustive search with no loss of accuracy, on a variety of large datasets. Based on empirically verified models for the distribution of cosine distances, we present a theoretical analysis of the expected number of distance computations per query and the probability that a pool will be pruned. Our method has the following features: (i) It implicitly exploits useful distributional properties of cosine distances unlike other methods; (ii) All required data structures are created purely offline; (iii) It does not impose any strong assumptions on the number of true near neighbors; (iv) It is adaptable to streaming settings where new vectors are dynamically added to the database; and (v) It does not require any parameter tuning. The high recall of our technique makes it particularly suited to plagiarism detection scenarios where it is important to report every database item that is sufficiently similar item to the query.</description>

      <title>Tight (Double) Exponential Bounds for Identification Problems: Locating-Dominating Set and Test Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate fine-grained algorithmic aspects of identification problems in graphs and set systems, with a focus on Locating-Dominating Set and Test Cover. We prove the (tight) conditional lower bounds for these problems when parameterized by treewidth and solution as. Formally, \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} (respectively, \textsc{Test Cover}) parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph (respectively, of the natural auxiliary graph) does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(tw)}} \cdot poly(n)$ (respectively, $2^{2^{o(tw)}} \cdot poly(|U| + |\mathcal{F}|))$. This result augments the small list of NP-Complete problems that admit double exponential lower bounds when parameterized by treewidth. Then, we first prove that \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{o(k^2)} \cdot poly(n)$, nor a polynomial time kernelization algorithm that reduces the solution size and outputs a kernel with $2^{o(k)}$ vertices, unless the \ETH\ fails. To the best of our knowledge, \textsc{Locating-Dominating Set} is the first problem that admits such an algorithmic lower-bound (with a quadratic function in the exponent) when parameterized by the solution size. Finally, we prove that \textsc{Test Cover} does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(k)}} \cdot poly(|U| + |\mathcal{F}|)$. This is also a rare example of the problem that admits a double exponential lower bound when parameterized by the solution size.
  We also present algorithms whose running times match the above lower bounds.</description>

      <title>An asymptotically optimal algorithm for generating bin cardinalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the balls-into-bins setting, $n$ balls are thrown uniformly at random into $n$ bins. The na\"{i}ve way to generate the final load vector takes $\Theta(n)$ time. However, it is well-known that this load vector has with high probability bin cardinalities of size $\Theta(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$. Here, we present an algorithm in the RAM model that generates the bin cardinalities of the final load vector in the optimal $\Theta(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$ time in expectation and with high probability.
  Further, the algorithm that we present is still optimal for any $m \in [n, n \log n]$ balls and can also be used as a building block to efficiently simulate more involved load balancing algorithms. In particular, for the Two-Choice algorithm, which samples two bins in each step and allocates to the least-loaded of the two, we obtain roughly a quadratic speed-up over the na\"{i}ve simulation.</description>

      <title>Biased Pareto Optimization for Subset Selection with Dynamic Cost Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subset selection with cost constraints aims to select a subset from a ground set to maximize a monotone objective function without exceeding a given budget, which has various applications such as influence maximization and maximum coverage. In real-world scenarios, the budget, representing available resources, may change over time, which requires that algorithms must adapt quickly to new budgets. However, in this dynamic environment, previous algorithms either lack theoretical guarantees or require a long running time. The state-of-the-art algorithm, POMC, is a Pareto optimization approach designed for static problems, lacking consideration for dynamic problems. In this paper, we propose BPODC, enhancing POMC with biased selection and warm-up strategies tailored for dynamic environments. We focus on the ability of BPODC to leverage existing computational results while adapting to budget changes. We prove that BPODC can maintain the best known $(\alpha_f/2)(1-e^{-\alpha_f})$-approximation guarantee when the budget changes. Experiments on influence maximization and maximum coverage show that BPODC adapts more effectively and rapidly to budget changes, with a running time that is less than that of the static greedy algorithm.</description>

      <title>Upward Pointset Embeddings of Planar st-Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study upward pointset embeddings (UPSEs) of planar $st$-graphs. Let $G$ be a planar $st$-graph and let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a pointset with $|S|= |V(G)|$. An UPSE of $G$ on $S$ is an upward planar straight-line drawing of $G$ that maps the vertices of $G$ to the points of $S$. We consider both the problem of testing the existence of an UPSE of $G$ on $S$ (UPSE Testing) and the problem of enumerating all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$. We prove that UPSE Testing is NP-complete even for $st$-graphs that consist of a set of directed $st$-paths sharing only $s$ and $t$. On the other hand, for $n$-vertex planar $st$-graphs whose maximum $st$-cutset has size $k$, we prove that it is possible to solve UPSE Testing in $O(n^{4k})$ time with $O(n^{3k})$ space, and to enumerate all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(k n^{4k} \log n)$ space, after $O(k n^{4k} \log n)$ set-up time. Moreover, for an $n$-vertex $st$-graph whose underlying graph is a cycle, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an UPSE on a given poinset, which can be tested in $O(n \log n)$ time. Related to this result, we give an algorithm that, for a set $S$ of $n$ points, enumerates all the non-crossing monotone Hamiltonian cycles on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(n^2)$ space, after $O(n^2)$ set-up time.</description>

Abstract: In a game of persuasion with evidence, a sender has private information. By presenting evidence on the information, the sender wishes to persuade a receiver to take a single action (e.g., hire a job candidate, or convict a defendant). The sender's utility depends solely on whether or not the receiver takes the action. The receiver's utility depends on both the action and the sender's private information. We study three natural variations. First, we consider the problem of computing an equilibrium of the game without commitment power. Second, we consider a persuasion variant, where the sender commits to a signaling scheme and the receiver, after seeing the evidence, takes the action or not. Third, we study a delegation variant, where the receiver first commits to taking the action if being presented certain evidence, and the sender presents evidence to maximize the probability the action is taken. We study these variants through the computational lens, and give hardness results, optimal approximation algorithms, and polynomial-time algorithms for special cases. Among our results is an approximation algorithm that rounds a semidefinite program that might be of independent interest, since, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first such approximation algorithm in algorithmic economics.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Logical Zonotope: A Set Representation for Reachability Analysis of Logical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set representation called polynomial logical zonotopes for performing exact and computationally efficient reachability analysis on logical systems. We prove that through this polynomial-like construction, we are able to perform all of the fundamental logical operations (XOR, NOT, XNOR, AND, NAND, OR, NOR) between sets of points exactly in a reduced space, i.e., generator space with reduced complexity. Polynomial logical zonotopes are a generalization of logical zonotopes, which are able to represent up to $2^n$ binary vectors using only $n$ generators. Due to their construction, logical zonotopes are only able to support exact computations of some logical operations (XOR, NOT, XNOR), while other operations (AND, NAND, OR, NOR) result in over-approximations in the generator space. In order to perform all fundamental logical operations exactly, we formulate a generalization of logical zonotopes that is constructed by dependent generators and exponent matrices. While we are able to perform all of the logical operations exactly, this comes with a slight increase in computational complexity compared to logical zonotopes. To illustrate and showcase the computational benefits of polynomial logical zonotopes, we present the results of performing reachability analysis on two use cases: (1) safety verification of an intersection crossing protocol and (2) reachability analysis on a high-dimensional Boolean function. Moreover, to highlight the extensibility of logical zonotopes, we include an additional use case where we perform a computationally tractable exhaustive search for the key of a linear feedback shift register.</description>

      <title>Optimal Structured Matrix Approximation for Robustness to Incomplete Biosequence Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general method for optimally approximating an arbitrary matrix $\mathbf{M}$ by a structured matrix $\mathbf{T}$ (circulant, Toeplitz/Hankel, etc.) and examine its use for estimating the spectra of genomic linkage disequilibrium matrices. This application is prototypical of a variety of genomic and proteomic problems that demand robustness to incomplete biosequence information. We perform a simulation study and corroborative test of our method using real genomic data from the Mouse Genome Database. The results confirm the predicted utility of the method and provide strong evidence of its potential value to a wide range of bioinformatics applications. Our optimal general matrix approximation method is expected to be of independent interest to an even broader range of applications in applied mathematics and engineering.</description>

      <title>On Bounds for Greedy Schemes in String Optimization based on Greedy Curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the celebrated bound introduced by Conforti and Cornu\'ejols (1984) for greedy schemes in submodular optimization. The bound assumes a submodular function defined on a collection of sets forming a matroid and is based on greedy curvature. We show that the bound holds for a very general class of string problems that includes maximizing submodular functions over set matroids as a special case. We also derive a bound that is computable in the sense that they depend only on quantities along the greedy trajectory. We prove that our bound is superior to the greedy curvature bound of Conforti and Cornu\'ejols. In addition, our bound holds under a condition that is weaker than submodularity.</description>
