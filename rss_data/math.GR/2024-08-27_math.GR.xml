      <title>Conditional representation stability, classification of $*$-homomorphisms, and eta invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasi-representation of a group is a map from the group into a matrix algebra (or similar object) that approximately satisfies the relations needed to be a representation. Work of many people starting with Kazhdan and Voiculescu, and recently advanced by Dadarlat, Eilers-Shulman-S\o{}rensen and others, has shown that there are topological obstructions to approximating unitary quasi-representations of groups by honest representations, where `approximation' is understood to be with respect to the operator norm.
  The purpose of this paper is to explore whether approximation is possible if the known obstructions vanish, partially generalizing work of Gong-Lin and Eilers-Loring-Pedersen for the free abelian group of rank two, and the Klein bottle group. We show that this is possible, at least in a weak sense, for some `low-dimensional' groups including fundamental groups of closed surfaces, certain Baumslag-Solitar groups, free-by-cyclic groups, and many fundamental groups of three manifolds.
  The techniques used in the paper are $K$-theoretic: they have their origin in Baum-Connes-Kasparov type assembly maps, and in the Elliott program to classify $C^*$-algebras; Kasparov's bivariant KK-theory is a crucial tool. The key new technical ingredients are: a stable uniqueness theorem in the sense of Dadarlat-Eilers and Lin that works for non-exact $C^*$-algebras; and an analysis of maps on $K$-theory with finite coefficients in terms of the relative eta invariants of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer. Despite the proofs going through $K$-theoretic machinery, the main theorems can be stated in elementary terms that do not need any $K$-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solvable Baumslag Solitar groups $\text{BS}(1,n)$ each admit a canonical model space, $X_n$. We give a complete classification of lattices in $G_n = \text{Isom}^+(X_n)$ and find that such lattices fail to be strongly rigid$\unicode{x2014}$there are automorphisms of lattices $\Gamma \subset G_n$ which do not extend to $G_n$$\unicode{x2014}$but do satisfy a weaker form of rigidity: for all isomorphic lattices $\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2\subset G_n$, there is an automorphism $\rho \in \text{Aut}(G_n)$ so that $\rho(\Gamma_1) = \Gamma_2$.</description>

      <title>Character triples and relative defect zero characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a character triple $(G,N,\theta)$, which means that $G$ is a finite group with $N \vartriangleleft G$ and $\theta\in{\rm Irr}(N)$ is $G$-invariant, we introduce the notion of a $\pi$-quasi extension of $\theta$ to $G$ where $\pi$ is the set of primes dividing the order of the cohomology element $[\theta]_{G/N}\in H^2(G/N,\mathbb{C}^\times)$ associated with the character triple, and then establish the uniqueness of such an extension in the normalized case. As an application, we use the $\pi$-quasi extension of $\theta$ to construct a bijection from the set of $\pi$-defect zero characters of $G/N$ onto the set of relative $\pi$-defect zero characters of $G$ over $\theta$. Our results generalize the related theorems of M. Murai and of G. Navarro.</description>

      <title>A note on test elements for monomorphisms of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A word in a group is called a test element if any endomorphism fixing it is necessarily an automorphism. In this note, we give a sufficient condition in geometry to construct test elements for monomorphisms of a free group, by using the Whitehead graph and the action of the free group on its Cayley graph.</description>

      <title>Some Properties of Order-Divisor Graphs of Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the properties of order-divisor graphs associated with finite groups. An order-divisor graph of a finite group is an undirected graph in which the set of vertices includes all elements of the group, and two distinct vertices with different orders are adjacent if the order of one vertex divides the order of the other. We prove some beautiful results in order-divisor graphs of finite groups. The primary focus is on examining the girth, degree of vertices, and size of the order-divisor graph. In particular, we provide a comprehensive description of these parameters for the order-divisor graphs of finite cyclic groups and dihedral groups.</description>

      <title>Greedy base sizes for sporadic simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A base for a permutation group $G$ acting on a set $\Omega$ is a sequence $\mathcal{B}$ of points of $\Omega$ such that the pointwise stabiliser $G_{\mathcal{B}}$ is trivial. Denote the minimum size of a base for $G$ by $b(G)$. There is a natural greedy algorithm for constructing a base of relatively small size; denote by $\mathcal{G}(G)$ the maximum size of a base it produces. Motivated by a long-standing conjecture of Cameron, we determine $\mathcal{G}(G)$ for every almost simple primitive group $G$ with socle a sporadic simple group, showing that $\mathcal{G}(G)=b(G)$.</description>

      <title>Contracting Self-similar Groups in Group-Based Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose self-similar contracting groups as a platform for cryptographic schemes based on simultaneous conjugacy search problem (SCSP). The class of these groups contains extraordinary examples like Grigorchuk group, which is known to be non-linear, thus making some of existing attacks against SCSP inapplicable. The groups in this class admit a natural normal form based on the notion of a nucleus portrait, that plays a key role in our approach. While for some groups in the class the conjugacy search problem has been studied, there are many groups for which no algorithms solving it are known. Moreover, there are some self-similar groups with undecidable conjugacy problem. We discuss benefits and drawbacks of using these groups in group-based cryptography and provide computational analysis of variants of the length-based attack on SCSP for some groups in the class, including Grigorchuk group, Basilica group, and others.</description>

Abstract: We present a method to construct infinite families of entangling $2$-qudit gates, and amongst them entangling $2$-qudit gates which satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. We show that, given $2$-qudit gates $c$ and $d$, if $c$ or $d$ is entangling, then their Tracy-Singh product $c \boxtimes d$ is also entangling and we can provide non-entangled states which become entangled after the application of $c \boxtimes d$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we summarize the work on the characterization of finite simple groups and the study on finite groups with the set of element orders and two orders (the order of group and the set of element orders). Some related topics, and the applications together with their generalizations are also discussed. The original version of this article was published in Chinese in the journal Scientia Sinica Mathematica, no.53(2023), pp.931-952. This revised and expanded version has corrected several errors and added quite a few contents. Especially, it is pointed that this work has applications in mathematics and computational complexity theory.</description>

      <title>Regular bi-interpretability and finite axiomatizability of Chevalley groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01954v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider Chevalley groups over commutative rings with~$1$, constructed by irreducible root systems of rank $&gt;1$. We always suppose that for the systems $A_2, B_\ell, C_\ell, F_4, G_2$ our rings contain $1/2$ and for the system $G_2$ also $1/3$. Under these assumptions we prove that the central quotients of Chevalley groups are regularly bi-interpretable with the corresponding rings, the class of all central quotients of Chevalley groups of a given type is elementarily definable and even finitely axiomatizable (see Definition~2.2). The same holds for adjoint Chevalley groups and for bondedly generated Chevalley groups. We also give an example of Chevalley group with infinite center, which is not bi-interpretable with the corresponding ring and is elementarily equivalent to a group that is not a Chevalley group itself.</description>

      <title>On subgroups with narrow Schreier graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study finitely generated pairs of groups $H \leq G$ such that the Schreier graph of $H$ has at least two ends and is \emph{narrow}. Examples of narrow Schreier graphs include those that are quasi-isometric to finitely ended trees or have linear growth. Under this hypothesis, we show that $H$ is a virtual fiber subgroup if and only if $G$ contains infinitely many double cosets of $H$. Along the way, we prove that if a group acts essentially on a finite dimensional CAT(0) cube complex with no facing triples then it virtually surjects onto the integers with kernel commensurable to a hyperplane stabiliser.</description>

      <title>Two conjectures on coarse conjugacy by Geller and Misiurewicz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their study of coarse entropy, W. Geller and M. Misiurewicz introduced the notion of coarse conjugacy: a version of conjugacy appropriate for dynamics on metric spaces observed from afar. They made two conjectures on coarse conjugacy generalising their results. We disprove both of these conjectures. We investigate the impact of extra assumptions on the validity of the conjectures: We show that the result of Geller and Misiurewicz towards one of the conjectures can be considered optimal, and we prove the other conjecture under an assumption complementary to that from the referenced work.</description>

      <title>Scissors automorphism groups and their homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In any category with a reasonable notion of cover, each object has a group of scissors automorphisms. We prove that under mild conditions, the homology of this group is independent of the object, and can be expressed in terms of the scissors congruence K-theory spectrum defined by Zakharevich. We therefore obtain both a group-theoretic interpretation of Zakharevich's higher scissors congruence K-theory, as well as a method to compute the homology of scissors automorphism groups. We apply this to various families of groups, such as interval exchange groups and Brin--Thompson groups, recovering results of Szymik--Wahl, Li, and Tanner, and obtaining new results as well.</description>
