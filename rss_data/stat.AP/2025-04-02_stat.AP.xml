      <title>Reducing Differential Item Functioning via Process Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing fairness is a major concern in psychometric and educational research. A typical approach for ensuring testing fairness is through differential item functioning (DIF) analysis. DIF arises when a test item functions differently across subgroups that are typically defined by the respondents' demographic characteristics. Most of the existing research has focused on the statistical detection of DIF, yet less attention has been given to reducing or eliminating DIF and understanding why it occurs. Simultaneously, the use of computer-based assessments has become increasingly popular. The data obtained from respondents interacting with an item are recorded in computer log files and are referred to as process data. Process data provide valuable insights into respondents' problem-solving strategies and progress, offering new opportunities for DIF analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel method within the framework of generalized linear models (GLMs) that leverages process data to reduce and understand DIF. Specifically, we construct a nuisance trait surrogate with the features extracted from process data. With the constructed nuisance trait, we introduce a new scoring rule that incorporates respondents' behaviors captured through process data on top of the target latent trait. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach through extensive simulation experiments and an application to thirteen Problem Solving in Technology-Rich Environments (PSTRE) items from the 2012 Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) assessment.</description>

      <title>Detecting adverse high-order drug interactions from individual case safety reports using computational statistics on disproportionality measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adverse drug interactions are a critical concern in pharmacovigilance, as both clinical trials and spontaneous reporting systems often lack the breadth to detect complex drug interactions. This study introduces a computational framework for adverse drug interaction detection, leveraging disproportionality analysis on individual case safety reports. By integrating the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification, the framework extends beyond drug interactions to capture hierarchical pharmacological relationships. To address biases inherent in existing disproportionality measures, we employ a hypergeometric risk metric, while a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm provides robust empirical p-value estimation for the risk associated to cocktails. A genetic algorithm further facilitates efficient identification of high-risk drug cocktails. Validation on synthetic and FDA Adverse Event Reporting System data demonstrates the method's efficacy in detecting established drugs and drug interactions associated with myopathy-related adverse events. Implemented as an R package, this framework offers a reproducible, scalable tool for post-market drug safety surveillance.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian latent Gaussian conditional autoregressive copula model for analyzing spatially-varying trends in rainfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the availability of rainfall water plays a crucial role in rainfed agriculture. Given the substantial proportion of agricultural practices in India being rainfed and considering the potential trends in rainfall amounts across years due to climate change, we build a statistical model for analyzing annual total rainfall data for 34 meteorological subdivisions of mainland India available for 1951-2014. Here, we model the margins using a gamma regression model and the dependence through a Gaussian conditional autoregressive (CAR) copula model. Due to the natural variation of the average annual rainfall received across various dry through wet regions of the country, we allow areally-varying gamma regression coefficients under a latent Gaussian model framework. The neighborhood structure of the regions determines the dependence structure of both the likelihood and the prior layers, where we explore both CAR and intrinsic CAR structures for the priors. The proposed methodology also imputes the missing data effectively. We use the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to draw Bayesian inferences. In simulation studies, the proposed model outperforms some competitors that do not allow a dependence structure at the data or prior layers. Implementing the proposed method for the Indian areal rainfall dataset, we draw inferences about the model parameters and discuss the potential effect of climate change on rainfall across India.</description>

      <title>Producing population-level estimates of internal displacement in Ukraine using GPS mobile phone data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly 110 million people are forcibly displaced people worldwide. However, estimating the scale and patterns of internally displaced persons in real time, and developing appropriate policy responses, remain hindered by traditional data streams. They are infrequently updated, costly and slow. Mobile phone location data can overcome these limitations, but only represent a population segment. Drawing on an anonymised large-scale, high-frequency dataset of locations from 25 million mobile devices, we propose an approach to leverage mobile phone data and produce population-level estimates of internal displacement. We use this approach to quantify the extent, pace and geographic patterns of internal displacement in Ukraine during the early stages of the Russian invasion in 2022. Our results produce reliable population-level estimates, enabling real-time monitoring of internal displacement at detailed spatio-temporal resolutions. Accurate estimations are crucial to support timely and effective humanitarian and disaster management responses, prioritising resources where they are most needed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates long-term cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients using advanced clustering techniques. The objective was to analyse ECG parameters, demographic data, comorbidities, and hospitalization details to identify patterns in cardiovascular health outcomes. We applied K-means clustering and identified three distinct clusters: Cluster 0 with moderate heart rate variability and ICU admissions, Cluster 1 with lower heart rate variability and ICU admissions, and Cluster 2 with higher heart rate variability and ICU admissions, indicating higher risk profiles.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Hypoglycemia Classification Across Multiple Prediction Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) management can be significantly enhanced through the use of predictive machine learning (ML) algorithms, which can mitigate the risk of adverse events like hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia, characterized by blood glucose levels below 70 mg/dL, is a life-threatening condition typically caused by excessive insulin administration, missed meals, or physical activity. Its asymptomatic nature impedes timely intervention, making ML models crucial for early detection. This study integrates short- (up to 2h) and long-term (up to 24h) prediction horizons (PHs) within a single classification model to enhance decision support. The predicted times are 5-15 min, 15-30 min, 30 min-1h, 1-2h, 2-4h, 4-8h, 8-12h, and 12-24h before hypoglycemia. In addition, a simplified model classifying up to 4h before hypoglycemia is compared. We trained ResNet and LSTM models on glucose levels, insulin doses, and acceleration data. The results demonstrate the superiority of the LSTM models when classifying nine classes. In particular, subject-specific models yielded better performance but achieved high recall only for classes 0, 1, and 2 with 98%, 72%, and 50%, respectively. A population-based six-class model improved the results with at least 60% of events detected. In contrast, longer PHs remain challenging with the current approach and may be considered with different models.</description>

      <title>Bayesian nonparametric copulas with tail dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel bivariate copula model able to capture both the central and tail dependence of the joint probability distribution. Model that can capture the dependence structure within the joint tail have important implications in many application areas where the focus is risk management (e.g. macroeconomics and finance). We use a Bayesian nonparametric approach to introduce a random copula based on infinite partitions of unity. We define a hierarchical prior over an infinite partition of the unit hypercube which has a stick breaking representation leading to an infinite mixture of products of independent beta densities. Capitalising on the stick breaking representation we introduce a Gibbs sample to proceed to inference. For our empirical analysis we consider both simulated and real data (insurance claims and portfolio returns). We compare both our model's ability to capture tail dependence and its out of sample predictive performance to competitive models (e.g. Joe and Clayton copulas) and show that in both simulated and real examples our model outperforms the competitive models.</description>

      <title>pumBayes: Bayesian Estimation of Probit Unfolding Models for Binary Preference Data in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probit unfolding models (PUMs) are a novel class of scaling models that allow for items with both monotonic and non-monotonic response functions and have shown great promise in the estimation of preferences from voting data in various deliberative bodies. This paper presents the R package pumBayes, which enables Bayesian inference for both static and dynamic PUMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that require minimal or no tuning. In addition to functions that carry out the sampling from the posterior distribution of the models, the package also includes various support functions that can be used to pre-process data, select hyperparameters, summarize output, and compute metrics of model fit. We demonstrate the use of the package through an analysis of two datasets, one corresponding to roll-call voting data from the 116th U.S. House of Representatives, and a second one corresponding to voting records in the U.S. Supreme Court between 1937 and 2021.</description>

      <title>Graphical Models and Efficient Inference Methods for Multivariate Phase Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate phase relationships are important to characterize and understand numerous physical, biological, and chemical systems, from electromagnetic waves to neural oscillations. These systems exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics and intricate interdependencies among their constituent elements. While classical models of multivariate phase relationships, such as the wave equation and Kuramoto model, give theoretical models to describe phenomena, the development of statistical tools for hypothesis testing and inference for multivariate phase relationships in complex systems remains limited. This paper introduces a novel probabilistic modeling framework to characterize multivariate phase relationships, with wave-like phenomena serving as a key example. This approach describes spatial patterns and interactions between oscillators through a pairwise exponential family distribution. Building upon the literature of graphical model inference, including methods like Ising models, graphical lasso, and interaction screening, this work bridges the gap between classical wave dynamics and modern statistical approaches. Efficient inference methods are introduced, leveraging the Chow-Liu algorithm for directed tree approximations and interaction screening for general graphical models. Simulated experiments demonstrate the utility of these methods for uncovering wave properties and sparse interaction structures, highlighting their applicability to diverse scientific domains. This framework establishes a new paradigm for statistical modeling of multivariate phase relationships, providing a powerful toolset for exploring the complexity of these systems.</description>

      <title>Quantile Treatment Effects in High Dimensional Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel estimator for quantile causal effects with high-dimensional panel data (large $N$ and $T$), where only one or a few units are affected by the intervention or policy. Our method extends the generalized synthetic control method (Xu 2017) from average treatment effect on the treated to quantile treatment effect on the treated, allowing the underlying factor structure to change across the quantile of the interested outcome distribution. Our method involves estimating the quantile-dependent factors using the control group, followed by a quantile regression to estimate the quantile treatment effect using the treated units. We establish the asymptotic properties of our estimator and propose a bootstrap procedure for statistical inference, supported by simulation studies. An empirical application of the 2008 China Stimulus Program is provided.</description>

      <title>Assessing Driving Risk Through Unsupervised Detection of Anomalies in Telematics Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicle telematics provides granular data for dynamic driving risk assessment, but current methods often rely on aggregated metrics (e.g., harsh braking counts) and do not fully exploit the rich time-series structure of telematics data. In this paper, we introduce a flexible framework using continuous-time hidden Markov model (CTHMM) to model and analyze trip-level telematics data. Unlike existing methods, the CTHMM models raw time-series data without predefined thresholds on harsh driving events or assumptions about accident probabilities. Moreover, our analysis is based solely on telematics data, requiring no traditional covariates such as driver or vehicle characteristics. Through unsupervised anomaly detection based on pseudo-residuals, we identify deviations from normal driving patterns -- defined as the prevalent behaviour observed in a driver's history or across the population -- which are linked to accident risk. Validated on both controlled and real-world datasets, the CTHMM effectively detects abnormal driving behaviour and trips with increased accident likelihood. In real data analysis, higher anomaly levels in longitudinal and lateral accelerations consistently correlate with greater accident risk, with classification models using this information achieving ROC-AUC values as high as 0.86 for trip-level analysis and 0.78 for distinguishing drivers with claims. Furthermore, the methodology reveals significant behavioural differences between drivers with and without claims, offering valuable insights for insurance applications, accident analysis, and prevention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban air mobility (UAM) introduces new challenges for infrastructure planning, requiring data driven approaches for sustainable site selection. This study proposes USE-LFA (Urban Site Evaluation using Latent Factor Analysis), a framework designed to support equitable and environmentally conscious siting of urban ports. Applying latent factor analysis to 25 urban attributes in Seoul, the framework identifies six latent factors, grouped into two dimensions: Suitability and Attractiveness. These dimensions are combined through a tunable prioritization metric, enabling alignment with local strategic goals. The analysis uncovers spatial typologies and clustered siting patterns, highlighting regional disparities in site potential. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that small adjustments in the Suitability Attractiveness weighting substantially affect viable site candidates, emphasizing the need for calibrated decision-making. USE-LFA facilitates interpretable and transferable analysis across different urban contexts and datasets, offering a scalable approach to integrating UAM and other emerging mobility systems into urban environments, while advancing sustainable and inclusive transport infrastructure development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper seeks to analyse and predict conditional intraday volatility curves in FX markets using functional Generalised AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models. Remarkably, taking account of cross-dependency dynamics between the major currencies significantly improves intraday conditional volatility forecasting. Additionally, incorporating intraday bid-ask spread using a functional GARCH-X model further enhances predictability. The precise volatility forecasts motivate the construction of intraday Value-at-Risk (VaR). An intraday risk management application highlights that predicted intraday VaR curves can help mitigate dramatic losses in intraday trading strategies, showcasing their practical economic benefits.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for data-driven weather models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based data-driven weather forecasting models have experienced rapid progress over the last years. Recent studies, with models trained on reanalysis data, achieve impressive results and demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art physics-based numerical weather prediction models across a range of variables and evaluation metrics. Beyond improved predictions, the main advantages of data-driven weather models are their substantially lower computational costs and the faster generation of forecasts, once a model has been trained. However, most efforts in data-driven weather forecasting have been limited to deterministic, point-valued predictions, making it impossible to quantify forecast uncertainties, which is crucial in research and for optimal decision making in applications. Our overarching aim is to systematically study and compare uncertainty quantification methods to generate probabilistic weather forecasts from a state-of-the-art deterministic data-driven weather model, Pangu-Weather. Specifically, we compare approaches for quantifying forecast uncertainty based on generating ensemble forecasts via perturbations to the initial conditions, with the use of statistical and machine learning methods for post-hoc uncertainty quantification. In a case study on medium-range forecasts of selected weather variables over Europe, the probabilistic forecasts obtained by using the Pangu-Weather model in concert with uncertainty quantification methods show promising results and provide improvements over ensemble forecasts from the physics-based ensemble weather model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for lead times of up to 5 days.</description>

Abstract: High-dimensional panels of time series often arise in finance and macroeconomics, where co-movements within groups of panel components occur. Extracting these groupings from the data provides a course-grained description of the complex system in question and can inform subsequent prediction tasks. We develop a novel methodology to model such a panel as a restricted vector autoregressive process, where the coefficient matrix is the weighted adjacency matrix of a stochastic block model. This network time series model, which we call the Network Informed Restricted Vector Autoregression (NIRVAR) model, yields a coefficient matrix that has a sparse block-diagonal structure. We propose an estimation procedure that embeds each panel component in a low-dimensional latent space and clusters the embedded points to recover the blocks of the coefficient matrix. Crucially, the method allows for network-based time series modelling when the underlying network is unobserved. We derive the bias, consistency and asymptotic normality of the NIRVAR estimator. Simulation studies suggest that the NIRVAR estimated embedded points are Gaussian distributed around the ground truth latent positions. On three applications to finance, macroeconomics, and transportation systems, NIRVAR outperforms competing models in terms of prediction and provides interpretable results regarding group recovery.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Age Distribution of Deaths: Cumulative Distribution Function Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Like density functions, period life-table death counts are nonnegative and have a constrained integral, and thus live in a constrained nonlinear space. Implementing established modelling and forecasting methods without obeying these constraints can be problematic for such nonlinear data. We introduce cumulative distribution function transformation to forecast the life-table death counts. Using the Japanese life-table death counts obtained from the Japanese Mortality Database (2024), we evaluate the point and interval forecast accuracies of the proposed approach, which compares favourably to an existing compositional data analytic approach. The improved forecast accuracy of life-table death counts is of great interest to demographers for estimating age-specific survival probabilities and life expectancy and actuaries for determining temporary annuity prices for different ages and maturities.</description>

      <title>Local False Sign Rate and the Role of Prior Covariance Rank in Multivariate Empirical Bayes Multiple Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the rank of the prior covariance matrix and the local false sign rate (lfsr) in multivariate empirical Bayes multiple testing, specifically within the context of normal mean models. We demonstrate that using low-rank covariance matrices for the prior results in inflated false sign rates, a consequence of rank deficiency. To address this, we propose an adjustment that mitigates this inflation by employing full-rank covariance matrices. Through simulations, we validate the effectiveness of this adjustment in controlling false sign rates, thereby improving the robustness of empirical Bayes methods in high-dimensional settings. Our results show that the rank of the prior covariance matrix directly influences the accuracy of sign estimation and the performance of the lfsr, with significant implications for large-scale hypothesis testing in statistics and genomics.</description>
