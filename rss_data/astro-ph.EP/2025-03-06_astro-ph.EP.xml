      <title>Discovery of Radio Recombination Lines from Proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations that, for the first time, detect hydrogen and helium radio recombination lines from a protoplanetary disk. We imaged the Orion Nebula Cluster at 3.1 mm with a spectral setup that covered the $n=42 \rightarrow 41$ transitions of hydrogen (H41$\alpha$) and helium (He41$\alpha$). The unprecedented sensitivity of these observations enables us to search for radio recombination lines toward the positions of ${\sim}200$ protoplanetary disks. We detect H41$\alpha$ from 17 disks, all of which are HST-identified `proplyds.' The detected H41$\alpha$ emission is spatially coincident with the locations of proplyd ionization fronts, indicating that proplyd H41$\alpha$ emission is produced by gas that has been photoevaporated off the disk and ionized by UV radiation from massive stars. We measure the fluxes and widths of the detected H41$\alpha$ lines and find line fluxes of ${\sim}30-800$ mJy km s$^{-1}$ and line widths of ${\sim}30-90$ km s$^{-1}$. The derived line widths indicate that the broadening of proplyd H41$\alpha$ emission is dominated by outflowing gas motions associated with external photoevaporation. The derived line fluxes, when compared with measurements of 3.1 mm free-free flux, imply that the ionization fronts of H41$\alpha$-detected proplyds have electron temperatures of ${\sim}6,000-11,000$ K and electron densities of ${\sim}10^6-10^7$ cm$^{-3}$. Finally, we detect He41$\alpha$ towards one H41$\alpha$-detected source and find evidence that this system is helium-rich. Our study demonstrates that radio recombination lines are readily detectable in ionized photoevaporating disks, providing a new way to measure disk properties in clustered star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Positive Feedback: How a Synergy Between the Streaming Instability and Dust Coagulation Forms Planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important open questions in planet formation is how dust grains in a protoplanetary disk manage to overcome growth barriers and form the $\sim$100km planet building blocks that we call planetesimals. There appears to be a gap between the largest grains that can be produce by coagulation, and the smallest grains that are needed for the streaming instability (SI) to form planetesimals. Here we explore a novel hypothesis: That dust coagulation and the SI work in tandem. That they form a feedback loop where each one boosts the action of the other to bridge the gap between dust grains and planetesimals. We develop a semi-analytical model of dust concentration due to the SI, and an analytic model of how the SI affects the fragmentation and radial drift barriers. We then combine those to model our proposed feedback loop. In the fragmentation-limited regime, we find a powerful synergy between the SI and dust growth that drastically increases both grain sizes and densities. We find that a midplane dust-to-gas ratio of $\epsilon \ge 0.3$ is a sufficient condition for the feedback loop to reach the planetesimal-forming region for turbulence values $10^{-4} \le \alpha \le 10^{-3}$ and grain sizes $0.01 \le {\rm St} \le 0.1$. In contrast, the drift-limited regime only shows grain growth, without significant dust accumulation. Planet formation in the drift-limited portion of the disk may require other processes (particle traps) to halt radial drift.</description>

      <title>High angular resolution evidence of dust traps from deep ALMA Band 3 observations of LkCa15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust traps are the most promising mechanisms to explain the observed substructures in protoplanetary discs. In this work, we present high-angular resolution ($\sim$60 mas, 9.4\,au) and high-sensitivity Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) observations at 3 mm of the transitional disc around LkCa15. The new data, combined with previous high-resolution observations at $\lambda=0.87,1.3$ mm, make LkCa15 an ideal laboratory for testing the dust trapping mechanism. We found that the width of the three rings decreases linearly with frequency, and the spectral indices show local minima at the locations of the rings, consistent with dust trap models. Multi-wavelength modelling confirms that the dust surface density and maximum grain size peak at 69 and 101\,au, and suggestive peak at 42\,au. The estimated total dust mass is between 13-250 M$_{\oplus}$, depending on the chosen opacity. The inner disc shows bright and unresolved emission at 3 mm, exhibiting a spectral index of $\alpha_{1.3-3 \rm mm} = 0.3 \pm 0.37$, and $\alpha_{\rm 3mm-3cm}$ ranging from $-0.1$ to $0.0$. These properties are consistent with free-free emission from an ionised jet or disc wind. Dust evolution models and radiative transfer calculations suggest that a viscosity coefficient of $\alpha = 10^{-3}$, a fragmentation velocity of 10 m\,s$^{-1}$, and DSHARP opacities provide the best match to the observed properties.</description>

      <title>Is the "Dark Comet" 2005 VL1 the Venera 2 Spacecraft?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Seligman et. al. (2024) identified a population of near-Earth objects (NEOs) that exhibit statistically significant non-gravitational accelerations with no coma, and labeled them dark comets. Here, we show that one of these objects, 2005 VL1, was at closest approach to Earth in November 1965 when the Venera 2 spacecraft was launched to explore Venus. The observed H magnitude of 2005 VL1 is consistent with a high reflectance from the full surface of Venera 2 including its Solar panels. As known for Venera 2, 2005 VL1 arrived within a short distance from Venus in February 1966, a highly improbable coincidence (&lt; 1%) for the orbital phase of a near-Earth object that does not target a close approach to Venus. Indeed, 2005 VL1's orbital parameters are very similar to the reported values for Venera 2. Given the area-to-mass ratio of Venera 2, we show that 2005 VL1's non-gravitational acceleration and negligible transverse acceleration match the values expected from Solar radiation pressure.</description>

      <title>Can Hyperbolic Diffusion Help Explain Sharp Edges in the Gaps in Saturn's Rings?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore whether hyperbolic diffusion may help explain sharp edges in the gaps in Saturn's rings. Sharp edges are conventionally understood to be due to angular momentum flux reversal at gap edges. We do not dispute this finding, but investigate whether non-classical diffusion may amplify this finding. We explore a simple model of hyperbolic diffusion for the radial spread of material in planetary rings. The model arises by the introduction of a relaxation time in an advection equation for the radial diffusive angular momentum flux. We show that radial secular forcing, combined with a hyperbolic diffusion equation, leads to sharp gap edges, in which the density of ring material drops precipitously down to zero at some critical distance from the moon's orbit. Additionally, we show that our simple model can produce large ``spikes'' or ``horns'' in the density profile on either side of a ring gap, mirroring results of large N-body simulations. It remains to be seen how these results may be affected by the inclusion of the well-understood angular momentum flux reversal near tidally-induced gap edges.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Primordial Alignment II: Insights from Stellar Obliquity Measurements for Hot Jupiters in Compact Multiplanet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction of hot Jupiters have orbital axes misaligned with their host stars' spin axes. The large stellar obliquities of these giants have long been considered potential signatures of high-eccentricity migration, which is expected to clear out any nearby planetary companions. This scenario requires that only isolated hot Jupiters be spin-orbit misaligned while those with nearby companions, which must have more quiescent histories, maintain low-obliquity orbits, assuming they formed aligned within their primordial protoplanetary disks. Investigations of this stellar obliquity-companionship connection, however, have been severely limited by the lack of hot Jupiters found in compact multi-planet systems. Here we present the sky-projected stellar obliquity ($\lambda$) of a hot Jupiter with a nearby inner companion recently discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite: TOI-5143 c. Specifically, we utilize the Doppler shadow caused by the planet's transit, enabled by the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, to find that the planet is aligned with $\lambda=2.1 ^{+2.8}_{-2.7} \circ$. Of the exoplanets with RM measurements, TOI-5143 c becomes just the third hot Jupiter with a nearby companion, and is part of the 19th compact multi-planet single-star system, with an RM measurement. The spin-orbit alignment of these 19 systems provides strong support for primordial alignment, and thus implies that large obliquities are gained primarily due to post-disk dynamical interactions such as those inherent to high-eccentricity migration. As such, the observed spin-orbit alignment of hot Jupiters with nearby companions affirms that some fraction of these giants instead have quiescent origins.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Deep, Extended Kuiper Belt in the Galactic Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Roman Space Telescope survey to investigate fundamental properties of the distant solar system in the region of the Kuiper Belt where object characteristics and the size distribution are inaccessible from any other telescope. Our pointing is coincident with the search space accessible to NASA's New Horizons spacecraft meaning, that a discovered object sufficiently near the orbit of New Horizons would potentially be investigated by a close flyby. In addition, numerous objects expected to be discovered by this search can be observed in the distance by New Horizons allowing their surface properties and satellite systems to both be probed. As designed, this survey will discover and determine orbits for as many as 900 Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), providing a unique opportunity for ground-breaking Kuiper Belt science. It will simultaneously: (1) Probe and characterize the deep Kuiper Belt by identifying objects as small as a few km and taking our understanding of the size distribution to a new level. This has implications for understanding the the standard model (the Streaming Instability) of KBO formation and elucidating crater formation physics on these icy bodies. (2) Open KBO rotation studies, in particular of those objects with long rotation periods,(3) Discover and characterize KBO binaries at large distances, important because their duplicity offers information about object densities at these distant locations from the Sun. (4) Shed light on the cratering history of KBOs and improving the dating of the surfaces of Arrokoth, Pluto and Charon in addition to helping to place the 32 distant KBOs New Horizons has observed in context. This project also has synergies with transiting exoplanet studies due to the stellar density of our search fields. Coupled with our timing requirements it is sensitive to discovery of hot Jupiters and hot Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Abundance analysis of stars hosting gas-rich debris disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion from protoplanetary or debris disks can contaminate the stellar photosphere, which is detectable in stars with radiative envelopes due to relatively slower photospheric mixing. The contaminated photosphere reflects ongoing disk processes, detectable through stellar spectroscopy. We investigate the composition of six gas-rich debris disk-hosting A-type stars to understand possible links with their debris disk or earlier accretion stages. We used archival spectra to estimate the stellar parameters and abundances of our sample. We also estimated the stellar photospheric accretion contamination parameter, fph which indicates the fraction of accreting material on the stellar photosphere. The oxygen abundance in intermediate-mass stars decreases with age until the debris disk stage (&lt; 20 Myr). The downward trend could result from H2O ice accumulating in dust traps or the formation of hydrated asteroids in the protoplanetary disk, locking oxygen in solids and reducing its accretion onto the star. All stars have similar volatile abundances (C, O), but HD 110058 and HD 32297 show refractory depleted abundances. The near-zero fph values in the six stars suggest that any currently accreted gas would not overwhelm mixing in the photosphere and would not impact the observed composition. The refractory depleted abundances in HD 110058 and HD 32297 suggest residual, or even chronic, accretion contamination from their earlier protoplanetary stages when the accretion rates were about five orders of magnitude higher. For HD 110058, with the highest refractory depletion, we estimated a lower limit on its earlier protoplanetary accretion rate of 9 x 10^(-8) Msun/yr, similar to other Herbig stars and equal to the Herbig star - HD 100546. This supports our hypothesis that refractory depletion in HD 110058 originates from a prior phase of higher accretion of dust-poor material.</description>

      <title>Ab initio quantum dynamics as a scalable solution to the exoplanet opacity challenge: A case study of CO$_2$ in hydrogen atmosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions lie at the heart of our exploration of exoplanetary atmospheres. Interpreting data obtained by remote sensing is enabled by meticulous, time- and resource-consuming work aiming at deepening our understanding of such interactions (i.e., opacity models). Recently, Niraula et al. 2022 pointed out that due primarily to limitations on our modeling of broadening and far-wing behaviors, opacity models needed a timely update for exoplanet exploration in the JWST era, and thus argued for a scalable approach. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce an end-to-end solution from \textsl{ab initio} calculations to pressure broadening, and use a perturbation framework to identify the need for precision to a level of $\sim$10\%. We focus on the CO$_2$-H$_2$ system as CO$_2$ is a key absorption feature for exoplanet research (primarily in many gas giants) at $\sim$4.3$\mu$m as pressure-broadening parameters required for interpreting such observations remain sparse. We compute elastic and inelastic cross-sections for the collision of {ortho-}H$_2$~with CO$_2$, in the ground vibrational state, and at the coupled-channel fully converged level. For scattering energies above $\sim$20~cm$^{-1}$, moderate precision inter-molecular potentials are indistinguishable from high precision ones in cross-sections. Our calculations agree with the currently available measurement within 7\%, i.e., well beyond the precision requirements.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen transport in protoplanetary disks by ammonium salts: a possible origin of Jupiter's nitrogen enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric compositions preserve the history of planet formation processes. Jupiter has the remarkable feature of being uniformly enriched in various elements compared to the Sun, including highly volatile elements such as nitrogen and noble gases. Radial transport of volatile species by amorphous ice in the solar nebula is one mechanism that explains Jupiter's volatile enrichment, but the low entrapment efficiency of nitrogen into amorphous ice is an issue. We propose an alternative mechanism of delivering nitrogen to Jupiter: radial transport of semi-volatile ammonium salts in the solar nebula. Ammonium salts have been identified in 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and can potentially compensate for the comet's nitrogen depletion compared to the Sun. We simulate the radial transport and dissociation of ammonium salts carried by dust in a protoplanetary disk, followed by the accretion of the gas and NH$_3$ vapor by a protoplanet, as well as the delivery of nitrogen to the planetary atmosphere from the salt-containing planetary core that undergoes dilution. We find that when the dust contains 10-30 wt% ammonium salts, the production of NH$_3$ vapor in the inner disk (~ 3 au) by dissociated salts and the incorporation of the salt-derived NH$_3$ through core formation and subsequent gas accretion by the protoplanet result in a planetary nitrogen enrichment consistent with the observations of Jupiter. Ammonium salts may thus play a vital role in developing the atmospheric composition of planets forming in the inner disk. Combining our model with future observations of the bulk compositions and isotopes of comets and other primordial bodies will help to further elucidate the elemental transport to the gas giants and ice giants in the solar system.</description>

      <title>MARFA: an Effective Line-by-line Tool For Calculating Molecular Absorption in Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03418v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MARFA (Molecular atmospheric Absorption with Rapid and Flexible Analysis) -- an open-source line-by-line tool for calculating absorption coefficients and cross-sections in planetary atmospheres, particularly under conditions of uncertain spectroscopic data and missing continuum functions. With incorporated eleven-grid interpolation technique MARFA shows good performance in computation of far-wing contributions for large line cut-offs. The tool supports flexible parameterization, including line shape functions, wing corrections, user-defined atmospheric profiles, thus, facilitating rapid sensitivity studies for sparse datasets. Spectra are calculated at a high-resolution of about 5*10E-4 cm-1, optimized for infrared and visible spectral regions where HITRAN-formatted line data is available, yet adaptable to other datasets with available line parameters. Output is represented either in a form of binary lookup tables files, directly compatible with radiative transfer codes or in a human-readable format for data analysis and distribution. The MARFA tool is provided in two ways: through a web application accessible at marfa.app for onboarding and educational usage, and as an open-source code available in a public repository for advanced utilization, development and contributions.</description>

Abstract: The collision outcomes of dust aggregates in protoplanetary disks dictate how planetesimals form. Experimental and numerical studies have suggested that bouncing collisions occurring at low impact velocities may limit aggregate growth in the disks, but the conditions under which bouncing occurs have yet to be fully understood. In this study, we perform a suite of collision simulations of moderately compact dust aggregates with various impact velocities, aggregate radii, and filling factors ranging between 0.4 and 0.5. Unlike previous simulations, we generate compact aggregates by compressing more porous ones, mimicking the natural processes through which compact aggregates form. We find that the compressed aggregates bounce above a threshold mass, which decreases with impact velocity. The threshold mass scales with impact velocity as the $-4/3$ power, consistent with the findings of previous experiments. We also find that the threshold aggregate mass for bouncing depends strongly on filling factor, likely reflecting the strong filling-factor dependence of the compressive strength of compressed aggregates. Our energy analysis reveals that nearly 90\% of the initial impact energy is dissipated during the initial compression phase, and over 70\% of the remaining energy is dissipated during the subsequent stretching phase, regardless of whether the collision results in sticking or bouncing. Our results indicate that dust aggregates with a filling factor of 0.4 cease to grow beyond 100 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ as a result of the bouncing barrier.</description>
