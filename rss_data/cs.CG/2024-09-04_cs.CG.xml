      <title>The Price of Upwardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Not every directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying undirected graph is planar admits an upward planar drawing. We are interested in pushing the notion of upward drawings beyond planarity by considering upward $k$-planar drawings of DAGs in which the edges are monotonically increasing in a common direction and every edge is crossed at most $k$ times for some integer $k \ge 1$. We show that the number of crossings per edge in a monotone drawing is in general unbounded for the class of bipartite outerplanar, cubic, or bounded pathwidth DAGs. However, it is at most two for outerpaths and it is at most quadratic in the bandwidth in general. From the computational point of view, we prove that upward-$k$-planarity testing is NP-complete already for $k =1$ and even for restricted instances for which upward planarity testing is polynomial. On the positive side, we can decide in linear time whether a single-source DAG admits an upward $1$-planar drawing in which all vertices are incident to the outer face.</description>

      <title>Holes in Convex and Simple Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gons and holes in point sets have been extensively studied in the literature. For simple drawings of the complete graph a generalization of the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres theorem is known and empty triangles have been investigated. We introduce a notion of $k$-holes for simple drawings and study their existence with respect to the convexity hierarchy. We present a family of simple drawings without 4-holes and prove a generalization of Gerken's empty hexagon theorem for convex drawings. A crucial intermediate step will be the structural investigation of pseudolinear subdrawings in convex~drawings.</description>

      <title>Weakly Leveled Planarity with Bounded Span</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies planar drawings of graphs in which each vertex is represented as a point along a sequence of horizontal lines, called levels, and each edge is either a horizontal segment or a strictly $y$-monotone curve. A graph is $s$-span weakly leveled planar if it admits such a drawing where the edges have span at most $s$; the span of an edge is the number of levels it touches minus one. We investigate the problem of computing $s$-span weakly leveled planar drawings from both the computational and the combinatorial perspectives. We prove the problem to be para-NP-hard with respect to its natural parameter $s$ and investigate its complexity with respect to widely used structural parameters. We show the existence of a polynomial-size kernel with respect to vertex cover number and prove that the problem is FPT when parameterized by treedepth. We also present upper and lower bounds on the span for various graph classes.
  Notably, we show that cycle trees, a family of $2$-outerplanar graphs generalizing Halin graphs, are $\Theta(\log n)$-span weakly leveled planar and $4$-span weakly leveled planar when $3$-connected. As a byproduct of these combinatorial results, we obtain improved bounds on the edge-length ratio of the graph families under consideration.</description>

      <title>Curvy: A Parametric Cross-section based Surface Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach for reconstructing shape point clouds using planar sparse cross-sections with the help of generative modeling. We present unique challenges pertaining to the representation and reconstruction in this problem setting. Most methods in the classical literature lack the ability to generalize based on object class and employ complex mathematical machinery to reconstruct reliable surfaces. We present a simple learnable approach to generate a large number of points from a small number of input cross-sections over a large dataset. We use a compact parametric polyline representation using adaptive splitting to represent the cross-sections and perform learning using a Graph Neural Network to reconstruct the underlying shape in an adaptive manner reducing the dependence on the number of cross-sections provided.</description>

      <title>Intersection Graphs with and without Product Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph class $\mathcal{G}$ admits product structure if there exists a constant $k$ such that every $G \in \mathcal{G}$ is a subgraph of $H \boxtimes P$ for a path $P$ and some graph $H$ of treewidth $k$. Famously, the class of planar graphs, as well as many beyond-planar graph classes are known to admit product structure. However, we have only few tools to prove the absence of product structure, and hence know of only a few interesting examples of classes. Motivated by the transition between product structure and no product structure, we investigate subclasses of intersection graphs in the plane (e.g., disk intersection graphs) and present necessary and sufficient conditions for these to admit product structure. Specifically, for a set $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ (e.g., a disk) and a real number $\alpha \in [0,1]$, we consider intersection graphs of $\alpha$-free homothetic copies of $S$. That is, each vertex $v$ is a homothetic copy of $S$ of which at least an $\alpha$-portion is not covered by other vertices, and there is an edge between $u$ and $v$ if and only if $u \cap v \neq \emptyset$. For $\alpha = 1$ we have contact graphs, which are in most cases planar, and hence admit product structure. For $\alpha = 0$ we have (among others) all complete graphs, and hence no product structure. In general, there is a threshold value $\alpha^*(S) \in [0,1]$ such that $\alpha$-free homothetic copies of $S$ admit product structure for all $\alpha &gt; \alpha^*(S)$ and do not admit product structure for all $\alpha &lt; \alpha^*(S)$. We show for a large family of sets $S$, including all triangles and all trapezoids, that it holds $\alpha^*(S) = 1$, i.e., we have no product structure, except for the contact graphs (when $\alpha= 1$). For other sets $S$, including regular $n$-gons for infinitely many values of $n$, we show that $0 &lt; \alpha^*(S) &lt; 1$ by proving upper and lower bounds.</description>

Abstract: A packing of disks in the plane is a set of disks with disjoint interiors. This paper is a survey of some open questions about such packings. It is organized into five themes: compacity, conjugacy, density, uniformity and computability.</description>

      <title>Zarankiewicz's problem via $\epsilon$-t-nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Zarankiewicz's problem asks for the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices which does not contain the complete bipartite graph $K_{t,t}$. In one of the cornerstones of extremal graph theory, K\H{o}v\'ari S\'os and Tur\'an proved an upper bound of $O(n^{2-\frac{1}{t}})$. In a celebrated result, Fox et al. obtained an improved bound of $O(n^{2-\frac{1}{d}})$ for graphs of VC-dimension $d$ (where $d&lt;t$). Basit, Chernikov, Starchenko, Tao and Tran improved the bound for the case of semilinear graphs. At SODA'23, Chan and Har-Peled further improved Basit et al.'s bounds and presented (quasi-)linear upper bounds for several classes of geometrically-defined incidence graphs, including a bound of $O(n \log \log n)$ for the incidence graph of points and pseudo-discs in the plane.
  In this paper we present a new approach to Zarankiewicz's problem, via $\epsilon$-t-nets - a recently introduced generalization of the classical notion of $\epsilon$-nets. We show that the existence of `small'-sized $\epsilon$-t-nets implies upper bounds for Zarankiewicz's problem. Using the new approach, we obtain a sharp bound of $O(n)$ for the intersection graph of two families of pseudo-discs, thus both improving and generalizing the result of Chan and Har-Peled from incidence graphs to intersection graphs. We also obtain a short proof of the $O(n^{2-\frac{1}{d}})$ bound of Fox et al., and show improved bounds for several other classes of geometric intersection graphs, including a sharp $O(n\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$ bound for the intersection graph of two families of axis-parallel rectangles.</description>
