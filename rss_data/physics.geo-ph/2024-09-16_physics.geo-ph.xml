      <title>Deep learning-based shot-domain seismic deblending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To streamline fast-track processing of large data volumes, we have developed a deep learning approach to deblend seismic data in the shot domain based on a practical strategy for generating high-quality training data along with a list of data conditioning techniques to improve performance of the data-driven model. We make use of unblended shot gathers acquired at the end of each sail line, to which the access requires no additional time or labor costs beyond the blended acquisition. By manually blending these data we obtain training data with good control of the ground truth and fully adapted to the given survey. Furthermore, we train a deep neural network using multi-channel inputs that include adjacent blended shot gathers as additional channels. The prediction of the blending noise is added in as a related and auxiliary task with the main task of the network being the prediction of the primary-source events. Blending noise in the ground truth is scaled down during the training and validation process due to its excessively strong amplitudes. As part of the process, the to-be-deblended shot gathers are aligned by the blending noise. Implementation on field blended-by-acquisition data demonstrates that introducing the suggested data conditioning steps can considerably reduce the leakage of primary-source events in the deep part of the blended section. The complete proposed approach performs almost as well as a conventional algorithm in the shallow section and shows great advantage in efficiency. It performs slightly worse for larger traveltimes, but still removes the blending noise efficiently.</description>

      <title>Using Convolutional Neural Networks for Denoising and Deblending of Marine Seismic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processing marine seismic data is computationally demanding and consists of multiple time-consuming steps. Neural network based processing can, in theory, significantly reduce processing time and has the potential to change the way seismic processing is done. In this paper we are using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to remove seismic interference noise and to deblend seismic data. To train such networks, a significant amount of computational memory is needed since a single shot gather consists of more than 106 data samples. Preliminary results are promising both for denoising and deblending. However, we also observed that the results are affected by the signal-to-noise ratio (SnR). Moving to common channel domain is a way of breaking the coherency of the noise while also reducing the input volume size. This makes it easier for the network to distinguish between signal and noise. It also increases the efficiency of the GPU memory usage by enabling better utilization of multi core processing. Deblending in common channel domain with the use of a CNN yields relatively good results and is an improvement compared to shot domain.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Rossby number gap in rapidly rotating thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geophysical and astrophysical fluid flows are typically buoyantly driven and are strongly constrained by planetary rotation at large scales. Rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRRBC) provides a paradigm for direct numerical simulations (DNS) and laboratory studies of such flows, but the accessible parameter space remains restricted to moderately fast rotation (Ekman numbers $\rm Ek \gtrsim 10^{-8}$), while realistic $\rm Ek$ for astro-/geophysical applications are significantly smaller. Reduced equations of motion, the non-hydrostatic quasi-geostrophic equations describing the leading-order behavior in the limit of rapid rotation ($\rm Ek \to 0$) cannot capture finite rotation effects, leaving the physically most relevant part of parameter space with small but finite $\rm Ek$ currently inaccessible. Here, we introduce the rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (RiNSE), a reformulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $\rm Ek\to 0$. We provide the first full DNS of RRRBC at unprecedented rotation strengths down to $\rm Ek=10^{-15}$ and below and show that the RiNSE converge to the asymptotically reduced equations.</description>

      <title>Is there a genetic relationship between chondrules and matrix?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chondritic components such as chondrules and matrix are the key time capsules that can help us understand the evolution and dynamics of the protoplanetary disk from which the Solar System originated. Knowledge of where and how these components formed and to what extent they were transported in the gaseous disk provides major constraints to astrophysical models that investigate planet formation. Here, we explore whether chondrules and matrix are genetically related to each other and formed from single reservoirs per chondrite group or if every chondrite represents a unique proportion of components transported from a small number of formation reservoirs in the disk. These static versus dynamic disk interpretations of cosmochemical data have profound implications for the accretion history of the planets in the Solar System. To fully understand the relationship between chondrules and matrix and their potential complementarity, we dive into the petrological nature and origin of matrix, the chemical and isotopic compositions of chondrules and matrix and evaluate these data considering the effect of secondary alteration observed in chondrites and the potential complexity of chondrule formation. Even though we, the authors, have used different datasets and arrived at differing interpretations of chondrule-matrix relationships in the past, this review provides clarity on the existing data and has given us new directions towards future research that can resolve the complementarity debate.</description>

      <title>Toward Routing River Water in Land Surface Models with Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is playing an increasing role in hydrology, supplementing or replacing physics-based models. One notable example is the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting streamflow given observed precipitation and geographic characteristics. Training of such a model over the continental United States (CONUS) demonstrated that a single set of model parameters can be used across independent catchments, and that RNNs can outperform physics-based models. In this work, we take a next step and study the performance of RNNs for river routing in land surface models (LSMs). Instead of observed precipitation, the LSM-RNN uses instantaneous runoff calculated from physics-based models as an input. We train the model with data from river basins spanning the globe and test it in streamflow hindcasts. The model demonstrates skill at generalization across basins (predicting streamflow in catchments not used in training) and across time (predicting streamflow during years not used in training). We compare the predictions from the LSM-RNN to an existing physics-based model calibrated with a similar dataset and find that the LSM-RNN outperforms the physics based model. Our results show that RNNs are effective for global streamflow prediction from runoff inputs and motivate the development of complete routing models that can capture nested sub-basis connections.</description>
