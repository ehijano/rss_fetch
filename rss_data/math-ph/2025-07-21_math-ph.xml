      <title>Moments and the Basic Equilibrium Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the classical theory of moments of configurations of weighted points with a focus on systems with an identically vanishing first moment. The latter condition provides equations for equilibrium configurations of systems of interacting particles under the sole condition that interactions are pairwise and along the line determined by each pair of particles. Complying external forces are admitted, so some dynamical equilibrium configurations, such as relative equilibria, may be treated with our approach. Moments provide a unified framework for equilibrium problems in arbitrary dimensions. The equilibrium equations are homogeneous, of relatively low degree, invariant by oriented isometries (for interactions depending only on mutual distances), and are obtained through simple algebraic procedures requiring neither reduction by isometries nor a variational principle for their determination. Our equations include the renowned sets of n-body central configuration equations by O. Dziobek, and by A. Albouy and A. Chenciner. These equations are extended to a rather broad class of equilibrium problems, and several new sets of equilibrium equations are introduced. We also apply moments to establish a theory of constraints for mutual distances of configurations of fixed dimension and of co-spherical configurations, thus re-obtaining and adding to classical results by A. Cayley, among others.</description>

      <title>Liquid Drop Model for Nuclear Matter in the Low Density Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the liquid drop model with a positive background density in the thermodynamic limit. We prove a two-term asymptotics for the ground state energy per unit volume in the dilute limit. Our proof justifies the expectation that optimal configurations consist of droplets of unit size that arrange themselves according to minimizers for the Jellium problem for point particles. In particular, we provide the first rigorous derivation of what is known as the gnocchi phase in astrophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the tensor product of two unitary irreducible representations, as well as the tensor product of a unitary irreducible representation with a finite-dimensional one, and determine the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Using von Neumann's projection operator method, we obtain an explicit representation of these coefficients, which allows us to express them as symmetric q-hypergeometric series. Finally, by leveraging the properties of the q-hypergeometric function, we derive several properties of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, including a number of new results, in a unified and straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>Physical models realizing the transformer architecture of large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 (cf.\cite{VSP2017}) marked the most striking advancement in natural language processing. The transformer is a model architecture relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. However, we believe there is a gap in our theoretical understanding of what the transformer is, and why it works physically. In this paper, from a physical perspective on modern chips, we construct physical models in the Fock space over the Hilbert space of tokens realizing large language models based on a transformer architecture as open quantum systems. Our physical models underlie the transformer architecture for large language models.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster algorithms for Potts lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo algorithms, like the Swendsen-Wang and invaded-cluster, sample the Ising and Potts models asymptotically faster than single-spin Glauber dynamics do. Here, we generalize both algorithms to sample Potts lattice gauge theory by way of a $2$-dimensional cellular representation called the plaquette random-cluster model. The invaded-cluster algorithm targets Potts lattice gauge theory at criticality by implementing a stopping condition defined in terms of homological percolation, the emergence of spanning surfaces on the torus. Simulations for $\mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_3$ lattice gauge theories on the cubical $4$-dimensional torus indicate that both generalized algorithms exhibit much faster autocorrelation decay than single-spin dynamics and allow for efficient sampling on $4$-dimensional tori of linear scale at least $40$.</description>

      <title>Loss-Complexity Landscape and Model Structure Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function $h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.</description>

      <title>Solving wave equation problems on D-Wave quantum annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation in several scenarios using the quantum annealer provided by the D-Wave systems within a pseudospectral scheme, where its solution is encoded into certain set of suitable basis functions. We assess the performance of different strategies of encoding based on algebraic arguments and the adiabatic condition, and benchmark these against the classical heuristic simulating annealing algorithm. In particular, we compute the minimum energy gap, the so-called dynamic range and the mean squared error to assess the numerical stability, consistency and accuracy of the solutions returned by each strategy. Our work stresses out the importance of developing custom embedded techniques ensuring well-conditioned algebraic systems. In particular, we find out that encoding strategies retrieving algebraic systems exhibiting full-rank and small dynamic ranges enhance the performance of the quantum annealer even under polychromatic driving and for intricate initial conditions. We further discuss the prospect of developing hybrid quantum-classical schemes enable to meet suitable algebraic and adiabatic conditions simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Error exponents for tripartite-to-bipartite entanglement transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider distillation of ebits between a specified pair of subsystems from pure tripartite states by local operations and classical communication. It is known that, allowing an asymptotically vanishing error, the maximal rate is the minimum of the von Neumann entropies of the two corresponding marginals, and under asymptotic stochastic local operations and classical communication the maximal rate is given by a minimization over a one-parameter family of entanglement measures. In this paper, we determine the direct and strong converse error exponents, and the optimal rate for deterministic transformations.</description>

      <title>Jordanian spin chains for twisted strings in $AdS_5\times S^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the integrable spin chain formulation of Jordanian deformations of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, realised via Drinfel'd twists. Among these models, we first identify a unique supergravity deformation confined to an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ sector and with constant dilaton. We then develop a general framework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit map to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non compact $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan generator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods. Instead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral problem based on a residual root generator both in the thermodynamic limit and for short chains. We find that the ground state is non-trivially deformed, and is in agreement with the classical string result, while our analysis does not capture higher-spin excited states. We also study the asymptotics of the associated $Q$-system, which is well-behaved and compatible with the boundary-twist. While a full understanding of the spectrum remains open, our work provides concrete steps toward a spectral description of non-abelian twisted integrable models.</description>

      <title>Strong Convergence of Multiplicative Brownian Motions on the General Linear Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the family of multiplicative Brownian motions $G_{\lambda,\tau}$ on the general linear group introduced by Driver-Hall-Kemp. They are parametrized by the real variance $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$ and the complex covariance $\tau \in \mathbb{C}$ of the underlying elliptic Brownian motion. We show the almost sure strong convergence of the finite-dimensional marginals of $G_{\lambda,\tau}$ to the corresponding free multiplicative Brownian motion introduced by Hall-Ho: as the dimension tends to infinity, not only does the noncommutative distribution converge almost surely, but the operator norm does as well. This result generalizes the work of Collins-Dahlqvist-Kemp for the special case $(\lambda,\tau)=(1,0)$ which corresponds to the Brownian motion on the unitary group. Actually, this strong convergence remains valid when the family of multiplicative Brownian motions $G_{\lambda,\tau}$ is considered alongside a family of strongly converging deterministic matrices.</description>

      <title>Individual-Based Foundation of SIR-Type Epidemic Models: mean-field limit and large time behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a kinetic framework for modeling the time evolution of the statistical distributions of the population densities in the three compartments of susceptible, infectious, and recovered individuals, under epidemic spreading driven by susceptible-infectious interactions. The model is based on a system of Boltzmann-type equations describing binary interactions between susceptible and infectious individuals, supplemented with linear redistribution operators that account for recovery and reinfection dynamics. The mean values of the kinetic system recover a SIR-type model with reinfection, where the macroscopic parameters are explicitly derived from the underlying microscopic interaction rules. In the grazing collision regime, the Boltzmann system can be approximated by a system of coupled Fokker-Planck equations. This limit allows for a more tractable analysis of the dynamics, including the large-time behavior of the population densities. In this context, we rigorously prove the convergence to equilibrium of the resulting mean-field system in a suitable Sobolev space by means of the so-called energy distance. The analysis reveals the dissipative structure of the dynamics and the role of the interaction terms in driving the system toward a stable equilibrium configuration. These results provide a multi-scale perspective connecting kinetic theory with classical epidemic models.</description>

      <title>Large deviations at the edge for 1D gases and tridiagonal random matrices at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model for a gas of $N$ confined particles subject to a two-body repulsive interaction, namely the one-dimensional log or Riesz gas. We are interested in the so-called \textit{high temperature} regime, \textit{ie} where the inverse temperature $\beta_N$ scales as $N\beta_N\rightarrow2P&gt;0$. We establish, in the log case, a large deviation (LD) principle and moderate deviations estimates for the largest particle $x_\mathrm{max}$ when appropriately rescaled . Our result is an extension of [Ben-Arous, Dembo, Guionnet 2001] and [Pakzad 2020 where such estimates were shown for the largest particle of the $\beta$-ensemble respectively at fixed $\beta_N=\beta&gt;0$ and $\beta_N\gg N^{-1}$. We show that the corresponding rate function is the same as in the case of iid particles. We also provide LD estimates in the Riesz case.
  Additionally, we consider related models of symmetric tridiagonal random matrices with independent entries having Gaussian tails; for which we establish the LD principle for the top eigenvalue. In a certain specialization of the entries, we recover the result for the largest particle of the log-gas. We show that LD are created by a few entries taking abnormally large values.</description>

      <title>Spherical and Planar Ball Bearings -- a Study of Integrable Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the nonholonomic systems of $n$ homogeneous balls $\mathbf B_1,\dots,\mathbf B_n$ with the same radius $r$ that are rolling without slipping about a fixed sphere $\mathbf S_0$ with center $O$ and radius $R$. In addition, it is assumed that a dynamically nonsymmetric sphere $\mathbf S$ with the center that coincides with the center $O$ of the fixed sphere $\mathbf S_0$ rolls without slipping in contact to the moving balls $\mathbf B_1,\dots,\mathbf B_n$. The problem is considered in four different configurations. We derive the equations of motion and prove that these systems possess an invariant measure. As the main result, for $n=1$ we found two cases that are integrable in quadratures according to the Euler-Jacobi theorem. The obtained integrable nonholonomic models are natural extensions of the well-known Chaplygin ball integrable problems. Further, we explicitly integrate the planar problem consisting of $n$ homogeneous balls of the same radius, but with different masses, that roll without slipping over a fixed plane $\Sigma_0$ with a plane $\Sigma$ that moves without slipping over these balls.</description>

Abstract: We consider a Bose gas on the unit torus at zero temperature in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime, known to perform Bose-Einstein condensation: a macroscopic fraction of the bosons occupy the same quantum state, called condensate. We study the Bose gas' quantum depletion, that is the number of bosons outside the condensate, and derive an explicit asymptotic formula of its generating function. Moreover, we prove an upper bound for the tails of the quantum depletion.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This textbook introduces the basic concepts of the theory of causal fermion systems, a recent approach to the description of fundamental physics. The theory yields quantum mechanics, general relativity and quantum field theory as limiting cases and is therefore a candidate for a unified physical theory. From the mathematical perspective, causal fermion systems provide a general framework for describing and analyzing non-smooth geometries and "quantum geometries." The dynamics is described by a novel variational principle, the causal action principle.
  The book includes a detailed summary of the mathematical and physical preliminaries. It explains the physical concepts behind the causal fermion system approach from the basics. Moreover, all the mathematical objects and structures are introduced step by step. The mathematical methods used for the analysis of causal fermion systems and the causal action principle are introduced in depth. Many examples and applications are worked out.
  The textbook is addressed to master and graduate students in mathematics or physics. Furthermore, it serves as a reference work for researchers working in the field.</description>

      <title>Fermionic quantum walkers coupled to a bosonic reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the discrete-time dynamics of a model of non-interacting fermions coupled to an infinite reservoir formed by a bosonic quantum walk on ${\mathbb Z}$. This dynamics consists of consecutive applications of free evolutions of the fermions and bosons followed by a local coupling between them. The unitary operator implementing this coupling accounts for energy exchanges between the system and reservoir while it preserves the number of fermions. The free fermion evolution is given by a second-quantized single-particle unitary operator satisfying some genericity assumptions. The free boson evolution is given by the second-quantized shift operator on ${\mathbb Z}$. We derive explicitly the Heisenberg dynamics of fermionic observables and obtain a systematic expansion in the large-coupling regime, which we control by using spectral methods. We also prove that the reduced state of the fermions converges in the large-time limit to a mixture of infinite-temperature Gibbs states in each particle sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a theory of hyperelliptic functions based on multidimensional sigma functions is developed and explicit formulas for hyperelliptic solutions to the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations KP-I and KP-II are obtained. The long-standing problem of describing the dependence of these solutions on the variation of the coefficients of the defining equation of a hyperelliptic curve, which are integrals of the equations, is solved.</description>

      <title>Large time cumulants of the KPZ equation on an interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation on the interval $[0,L]$ with Neumann type boundary conditions and boundary parameters $u,v$. We show that the $k$-th order cumulant of the height behaves as $c_k(L,u,v)\, t$ in the large time limit $t \to +\infty$, and we compute the coefficients $c_k(L,u,v)$. We obtain an expression for the upper tail large deviation function of the height. We also consider the limit of large $L$, with $u=\tilde u/\sqrt{L}$, $u=\tilde v/\sqrt{L}$, which should give the same quantities for the two parameter family $(\tilde u, \tilde v)$ KPZ fixed point on the interval. We employ two complementary methods. On the one hand we adapt to the interval the replica Bethe ansatz method pioneered by Brunet and Derrida for the periodic case. On the other hand, we perform a scaling limit using previous results available for the open ASEP. The latter method allows to express the cumulants of the KPZ equation in terms a functional equation involving an integral operator.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase transition for the homogeneous multi-component Curie-Weiss-Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the homogeneous multi-component Curie-Weiss-Potts model with $q \geq 3$ spins. The model is defined on the complete graph $K_{Nm}$, whose vertex set is equally partitioned into $m$ components of size $N$. For a configuration $\sigma: \{1, \cdots, Nm\} \to \{1, \cdots, q\},$ the Gibbs measure is defined by $$
  \mu_{N,\beta}(\sigma) =\frac{1}{Z_{N,\beta}} \exp\Big(\frac{\beta}{N} \sum_{v,w=1}^{Nm}\mathcal{J}(v,w)\, \mathbb{1}_{\{\sigma(v)=\sigma(w)\}}\Big), $$ where $Z_{N, \beta}$ is a normalizing constant, and $\beta&gt;0$ is the inverse temperature parameter. The interaction coefficients are $ \mathcal{J}(v, w) = \frac{J}{1 + (m-1) \lambda}$, for $v, w$ in the same component, and $\mathcal{J}(v, w) = \frac{J \lambda}{1 + (m-1)\lambda}$ for $v, w$ in the different components, where $\lambda \in (0, 1)$ is the relative strength of inter-component interaction to intra-component interaction, and $J&gt;0$ is the effective interaction strength. We identify a dynamical phase transition at the critical inverse temperature $\beta_{\operatorname{cr}} = \beta_{s}(q)/J$, where $\beta_{s}(q)$ is maximal inverse temperature guaranteeing a unique critical point of the free energy in the Curie-Weiss-Potts model arXiv:1204.4503. By extending the aggregate path method arXiv:1312.6728 to our multi-component setting, we prove $O(N \log N)$ mixing time in the high-temperature regime $\beta&lt;\beta_{s}(q)/J.$ In the low-temperature regime $\beta &gt; \beta_{s}(q)/J,$ we further show exponential mixing time by a metastability. This is the first result for the dynamical phase transition in the multi-component Potts model.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of a non-Hermitian $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetric Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the exact solution of a non-Hermitian $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetric isotropic Heisenberg spin chain with integrable boundary fields. We find that the system exhibits two types of phases we refer to as $A$ and $B$ phases. In the $B$ type phase, the $\mathscr{PT}$- symmetry remains unbroken and it consists of eigenstates with only real energies, whereas the $A$ type phase contains a $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry broken sector comprised of eigenstates with only complex energies and a sector of unbroken $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry with eigenstates of real energies. The $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry broken sector consists of pairs of eigenstates whose energies are complex conjugates of each other. The existence of two sectors in the $A$ type phase is associated with the exponentially localized bound states at the edges with complex energies which are described by boundary strings. We find that both $A$ and $B$ type phases can be further divided into sub-phases which exhibit different ground states. We also compute the bound state wavefunction in one magnon sector and find that as the imaginary value of the boundary parameter is increased, the exponentially localized wavefunction broadens thereby protruding more into the bulk, which indicates that exponentially localized bound states may not be stabilized for large imaginary values of the boundary parameter.</description>

Abstract: This paper examines the Maxwell system of electrodynamics within the framework of distributions. A primary objective is to establish boundary conditions for fields at interfaces when the charge and current densities are measures localized on the interface. From this analysis, the paper presents a derivation of the generalized Snell's law, along with formulas for the amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves in terms of the incident amplitude.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lagrangian Multiforms for ABS Equations II: Tetrahedron and Octahedron Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16845v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present four types of discrete Lagrangian 2-form associated to the integrable quad equations of the ABS list. These include the triangle Lagrangian that has traditionally been used in the Lagrangian multiform description of ABS equations, the trident Lagrangian that was central to Part I of this paper, and two Lagrangians that have not been studied in the multiform setting. Two of the Lagrangian 2-forms have the quad equations, or a system equivalent to the quad equations, as their Euler-Lagrange equations, and one produces the tetrahedron equations. This is in contrast to the triangle Lagrangian 2-form, which produces equations that are weaker than the quad equations (they are equivalent to two octahedron equations). We use relations between the Lagrangian 2-forms to prove that the system of quad equations is equivalent to the combined system of tetrahedron and octahedron equations. Furthermore, for each of the Lagrangian 2-forms, we study the double zero property of the exterior derivative. In particular, this gives a possible variational interpretation to the octahedron equations.</description>

      <title>Kondo overscreening in the presence of superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a model describing a system where the superconductivity competes with the overscreened Kondo effect. The model consists of a single spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity at the edge of a quantum wire where spin$-1$ bulk fermions interact attractively, generating a (superconducting) mass gap. The competition between the Kondo screening and the superconductivity leads to a rich phase structure. We find that for strong Kondo coupling, there is a regime of phase space where the Kondo phase is stable with the impurity \textit{overscreened} by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and a Kondo scale is dynamically generated. When the bulk and boundary interaction strength are comparable, we find that a midgap state appears in the spectrum and screens the impurity, while in the ground state, the impurity is unscreened. This midgap state is akin to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states that exist in the entire phase space in the BCS superconductor. Moreover, when the bulk superconducting interaction strength is stronger than the boundary Kondo interaction strength, the impurity can no longer be screened. Further, between the Kondo and YSR phases, we find a novel phase where, while the Kondo cloud overscreens the impurity, a boundary excitation exists that has vanishing energy in the thermodynamic limit. Similar phase diagrams that result from competition between different mechanisms were found for other models, too: the dissipative Kondo system, where dissipation competes with screening; the Kondo impurity coupled to spin-1/2 attractively interacting fermions where condensation competes with screening; and the XXX-Kondo model, where the lattice cutoff and the bulk spin interaction compete with screening.</description>

      <title>Generalized Li\'enard systems and isochronous connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore some classical and quantum aspects of the nonlinear Li\'enard equation $\ddot{x} + k x \dot{x} + \omega^2 x + (k^2/9) x^3 = 0$, where $x=x(t)$ is a real variable and $k, \omega \in \mathbb{R}$. We demonstrate that such an equation could be derived from an equation of the Levinson-Smith kind which is of the form $\ddot{z} + J(z) \dot{z}^2 + F(z) \dot{z} + G(z) = 0$, where $z=z(t)$ is a real variable and $\{J(z), F(z), G(z)\}$ are suitable functions to be specified. It can further be mapped to the harmonic oscillator by making use of a nonlocal transformation, establishing its isochronicity. Computations employing the Jacobi last multiplier reveal that the system exhibits a bi-Hamiltonian character, i.e., there are two distinct types of Hamiltonians describing the system. For each of these, we perform a canonical quantization in the momentum representation and explore the possibility of bound states. While one of the Hamiltonians is seen to exhibit an equispaced spectrum with an infinite tower of states, the other one exhibits branching but can be solved exactly in closed form for certain choices of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforced minimal entanglement and correlation in quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry, entanglement and correlation is an interesting and important topic in quantum many-body physics. Within the framework of matrix product states, in this paper we study the minimal entanglement and correlation enforced by the $SO(3)$ spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry in a quantum spin-$J$ chain, with $J$ a positive integer. When neither symmetry is spontaneously broken, for a sufficiently long segment in a sufficiently large closed chain, we find that the minimal R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropy compatible with these symmetries is $\min\{ -\frac{2}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), 2\ln(J+1) \}$, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$. In an infinitely long open chain with such symmetries, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$ the minimal R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropy of half of the system is $\min\{ -\frac{1}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), \ln(J+1) \}$. When $\alpha\rightarrow 1$, these lower bounds give the symmetry-enforced minimal von Neumann entropies in these setups. Moreover, we show that no state in a quantum spin-$J$ chain with these symmetries can have a vanishing correlation length. Interestingly, the states with the minimal entanglement may not be a state with the minimal correlation length.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lagrangian Multiforms for ABS Equations I: Quad Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete Lagrangian multiform theory is a variational perspective on lattice equations that are integrable in the sense of multidimensional consistency. The Lagrangian multiforms for the equations of the ABS classification formed the start of this theory, but the Lagrangian multiforms that are usually considered in this context produce equations that are slightly weaker than the ABS equations. In this work, we present alternative Lagrangian multiforms that have Euler-Lagrange equations equivalent to the ABS equations. In addition, the treatment of the ABS Lagrangian multiforms in the existing literature fails to acknowledge that the complex functions in their definitions have branch cuts. The choice of branch affects both the existence of an additive three-leg form for the ABS equations and the closure property of the Lagrangian multiforms. We give counterexamples for both these properties, but we recover them by including integer-valued fields, related to the branch choices, in the action sums.</description>

      <title>Entropy functionals and equilibrium states in mixed quantum-classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the 2D Plasma-Vacuum Interface Problems for Ideal Incompressible MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript concerns the stability conditions for the well-posedness of the two-dimensional plasma-vacuum interface problems for ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, which describe the dynamics of conducting perfect fluids in a vacuum region under the influence of magnetic fields. Due to the counterexamples constructed by C. Hao and the second author [Comm. Math. Phys. 376 (2020), 259-286], the plasma-vacuum problems violating the Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition and without surface tension are believed to be highly unstable or even ill-posed. However, based on a geometric perspective, we demonstrate that, although the initial data provided therein are ill-posed in the Lagrangian framework characterizing the regularity of flow maps, plasma-vacuum problems with such initial data can still be stable/well-posed in the Eulerian setting without involving flow maps, under the hypothesis that the total magnetic fields are non-degenerate on the free boundary. This discloses the essential difference between the Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks of MHD free boundary problems and the stabilizing effect of the magnetic field. We also consider the surface tension effect and establish the local well-posedness theories in standard Sobolev spaces in this case. Furthermore, under either the non-degeneracy assumption on magnetic fields or the Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition on the effective pressure, we prove vanishing surface tension limits. These results indicate that both capillary forces and non-degenerate tangential magnetic fields can stabilize the motion of the plasma-vacuum interface, and the stabilizing effect of surface tension is stronger than that of the tangential magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum Framework for Simulating Linear PDEs with Robin Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an explicit, oracle-free quantum framework for numerically simulating general linear partial differential equations (PDEs), extending previous work to incorporate (a) Robin boundary conditions - which include Neumann and Dirichlet conditions as special cases - (b) inhomogeneous terms, and (c) variable coefficients in space and time. Our approach begins with a general finite-difference discretization and applies the Schrodingerisation technique to transform the resulting system into one that admits unitary quantum evolution, enabling quantum simulation.
  For the Schrodinger equation corresponding to the discretized PDE, we construct an efficient block-encoding of the Hamiltonian $H$ that scales polylogarithmically with the number of grid points $N$. This encoding is compatible with quantum signal processing and allows for the implementation of the evolution operator $e^{-iHt}$. The oracle-free nature of our method permits complexity to be measured in fundamental gate units-namely, CNOT gates and single-qubit rotations-bypassing the inefficiencies of oracle queries. Consequently, the overall algorithm scales polynomially with $N$ and linearly with the spatial dimension $d$, achieving a polynomial speedup in $N$ and an exponential advantage in $d$, thereby mitigating the classical curse of dimensionality. The validity and efficiency of the proposed approach are further substantiated by numerical simulations.
  By explicitly defining the quantum operations and quantifying their resource requirements, our approach offers a practical alternative for numerically solving PDEs, distinct from others that rely on oracle queries and purely asymptotic scaling methods.</description>

      <title>Complete Minimal Form Factors for Irrelevant Deformations of Integrable Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to compute the minimal form factors of diagonal integrable field theories perturbed by generalized $T \bar{T}$ perturbations. Building on existing results by the same authors, these MFFs are constructed in such a way as not to allow for any free parameters, an issue that plagued previous solutions. The MFFs are derived from a generalization of the standard integral representation which has been used since the birth of the form factor bootstrap program. Their asymptotics is characterized by exponential decay at large rapidities. By computing higher particle form factors, we find that any natural higher-particle solutions involve the cancellation of parts of the newly found MFF. We conclude that the assumption that the form factor equations, particularly the kinematic residue equation, remain unchanged in the presence of $T \bar{T}$ perturbations, is too strong. There is a trade-off between having MFFs satisfying desirable analyticity and asymptotic properties and finding analytic solutions to the form factor equations, which is likely solved by nontrivial changes to the form factor equations, especially those where locality or semilocality of fields are essential assumptions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spin-spin correlators weighted by fermion number measurements with low rapidity threshold in the 2D Ising free-fermion QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the work, we study the averaged number of massive fermions above a low rapidity threshold $Y$, underlying the form-factor expansions of the spin-spin two-point correlators at an Euclidean distance $r$, in the 2D Ising QFT at the free massive fermion point. Despite the on-shell freeness, the spin operators are still far away from being Gaussian, and create particles in the asymptotic states with complicated correlations. We show how the number observables can still be incorporated into the integrable Sinh-Gordon/Painleve-III framework and controlled by linear differential equations with two variables $(r,Y)$. We show how the differential equations and the information of two crucial scaling functions arising in the $r\rightarrow 0$, $e^{Y}r={\cal O}(1)$ scaling limit, can be combined to fully determine the small-$r$ asymptotics of the observables, in the $\lambda$-extended form. The scaling functions, on the other hand, are analyzed by summing the exponential form-factor expansions directly, generalizing the traditional Ising connecting computations. We show carefully, how the singularities cancel in the physical value limit $\lambda \pi \rightarrow 1$ and how the power-corrections that collapse at this value can be resummed. In particular, we show for the physical $\lambda$-value, the scaling functions are related to an integrated four-point function in the Ising CFT and continue to control the asymptotics of the number-observables in the scaling limit up to ${\cal O}(r^3)$.</description>
