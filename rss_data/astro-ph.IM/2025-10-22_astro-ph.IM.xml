      <title>A Cost-Effective Search for Extraterrestrial Probes in the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For centuries, astronomers have discussed the possibility of inhabited worlds - from Herschel's 18th-century observations suggesting Mars may host life, to the systematic search for technosignatures that began in the 1960s using radio telescopes. Searching for artifacts in the solar system has received relatively little formal scientific interest and has faced significant technical and social challenges. Automated surveys and new observational techniques developed over the past decade now enable astronomers to survey parts of the sky for anomalous objects.
  We briefly describe four methods for detecting extraterrestrial artifacts and probes within the Solar System and then focus on demonstrating one of these. The first makes use of pre-Sputnik images to search for flashes from glinting objects. The second method makes use of space-borne telescopes to search for artificial objects. A third approach involves examining the reflectance spectra of objects in Earth orbit, in search of the characteristic reddening that may imply long-term exposure of metallic surfaces to space weathering. We focus here on a fourth approach, which involves using Earth's shadow as a filter when searching for optically luminous objects in near-Earth space. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept of this method by conducting two searches for transients in images acquired by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which has generated many repeated 30-second exposures of the same fields.
  In this way, we identified previously uncatalogued events at short angular separations from the center of the shadow, motivating more extensive searches using this technique. We conclude that the Earth's shadow presents a new and exciting search domain for near-Earth SETI.</description>

      <title>Charged liquid surface instabilities and detection of Solar neutrino by XENONnT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Announcement of detection of Solar 8B neutrinos by XENONnT dual-phase detector come with a suite of unexplained detector effects. We expect accumulation of surface charges and charged surface instability resulting in maximal surface elevation and charge density at wire crossing regions, where anomalies were observed. Thou data from these regions were excluded from analysis, surface distortions and charges are present everywhere, which can lead to large systematic errors in small signal detection.</description>

      <title>Exploring Giant Planet Atmospheres with Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visible and ultraviolet imaging and spectroscopy of Solar System giant planets can set the paradigm for the atmospheric, ionospheric, and magnetospheric processes shaping the diversity of giant exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and their interactions with stellar hosts. Spectra of their molecular absorptions, aerosol scattering, airglow, and auroral emissions can reveal these dynamic atmospheres in three dimensions. Given that giant planets are extended, bright, moving, and rotating objects, with extreme dynamic range and highly variable appearances, they impose specific mission and instrumentation requirements on future large space-based optical/UV observatories like the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We advocate that HWO must have the capability to track non-sidereal targets like the giant planets and their satellites; should be able to view auroras and atmospheres without saturation (e.g., through the use of filters or fast read-out modes); and with a high dynamic range to explore faint objects near bright discs. HWO should enable spatially-resolved spectroscopy from $\sim80$ nm to $\sim900$ nm, capturing H$_2$ Lyman and Werner band series and H Lyman-$\alpha$ in the far-UV; molecular absorptions and scattering in the mid-UV/visible; and deep hydrogen/methane absorptions in the 800-900 nm for cloud characterisation and CH$_4$ mapping. Imaging should enable time-resolved observations, from seconds to create auroral movies, to hours for cloud tracking and winds, to months and years for atmosphere/ionosphere variability. We advocate that an imager should have sufficient field of view to capture Jupiter ($&gt;50$\arcsec), and that UV/visible integral field spectrographs be considered with both narrow ($3$\arcsec) and wide ($&gt;10$\arcsec) field capabilities to provide efficient mapping of atmospheres and auroras.

      <title>Comission Femmes et Astronomie de la SF2A : Women participation in french astronomy 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Commission Femmes et Astronomie of the French Astronomical Society, has conducted a statistical study aimed at mapping the current presence of women in French professional astronomy and establishing a baseline for tracking its evolution over time. This study follows an initial survey carried out in 2021, which covered eight astronomy and astrophysics institutes (1,060 employees). This year, the scope was expanded to 11 institutes, bringing together a total of 1,525 employees, including PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, academics, as well as technical and administrative staff, representing about 57% of the whole French community. We examined how the proportion of women varies according to career stage, level of responsibility, job security, and income. The results are compared to the 2021-2022 survey and appear to illustrate the well-known "leaky pipeline", with one of the main bottlenecks being access to permanent positions. The study shows that the proportion of women consistently declines with increasing job security, career seniority, qualification level, and salary.</description>

      <title>Universal Spectral Tokenization via Self-Supervised Panchromatic Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential scientific data span many resolutions and domains, and unifying them into a common representation is a key step toward developing foundation models for the sciences. Astronomical spectra exemplify this challenge: massive surveys have collected millions of spectra across a wide range of wavelengths and resolutions, yet analyses remain fragmented across spectral domains (e.g., optical vs. infrared) and object types (e.g., stars vs. galaxies), limiting the ability to pool information across datasets. We present a deep learning model that jointly learns from heterogeneous spectra in a self-supervised manner. Our universal spectral tokenizer processes spectra from a variety of object types and resolutions directly on their native wavelength grids, producing intrinsically aligned, homogeneous, and physically meaningful representations that can be efficiently adapted to achieve competitive performance across a range of downstream tasks. For the first time, we demonstrate that a single model can unify spectral data across resolutions and domains, suggesting that our model can serve as a powerful building block for foundation models in astronomy -- and potentially extend to other scientific domains with heterogeneous sequential data, such as climate and healthcare.</description>

      <title>AION-1: Omnimodal Foundation Model for Astronomical Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While foundation models have shown promise across a variety of fields, astronomy still lacks a unified framework for joint modeling across its highly diverse data modalities. In this paper, we present AION-1, a family of large-scale multimodal foundation models for astronomy. AION-1 integrates heterogeneous imaging, spectroscopic, and scalar data using a two-stage architecture: modality-specific tokenization followed by transformer-based masked modeling of cross-modal token sequences. The model is pretrained on five large-scale surveys: Legacy Survey, Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), and Gaia. These span more than 200 million observations of stars, galaxies, and quasars. With a single frozen encoder, AION-1 achieves strong results on a broad suite of downstream tasks, including galaxy and stellar property estimation, galaxy morphology classification, similarity-based retrieval, galaxy image segmentation, and spectral super-resolution. We release AION-1 model variants ranging from 300 M to 3.1 B parameters. Beyond astronomy, AION-1 provides a scalable blueprint for multimodal scientific foundation models that can seamlessly integrate noisy, instrument-specific observations. All code, tokenizers, pretrained weights, and a lightweight evaluation suite are released under an open-source license.</description>

      <title>Close-in faint companions mimicking interferometric hot exozodiacal dust observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Interferometric observations of various nearby main-sequence stars show an unexpected infrared excess, raising the question of its origin. The two dominant interpretations favor hot exozodiacal dust or a faint companion, as both can produce similar signatures. Method: We modeled a system consisting of a star and a faint companion within a field of view of 2au x 2au. We calculated the visibility and closure phases for three VLTI instruments (PIONIER, GRAVITY, and MATISSE) and four telescope configurations. Aim: We aim to investigate the interferometric signatures of faint companions and assess their detectability. We explore limitations of current detection methods and evaluate the challenges in distinguishing between hot exozodiacal dust and a faint companion as the source of the observed excess. Results: We derived an upper limit for the companion-induced visibility deficit and closure phase. Contrary to the common interpretation that near-zero closure phases rule out the presence of a companion, we show that companions can remain undetected in closure phase data, as indicated by significant non-detection probabilities, yet, these companions can still produce measurable visibility deficits. We confirmed our results by reevaluating an L-band observation of kappa Tuc A. We found indications for a faint companion with a flux ratio of 0.7% and an estimated non-detection probability of around 21%, which could explain the variability of the previously observed visibility deficit. Conclusions: Previous companion rejection criteria, such as near-zero closure phases and flux estimates based on Gaussian-distributed dust densities, are not universally valid. This highlights the need for a reevaluation of companion rejections in former studies of the hot exozodiacal dust phenomenon. In addition, we propose a method for distinguishing both sources of visibility deficit.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic study of the light-polluted night sky in Hong Kong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic study of the night sky has been a common way to assess the impacts of artificial light at night at remote astronomical observatories. However, the spectroscopic properties of the urban night sky remain poorly documented. We addressed this gap by collecting more than 12,000 zenith sky spectra with compact spectrometers at urban and suburban sites from 2021 to 2023. Here, by examining the intensity variations of the spectral features that represent characteristic emissions from common artificial light sources, we show that the skyglow is predominantly shaped by artificial emissions, including compact fluorescent lamps and high-pressure sodium lamps. Contributions from commercially controlled lighting, including those for floodlighting and advertising adopting light-emitting diode and metal halide technologies, were more pronounced in urban areas during the hours leading up to midnight. We also documented direct evidence of the impact of a neon sign located on top of a commercial tower, illustrating how a single light source can significantly influence the surrounding environment. Compared with observations made a decade ago at the same location, our findings indicate a growing popularity of light-emitting diode lighting for external use, consistent with the existing literature. This first comprehensive spectroscopic investigation of light pollution in an urban environment emphasizes the evolving patterns of outdoor lighting and highlights the critical and unique role of spectroscopic measurements. The results provide essential information for the development of effective strategies and policies to mitigate light pollution in urban areas and at sites of astronomical importance.</description>

      <title>Deep Synoptic Array Science: Searching for Long Duration Radio Transients with the DSA-110</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the design and commissioning tests for the DSA-110 Not-So-Fast Radio Burst (NSFRB) search pipeline, a 1.4 GHz image-plane single-pulse search sensitive to 134 ms-160.8 s radio bursts. Extending the pulse width range of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) search by 3 orders of magnitude, the NSFRB search is sensitive to the recently-discovered Galactic Long Period Radio Transients (LPRTs). The NSFRB search operates in real-time, utilizing a custom GPU-accelerated search code, \texttt{cerberus}, implemented in Python with JAX. We summarize successful commissioning sensitivity tests with continuum sources and pulsar B0329+54, estimating the $6\sigma$ flux (fluence) threshold to be ~290 mJy (~40 Jy ms). Future tests of recovery of longer timescale transients, e.g. CHIME J1634+44, are planned to supplement injection testing and B0329+54 observations. An offline DSA-110 NSFRB Galactic Plane Survey was conducted to search for LPRTs, covering $-3.5^\circ&lt;b&lt;5.7^\circ$ and $141^\circ&lt;l&lt;225^\circ$ (~770 square degrees) in Galactic coordinates. We estimate an upper limit Poissonian burst rate ~1 hr$^{-1}$ per square degree (~7 hr$^{-1}$ per $3^\circ\times3^\circ$ survey grid cell) maximized across the inner $|b|&lt;0.25^\circ$ of the surveyed region. By imposing the ~290 mJy flux limit on two representative models (the magnetar plastic flow model and the White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary model), we reject with 95% confidence the presence of White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary LPRTs with periods between ~10-70s within ~95% of the surveyed region. Combined with the prevalence of LPRTs in the Galactic Plane, our results motivate further consideration of both White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary models and isolated magnetar models. We will continue to explore novel LPRT search strategies during real-time operations, such as triggered periodicity searches and additional targeted surveys.</description>

      <title>The thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect in galaxy clusters and filaments using multifrequency temperature maps of the cosmic microwave background: Abell 399--Abell 401 cluster pair case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multifrequency and multi-instrument methodology to study the physical properties of galaxy clusters and cosmic filaments using cosmic microwave background observations. Our approach enables simultaneous measurement of both the thermal (tSZ) and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effects, incorporates relativistic corrections, and models astrophysical foregrounds such as thermal dust emission. We do this by jointly fitting a single physical model across multiple maps from multiple instruments at different frequencies, rather than fitting a model to a single Compton-$y$ map. We demonstrate the success of this method by fitting the Abell 399-Abell 401 galaxy cluster pair and filament system using archival data from the Planck satellite and new, targeted deep data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, covering 11 different frequencies over 14 maps from 30 GHz to 545 GHz. Our tSZ results are consistent with previous work using Compton-$y$ maps. We measure the line-of-sight peculiar velocities of the cluster-filament system using the kSZ effect and find statistical uncertainties on individual cluster peculiar velocities of $\lesssim $600 km s$^{-1}$, which are competitive with current state-of-the-art measurements. Additionally, we measure the optical depth of the filament component with a signal-to-noise of 8.5$\sigma$ and reveal hints of its morphology. This modular approach is well-suited for application to future instruments across a wide range of millimeter and sub-millimeter wavebands.</description>

      <title>GLEAM-300: The GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey at 300 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a wide-field radio survey at 300 MHz covering the sky from $-90^\circ \leq \delta_\text{J2000} \lesssim +40^\circ$ using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). This 300-MHz survey follows the Galactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey, and provides an additional comparatively high-frequency data point to existing multi-frequency (72-231 MHz) data. With this data release we provide mosaic images and a catalogue of compact source components. We use two-minute snapshot observations covering 2015-2016, combining overlapping two-minute snapshot images to provide full-sensitivity mosaic images with a median root-mean-square noise of $9.1_{-2.8}^{+5.5}$ mJy beam$^{-1}$ and median angular resolution of $128.8^{\prime\prime} \times 112.5^{\prime\prime}$, with some position-dependent variation. We find a total of 338 080 unique Gaussian components across the mosaic images. The survey is the first at 300 MHz from the MWA covering the whole Southern Hemisphere. It provides a unique spectral data point that complements the existing GLEAM survey and the ongoing GLEAM-eXtended survey, and points toward results from the upcoming SKA-Low surveys.</description>

Abstract: The space mission LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), scheduled for launch in 2035, aims to detect gravitational wave (GW) signals in the milli-Hz band. In the context of ESA Voyage 2050 Call for new mission concepts, other frequency ranges are explored by the Gravitational-Wave Space 2050 Working Group to conceive new proposals for a post-LISA space-based detector. In this work, we give a preliminary estimate of the observational potential of three mission designs proposed in the literature, namely $\mu$Ares, AMIGO and the Decihertz Observatory. The analysis framework includes astrophysical GW sources such as massive black hole binaries, extreme mass-ratio inspirals and compact binaries such as stellar black holes and white dwarfs. For each detector, we first present a consistent computation of the unresolved gravitational wave background (GWB) produced by the sum of all anticipated astrophysical populations, using an iterative subtraction algorithm. We then investigate which types of systems are the most appealing, by measuring the number of GW signals detected and exploring the source properties.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Emulators for Cosmology: Accelerating Cosmological Analyses Without Sacrificing Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cosmology, emulators play a crucial role by providing fast and accurate predictions of complex physical models, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces that would be computationally prohibitive with direct numerical simulations. Symbolic emulators have emerged as promising alternatives to numerical approaches, delivering comparable accuracy with significantly faster evaluation times. While previous symbolic emulators were limited to relatively narrow prior ranges, we expand these to cover the parameter space relevant for current cosmological analyses. We introduce approximations to hypergeometric functions used for the $\Lambda$CDM comoving distance and linear growth factor which are accurate to better than 0.001% and 0.05%, respectively, for all redshifts and for $\Omega_{\rm m} \in [0.1, 0.5]$. We show that integrating symbolic emulators into a Dark Energy Survey-like $3\times2$pt analysis produces cosmological constraints consistent with those obtained using standard numerical methods. Our symbolic emulators offer substantial improvements in speed and memory usage, demonstrating their practical potential for scalable, likelihood-based inference.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy-Aware Pulsar Parameter Estimation from Light Curves via Deep Learning and Test-Time Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing properties of neutron stars from photometric observations of these objects helps us answer crucial questions at the forefront of multi-messenger astronomy, such as, what is behavior of highest density matter in extreme environments and what is the procedure of generation and evolution of magnetic fields in these astrophysical environments? However, uncertainties and degeneracies-where different parameter sets produce similar light curves-make this task challenging. We propose a deep learning framework for inferring pulsar parameters from observed light curves. Traditional deep learning models are not designed to produce multiple degenerate solutions for a given input. To address this, we introduce a custom loss function that incorporates a light curve emulator as a forward model, along with a dissimilarity loss that encourages the model to capture diverse, degenerate parameter sets for a given light curve. We further introduce a test-time optimization scheme that refines predicted parameters by minimizing the discrepancy between the observed light curve and those reconstructed by the forward model from predicted parameters during inference. The model is trained using a suite of state-of-the-art simulated pulsar light curves. Finally, we demonstrate that the parameter sets predicted by our approach reproduce light curves that are consistent with the true observation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge in Astrophysical Observational Inversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) models in the context of dynamical astrophysical systems, specifically tackling observational inverse prediction tasks within Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) for star formation. We introduce the Astro-DSB model, a variant of DSB with the pairwise domain assumption tailored for astrophysical dynamics. By investigating its learning process and prediction performance in both physically simulated data and in real observations (the Taurus B213 data), we present two main takeaways. First, from the astrophysical perspective, our proposed paired DSB method improves interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction performance over conventional astrostatistical and other machine learning methods. Second, from the generative modeling perspective, probabilistic generative modeling reveals improvements over discriminative pixel-to-pixel modeling in Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) testing cases of physical simulations with unseen initial conditions and different dominant physical processes. Our study expands research into diffusion models beyond the traditional visual synthesis application and provides evidence of the models' learning abilities beyond pure data statistics, paving a path for future physics-aware generative models which can align dynamics between machine learning and real (astro)physical systems.</description>

      <title>AstroMMBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models Capabilities in Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astronomical image interpretation presents a significant challenge for applying multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specialized scientific tasks. Existing benchmarks focus on general multimodal capabilities but fail to capture the complexity of astronomical data. To bridge this gap, we introduce AstroMMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in astronomical image understanding. AstroMMBench comprises 621 multiple-choice questions across six astrophysical subfields, curated and reviewed by 15 domain experts for quality and relevance. We conducted an extensive evaluation of 25 diverse MLLMs, including 22 open-source and 3 closed-source models, using AstroMMBench. The results show that Ovis2-34B achieved the highest overall accuracy (70.5%), demonstrating leading capabilities even compared to strong closed-source models. Performance showed variations across the six astrophysical subfields, proving particularly challenging in domains like cosmology and high-energy astrophysics, while models performed relatively better in others, such as instrumentation and solar astrophysics. These findings underscore the vital role of domain-specific benchmarks like AstroMMBench in critically evaluating MLLM performance and guiding their targeted development for scientific applications. AstroMMBench provides a foundational resource and a dynamic tool to catalyze advancements at the intersection of AI and astronomy.</description>

      <title>The DECADE cosmic shear project I: A new weak lensing shape catalog of 107 million galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) weak lensing dataset: a catalog of 107 million galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) in the northern Galactic cap. This catalog was assembled from public DECam data including survey and standard observing programs. These data were consistently processed with the Dark Energy Survey Data Management pipeline as part of the DECADE campaign and serve as the basis of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE) Early Data Release 3 (EDR3). We apply the Metacalibration measurement algorithm to generate and calibrate galaxy shapes. After cuts, the resulting cosmology-ready galaxy shape catalog covers a region of $5,\!412 \,\,{\rm deg}^2$ with an effective number density of $4.59\,\, {\rm arcmin}^{-2}$. The coadd images used to derive this data have a median limiting magnitude of $r = 23.6$, $i = 23.2$, and $z = 22.6$, estimated at ${\rm S/N} = 10$ in a 2 arcsecond aperture. We present a suite of detailed studies to characterize the catalog, measure any residual systematic biases, and verify that the catalog is suitable for cosmology analyses. In parallel, we build an image simulation pipeline to characterize the remaining multiplicative shear bias in this catalog, which we measure to be $m = (-2.454 \pm 0.124) \times10^{-2}$ for the full sample. Despite the significantly inhomogeneous nature of the data set, due to it being an amalgamation of various observing programs, we find the resulting catalog has sufficient quality to yield competitive cosmological constraints.</description>

      <title>The DECADE cosmic shear project II: photometric redshift calibration of the source galaxy sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the photometric redshift characterization and calibration for the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) weak lensing dataset: a catalog of 107 million galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) in the northern Galactic cap. The redshifts are estimated from a combination of wide-field photometry, deep-field photometry with associated redshift estimates, and a transfer function between the wide field and deep field that is estimated using a source injection catalog. We construct four tomographic bins for the galaxy catalog, and estimate the redshift distribution, $n(z)$, within each one using the Self-organizing Map Photo-Z (SOMPZ) methodology. Our estimates include the contributions from sample variance, zeropoint calibration uncertainties, and redshift biases, as quantified for the deep-field dataset. The total uncertainties on the mean redshifts are $\sigma_{\langle z \rangle} \approx 0.01$. The SOMPZ estimates are then compared to those from the clustering redshift method, obtained by cross-correlating our source galaxies with galaxies in spectroscopic surveys, and are shown to be consistent with each other.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-Principle Experiment on a Displacement-Noise-Free Neutron Interferometer for Gravitational Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The displacement-noise-free interferometer (DFI) is designed to eliminate all displacement-induced noise while retaining sensitivity to gravitational wave (GW) signals. Ground-based DFIs suffer from physical arm-length limitations, resulting in poor sensitivity at frequencies below 1 kHz. To address this, previous research introduced a neutron-based DFI, which replaces laser light with neutrons and achieves exceptional sensitivity down to a few hertz. In this study, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment using a pulsed neutron source at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J- PARC). Despite practical constraints that led to deviations from the ideal experimental design, we optimized the setup and developed a novel analysis method that successfully cancels displacement noise while preserving simulated GW signals. This work presents the first successful demonstration of a neutron DFI and a neutron interferometer for GW detection.</description>

      <title>Overlapping signals in next-generation gravitational wave observatories: A recipe for selecting the best parameter estimation technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Third-generation gravitational wave detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will have significantly better sensitivities than current detectors, as well as a wider frequency bandwidth. This will increase the number and duration of the observed signals, leading to many signals overlapping in time. If not adequately accounted for, this can lead to biases in parameter estimation. In this work, we combine the joint parameter estimation method with relative binning to handle full parameter inference on overlapping signals from binary black holes, including precession effects and higher-order mode content. As this method is computationally more expensive than traditional single-signal parameter estimation, we test a prior-informed Fisher matrix and a time-frequency overlap method for estimating expected bias to help us decide when joint parameter estimation is necessary over the simpler methods. We improve upon previous Fisher matrix implementations by including the prior information and performing an optimization routine to better locate the maximum likelihood point point, but we still find the method unreliable. The time-frequency method is accurate in 86% of close binary black hole mergers. We end by developing our own method of estimating bias due overlaps, where we reweight the single signal parameter estimation posterior to quantify how much the overlapping signals affect it. We show it has 99% accuracy for zero noise injections (98% in Gaussian noise), at the cost of one additional standard sampling run when joint parameter estimation proves to be necessary.</description>
