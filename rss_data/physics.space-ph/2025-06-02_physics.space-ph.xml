      <title>Removal of Lunar Dust Simulant from Cold Dielectric Surfaces with Electron Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that lunar dust simulant can be efficiently lofted and removed from various room temperature surfaces in vacuum when exposed to a low-energy electron beam. This provides a potential solution to the well-known dust risks associated with future lunar exploration. Considering its application in extremely cold regions on the Moon, we experimentally demonstrated dust lofting from surfaces at temperatures as low as -123degC using an electron beam. Compared to room temperature applications, we found that the dust lofting from a glass surface slows down significantly at lower temperatures. Possible reasons are discussed. We also found that the dust lofting process can be accelerated when the electron beam energy is swept within an optimal range and rate.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of oscillatory magnetic reconnection modulated by solar convective motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory magnetic reconnection is a periodic magnetic reconnection process, during which the current sheet's orientation and the magnetic connections change periodically. This periodic variation is generally considered to originate from the magnetic reconnection itself rather than from external driving processes. We conduct 2.5-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the emergence of a magnetic flux tube from the convection zone into the lower corona, where the emerging magnetic fields reconnect with background ones. During the reconnection process within 5771 s, the current sheet's orientation has been reversed 41 times, corresponding to 40 oscillation periods. Notably, the longest period is 30 minutes, which is consistent with the previous observational results. We find that the main factor leading to the reversal of the current sheet's orientation is the quasi-periodic external force provided by the emergence of plasma and magnetic fields from the convection zone. We also find the shifting of the upward outflows from the reconnection region along the horizontal direction due to the alternating changes of the reconnection inflow and outflow regions. In addition to the quasi-periodic change of the current sheet orientation, the reconnection rate at the main X-point also oscillates with a period between 100-400 s, which corresponds to the period of p-mode oscillations.</description>
