      <title>Skew power series rings with automorphisms of finite inner order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the algebraic properties of the bounded skew power series ring $Q^+[[x;\sigma,\delta]]$ over a (complete, simple) \emph{standard} filtered artinian algebra $Q$ of positive characteristic. Here we are assuming that $(\sigma,\delta)$ is a commuting skew derivation of $Q$, where $\delta$ is inner, satisfying the appropriate compatibility conditions. In a previous work of the authors, it was proved that $Q^+[[x;\sigma,\delta]]$ is a simple ring whenever $\sigma$ has infinite inner order. We now extend this result to the case when $\sigma$ has finite inner order, proving that this ring is often simple, and always prime in cases of interest. This solves an important special case of an open question of Letzter, and yields important consequences for the classification of prime ideals in Iwasawa algebras of solvable groups.</description>

      <title>Rings of the right (left) almost stable range 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a concept of rings of right (left) almost stable range $1$ and we construct a theory of a canonical diagonal reduction of matrices over such rings. A description of new classes of noncommutative elementary divisor rings is done as well. In particular, for B\'ezout $D$-domain we introduced the notions of $D$-adequate element and $D$-adequate ring. We proved that every $D$-adequate B\'ezout domain has almost stable range $1$. For Hermite $D$-ring we proved the necessary and sufficient conditions to be an elementary divisor ring. A ring $R$ is called an $L$-ring if the condition $RaR = R$ for some $a\in R$ implies that $a$ is a unit of $R$. We proved that every $L$-ring of almost stable range $1$ is a ring of right almost stable range $1$.</description>

      <title>On Parametric Linear System Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric linear systems are linear systems of equations in which some symbolic parameters, that is, symbols that are not considered to be candidates for elimination or solution in the course of analyzing the problem, appear in the coefficients of the system. In this work we assume that the symbolic parameters appear polynomially in the coefficients and that the only variables to be solved for are those of the linear system. The consistency of the system and expression of the solutions may vary depending on the values of the parameters. It is well-known that it is possible to specify a covering set of regimes, each of which is a semi-algebraic condition on the parameters together with a solution description valid under that condition.
  We provide a method of solution that requires time polynomial in the matrix dimension and the degrees of the polynomials when there are up to three parameters. In previous methods the number of regimes needed is exponential in the system dimension and polynomial degree of the parameters. Our approach exploits the Hermite and Smith normal forms that may be computed when the system coefficient domain is mapped to the univariate polynomial domain over suitably constructed fields. Our approach effectively identifies intrinsic singularities and ramification points where the algebraic and geometric structure of the matrix changes.</description>

      <title>$k$-Positive Maps: New Characterizations and a Generation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $k$-positive linear maps on matrix algebras and address two problems, (i) characterizations of $k$-positivity and (ii) generation of non-decomposable $k$-positive maps. On the characterization side, we derive optimization-based conditions equivalent to $k$-positivity that (a) reduce to a simple check when $k=d$, (b) reveal a direct link to the spectral norm of certain order-3 tensors (aligning with known NP-hardness barriers for $k&lt;d$), and (c) recast $k$-positivity as a novel optimization problem over separable states, thereby connecting it explicitly to separability testing. On the generation side, we introduce a Lie-semigroup-based method that, starting from a single $k$-positive map, produces one-parameter families that remain $k$-positive and non-decomposable for small enough times. We illustrate this by generating such families for $d=3$ and $d=4$. We also formulate a semi-definite program (SDP) to test an equivalent form of the positive partial transpose (PPT) square conjecture (and do not find any violation of the latter). Our results provide practical computational tools for certifying $k$-positivity and a systematic way to sample $k$-positive non-decomposable maps.</description>

      <title>On the boundary Carrollian conformal algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the mathematical study of the boundary Carrollian conformal algebra (BCCA), an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra recently discovered in the context of Carrollian physics. The BCCA is an intriguing object from both physical and mathematical perspectives, since it is a filtered but not graded Lie algebra. In this paper, we first construct some modules for the BCCA and one of its subalgebras, which we call $\mathcal{O}$, by restriction of well-known modules of the BMS$_3$ and Witt algebras respectively. After showing that such modules are free or ``almost free'', we go through some structure theory on the BCCA to define a new basis and a decreasing filtration on the algebra which lets us construct BCCA-modules intrinsically. In particular, we construct Whittaker modules over the BCCA and the subalgebra $\mathcal{O}$ and prove criteria for their irreducibility.</description>

      <title>Pfister's local-global principle for Azumaya algebras with involution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04851v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Pfister's local-global principle for hermitian forms over Azumaya algebras with involution over semilocal rings, and show in particular that the Witt group of nonsingular hermitian forms is $2$-primary torsion. Our proof relies on a hermitian version of Sylvester's law of inertia, which is obtained from an investigation of the connections between a pairing of hermitian forms extensively studied by Garrel, signatures of hermitian forms, and positive semidefinite quadratic forms.</description>

      <title>Inverse semialgebras and partial actions of Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a non-associative (i.e. non-necessarily associtive) inverse semialgebra over a field, the Lie version of which is inspired by the set of all partially defined derivations of a non-associative algebra, whereas the associative case is based on such examples as the set of all partially defined linear maps of a vector space, the set of all sections of the structural sheaf of a scheme, the set of all regular functions defined on open subsets of an algebraic variety and the set of all smooth real valued functions defined on open subsets of a smooth manifold. Given a Lie algebra $L$ we define the notion of a partial action of $L$ on a non-associative algebra $A$ as an appropriate premorphism and introduce a Lie inverse semialgebra $E(L),$ which is a Lie analogue of R. Exel's inverse semigroup $S(G)$ that governs the partial actions of a group $G.$ We discuss how $E(L)$ controls the premorphisms from $L$ to $A,$ obtaining results on its total control. We define the concept of an $F$-inverse Lie semialgebra and obtain Lie theoretic analogues of some classical results of the theory of inverse semigroups, namely, we show that the category of partial representations of $L$ in meet semilattices is equivalent to the category ${\mathcal F}$ of $F$-inverse Lie semialgebras with morphisms that preserve the greatest elements of $\sigma$-classes. In addition, we establish an adjunction between the category of Lie algebras and the category ${\mathcal F}.$</description>

      <title>Rational Motions of Minimal Quaternionic Degree with Prescribed Line Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how to find rational motions that move a line along a given rational ruled surface. Our goal is to find motions with the lowest possible degree using dual quaternions. While similar problems for point trajectories are well known, the case of line trajectories is more complicated and has not been studied. We explain when such motions exist and how to compute them. Our method gives explicit formulas for constructing these motions and shows that, in many cases, the solution is unique. We also show examples and explain how to use these results to design simple mechanisms that move a line in the desired way. This work helps to better understand the relationship between rational motions and ruled surfaces and may be useful for future research in mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetries of remarkable (1+2)-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an original method, we find the algebra of generalized symmetries of a remarkable (1+2)-dimensional ultraparabolic Fokker-Planck equation, which is also called the Kolmogorov equation and is singled out within the entire class of ultraparabolic linear second-order partial differential equations with three independent variables by its wonderful symmetry properties. It turns out that the essential subalgebra of this algebra, which consists of linear generalized symmetries, is generated by the recursion operators associated with the nilradical of the essential Lie invariance algebra of the Kolmogorov equation, and the Casimir operator of the Levi factor of the latter algebra unexpectedly arises in the consideration. We also establish an isomorphism between this algebra and the Lie algebra associated with the second Weyl algebra, which provides a dual perspective for studying their properties. After developing the theoretical background of finding exact solutions of homogeneous linear systems of differential equations using their linear generalized symmetries, we efficiently apply it to the Kolmogorov equation.</description>
