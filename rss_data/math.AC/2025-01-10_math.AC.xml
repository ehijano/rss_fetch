      <title>Low-Rank Reduced Biquaternion Tensor Ring Decomposition and Tensor Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the reduced biquaternion tensor ring (RBTR) decomposition and provide a detailed exposition of the corresponding algorithm RBTR-SVD. Leveraging RBTR decomposition, we propose a novel low-rank tensor completion algorithm RBTR-TV integrating RBTR ranks with total variation (TV) regularization to optimize the process. Numerical experiments on color image and video completion tasks indicate the advantages of our method.</description>

      <title>On the ascent of almost and quasi-atomicity to monoid semidomains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A commutative monoid is atomic if every non-invertible element factors into irreducibles (also called atoms), while an integral (semi)domain is atomic if its multiplicative monoid is atomic. Notions weaker than atomicity have been introduced and studied during the past decade, including almost atomicity and quasi-atomicity, which were coined and first investigated by Boynton and Coykendall in their study of graphs of divisibility of integral domains. The ascent of atomicity to polynomial extensions was settled by Roitman back in 1993 while the ascent of atomicity to monoid domains was settled by Coykendall and the second author in 2019 (in both cases the answer was negative). The main purpose of this paper is to study the ascent of almost atomicity and quasi-atomicity to polynomial extensions and monoid domains. Under certain reasonable conditions, we establish the ascent of both properties to polynomial extensions (over semidomains). Then we construct an explicit example illustrating that, with no extra conditions, quasi-atomicity does not ascend to polynomial extensions. Finally, we show that, in general, neither almost atomicity nor quasi-atomicity ascend to monoid domains, improving upon a construction first provided by Coykendall and the second author for the non-ascent of atomicity.</description>

      <title>The{N/D}-Conjecture for Nonresonant Hyperplane Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the Bernstein--Sato polynomials $b_{f}$ of homogeneous polynomials $f$ of degree $d$ with $n$ variables. It is open to know when $n\over d$ is a root of $b_{f}$. For essential indecomposable hyperplane arrangements, this is a conjecture by Budur, Musta\c{t}\u{a} and Teitler and implies the strong monodromy conjecture for arrangements. U. Walther gave a sufficient condition that a certain differential form does not vanish in the top cohomology group of Milnor fiber. We use Walther's result to verify the $n\over d$-conjecture for weighted hyperplane arrangements satisfying the nonresonant condition. We also give some essential indecomposable homogeneous polynomials $f$ such that $-{n\over d}$ is not a root of $b_{f}$. This leads to a conjectural sufficient condition for $b_{f}(-{n\over d})=0$.</description>

      <title>Some factorization results for formal power series with integer coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain some factorization results on formal power series having integer coefficients with sharp bounds on number of irreducible factors. These factorization results correspondingly lead to irreducibility criteria for formal power series. The information about prime factorization of the constant term and that of some higher order terms is utilized for the purpose. Further, using theory of Newton polygons for power series, we extend the classical Dumas irreducibility criterion to formal power series over integers, which in particular, yields several irreducibility criteria.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on plane curves related to freeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a free curve $C$ of degree $d$ with exponents $(d_1,d_2)$ there is a simple formula relating $d,d_1, d_2$ and the total Tjurina number of $C$. Our first result discusses how this result changes when the curve $C$ is no longer free. For a free line arrangement with exponents $(d_1,d_2)$, the Poincar\'e polynomial coincides with the Betti polynomial $B(t)$ and with the product $P(t)=(1+d_1t)(1+d_2t)$. Our second result shows that for any curve $C$, the difference $P(t)-B(t)$ is a polynomial $a t +bt^2$, with $a$ and $b$ non-negative integers. Moreover $a =0$ or $b=0$ if and only if $C$ is a free line arrangement. We also give a combinatorial restriction which a potential minimal counter-example to Terao's Conjecture must satisfy. Moreover, we make more precise a result by H. Schenck concerning the relation between the exponents and the maximal multiplicity of points in any line arrangement.</description>
