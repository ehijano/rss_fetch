      <title>Homophily in Complex Networks: Measures, Models, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homophily, the tendency of individuals to connect with others who share similar attributes, is a defining feature of social networks. Understanding how groups interact, both within and across, is crucial for uncovering the dynamics of network evolution and the emergence of structural inequalities in these network. This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of homophily, covering its various definitions, key properties, and the limitations of widely used metrics. Extending beyond traditional pairwise interactions, we will discuss homophily in higher-order network structures such as hypergraphs and simplicial complexes. We will further discuss network generating models capable of producing different types of homophilic networks with tunable levels of homophily and highlight their relevance in real-world contexts. The tutorial concludes with a discussion of open challenges, emerging directions, and opportunities for further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Identifying Constructive Conflict in Online Discussions through Controversial yet Toxicity Resilient Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bridging content that brings together individuals with opposing viewpoints on social media remains elusive, overshadowed by echo chambers and toxic exchanges. We propose that algorithmic curation could surface such content by considering constructive conflicts as a foundational criterion. We operationalize this criterion through controversiality to identify challenging dialogues and toxicity resilience to capture respectful conversations. We develop high-accuracy models to capture these dimensions. Analyses based on these models demonstrate that assessing resilience to toxic responses is not the same as identifying low-toxicity posts. We also find that political posts are often controversial and tend to attract more toxic responses. However, some posts, even the political ones, are resilient to toxicity despite being highly controversial, potentially sparking civil engagement. Toxicity resilient posts tend to use politeness cues, such as showing gratitude and hedging. These findings suggest the potential for framing the tone of posts to encourage constructive political discussions.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Neural-Network-Entropy model of vital node identification on network attack and propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vital nodes usually play a key role in complex networks. Uncovering these nodes is an important task in protecting the network, especially when the network suffers intentional attack. Many existing methods have not fully integrated the node feature, interaction and state. In this article, we propose a novel method (GNNE) based on graph neural networks and information entropy. The method employs a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn the nodes' features, which are input into a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to obtain the influence factor of nodes, and the node influence factors are used to calculate the nodes' entropy to evaluate the node importance. The GNNE takes advantage of the GCN and GAT, with the GCN well extracting the nodes' features and the GAT aggregating the features of the nodes' neighbors by using the attention mechanism to assign different weights to the neighbors with different importance, and the nodes' entropy quantifies the nodes' state in the network. The proposed method is trained on a synthetic Barabasi-Albert network, and tested on six real datasets. Compared with eight traditional topology-based methods and four graph-machine-learning-based methods, the GNNE shows an advantage for the vital node identification in the perspectives of network attack and propagation.</description>

      <title>Simulating Online Social Media Conversations on Controversial Topics Using AI Agents Calibrated on Real-World Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online social networks offer a valuable lens to analyze both individual and collective phenomena. Researchers often use simulators to explore controlled scenarios, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes these simulations more realistic by enabling agents to understand and generate natural language content. In this work, we investigate the behavior of LLM-based agents in a simulated microblogging social network. We initialize agents with realistic profiles calibrated on real-world online conversations from the 2022 Italian political election and extend an existing simulator by introducing mechanisms for opinion modeling. We examine how LLM agents simulate online conversations, interact with others, and evolve their opinions under different scenarios. Our results show that LLM agents generate coherent content, form connections, and build a realistic social network structure. However, their generated content displays less heterogeneity in tone and toxicity compared to real data. We also find that LLM-based opinion dynamics evolve over time in ways similar to traditional mathematical models. Varying parameter configurations produces no significant changes, indicating that simulations require more careful cognitive modeling at initialization to replicate human behavior more faithfully. Overall, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs for simulating user behavior in social environments, while also identifying key challenges in capturing heterogeneity and complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>GnnXemplar: Exemplars to Explanations - Natural Language Rules for Global GNN Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for node classification, yet their opaque decision-making limits trust and adoption. While local explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped. Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study with 60 participants.</description>

      <title>When Collaborative Maintenance Falls Short: The Persistence of Retracted Papers on Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a key infrastructure for public access to scientific knowledge, but it faces challenges in maintaining the credibility of cited sources, especially when scientific papers are retracted. This paper investigates how citations to retracted research are handled on English Wikipedia. We construct a novel dataset that integrates Wikipedia revision histories with metadata from Retraction Watch, Crossref, Altmetric, and OpenAlex, identifying 1,181 citations of retracted papers. We find that 71.6% of all citations analyzed are problematic. These are citations added before a paper's retraction, as well as the citations introduced after retraction without any in-text mention of the paper's retracted status. Our analysis reveals that these citations persist for a median of over 3.68 years (1,344 days). Through survival analysis, we find that signals of human attention are associated with a faster correction process. Unfortunately, a paper's established scholarly authority, a higher academic citation count, is associated with a slower time to correction. Our findings highlight how the Wikipedia community supports collaborative maintenance but leaves gaps in citation-level repair. We contribute to CSCW research by advancing our understanding of this sociotechnical vulnerability, which takes the form of a community coordination challenge, and by offering design directions to support citation credibility at scale.</description>

      <title>Generative Propaganda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative propaganda is the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to shape public opinion. To characterize its use in real-world settings, we conducted interviews with defenders (e.g., factcheckers, journalists, officials) in Taiwan and creators (e.g., influencers, political consultants, advertisers) as well as defenders in India, centering two places characterized by high levels of online propaganda. The term "deepfakes", we find, exerts outsized discursive power in shaping defenders' expectations of misuse and, in turn, the interventions that are prioritized. To better characterize the space of generative propaganda, we develop a taxonomy that distinguishes between obvious versus hidden and promotional versus derogatory use. Deception was neither the main driver nor the main impact vector of AI's use; instead, Indian creators sought to persuade rather than to deceive, often making AI's use obvious in order to reduce legal and reputational risks, while Taiwan's defenders saw deception as a subset of broader efforts to distort the prevalence of strategic narratives online. AI was useful and used, however, in producing efficiency gains in communicating across languages and modes, and in evading human and algorithmic detection. Security researchers should reconsider threat models to clearly differentiate deepfakes from promotional and obvious uses, to complement and bolster the social factors that constrain misuse by internal actors, and to counter efficiency gains globally.</description>

      <title>Multi-set spectral clustering of time-evolving networks using the supra-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11984v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for learning communities in time-evolving networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We consider the supra-Laplacian for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the supra-Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.</description>

      <title>Structure-prior Informed Diffusion Model for Graph Source Localization with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Source localization in graph information propagation is essential for mitigating network disruptions, including misinformation spread, cyber threats, and infrastructure failures. Existing deep generative approaches face significant challenges in real-world applications due to limited propagation data availability. We present SIDSL (\textbf{S}tructure-prior \textbf{I}nformed \textbf{D}iffusion model for \textbf{S}ource \textbf{L}ocalization), a generative diffusion framework that leverages topology-aware priors to enable robust source localization with limited data. SIDSL addresses three key challenges: unknown propagation patterns through structure-based source estimations via graph label propagation, complex topology-propagation relationships via a propagation-enhanced conditional denoiser with GNN-parameterized label propagation module, and class imbalance through structure-prior biased diffusion initialization. By learning pattern-invariant features from synthetic data generated by established propagation models, SIDSL enables effective knowledge transfer to real-world scenarios. Experimental evaluation on four real-world datasets demonstrates superior performance with 7.5-13.3\% F1 score improvements over baselines, including over 19\% improvement in few-shot and 40\% in zero-shot settings, validating the framework's effectiveness for practical source localization.

      <title>Post-hoc Study of Climate Microtargeting on Social Media Ads with LLMs: Thematic Insights and Fairness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05401v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate change communication on social media increasingly employs microtargeting strategies to effectively reach and influence specific demographic groups. This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Meta (previously known as Facebook) advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to uncover biases in model predictions. We assess disparities in accuracy and error rates across demographic groups using established fairness metrics such as Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, and Predictive Equality. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of male audiences. The analysis of thematic explanations uncovers recurring patterns in messaging strategies tailored to various demographic groups, while the fairness analysis underscores the need for more inclusive targeting methods. This study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As video games continue to evolve, understanding what drives player enjoyment remains a key challenge. Player reviews provide valuable insights, but their unstructured nature makes large-scale analysis difficult. This study applies generative AI and machine learning, leveraging Microsoft Phi-4 small language model (SLM) and Google Cloud, to quantify and analyze game reviews from Steam and Meta Quest stores. The approach converts qualitative feedback into structured data, enabling comprehensive evaluation of key game design elements, monetization models, and platform-specific trends. The findings reveal distinct patterns in player preferences across PC and VR games, highlighting factors that contribute to higher player enjoyment. By using Google Cloud for large scale data storage and processing, this study establishes a scalable framework for game review analysis. The study's insights offer actionable guidance for game developers, helping optimize game mechanics, pricing strategies, and player engagement.</description>
