      <title>Align-Free Multi-Plane Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-plane phase retrieval method provides a budget-friendly and effective way to perform phase imaging, yet it often encounters alignment challenges due to shifts along the optical axis in experiments. Traditional methods, such as employing beamsplitters instead of mechanical stage movements or adjusting focus using tunable light sources, add complexity to the setup required for multi-plane phase retrieval. Attempts to address these issues computationally face difficulties due to the variable impact of diffraction, which renders conventional homography techniques inadequate. In our research, we introduce a novel Adaptive Cascade Calibrated (ACC) strategy for multi-plane phase retrieval that overcomes misalignment issues. This technique detects feature points within the refocused sample space and calculates the transformation matrix for neighboring planes on-the-fly to digitally adjust measurements, facilitating alignment-free multi-plane phase retrieval. This approach not only avoids the need for complex and expensive optical hardware but also simplifies the imaging setup, reducing overall costs. The effectiveness of our method is validated through simulations and real-world optical experiments.</description>

      <title>Purcell enhanced optical refrigeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical refrigeration of solids with anti-Stokes fluorescence has been widely explored as a vibration-free cryogenic cooling technology. A minimum temperature of 87 K has been demonstrated with rare-earth ion doped crystals using optical refrigeration. However, the depletion of the upper-lying energy levels in the ground state manifold hinders further cooling to below liquid nitrogen (LN$_2$) temperatures, confining its applications. In this work, we introduce a Purcell enhanced optical refrigeration method to circumvent this limitation. This approach enhances the emission of high energy photons by coupling to a nearby nanocavity, blue shifting the mean emission wavelength. Such Purcell enhanced emission facilitates cooling starting from a lower energy level in the ground state manifold, which exhibits a higher occupation below LN$_2$ temperatures. Using our experimentally measured optical coefficients, our theoretical analysis predicts a minimum achievable temperature of 38 K for a Yb$^{3+}$:YLiF$_{4}$ nanocrystal near a cavity under realistic conditions. The proposed method is applicable to other rare-earth ion doped materials and semiconductors, and will have applications in creating superconducting and other quantum devices with solid-state cooling.</description>

      <title>Tunable plasmonic properties of spatially overlapping asymmetric nanoparticle dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the plasmonic properties of nanoparticle dimers with optical responses over a wide spectral range have been investigated by varying the inter-particle gap, dimer geometry, gap morphology, nanoparticle composition, and refractive index of the surrounding medium. In particular, we have theoretically investigated the plasmonic properties of spatially overlapping symmetric gold nanodisks, shape-asymmetric gold nanodisk nanoplates, and compositionally asymmetric gold-silver nanodisk dimers by varying the gap separation from touching to overlapping regime. In such a configuration, we have observed the appearance of a dominant bonding dimer plasmon (BDP) mode that blue-shifts as gap separation turns from touching to overlapping. In addition, it is found that asymmetric dimer produces a broader resonance shift compared to symmetric dimer because of the hybridization of bright and dark plasmon modes, making it a viable option for sensing applications. It is also found that blue shifting of the plasmon mode occurred by changing the gap morphology of the contacting region of the dimer for fixed nanoparticle size and dimer overlapping. Moreover, we explored the influence of overlapping nanoparticle dimer thickness and observed a notable resonance shift by varying the thickness of the nanoparticle dimer. Finally, based on this tunable resonance shift, we explored the sensing applications of bonding dimer plasmon mode with optimized geometries. Thus, the computed figure of merit (FOM) of the overlapping symmetric, shape-asymmetric, and compositionally asymmetric nanoparticle dimers were found to be 1.55, 2.08, and 3.04, respectively, and comparative advantages among the three configurations with implications for surface-based sensing have been thoroughly discussed.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution by converting evanescent waves in microsphere to propagating and transfer function from its surface to nano-jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EM waves transmitted through a thin object with fine structures is observed, by microsphere located above the object. While the waves include both evanescent and propagating waves, the high resolution is obtained by the evanescent ones, including the information on the fine structures of the object. Description of this process is divided into two parts: a) The super resolution is analyzed by using Helmholtz equation for the evanescent waves transmitted from the object to the microsphere surface. b) Using boundary condition, the electric fields on the inner surface of the microsphere includes both the evanescent and propagating waves. The transmission of these waves to a nano jet is produced by a transfer function, including convolution between the spatial modes of the evanescent waves with those of the microsphere, which increases the conversion of the evanescent waves to propagating waves, and thus increase the resolution.</description>

      <title>Electro-phononic and magneto-phononic frequency conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear frequency conversion by optical rectification, as well as difference- and sum-frequency generation are fundamental processes for producing electromagnetic radiation at different frequencies. Here, we demonstrate that coherently excited infrared-active phonons can be used as transducers for generating nonlinear electric polarizations and magnetizations via phonon-phonon and phonon-magnon interactions, in a way similar to nonlinear optical frequency conversion. We derive analytical solutions for the time-dependent polarizations and magnetizations for the second-order response to the electric field component of an ultrashort laser pulse. These allow us to define second-order nonlinear electric and magneto-electric susceptibilities that capture the rectification, as well as the impulsive and sum-frequency excitation of coherent phonons and magnons. Our theoretical framework naturally incorporates existing mechanisms and further leads to the prediction of a hybrid magneto-opto-phononic inverse Faraday effect involving photon-phonon-magnon scattering. Our work demonstrates nonlinear phononics as a pathway to controlling the electric polarization and magnetization in solids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a single crystal, KTA (potassium titanyl-arsenate, KTiOAsO$_4$) based picosecond optical parametric amplifier pumped by an in-house built 1030 nm Yb:YAG thin-disk laser, capable of tunability from 1.46 to 3.5 $\mu$m, operating at 90 kHz, with high average power in the signal and idler beams. The highest output power of 8.9 W was reached for the 1750 nm signal beam with 19% conversion efficiency and the respective 2500 nm idler beam power was 6.2 W with 13% efficiency. The highest combined signal and idler mid-IR power was obtained at 17 W at the 2060 nm wavelength degeneracy point.</description>

      <title>Broadband microwave-rate dark pulse microcombs in dissipation-engineered LiNbO$_3$ microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kerr microcombs generated in optical microresonators provide broadband light sources bridging optical and microwave signals. Their translation to thin-film lithium niobate unlocks second-order nonlinear optical interfaces such as electro-optic modulation and frequency doubling for completing comb functionalities. However, the strong Raman response of LiNbO$_3$ has complicated the formation of Kerr microcombs. Until now, dark pulse microcombs, requiring a double balance between Kerr nonlinearity and normal group velocity dispersion as well as gain and loss, have remained elusive in LiNbO$_3$ microresonators. Here, by incorporating dissipation engineering, we demonstrate dark pulse microcombs with 25 GHz repetition frequency and 200 nm span in a high-$Q$ LiNbO$_3$ microresonator. Resonances near the Raman-active wavelengths are strongly damped by controlling phase-matching conditions of a specially designed pulley coupler. The coherence and tunability of the dark pulse microcombs are also investigated. Our work provides a solution to realize high-power microcombs operating at microwave rates on LiNbO$_3$ chips, promising new opportunities for the monolithic integration of applications spanning communication to microwave photonics.</description>

      <title>Replica-assisted super-resolution fluorescence imaging in scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Far-field super-resolution fluorescence microscopy has been rapidly developed for applications ranging from cell biology to nanomaterials. However, it remains a significant challenge to achieve super-resolution imaging at depth in opaque materials. In this study, we present a super-resolution microscopy technique for imaging hidden fluorescent objects through scattering media, started by exploiting the inherent object replica generation arising from the memory effect, i.e. the seemingly informationless emission speckle can be regarded as a random superposition of multiple object copies. Inspired by the concept of super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging, we use temporally-fluctuating speckles to excite fluorescent signals and perform high-order cumulant analysis on the fluctuation, which can not only improve the image resolution, but also increase the speckle contrast to isolate only the bright object replicas. A super-resolved image can be finally retrieved by simply unmixing the sparsely distributed replicas with their location map. This methodology allows to overcome scattering and achieve robust super-resolution fluorescence imaging, circumventing the need of heavy computational steps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Full SMS, a multipurpose graphical user interface (GUI)-based software package for analysing single-molecule spectroscopy (SMS) data. SMS typically delivers multiparameter data -- such as fluorescence brightness, lifetime, and spectra -- of molecular- or nanometre-scale particles such as single dye molecules, quantum dots, or fluorescently labelled biological macromolecules. Full SMS allows an unbiased statistical analysis of fluorescence brightness through level resolution and clustering, analysis of fluorescence lifetimes through decay fitting, as well as the calculation of second-order correlation functions and the display of fluorescence spectra and raster-scan images. Additional features include extensive data filtering options, a custom HDF5-based file format, and flexible data export options. The software is open source and written in Python but GUI-based so it may be used without any programming knowledge. A multi-process architecture was employed for computational efficiency. The software is also designed to be easily extendable to include additional import data types and analysis capabilities.</description>

Abstract: The formation of plasmons through the collective excitation of charge density has generated intense discussions, offering insights to fundamental sciences and potential applications. While the underlying physical principles have been well-established, the effects of multibody interactions and orbital hybridization on plasmonic dynamics remain understudied. In this work, we present the observation of conventional metallic and correlated plasmons in epitaxial La1-xSrxNiO3 (LSNO) films with varying Sr doping concentrations (x = 0, 0.125, 0.25), unveiling their intriguing evolution. Unlike samples at other doping concentrations, the x = 0.125 intermediate doping sample does not exhibit the correlated plasmons despite showing high optical conductivity. Through experimental investigation using spectroscopic ellipsometry and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, that is further supported by theoretical calculations, the O2p-Ni3d orbital hybridization for x = 0.125 is found to be significantly enhanced, alongside a considerable weakening of its effective correlation U*. These factors account for the absence of correlated plasmons and the high optical conductivity observed in LSNO (0.125). Our findings highlight the significant impact of orbital hybridization on the electronic structures and the formation of quasiparticles in strongly correlated systems, thereby marking a notable advancement in plasmonics, emphasizing LSNO's compelling potential as a substitute material in optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Global Search Optics: Automatically Exploring Optimal Solutions to Compact Computational Imaging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The popularity of mobile vision creates a demand for advanced compact computational imaging systems, which call for the development of both a lightweight optical system and an effective image reconstruction model. Recently, joint design pipelines come to the research forefront, where the two significant components are simultaneously optimized via data-driven learning to realize the optimal system design. However, the effectiveness of these designs largely depends on the initial setup of the optical system, complicated by a non-convex solution space that impedes reaching a globally optimal solution. In this work, we present Global Search Optics (GSO) to automatically design compact computational imaging systems through two parts: (i) Fused Optimization Method for Automatic Optical Design (OptiFusion), which searches for diverse initial optical systems under certain design specifications; and (ii) Efficient Physic-aware Joint Optimization (EPJO), which conducts parallel joint optimization of initial optical systems and image reconstruction networks with the consideration of physical constraints, culminating in the selection of the optimal solution. Extensive experimental results on the design of three-piece (3P) sphere computational imaging systems illustrate that the GSO serves as a transformative end-to-end lens design paradigm for superior global optimal structure searching ability, which provides compact computational imaging systems with higher imaging quality compared to traditional methods. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/wumengshenyou/GSO.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Signature of the Superradiant Quantum Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement and quantum correlations between atoms are not usually considered key ingredients of the superradiant phase transition. Here we consider the Tavis-Cummings model, a solvable system of two-levels atoms, coupled with a single-mode quantized electromagnetic field. This system undergoes a superradiant phase transition, even in a finite-size framework, accompanied by a spontaneous symmetry breaking, and an infinite sequence of energy level crossings. We find approximated expressions for the ground state, its energy, and the position of the level crossings, valid in the limit of a very large number of photons with respect to that of the atoms. In that same limit, we find that the number of photons scales quadratically with the coupling strength, and linearly with the system size, providing a new insight into the superradiance phenomenon. Resorting to novel multipartite measures, we then demonstrate that this quantum phase transition is accompanied by a crossover in the quantum correlations and entanglement between the atoms (qubits). The latters therefore represent suited order parameters for this transition. Finally, we show that these properties of the quantum phase transition persist in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Negative transit time in non-tunneling electron transmission through graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond dynamics of electron transmission through atomically-thin crystalline films is studied with an {\em ab initio} scattering theory. The temporal character of the electron propagation through graphene multilayers is traced to the band structure of bulk graphite: In the forbidden gaps the wave packet transit time $\tau_\mathrm{T}$ saturates with thickness and in the allowed bands $\tau_\mathrm{T}$ oscillates following transmission resonances. Hitherto unknown negative transit time due to in-plane scattering is discovered in monolayers of graphene, h-BN, and oxygen. Moreover, Wigner time delay is found to diverge at the scattering resonances caused by the emergence of secondary diffracted beams. This offers a way to manipulate the propagation timing of the wave packet without sacrificing the transmitted intensity. The spatial reshaping of the wave packet at the resonances may help elucidate details of the streaking by an inhomogeneous field at the surface.</description>

      <title>Fast and label-free 3D virtual H&amp;E histology via active modulation-assisted dynamic full-field OCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pathological features are the gold standard for tumor diagnosis, guiding treatment and prognosis. However, standard histopathological process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, while frozen sections have lower accuracy. Dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography (D-FFOCT) offers rapid histologic information by measuring the subcellular dynamics of fresh, unprocessed tissues. However, D-FFOCT images suffer from abrupt shifts in hue and brightness, which is confusing for pathologists and diminish their interpretability and reliability. Here, we present active phase modulation-assisted D-FFOCT (APMD-FFOCT) to improve the imaging stability and enhance the contrast of static tissues. This enables us to further employ an unsupervised deep learning to convert APMD-FFOCT images into virtual hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained images for the first time. Three-dimensional (3D) virtual H&amp;E-stained images have been obtained at a scanning rate of 1 frame per second, as demonstrated in cancer diagnosis for human central nervous system and breast. The results prove that this new method will play a unique and important role in intraoperative histology.</description>

Abstract: Metasurfaces allow to manipulate light at the nanoscale. Integrating metasurfaces with transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers provides additional functionality to ultrathin optics, including tunable optical properties with enhanced light-matter interactions. In this work, we demonstrate the realization of a polaritonic metasurface utilizing the sizable light-matter coupling of excitons in monolayer WSe2 and the collective lattice resonances of nanoplasmonic gold arrays. To this end, we developed a novel fabrication method to integrate gold nanodisk arrays in hexagonal boron nitride and thus simultaneously ensure spectrally narrow exciton transitions and their immediate proximity to the near-field of array surface lattice resonances. In the regime of strong light-matter coupling, the resulting van der Waals metasurface exhibits all key characteristics of lattice polaritons, with a directional and linearly-polarized far-field emission profile dictated by the underlying nanoplasmonic lattice. Our work can be straightforwardly adapted to other lattice geometries, establishing structured van der Waals metasurfaces as means to engineer polaritonic lattices.</description>

      <title>Circular dichroism in perturbative harmonic generation in achiral nanostructures under vortex beam irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the nonlinear optical phenomena emerging from the interaction of vortex beams with achiral nanoparticles, leading to the observation of nonlinear circular dichroism in the perturbative high-harmonic generation. Despite the achiral symmetry of the nanoparticles, the interplay between the vector properties of the light, the symmetry of the nanoparticles, and the symmetry of the crystalline lattice of the nanoparticle material results in circular dichroism in the nonlinear regime. We derive a formula that describes the conditions for the appearance of circular dichroism across a broad range of scenarios, taking into account all the symmetries. We also show that the only the sign of the incident beam's total angular momentum projection plays role. We believe that this work provides important insights that can help improve the design process of chiral sensors, making them more versatile and effective.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional gradient force optical trapping in dielectric nanocavities by inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical trapping enables precise control of individual particles of different sizes, such as atoms, molecules, or nanospheres. Optical tweezers provide free-space omnidirectional optical trapping of objects in laboratories around the world. As an alternative to standard macroscopic setups based on lenses, which are inherently bound by the diffraction limit, plasmonic and photonic nanostructures promise trapping by near-field optical effects on the extreme nanoscale. However, the practical design of lossless waveguide-coupled nanostructures capable of trapping deeply sub-wavelength particles in all spatial directions using the gradient force has until now proven insurmountable. In this work, we demonstrate an omnidirectional optical trap realized by inverse-designing fabrication-ready integrated dielectric nanocavities. The sub-wavelength optical trap is designed to rely solely on the gradient force and is thus particle-size agnostic. In particular, we show how a nanometer-sized trapped particle experiences a force strong enough to overcome room-temperature thermal fluctuations. Furthermore, through the robust inverse design framework, we tailor manufacturable devices operating at near-infrared and optical frequencies. Our results open a new regime of levitated optical trapping by achieving a deep trapping potential capable of trapping single sub-wavelength particles in all directions using optical gradient forces. We anticipate potentially groundbreaking applications of the optimized optical trapping system for biomolecular analysis in aqueous environments, levitated cavity-optomechanics, and cold atom physics, constituting an important step towards realizing integrated bio-nanophotonics and mesoscopic quantum mechanical experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Spectral Phase Transfer in Four-Wave Mixing with Gas-filled Capillaries: A Trade-off Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four-wave mixing (FWM) in gas-filled hollow-core capillaries, a nonlinear optical process that mixes signal and pump photon frequencies to generate idler frequency photons, offers a method for precise spectral phase transfer from signal to idler at ultrashort timescales and extreme powers. However, this regime is challenged by competing linear and nonlinear dynamics, leading to significant trade-offs between spectral phase transfer and conversion efficiency. Our computational investigation focuses on upconversion of femtosecond pulses from the infrared (IR) to the ultraviolet (UV), a range notoriously difficult to manipulate. We explore an intermediate energy regime that strikes an optimal balance between FWM-mediated phase-transfer fidelity and nonlinear conversion efficiency. By adjusting the energy ratios and spectral phase profiles of the input signal, we achieve conversion efficiencies of approximately 5%-15% while maintaining an effectively quasi-linear spectral phase transfer. These findings contribute to establishing first-principles and scaling laws essential for applications such as high-precision imaging, spectroscopy, quantum transduction, and distributed entangled interconnects, facilitating advanced control of ultrafast photonic and electronic wavepackets in quantum materials with unprecedented spatial and temporal precision.</description>

      <title>Direct generation of time-energy-entangled W triphotons in atomic vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sources of entangled multiphotons are not only essential for fundamental tests of quantum foundations, but are also the cornerstone of a variety of optical quantum technologies today. Over past three decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to creating multiphoton entanglement by multiplexing existing biphoton sources with linear optics and postselections. Different from all previous protocols, here we report, for the first time, the observation of continuous-mode time-energy-entangled W-class triphotons with an unprecedented generation rate directly through the process of spontaneous six-wave mixing (SSWM) in a four-level triple-Lambda atomic vapor cell. Facilitated by electromagnetically induced transparency and coherence control, our SSWM scheme enables versatile narrowband triphoton generation with many intriguing properties including long temporal coherence and controllable waveforms, ideal for implementing long-distance quantum communications, networking, and information processing by interfacing photons and atoms. Most importantly, our work paves a way for the development of a reliable and efficient genuine triphoton source, thus making the research on multiphoton entanglement within easy reach.</description>

      <title>Realization of a programmable multi-purpose photonic quantum memory with over-thousand qubit manipulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks can enable various applications such as distributed quantum computing, long-distance quantum communication, and network-based quantum sensing with unprecedented performances. One of the most important building blocks for a quantum network is a photonic quantum memory which serves as the interface between the communication channel and the local functional unit. A programmable quantum memory which can process a large stream of flying qubits and fulfill the requirements of multiple core functions in a quantum network is still to-be-realized. Here we report a high-performance quantum memory which can simultaneously store 72 optical qubits carried by 144 spatially separated atomic ensembles and support up to a thousand consecutive write or read operations in a random access way, two orders of magnitude larger than the previous record. Due to the built-in programmability, this quantum memory can be adapted on-demand for several functions. As example applications, we realize quantum queue, stack, and buffer which closely resemble the counterpart devices for classical information processing. We further demonstrate the synchronization and reshuffle of 4 entangled pairs of photonic pulses with probabilistic arrival time and arbitrary release order via the memory, which is an essential requirement for the realization of quantum repeaters and efficient routing in quantum networks. Realization of this multi-purpose programmable quantum memory thus constitutes a key enabling building block for future large-scale fully-functional quantum networks.</description>

      <title>RCS reduction method with anomalous reflection metasurfaces using Floquet analysis : design modelling and measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes the design and measurement of a periodic metasurface that achieves anomalous reflection with reduced RCS in a given direction. A previous study proposed a semi-analytical model to predict the RCS behaviour of such a metasurface. This work focuses the discussion on manufacturing and measurement issues. The synthesis, design specifications, fabrication method and experimental setup are presented and discussed. Measurement results are also examined in detail, highlighting some limitations in metasurfaces RCS measurements. The proposed metasurface effectively achieves the predicted RCS level reduction in the Floquet direction considered. The agreement between simulation and experimental results demonstrates the accuracy of the modelling and the efficiency of the optimisation procedure.</description>
