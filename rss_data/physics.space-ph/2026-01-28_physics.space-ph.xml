      <title>Development of Electroformed X-ray Optics Bridging Synchrotron Technology and Space Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed X-ray telescope mirrors using an original electroforming replication technique established through the fabrication of millimeter-aperture, ultra-short-focal-length nanofocusing mirrors for synchrotron X-ray microscopy. This paper presents detailed results of X-ray illumination tests of a 60-mm-diameter, full-circumference, double-reflection monolithic electroformed nickel mirror and its Mirror Module Assembly (MMA). The experiments were conducted at the 1-km beamline BL29XUL at SPring-8. To simulate a parallel X-ray beam from celestial sources, we constructed a dedicated evaluation system, the High-Brilliance X-ray Kilometer-long Large-Area Expanded-beam Evaluation System (HBX-KLAEES). Owing to the high photon flux and the quasi-point-like source with a small divergence provided by HBX-KLAEES, the imaging performance was evaluated with high fidelity, resolving both the sharp core and large-angle components of the Point Spread Function (PSF). The results show an extremely sharp core with a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 0.7 arcsec and a Half Power Diameter (HPD) of 14 arcsec, even after integration into the MMA. In addition, a positive correlation was found between angular resolution and axial figure error in both the primary and secondary mirror sections, indicating that axial figure errors contribute to image degradation. Based on these results, the MMA was selected as one of the hard X-ray optics for the FOXSI-4 sounding rocket experiment, which performs high-resolution soft and hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy of solar flares and was successfully launched. These results demonstrate the potential for further improvements in angular resolution and the development of high-resolution, ultra-short focal length X-ray optics for small satellites, including CubeSats.</description>

      <title>Evolution of reconnection flux during eruption of magnetic flux ropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are powerful drivers of space weather, with magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) widely regarded as their primary precursors. However, the variation in reconnection flux during the evolution of MFR during CME eruptions remains poorly understood. In this paper, we develop a realistic 3D magneto-hydrodynamic model using which we explore the temporal evolution of reconnection flux during the MFR evolution using both numerical simulations and observational data. Our initial coronal configuration features an isothermal atmosphere and a potential arcade magnetic field beneath which an MFR emerges at the lower boundary. As the MFR rises, we observe significant stretching and compression of the overlying magnetic field beneath it. Magnetic reconnection begins with the gradual formation of a current sheet, eventually culminating with the impulsive expulsion of the flux rope. We analyze the temporal evolution of reconnection fluxes during two successive MFR eruptions while continuously emerging the twisted flux rope through the lower boundary. We also conduct a similar analysis using observational data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) for an eruptive event. Comparing our MHD simulation with observational data, we find that reconnection flux play a crucial role in determination of CME speeds. From the onset to the eruption, the reconnection flux shows a strong linear correlation with the velocity. This nearly realistic simulation of a solar eruption provides important insights into the complex dynamics of CME initiation and progression.</description>

      <title>Early solar wind and dynamo magnetic field topology predictions for (16) Psyche and other asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asteroid (16) Psyche is a metal-rich body that might record an ancient coherent magnetization if some relict crust or mantle is preserved. Herein, we use magnetohydrodynamic simulations to predict (16) Psyche's field topology for several distinct pathways, (i) an early solar wind-induced magnetization imparted after a larger body was impacted, forming the present-day asteroid, (ii) a core dynamo magnetization imparted in an asteroid that is either presently largely intact or was a rubble pile, and (iii) magnetization in the turbulent solar nebula disk. For pathway (i) we find the field to be predominantly dipolar and spin axis-aligned. For pathway (ii) we find the field to be either dipolar and spin axis-misaligned, or highly multipolar. We also find that (iii) a field produced earlier before the solar nebula cleared, would be highly multipolar. In cases (i) and (ii) we also place constraints on the field strength. Simple detection of a magnetic field without constraining its topology and temporal variability would be insufficient to confirm a remanent source, due to the influence of the present-day solar wind, electromagnetic induction, and (16) Psyche's high obliquity. For sufficiently strong fields however, the field topology and orientation may reveal key observable consequences of the nature and history of (16) Psyche. Our framework is also broadly applicable to the study of magnetic fields from other asteroids.</description>
