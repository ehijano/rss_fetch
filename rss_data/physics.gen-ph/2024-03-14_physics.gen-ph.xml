      <title>A Plausible Path Towards Unification of Interactions via Gauge Fields Consistent with the Equivalence Principle-I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extension of the Lorentz group to include generators $\Gamma^\mu$ carrying a space-time index is demonstrated to explicitly construct the Minkowski metric within the internal group space as a consequence of the non-vanishing commutation relations between those generators. For fundamental representation states, this group forms a subgroup of GL(4) consistent with Dirac fermions. Since the representations inherently pair particles with anti-particles, the generators define a minimal group for transforming fields that fundamentally satisfy microscopic causality, thus treating causality as a crucial physical property.
  For fermions transforming under GL(4), beyond three spin matrices and $\Gamma^0$ there are 12 additional hermitian generators. It is demonstrated that a closed invariance subgroup of SU(2)$\times$U(1) for fermions of defined mass can be constructed. However, any closed subgroup of SU(3) transformations necessarily mix the mass-SU(2) eigenstates. The first part of exploration of group representations presented in this paper examines associating global invariance to these additional generators. The extended group requires that any charges arising due to establishment of internal local symmetries necessarily exhibit geometric equivalence under curvilinear transformations on the parameterization of space-time translations. Furthermore, a formulation for mixing the degenerate massless fermions (which explicitly cannot manifest SU(3) symmetry or charges) while maintaining Lorentz invariance, is presented.</description>

      <title>Accounting for gauge symmetries in CHSH experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-examine the CHSH experiment, which we abstract here as a multi-round game played between two parties with each party reporting a single binary outcome at each round. We explore in particular the role that symmetries, and the spontaneous breaking thereof, play in determining the maximally achievable correlations between the two parties. We show, with the help of an explicit statistical model, that the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry allows for stronger correlations than those that can be achieved in its absence. We then demonstrate that spontaneous symmetry breaking may lead to a violation of the renowned CHSH inequality. We believe that the ideas presented in this paper open the door to novel research avenues that have the potential to deepen our understanding of the quantum formalism and the physical reality that it describes.</description>

      <title>A new theory bridging non-relativistic and QED-based path integrals unveils more than quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Feynman path integral plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics, offering significant insights into the interaction between classical action and propagators, and linking quantum electrodynamics (QED) with Feynman diagrams. However, the formulations of path integrals in classical quantum mechanics and QED are neither unified nor interconnected, suggesting the potential existence of an important bridging theory that could be key to solving existing puzzles in quantum mechanics. In this work, we delve into the theoretical consistency, completeness, and integration with established path integral theories, revealing this concealed path integral form. This newly uncovered form not only connects various path integral approaches but also demonstrates its potential in explaining quantum phenomena like the origin of spin and quantum nonlocal correlations. It transcends conventional quantum mechanics, proposing a more profound and fundamental physical principle.</description>

      <title>Quantum number conservation in meson interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum number descriptions of spin-zero mesons are obtained from their quark/anti-quark structures, extending the application of the already established seven quantum number conservation in fermion interactions to include mesons. This provides a new tool in the design of experiments and the analysis of results, making it particularly useful for those interactions that involve neutral mesons. One quantum number is parity, conflicting with the evidence for parity non-conservation. The origin of this disagreement is identified as the poor definition of parity in the Standard Model. It is shown that neutral mesons can produce inter-generational interactions, providing an alternative to the see-saw mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1608.05260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sidharth had shown that gravitation can be reconciled with electromagnetic and other forces if we start from a Landau-Ginzburg phase transition. This is further remarked upon and a unification of all forces of nature is proposed.</description>
