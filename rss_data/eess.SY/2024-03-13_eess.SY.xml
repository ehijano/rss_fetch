      <title>VLEIBot: A New 45-mg Swimming Microrobot Driven by a Bioinspired Anguilliform Propulsor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the VLEIBot^* (Very Little Eel-Inspired roBot), a 45-mg/23-mm^3 microrobotic swimmer that is propelled by a bioinspired anguilliform propulsor. The propulsor is excited by a single 6-mg high-work-density (HWD) microactuator and undulates periodically due to wave propagation phenomena generated by fluid-structure interaction (FSI) during swimming. The microactuator is composed of a carbon-fiber beam, which functions as a leaf spring, and shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires, which deform cyclically when excited periodically using Joule heating. The VLEIBot can swim at speeds as high as 15.1mm * s^{-1} (0.33 Bl * s^{-1}}) when driven with a heuristically-optimized propulsor. To improve maneuverability, we evolved the VLEIBot design into the 90-mg/47-mm^3 VLEIBot^+, which is driven by two propulsors and fully controllable in the two-dimensional (2D) space. The VLEIBot^+ can swim at speeds as high as 16.1mm * s^{-1} (0.35 Bl * s^{-1}), when driven with heuristically-optimized propulsors, and achieves turning rates as high as 0.28 rad * s^{-1}, when tracking path references. The measured root-mean-square (RMS) values of the tracking errors are as low as 4 mm.</description>

      <title>Learning-Aided Control of Robotic Tether-Net with Maneuverable Nodes to Capture Large Space Debris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maneuverable tether-net systems launched from an unmanned spacecraft offer a promising solution for the active removal of large space debris. Guaranteeing the successful capture of such space debris is dependent on the ability to reliably maneuver the tether-net system -- a flexible, many-DoF (thus complex) system -- for a wide range of launch scenarios. Here, scenarios are defined by the relative location of the debris with respect to the chaser spacecraft. This paper represents and solves this problem as a hierarchically decentralized implementation of robotic trajectory planning and control and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach when applied to two different tether-net systems, with 4 and 8 maneuverable units (MUs), respectively. Reinforcement learning (policy gradient) is used to design the centralized trajectory planner that, based on the relative location of the target debris at the launch of the net, computes the final aiming positions of each MU, from which their trajectory can be derived. Each MU then seeks to follow its assigned trajectory by using a decentralized PID controller that outputs the MU's thrust vector and is informed by noisy sensor feedback (for realism) of its relative location. System performance is assessed in terms of capture success and overall fuel consumption by the MUs. Reward shaping and surrogate models are used to respectively guide and speed up the RL process. Simulation-based experiments show that this approach allows the successful capture of debris at fuel costs that are notably lower than nominal baselines, including in scenarios where the debris is significantly off-centered compared to the approaching chaser spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Gain Scheduling using Reinforcement Learning for Quadcopter Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a technique using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt the control gains of a quadcopter controller. Specifically, we employed Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train a policy which adapts the gains of a cascaded feedback controller in-flight. The primary goal of this controller is to minimize tracking error while following a specified trajectory. The paper's key objective is to analyze the effectiveness of the adaptive gain policy and compare it to the performance of a static gain control algorithm, where the Integral Squared Error and Integral Time Squared Error are used as metrics. The results show that the adaptive gain scheme achieves over 40$\%$ decrease in tracking error as compared to the static gain controller.</description>

      <title>GMPC: Geometric Model Predictive Control for Wheeled Mobile Robot Trajectory Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The configuration of most robotic systems lies in continuous transformation groups. However, in mobile robot trajectory tracking, many recent works still naively utilize optimization methods for elements in vector space without considering the manifold constraint of the robot configuration. In this letter, we propose a geometric model predictive control (MPC) framework for wheeled mobile robot trajectory tracking. We first derive the error dynamics of the wheeled mobile robot trajectory tracking by considering its manifold constraint and kinematic constraint simultaneously. After that, we utilize the relationship between the Lie group and Lie algebra to convexify the tracking control problem, which enables us to solve the problem efficiently. Thanks to the Lie group formulation, our method tracks the trajectory more smoothly than existing nonlinear MPC. Simulations and physical experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Our pure Python-based simulation platform is publicly available to benefit further research in the community.</description>

      <title>On the locomotion of the slider within a self-adaptive beam-slider system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A beam-slider system is considered whose passive self-adaption relies on an intricate locomotion process involving both frictional and unilateral contact. The system also exploits geometric nonlinearity to achieve broadband efficacy. The dynamics of the system take place on three distinct time scales: On the fast time scale of the harmonic base excitation are the vibrations and the locomotion cycle. On the slow time scale, the slider changes its position along the beam, and the overall vibration level varies. Finally, on an intermediate time scale, strong modulations of the vibration amplitude may take place. In the present work, first, an analytical approximation of the beam's response on the slow time scale is derived as function of the slider position, which is a crucial prerequisite for identifying the main drivers of the slider's locomotion. Then, the most important forms of locomotion are described and approximations of their individual contribution to the overall slider transport are estimated. Finally, the theoretical results are compared against numerical results obtained from an experimentally validated model.</description>

      <title>Humans-in-the-Building: Getting Rid of Thermostats for Optimal Thermal Comfort Control in Energy Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the widespread attention to individual thermal comfort, coupled with significant energy-saving potential inherent in energy management systems for optimizing indoor environments, this paper aims to introduce advanced "Humans-in-the-building" control techniques to redefine the paradigm of indoor temperature design. Firstly, we innovatively redefine the role of individuals in the control loop, establishing a model for users' thermal comfort and constructing discomfort signals based on individual preferences. Unlike traditional temperature-centric approaches, "thermal comfort control" prioritizes personalized comfort. Then, considering the diversity among users, we propose a novel method to determine the optimal indoor temperature range, thus minimizing discomfort for various users and reducing building energy consumption. Finally, the efficacy of the "thermal comfort control" approach is substantiated through simulations conducted using Matlab.</description>

      <title>Energy versus Output Quality of Non-volatile Writes in Intermittent Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how to improve the energy performance of battery-less Internet of Things (IoT) devices at the cost of a reduction in the quality of the output. Battery-less IoT devices are extremely resource-constrained energy-harvesting devices. Due to erratic energy patterns from the ambient, their executions become intermittent; periods of active computation are interleaved by periods of recharging small energy buffers. To cross periods of energy unavailability, a device persists application and system state onto Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) in anticipation of energy failures. We purposely control the energy invested in these operations, representing a major energy overhead, when using Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Random-Access Memory (STT-MRAM) as NVM. As a result, we abate the corresponding overhead, yet introduce write errors. Based on 1.9+ trillion experimental data points, we illustrate whether this is a gamble worth taking, when, and where. We measure the energy consumption and quality of output obtained from the execution of nine diverse benchmarks on top of seven different platforms. Our results allow us to draw three key observations: i) the trade-off between energy saving and reduction of output quality is program-specific; ii) the same trade-off is a function of a platform's specific compute efficiency and power figures; and iii) data encoding and input size impact a program's resilience to errors. As a paradigmatic example, we reveal cases where we achieve up to 50% reduction in energy consumption with negligible effects on output quality, as opposed to settings where a minimal energy gain causes drastic drops in output quality.</description>

      <title>Distributed Estimation by Two Agents with Different Feature Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimation of a function by two agents (and a fusion center) given local data. Data comprises of samples of an independent variable and the corresponding value of a dependent variable. The agents are given a set of features using which they construct suitable function spaces to formulate and solve the estimation problem. The estimated functions are to be uploaded to a fusion space where they are fused to obtain the system estimate of the mapping and then downloaded by the agents to gather knowledge about the other agents estimate of the function. To this end, we present the following: a systematic construction of fusion space given the features of the agents; the derivation of an uploading operator for the agents to upload their estimated functions to a fusion space; an optimization problem in the fusion space to fuse the functions uploaded; the derivation of a downloading operator for the fused function to be downloaded. Through an example on least squares regression, we demonstrate the distributed estimation architecture that has been developed.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Load Shifting for Optimal Compressor Sequencing in Industrial Refrigeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ubiquity and energy needs of industrial refrigeration has prompted several research studies investigating various control opportunities for reducing energy demand. This work focuses on one such opportunity, termed compressor sequencing, which entails intelligently selecting the operational state of the compressors to service the required refrigeration load with the least possible work. We first study the static compressor sequencing problem and observe that deriving the optimal compressor operational state is computationally challenging and can vary dramatically based on the refrigeration load. Thus we introduce load shifting in conjunction with compressor sequencing, which entails strategically precooling the facility to allow for more efficient compressor operation. Interestingly, we show that load shifting not only provides benefits in computing the optimal compressor operational state, but also can lead to significant energy savings. Our results are based on and compared to real-world sensor data from an operating industrial refrigeration site of Butterball LLC located in Huntsville, AR, which demonstrated that without load shifting, even optimal compressor operation results in compressors often running at intermediate capacity levels, which can lead to inefficiencies. Through collected data, we demonstrate that a load shifting approach for compressor sequencing has the potential to reduce energy use of the compressors up to 20% compared to optimal sequencing without load shifting.</description>

      <title>On Modeling Adequacy and Stability Analysis of IBR-related Subsynchronous Oscillations in Multimachine Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying phasor-based analysis of subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) involving grid-following converters (GFLCs) and its benchmarking with electromagnetic transient (EMT) models have so far been restricted to highly simplified grid models with constant voltage sources behind series R-L circuits. In this paper, modeling adequacy of bulk power systems with synchronous generators (SGs), transmission systems, loads, and GFLCs are considered. To this end, we revisit the notions of time-varying phasor calculus, highlighting the distinction between space-phasor-calculus (SPC) and two often interchangeably used frameworks namely baseband-abc and generalized averaging. We present the models of grids in SPC framework that include transmission line dynamics, load dynamics, and SG stator transients. Next, we propose a generic approach to study modeling adequacy in small-signal sense by (a) identifying critical modes through eigenvalue and singular value analysis followed by (b) using weighted maximum singular value error magnitudes as metrics, and (c) further cross-validation. Using a modified 4-machine IEEE benchmark model with up to 3 GFLCs we show that SPC framework can be used for analysis of SSOs. Further, we consider the quasistationary phasor calculus (QPC) framework that neglects transmission line, load, and SG stator dynamics to show its adequacy in SSO modeling and analysis. Time-domain and frequency-domain results with EMT models are also presented.</description>

      <title>Improving Fairness in Photovoltaic Curtailments via Daily Topology Reconfiguration for Voltage Control in Power Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In PV-rich power distribution systems, over-voltage issues are often addressed by curtailing excess generation from PV plants (in addition to reactive power control), raising fairness concerns. Existing fairness-aware control schemes tackle this problem by incorporating fairness objectives into the cost function. However, such schemes result in increased overall curtailments. This paper proposes a solution through daily topology reconfiguration, ensuring that different PV plants face varying grid conditions each day, leading to different curtailment levels and enhancing fairness. We illustrate that implementing this approach enhances overall fairness without significantly increasing overall curtailments. The optimization problem involves two stages. The day-ahead stage optimizes the network topology using day-ahead forecasts of PV generation and demand, minimizing net curtailment and accounting for fairness based on curtailments from prior days. The real-time stage implements the optimized topology and computes active and reactive power setpoints for the PV plants. Day-ahead grid constraints are modeled using LinDistFlow, and real-time control employs a linearized model with a first-order Taylor approximation. The proposed scheme is numerically validated on several benchmark test cases. Results are compared using the Jain Fairness Index, considering fairness and reconfiguration scenarios.</description>

      <title>Automatic driving lane change safety prediction model based on LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving technology can improve traffic safety and reduce traffic accidents. In addition, it improves traffic flow, reduces congestion, saves energy and increases travel efficiency. In the relatively mature automatic driving technology, the automatic driving function is divided into several modules: perception, decision-making, planning and control, and a reasonable division of labor can improve the stability of the system. Therefore, autonomous vehicles need to have the ability to predict the trajectory of surrounding vehicles in order to make reasonable decision planning and safety measures to improve driving safety. By using deep learning method, a safety-sensitive deep learning model based on short term memory (LSTM) network is proposed. This model can alleviate the shortcomings of current automatic driving trajectory planning, and the output trajectory not only ensures high accuracy but also improves safety. The cell state simulation algorithm simulates the trackability of the trajectory generated by this model. The research results show that compared with the traditional model-based method, the trajectory prediction method based on LSTM network has obvious advantages in predicting the trajectory in the long time domain. The intention recognition module considering interactive information has higher prediction and accuracy, and the algorithm results show that the trajectory is very smooth based on the premise of safe prediction and efficient lane change. And autonomous vehicles can efficiently and safely complete lane changes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modal analysis and control of a nonlinear dynamical system, participation factors of state variables with respect to a mode of interest serve as pivotal tools for stability studies. Linear participation factors are uniquely determined by the mode's shape and composition, which are defined by the right and left eigenvectors of the linearized model. For nonlinear participation factors as well as five other variants of participation factors, this paper finds the sufficient conditions for them to be unique against scaling factors on the shape and composition of a mode. Besides, the similarity between the scaling factor and perturbation amplitude is also discussed.</description>

      <title>MPS: A New Method for Selecting the Stable Closed-Loop Equilibrium Attitude-Error Quaternion of a UAV During Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present model predictive selection (MPS), a new method for selecting the stable closed-loop (CL) equilibrium attitude-error quaternion (AEQ) of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) during the execution of high-speed yaw maneuvers. In this approach, we minimize the cost of yawing measured with a performance figure of merit (PFM) that takes into account both the aerodynamic-torque control input and attitude-error state of the UAV. Specifically, this method uses a control law with a term whose sign is dynamically switched in real time to select, between two options, the torque associated with the lesser cost of rotation as predicted by a dynamical model of the UAV derived from first principles. This problem is relevant because the selection of the stable CL equilibrium AEQ significantly impacts the performance of a UAV during high-speed rotational flight, from both the power and control-error perspectives. To test and demonstrate the functionality and performance of the proposed method, we present data collected during one hundred real-time high-speed yaw-tracking flight experiments. These results highlight the superior capabilities of the proposed MPS-based scheme when compared to a benchmark controller commonly used in aerial robotics, as the PFM used to quantify the cost of flight is reduced by 60.30 %, on average. To our best knowledge, these are the first flight-test results that thoroughly demonstrate, evaluate, and compare the performance of a real-time controller capable of selecting the stable CL equilibrium AEQ during operation.</description>

      <title>Long-term Hydrothermal Bid-based Market Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating long-term hydrothermal bid-based markets considering strategic agents is a challenging task. The representation of strategic agents considering inter-temporal constraints within a stochastic framework brings additional complexity to the already difficult single-period bilevel, thus, non-convex, optimal bidding problem. Thus, we propose a simulation methodology that effectively addresses these challenges for large-scale hydrothermal power systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through a case study with real data from the large-scale Brazilian power system. In the case studies, we show the effects of market concentration in power systems and how contracts can be used to mitigate them. In particular, we show how market power might affect the current setting in Brazil. The developed method can strongly benefit policy makers, market monitors, and market designers as simulations can be used to understand existing power systems and experiment with alternative designs.</description>

      <title>Verification-Aided Learning of Neural Network Barrier Functions with Termination Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barrier functions are a general framework for establishing a safety guarantee for a system. However, there is no general method for finding these functions. To address this shortcoming, recent approaches use self-supervised learning techniques to learn these functions using training data that are periodically generated by a verification procedure, leading to a verification-aided learning framework. Despite its immense potential in automating barrier function synthesis, the verification-aided learning framework does not have termination guarantees and may suffer from a low success rate of finding a valid barrier function in practice. In this paper, we propose a holistic approach to address these drawbacks. With a convex formulation of the barrier function synthesis, we propose to first learn an empirically well-behaved NN basis function and then apply a fine-tuning algorithm that exploits the convexity and counterexamples from the verification failure to find a valid barrier function with finite-step termination guarantees: if there exist valid barrier functions, the fine-tuning algorithm is guaranteed to find one in a finite number of iterations. We demonstrate that our fine-tuning method can significantly boost the performance of the verification-aided learning framework on examples of different scales and using various neural network verifiers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a first-order cooperative system of interacting agents converges to consensus if the so-called Persistence Excitation condition holds. This condition requires that the interaction function between any pair of agents satisfies an integral lower bound. The interpretation is that the interaction needs to ensure a minimal amount of service.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Approximate Byzantine Consensus: A Multi-hop Relay Method and Tight Graph Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a multi-agent resilient consensus problem, where some agents are of the Byzantine type and try to prevent the normal ones from reaching consensus. In our setting, normal agents communicate with each other asynchronously over multi-hop relay channels with delays. To solve this asynchronous Byzantine consensus problem, we develop the multi-hop weighted mean subsequence reduced (MW-MSR) algorithm. The main contribution is that we characterize a tight graph condition for our algorithm to achieve Byzantine consensus, which is expressed in the novel notion of strictly robust graphs. We show that the multi-hop communication is effective for enhancing the network's resilience against Byzantine agents. As a result, we also obtain novel conditions for resilient consensus under the malicious attack model, which are tighter than those known in the literature. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of the conventional flooding-based algorithms, with less computational complexity. Lastly, we provide numerical examples to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Tightly Bounded Polynomials via Flexible Discretizations for Dynamic Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polynomials are widely used to represent the trajectories of states and/or inputs. It has been shown that a polynomial can be bounded by its coefficients, when expressed in the Bernstein basis. However, in general, the bounds provided by the Bernstein coefficients are not tight. We propose a method for obtaining numerical solutions to dynamic optimization problems, where a flexible discretization is used to achieve tight polynomial bounds. The proposed method is used to solve a constrained cart-pole swing-up optimal control problem. The flexible discretization eliminates the conservatism of the Bernstein bounds and enables a lower cost, in comparison with non-flexible discretizations. A theoretical result on obtaining tight polynomial bounds with a finite discretization is presented. In some applications with linear dynamics, the non-convexity introduced by the flexible discretization may be a drawback.</description>

      <title>Mesh Refinement with Early Termination for Dynamic Feasibility Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel early-terminating mesh refinement strategy using an integrated residual method to solve dynamic feasibility problems. As a generalization of direct collocation, the integrated residual method is used to approximate an infinite-dimensional problem into a sequence of finite-dimensional optimization subproblems. Each subproblem in the sequence is a finer approximation of the previous. It is shown that these subproblems need not be solved to a high precision; instead, an early termination procedure can determine when mesh refinement should be performed. The new refinement strategy, applied to an inverted pendulum swing-up problem, outperforms a conventional refinement method by up to a factor of three in function evaluations.</description>

      <title>Dual Control of Exploration and Exploitation for Auto-Optimisation Control with Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest for optimal operation in environments with unknowns and uncertainties is highly desirable but critically challenging across numerous fields. This paper develops a dual control framework for exploration and exploitation (DCEE) to solve an auto-optimisation problem in such complex settings. In general, there is a fundamental conflict between tracking an unknown optimal operational condition and parameter identification. The DCEE framework stands out by eliminating the need for additional perturbation signals, a common requirement in existing adaptive control methods. Instead, it inherently incorporates an exploration mechanism, actively probing the uncertain environment to diminish belief uncertainty. An ensemble based multi-estimator approach is developed to learn the environmental parameters and in the meanwhile quantify the estimation uncertainty in real time. The control action is devised with dual effects, which not only minimises the tracking error between the current state and the believed unknown optimal operational condition but also reduces belief uncertainty by proactively exploring the environment. Formal properties of the proposed DCEE framework like convergence are established. A numerical example is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed DCEE. Simulation results for maximum power point tracking are provided to further demonstrate the potential of this new framework in real world applications.</description>

      <title>AC Power Flow Feasibility Restoration via a State Estimation-Based Post-Processing Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for restoring AC power flow feasibility from solutions to simplified optimal power flow (OPF) problems, including convex relaxations, power flow approximations, and machine learning (ML) models. The proposed algorithm employs a state estimation-based post-processing technique in which voltage phasors, power injections, and line flows from solutions to relaxed, approximated, or ML-based OPF problems are treated similarly to noisy measurements in a state estimation algorithm. The algorithm leverages information from various quantities to obtain feasible voltage phasors and power injections that satisfy the AC power flow equations. Weight and bias parameters are computed offline using an adaptive stochastic gradient descent method. By automatically learning the trustworthiness of various outputs from simplified OPF problems, these parameters inform the online computations of the state estimation-based algorithm to both recover feasible solutions and characterize the performance of power flow approximations, relaxations, and ML models. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can simultaneously utilize combined solutions from different relaxations, approximations, and ML models to enhance performance. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed algorithm, with solutions that are both AC power flow feasible and much closer to the true AC OPF solutions than alternative methods, often by several orders of magnitude in the squared two-norm loss function.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the conservatism and regret of distributionally robust (DR) stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) when using moment-based ambiguity sets for modeling unknown uncertainties. To quantify the conservatism, we compare the deterministic constraint tightening while taking a DR approach against the optimal tightening when the exact distributions of the stochastic uncertainties are known. Furthermore, we quantify the regret by comparing the performance when the distributions of the stochastic uncertainties are known and unknown. Analysing the accumulated sub-optimality of SMPC due to the lack of knowledge about the true distributions of the uncertainties marks the novel contribution of this work.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Parameters of the DC Power Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many power system operation and planning problems use the DC power flow approximation to address computational challenges from the nonlinearity of the AC power flow equations. The DC power flow simplifies the AC power flow equations to a linear form that relates active power flows to phase angle differences across branches, parameterized by coefficients based on the branches' susceptances. Inspired by techniques for training machine learning models, this paper proposes an algorithm that seeks optimal coefficient and bias parameters to improve the DC power flow approximation's accuracy. Specifically, the proposed algorithm selects the coefficient and bias parameter values that minimize the discrepancy, across a specified set of operational scenarios, between the power flows given by the DC approximation and the power flows from the AC equations. Gradient-based optimization methods like Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), Limited-Memory BFGS (L-BFGS), and Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) enable solution of the proposed algorithm for large systems. After an off-line training phase, the optimized parameters are used to improve the accuracy of the DC power flow during on-line computations. Numerical results show several orders of magnitude improvements in accuracy relative to a hot-start DC power flow approximation across a range of test cases.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Cross-Phase Effects of Reactive Power Intervention on Distribution Voltage Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing photovoltaic (PV) penetration in the distribution system can often lead to voltage violations. Mitigation of these violations requires reactive power intervention from PV inverters. However, the unbalanced nature of the distribution system leads to mixed effects on the voltages of nearby nodes for each inverter injecting or absorbing reactive power. In particular, reactive power absorption to reduce over-voltage in one phase can exacerbate over-voltage in a different phase. In this paper, the factors impacting the incremental and decremental voltage effects of reactive power intervention are analyzed in detail. The result of these effects on the distribution system performance is presented to highlight their significance and the need to factor them in for any coordinated voltage control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Bias-Compensated State of Charge and State of Health Joint Estimation for Lithium Iron Phosphate Batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of the state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) is crucial for the safe and reliable operation of batteries. Voltage measurement bias highly affects state estimation accuracy, especially in Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries, which are susceptible due to their flat open-circuit voltage (OCV) curves. This work introduces a bias-compensated algorithm to reliably estimate the SOC and SOH of LFP batteries under the influence of voltage measurement bias. Specifically, SOC and SOH are estimated using the Dual Extended Kalman Filter (DEKF) in the high-slope SOC range, where voltage measurement bias effects are weak. Besides, the voltage measurement biases estimated in the low-slope SOC regions are compensated in the following joint estimation of SOC and SOH to enhance the state estimation accuracy further. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the traditional method, which does not consider biases under different temperatures and aging conditions. Additionally, the bias-compensated algorithm can achieve low estimation errors of below 1.5% for SOC and 2% for SOH, even with a 30mV voltage measurement bias. Finally, even if the voltage measurement biases change in operation, the proposed algorithm can remain robust and keep the estimated errors of states around 2%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring stability of discrete-time (DT) linear parameter-varying (LPV) input-output (IO) models estimated via system identification methods is a challenging problem as known stability constraints can only be numerically verified, e.g., through solving Linear Matrix Inequalities. In this paper, an unconstrained DT-LPV-IO parameterization is developed which gives a stable model for any choice of model parameters. To achieve this, it is shown that all quadratically stable DT-LPV-IO models can be generated by a mapping of transformed coefficient functions that are constrained to the unit ball, i.e., a small-gain condition. The unit ball is then reparameterized through a Cayley transformation, resulting in an unconstrained parameterization of all quadratically stable DT-LPV-IO models. As a special case, an unconstrained parameterization of all stable DT linear time-invariant transfer functions is obtained. Identification using the stable DT-LPV-IO model with neural network coefficient functions is demonstrated on a simulation example of a position-varying mass-damper-spring system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently solving unbalanced three-phase power flow in distribution grids is pivotal for grid analysis and simulation. There is a pressing need for scalable algorithms capable of handling large-scale unbalanced power grids that can provide accurate and fast solutions. To address this, deep learning techniques, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have emerged. However, existing literature primarily focuses on balanced networks, leaving a critical gap in supporting unbalanced three-phase power grids. This letter introduces PowerFlowMultiNet, a novel multigraph GNN framework explicitly designed for unbalanced three-phase power grids. The proposed approach models each phase separately in a multigraph representation, effectively capturing the inherent asymmetry in unbalanced grids. A graph embedding mechanism utilizing message passing is introduced to capture spatial dependencies within the power system network. PowerFlowMultiNet outperforms traditional methods and other deep learning approaches in terms of accuracy and computational speed. Rigorous testing reveals significantly lower error rates and a notable hundredfold increase in computational speed for large power networks compared to model-based methods.</description>

      <title>BEACON: A Bayesian Evolutionary Approach for Counterexample Generation of Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rigorous safety verification of control systems in critical applications is essential, given their increasing complexity and integration into everyday life. Simulation-based falsification approaches play a pivotal role in the safety verification of control systems, particularly within critical applications. These methods systematically explore the operational space of systems to identify configurations that result in violations of safety specifications. However, the effectiveness of traditional simulation-based falsification is frequently limited by the high dimensionality of the search space and the substantial computational resources required for exhaustive exploration. This paper presents BEACON, a novel framework that enhances the falsification process through a combination of Bayesian optimization and covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy. By exploiting quantitative metrics to evaluate how closely a system adheres to safety specifications, BEACON advances the state-of-the-art in testing methodologies. It employs a model-based test point selection approach, designed to facilitate exploration across dynamically evolving search zones to efficiently uncover safety violations. Our findings demonstrate that BEACON not only locates a higher percentage of counterexamples compared to standalone BO but also achieves this with significantly fewer simulations than required by CMA-ES, highlighting its potential to optimize the verification process of control systems. This framework offers a promising direction for achieving thorough and resource-efficient safety evaluations, ensuring the reliability of control systems in critical applications.</description>

      <title>Improved Exploration for Safety-Embedded Differential Dynamic Programming Using Tolerant Barrier States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Tolerant Discrete Barrier States (T-DBaS), a novel safety-embedding technique for trajectory optimization with enhanced exploratory capabilities. The proposed approach generalizes the standard discrete barrier state (DBaS) method by accommodating temporary constraint violation during the optimization process while still approximating its safety guarantees. Consequently, the proposed approach eliminates the DBaS's safe nominal trajectories assumption, while enhancing its exploration effectiveness for escaping local minima. Towards applying T-DBaS to safety-critical autonomous robotics, we combine it with Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP), leading to the proposed safe trajectory optimization method T-DBaS-DDP, which inherits the convergence and scalability properties of the solver. The effectiveness of the T-DBaS algorithm is verified on differential drive robot and quadrotor simulations. In addition, we compare against the classical DBaS-DDP as well as Augmented-Lagrangian DDP (AL-DDP) in extensive numerical comparisons that demonstrate the proposed method's competitive advantages. Finally, the applicability of the proposed approach is verified through hardware experiments on the Georgia Tech Robotarium platform.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Riemannian Conjugate Gradient Method on the Stiefel Manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conjugate gradient method is a crucial first-order optimization method that generally converges faster than the steepest descent method, and its computational cost is much lower than that of second-order methods. However, while various types of conjugate gradient methods have been studied in Euclidean spaces and on Riemannian manifolds, there is little study for those in distributed scenarios. This paper proposes a decentralized Riemannian conjugate gradient descent (DRCGD) method that aims at minimizing a global function over the Stiefel manifold. The optimization problem is distributed among a network of agents, where each agent is associated with a local function, and the communication between agents occurs over an undirected connected graph. Since the Stiefel manifold is a non-convex set, a global function is represented as a finite sum of possibly non-convex (but smooth) local functions. The proposed method is free from expensive Riemannian geometric operations such as retractions, exponential maps, and vector transports, thereby reducing the computational complexity required by each agent. To the best of our knowledge, DRCGD is the first decentralized Riemannian conjugate gradient algorithm to achieve global convergence over the Stiefel manifold.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces a preference learning method that ensures adherence to given specifications, with an application to autonomous vehicles. Our approach incorporates the priority ordering of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulas describing traffic rules into a learning framework. By leveraging Parametric Weighted Signal Temporal Logic (PWSTL), we formulate the problem of safety-guaranteed preference learning based on pairwise comparisons and propose an approach to solve this learning problem. Our approach finds a feasible valuation for the weights of the given PWSTL formula such that, with these weights, preferred signals have weighted quantitative satisfaction measures greater than their non-preferred counterparts. The feasible valuation of weights given by our approach leads to a weighted STL formula that can be used in correct-and-custom-by-construction controller synthesis. We demonstrate the performance of our method with a pilot human subject study in two different simulated driving scenarios involving a stop sign and a pedestrian crossing. Our approach yields competitive results compared to existing preference learning methods in terms of capturing preferences and notably outperforms them when safety is considered.</description>

      <title>Goal-Reaching Trajectory Design Near Danger with Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15604</link>

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots must maintain safety, but should not sacrifice performance, leading to the classical reach-avoid problem. This paper seeks to compute trajectory plans for which a robot is guaranteed to reach a goal and avoid obstacles in the specific near-danger case that the obstacles and goal are near each other. The proposed method builds off of a common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing safe planning approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models, but this introduces additional numerical approximation error and thereby conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. With PARC, the main source of conservativeness is the model mismatch, which can be mitigated by careful controller and planning model design. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach-avoid methods in near-danger goal-reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers.</description>

      <title>DeepSafeMPC: Deep Learning-Based Model Predictive Control for Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safe Multi-agent reinforcement learning (safe MARL) has increasingly gained attention in recent years, emphasizing the need for agents to not only optimize the global return but also adhere to safety requirements through behavioral constraints. Some recent work has integrated control theory with multi-agent reinforcement learning to address the challenge of ensuring safety. However, there have been only very limited applications of Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods in this domain, primarily due to the complex and implicit dynamics characteristic of multi-agent environments. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method called Deep Learning-Based Model Predictive Control for Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DeepSafeMPC). The key insight of DeepSafeMPC is leveraging a entralized deep learning model to well predict environmental dynamics. Our method applies MARL principles to search for optimal solutions. Through the employment of MPC, the actions of agents can be restricted within safe states concurrently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using the Safe Multi-agent MuJoCo environment, showcasing significant advancements in addressing safety concerns in MARL.</description>
