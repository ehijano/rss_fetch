      <title>Survival probability for jump processes in unbounded domains on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large time behavior of the survival probability $\mathbb{P}_x\left(\tau_D&gt;t\right)$ for symmetric jump processes in unbounded domains with a positive bottom of the spectrum. We prove asymptotic upper and lower bounds with explicit constants in terms of the bottom of the spectrum $\lambda(D)$. Our main result applies to symmetric jump processes in general metric measure spaces. For $\alpha$-stable processes in unbounded uniformly $C^{1,1}$ domains, our results provide a probabilistic interpretation and an equivalent geometric condition for $\lambda(D)&gt;0$. In the case of increasing horn-shaped domains, the exponential rate of decay for the survival probability is sharp. We also present examples of unbounded domains where our results apply.</description>

      <title>Reversible birth-and-death dynamics in continuum: free-energy dissipation and attractor properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider continuous-time birth-and-death dynamics in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that admit at least one infinite-volume Gibbs point process based on area interactions as a reversible measure. For a large class of starting measures, we show that the specific relative entropy decays along trajectories, and that all possible long-time weak limit points are also Gibbs point processes with respect to the same interaction. Our proof rests on a representation of the entropy dissipation in terms of the Palm version of the propagated measure.</description>

      <title>Existence for low-regularity McKean-Vlasov dynamics via emergence of regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of solutions to common noise McKean-Vlasov martingale problems for coefficients with low regularity. Our approach is able to handle the key challenge posed by drift coefficients that are discontinuous with respect to the narrow convergence of measures. This case arises for e.g. singular interactions. Our proof strategy proceeds via a two-step approximation using smoothed McKean-Vlasov $n$-particle systems: We first pass to the large system limit by taking $n\to \infty$, and subsequently remove the smoothing. A novel aspect of our work is the use of a crucial emergence of regularity property. It ensures that after the first limit, we obtain a process of measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and provides quantitative integrability bounds on their densities. We use this regularity to establish a tightness result in a stronger topology than is typically considered. In this way we obtain a sufficiently strong mode of convergence that lets us subsequently remove the smoothing and solve the McKean-Vlasov martingale problem via the particle system approximations.</description>

      <title>Rates of Bulk Convergence for Ensembles of Classical Compact Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers random matrices distributed according to Haar measure in different classical compact groups. Utilizing the determinantal point structures of their nontrivial eigenangles, with respect to the $L_1$-Wasserstein distance, we obtain the rate of convergence for different ensembles to the sine point process when the dimension of matrices $N$ is sufficiently large. Specifically, the rate is roughly of order $N^{-2}$ on the unitary group and of order $N^{-1}$ on the orthogonal group and the compact symplectic group.</description>

      <title>Short proof of the conditioning property for multi-dimensional Poisson point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poisson processes and one-dimensional Poisson point processes satisfy three main properties: superposition, thinning, and conditioning. The proof of the first two relies on basic estimates involving the Poisson distribution that are also true for multi-dimensional Poisson point processes. In contrast, the proof of conditioning uses that the distances between consecutive occurrences in time or entities in space are independent and exponentially distributed, which is nonsensical in higher dimensions. This paper gives a short proof of the conditioning property for multi-dimensional Poisson point processes.</description>

      <title>Relative compactness of It\^o integrals on the M1 Skorokhod space with identification of limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish general results for weak relative compactness of sequences of It\^o integrals with respect to Skorohod's functional M1 topology, under general conditions. Moreover, we are able to explicitly characterise the form of the limit points of all convergent subsequences. This result closes a longstanding gap in the literature, where weak relative compactness had previously only been shown under the significantly more restrictive J1 topology, or the S topology which is too coarse to preserve continuity for most common functionals.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Dimensional Stochastic Differential Equations and Diffusion Dynamics of Coulomb Random Point Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic dynamics of infinite particle systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$ interacting through the $d$-dimensional Coulomb potential. For arbitrary inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and all dimensions $d\ge2$, we construct solutions to the associated infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations (ISDEs). Our main results establish the existence of strong solutions and their pathwise uniqueness. The resulting labeled process is an $(\mathbb{R}^d)^N$-valued diffusion with no invariant measure, while the associated unlabeled process is reversible with respect to the Coulomb random point field. Furthermore, we prove that finite-particle systems converge to these infinite-particle dynamics, thereby providing a rigorous foundation for Coulomb interacting Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Functional limit theorems for random Lebesgue-Stieltjes convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove joint functional limit theorems in the Skorokhod space equipped with the $J_1$-topology for successive Lebesgue-Stieltjes convolutions of nondecreasing stochastic processes with themselves. These convolutions arise naturally in coupled branching random walks, where the displacements of individuals relative to their mother's position are given by the underlying point process rather than its copy. Surprisingly, the numbers of individuals in the $j$th generation, with positions less than or equal to $t$, exhibit remarkably similar distributional behavior in both standard branching random walks and coupled branching random walks as $t$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Impulse control in a spectrally negative L\'evy model with a level-dependent intensity of bankruptcy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an optimal dividend problem with transaction costs where the surplus is modelled by a spectrally negative L\'evy process in an Omega model. n this model, the surplus is allowed to spend time below the critical ruin level, but is penalised by a state-dependent intensity of bankruptcy. We show that under the spectrally negative model an optimal strategy is such that the surplus is reduced to a level $c_1$ whenever they are above another level $c_2$, and that such levels are unique under the additional assumption that the L\'evy measure has a log-convex tail. We describe a numerical method to compute the optimal values $c_1$ and $c_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate harmonic analysis of random matrices of large size with their Dyson indices going simultaneous to zero, that is in the high temperature limit. In this regime, the limiting empirical spectral distribution and the multivariate Bessel function/Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric function of the empirical spectral distribution are intimately related to the Markov-Krein correspondence. The uniqueness, existence and other properties of the Markov-Krein correspondence are studied using the theory of the Dirichlet process.</description>

      <title>Analysis of quantities determining the critical inverse temperature in the annealed Potts model with Pareto vertex weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider in this work the crucial quantity $t_c$ that determines the critical inverse temperature $\beta_c$ in the $q$-state Potts model on sparse rank-1 random graphs where the vertices are equipped with a Pareto weight density $(\tau-1)\,w^{-\tau}\,{\cal X}_{[1,\infty)}(w)$. It is shown in \cite{ref1} that this $t_c$ is the unique positive zero of a function ${\cal K}$ that is obtained by an appropriate combination of the stationarity condition and the criticality condition for the case the external field $B$ equals 0 and that $q\geq3$ and $\tau\geq4$, see \cite{ref1}, Theorem~1.14 and Theorem ~1.21 and their proofs in \cite{ref1}, Section~7.1 and Section~7.3. From the proof of \cite{ref1}, Theorem~1.14, it is seen that ${\cal K}'$ and ${\cal K}''$ also have a unique positive zero, $t_c'$ and $t_c''$, respectively, and $t_c'=t_b$ and $t_c''=t_{\ast}$, where $t_b$ and $t_{\ast}$ are the unique positive zeros of ${\cal F}_0(t)-t\,{\cal F}_0'(t)$ and ${\cal F}_0''(t)$, respectively. Here, ${\cal F}_0(t)=E\,[W(e^{tW}-1)/(E\,[W]\,(e^{tW}+q-1))]$, and $t_c$, $t_b$ and $t_{\ast}$ play a key role in the graphical analysis of \cite{ref1}, Section~5.1 and Figure~1. Furthermore, $\gamma_c=\exp(\beta_c)-1$ and $t_c$ are related according to $\gamma_c=t_c/{\cal F}_0(t_c)$.
  We analyse $t_c$, $t_c'$ and $t_c''$ for general real $\tau\geq4$ and general real $q&gt;2$ by an appropriate formulation of their defining equations ${\cal K}(t_c)={\cal K}'(t_c')={\cal K}''(t_c'')=0$. Thus we find, along with the inequality $0&lt;t_c''&lt;t_c'&lt;t_c&lt;\infty$, the simple upper bounds $t_c&lt;2\,{\rm ln}(q-1)$, $t_c'&lt;\frac32\,{\rm ln}(q-1)$, $t_c''&lt;{\rm ln}(q-1)$, as well as certain sharpenings of these simple bounds and counterparts about the large-$q$ behaviour of $t_c$, $t_c$ and $t_c''$. We show that these bounds are sharp in the sense that they hold with equality for the limiting homogeneous case $\tau\to\infty$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for a standard Lebesgue space $X$, the strong operator closure of the semigroup generated by conditional expectations on $L^\infty(X)$ contains the group of measure-preserving automorphisms. This is based on a solution to the following puzzle: given $n$ full water tanks, each containing one unit of water, and $n$ empty ones, how much water can be transferred from the full tanks to the empty ones by repeatedly equilibrating the water levels between pairs of tanks?</description>

      <title>Constructive l2-Discrepancy Minimization with Additive Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \emph{signed series} problem in the $\ell_2$ norm asks, given set of vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in \mathbf{R}^d$ having at most unit $\ell_2$ norm, does there always exist a series $(\varepsilon_i)_{i\in [n]}$ of $\pm 1$ signs such that for all $i\in [n]$, $\max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i \varepsilon_i v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d})$. A result of Banaszczyk [2012, \emph{Rand. Struct. Alg.}] states that there exist signs $\varepsilon_i\in \{-1,1\},\; i\in [n]$ such that $\max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i \varepsilon_i v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d+\log n})$. The best constructive bound known so far is of $O(\sqrt{d\log n})$, by Bansal and Garg [2017, \emph{STOC.}, 2019, \emph{SIAM J. Comput.}]. We give a polynomial-time randomized algorithm to find signs $x(i) \in \{-1,1\},\; i\in [n]$ such that \[ \max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i x(i)v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d + \log^2 n}) = O(\sqrt{d}+\log n).\] By the constructive reduction of Harvey and Samadi [\emph{COLT}, 2014], this also yields a constructive bound of $O(\sqrt{d}+\log n)$ for the Steinitz problem in the $\ell_2$-norm. Thus, our result settles both conjectures when $d \geq \log^2n$. Our algorithm is based on the framework on Bansal and Garg, together with a new analysis involving $(i)$ additional linear and spectral orthogonality constraints during the construction of the covariance matrix of the random walk steps, which allow us to control the quadratic variation in the linear as well as the quadratic components of the discrepancy increment vector, alongwith $(ii)$ a ``Freedman-like" version of the Hanson-Wright concentration inequality, for filtration-dependent sums of subgaussian chaoses.</description>

      <title>Finite $N$ precursors of the free cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\mathrm{U}(N)$ invariant polynomials on the space of $N\times N$ matrices that are precursors of free cumulants in various respects. First, they are polynomials of deterministic matrices, that are not yet evaluated over some probability law, contrary to what is usually meant by cumulants. Secondly, they converge towards the algebraic expression of free cumulants in terms of moments as $N\to \infty$, with $1/N^2$ corrections expressed in terms of monotone Hurwitz numbers. Their most crucial property is their additivity with respect to averaging over sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, providing a finite $N$ version of the well-known additivity of free cumulants in free probability. Finally, they extend several properties of free cumulants at finite $N$, including a Wick rule for their average over a Gaussian weight and their appearance in various matrix integrals. Building on the additivity property of these precursors, we also define and compute a coproduct describing the behaviour of general invariant polynomials with respect to the addition of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, as well as their expectation values on sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$-invariant random matrices. In our construction, a central role is played by the so-called HCIZ integral, both for the definition of the precursors and for the derivation of their properties.</description>

      <title>Practically significant change points in high dimension -- measuring signal strength pro active component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the change point testing problem for high-dimensional time series. Unlike conventional approaches, where one tests whether the difference $\delta$ of the mean vectors before and after the change point is equal to zero, we argue that the consideration of the null hypothesis $H_0:\|\delta\|\le\Delta$, for some norm $\|\cdot\|$ and a threshold $\Delta&gt;0$, is better suited. By the formulation of the null hypothesis as a composite hypothesis, the change point testing problem becomes significantly more challenging. We develop pivotal inference for testing hypotheses of this type in the setting of high-dimensional time series, first, measuring deviations from the null vector by the $\ell_2$-norm $\|\cdot\|_2$ normalized by the dimension. Second, by measuring deviations using a sparsity adjusted $\ell_2$-"norm" $\|\cdot \|_2/\sqrt{\|\cdot\|_0} $, where $\|\cdot\|_0$ denotes the $\ell_0$-"norm," we propose a pivotal test procedure which intrinsically adapts to sparse alternatives in a data-driven way by pivotally estimating the set of nonzero entries of the vector $\delta$. To establish the statistical validity of our approach, we derive tail bounds of certain classes of distributions that frequently appear as limiting distributions of self-normalized statistics. As a theoretical foundation for all results, we develop a general weak invariance principle for the partial sum process $X_1^\top\xi +\cdots +X_{\lfloor\lambda n\rfloor}^\top\xi$ for a time series $(X_j)_{j\in\mathbb{Z}}$ and a contrast vector $\xi\in\mathbb{R}^p$ under increasing dimension $p$, which is of independent interest. Finally, we investigate the finite sample properties of the tests by means of a simulation study and illustrate its application in a data example.</description>

      <title>The shape of quadratic Gauss paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the distribution of quadratic Gauss paths, polygonal paths joining partial sums of quadratic Gauss sums to square-free fundamental discriminant moduli in a dyadic range [Q,2Q]. We prove that this striking ensemble converges in law, as Q-&gt;\infty, to a random Fourier series we explicitly describe, and we prove a convergence in probability result and a classification result for the limiting shapes that explain the visually remarkable properties of these Gauss paths.</description>

      <title>Sequential Fair Allocation With Replenishments: A Little Envy Goes An Exponentially Long Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the trade-off between envy and inefficiency in repeated resource allocation settings with stochastic replenishments, motivated by real-world systems such as food banks and medical supply chains. Specifically, we consider a model in which a decision-maker faced with stochastic demand and resource donations must trade off between an equitable and efficient allocation of resources over an infinite horizon. The decision-maker has access to storage with fixed capacity $M$, and incurs efficiency losses when storage is empty (stockouts) or full (overflows). We provide a nearly tight (up to constant factors) characterization of achievable envy-inefficiency pairs. Namely, we introduce a class of Bang-Bang control policies whose inefficiency exhibits a sharp phase transition, dropping from $\Theta(1/M)$ when $\Delta = 0$ to $e^{-\Omega(\Delta M)}$ when $\Delta &gt; 0$, where $\Delta$ is used to denote the target envy of the policy. We complement this with matching lower bounds, demonstrating that the trade-off is driven by supply, as opposed to demand uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that envy-inefficiency trade-offs not only persist in settings with dynamic replenishment, but are shaped by the decision-maker's available capacity, and are therefore qualitatively different compared to previously studied settings with fixed supply.</description>

      <title>Geometric inequalities, stability results and Kendall's problem in spherical space</title>

      <description>arXiv:1709.06522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Euclidean space, the asymptotic shape of large cells in various types of Poisson driven random tessellations has been the subject of a famous conjecture due to David Kendall. Since shape is a geometric concept and large cells are identified by means of geometric size functionals, the resolution of the conjecture is inevitably connected with geometric inequalities of isoperimetric type and their improvements in the form of geometric stability results, relating geometric size functionals and hitting functionals. The latter are deterministic characteristics of the underlying random tessellation. The current work explores specific and typical cells of random tessellations in spherical space. A key ingredient of our approach are new geometric inequalities and quantitative strengthenings in terms of stability results for quite general and some specific size and hitting functionals of spherically convex bodies. As a consequence we obtain probabilistic deviation inequalities and asymptotic distributions of quite general size functionals. In contrast to the Euclidean setting, where the asymptotic regime concerns large size, in the spherical framework the asymptotic analysis is concerned with high intensities.</description>

      <title>Dual Induction CLT for High-dimensional m-dependent Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive novel and sharp high-dimensional Berry--Esseen bounds for the sum of $m$-dependent random vectors over the class of hyper-rectangles exhibiting only a poly-logarithmic dependence in the dimension. Our results hold under minimal assumptions, such as non-degenerate covariances and finite third moments, and exhibit an optimal sample complexity of order $m^{(q-1)/(q-2)}/\sqrt{n}$. Aside from logarithmic terms, the resulting rates match the optimal rates established in the univariate case. When specialized to the sums of independent non-degenerate random vectors, our results produce sharp and, in some cases, optimal rates under the weakest possible conditions. We develop a novel inductive relationship between anti-concentration inequalities and Berry--Esseen bounds inspired by the classical Lindeberg swapping method and the concentration inequality approach for dependent data that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Occupied Processes: Going with the Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07936v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stochastic process $X$ becomes occupied when it is enlarged with its occupation flow $\mathcal{O}$, which tracks the time spent by the path at each level. Crucially, the occupied process $(\mathcal{O},X)$ enjoys a Markov structure when $X$ is Markov. We develop a novel It\^o calculus for occupied processes that lies midway between Dupire's functional It\^o calculus and the classical version. We derive a surprisingly simple It\^o formula and, through Feynman-Kac, unveil a broad class of path-dependent PDEs where $\mathcal{O}$ plays the role of time. The space variable, given by the current value of $X$, remains finite-dimensional, thereby paving the way for standard elliptic PDE techniques and numerical methods.
  In the financial applications, we demonstrate that occupation flows provide unified Markovian lifts for exotic options and variance instruments, allowing financial institutions to price and manage derivatives books with a single numerical solver. We then explore avenues in financial modeling where volatility is driven by the occupied process. In particular, we propose the local occupied volatility (LOV) model which not only calibrates to European vanilla options but also offers the flexibility to capture stylized facts of volatility and fit other instruments. We also present an extension of forward variance models that leverages the entire forward occupation surface.</description>

Abstract: We study a martingale Schr\"odinger bridge problem: given two probability distributions, find their martingale coupling with minimal relative entropy. Our main result provides Schr\"odinger potentials for this coupling. Namely, under certain conditions, the log-density of the optimal coupling is given by a triplet of real functions representing the marginal and martingale constraints. The potentials are also described as the solution of a dual problem.</description>

      <title>Emergence of regularity for limit points of McKean-Vlasov particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The empirical measure of an interacting particle system is a purely atomic random probability measure. In the limit as the number of particles grows to infinity, we show for McKean-Vlasov systems with common noise that this measure becomes absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure for almost all times, almost surely. The density possesses good regularity properties, and we obtain a moment bound for its (random) fractional Sobolev norm. This result is obtained for dynamics with a bounded drift, bounded and H\"older-continuous diffusion coefficients and when the diffusion coefficient for the idiosyncratic noise is uniformly elliptic. We directly study the sequence of particle systems via approximating their exchangeable dynamics by conditionally independent dynamics at the expense of an error. By using probabilistic means, the approximation and the error are controlled for each particle system, and the results are then passed to the large-system limit. The estimates thus obtained are combined via an analytic interpolation technique to derive a norm bound for the limiting random density. In this way, we obtain a regularity estimate for all cluster points, without requiring any knowledge of the dynamics of the limiting measure-valued flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Palm distributions are critical in the study of point processes. In the present paper we focus on a point process $\Phi$ defined as the superposition, i.e., sum, of two independent point processes, say $\Phi = \Phi_1 + \Phi_2$, and we characterize its Palm distribution. In particular, we show that the Palm distribution of $\Phi$ admits a simple mixture representation depending only on the Palm distribution of $\Phi_j$, as $j=1, 2$, and the associated moment measures. Extensions to the superposition of multiple point processes, and higher order Palm distributions, are treated analogously.</description>

We show that, provided that the intensity of the noise is sufficiently weak at high frequencies, this systems admits uniform bounds in time, so that it has an invariant measure, for which we obtain stretched exponential tail bounds.</description>

      <title>A new approach to stochastic McKean-Vlasov limits with low-regularity coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The empirical measure flow of a McKean-Vlasov $n$-particle system with common noise is a measure-valued process whose law solves an associated martingale problem. We obtain a stability result for the sequence of martingale problems: all narrow cluster points of the sequence of laws solve the formally limiting martingale problem. Through the solution of the limiting problem, we are able to characterize the dynamics of limits of the empirical measure flows. A major new aspect of our result is that it requires rather weak regularity assumptions for the coefficients, for instance a form of local continuity of the drift in the measure argument and ellipticity of the diffusion coefficient for the idiosyncratic noise. In fact, the formally limiting martingale problem may fail to have any solution if there are discontinuities in the measure argument, so that the stability property is in general not true under low regularity assumptions. Our novel approach leverages an emergence of regularity property for cluster points of the empirical measure flow. This provides us with a priori analytic regularity estimates which we use to compensate for the low regularity of the drift.</description>

      <title>The Feller diffusion conditioned on a single ancestral founder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the distributional properties of a Feller diffusion $(X(\tau))_{\tau \in [0, t]}$ conditioned on the current population $X(t)$ having a single ancestor at time zero. The approach is novel and is based on an interpretation of Feller's original solution according to which the current population is comprised of a Poisson number of exponentially distributed families, each descended from a single ancestor. The distribution of the number of ancestors at intermediate times and the joint density of coalescent times is determined under assumptions of initiation of the process from a single ancestor at a specified time in the past, including infinitely far in the past, and for the case of a uniform prior on the time since initiation. Also calculated are the joint distribution of the time since the most recent common ancestor of the current population and the contemporaneous population size at that time under different assumptions on the time since initiation. In each case exact solutions are given for supercritical, critical and subcritical diffusions. For supercritical diffusions asymptotic forms of distributions are also given in the limit of unbounded exponential growth.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a derivation of the explicit price for the perpetual American put option time-capped by the first drawdown epoch beyond a predefined level. We consider the market in which an asset price is described by geometric L\'evy process with downward exponential jumps. We show that the optimal stopping rule is the first time when the asset price gets below a special value. The proof relies on martingale arguments and the fluctuation theory of L\'evy processes. We also provide a numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Model theoretic events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do we randomly sample an infinite sequence from a first order structure? What properties might hold on almost all random sequences? Which kinds of probabilistic processes can be meaningfully applied and studied in the model theory context? This paper takes these questions seriously and advances a plausible framework to engage with probabilistic phenomena.
  The central object of this paper is a probability space. The underlying set of our space is a standard model theoretic object, i.e. the space of types in countably many variables over a monster model. Our probability measure is the iterated Morley product of a fixed Borel-definable Keisler measure. Choosing a point randomly in this space with respect to our distribution yields a "random generic type" in countably many variables. We are interested in which events hold for almost all random generic types. We consider two different flavors of model theoretic events: (1) When is the induced structure on almost all random generic types isomorphic to a fixed structure? (2) For a fixed formula which is unstable, IP, sOP, etc., what is the probability that a random generic type witnesses this dividing line?
  For (1), we show that if our measure satisfies a particular extension axiom, then there exists a structure $N$ such that the induced structure on almost all random generic types is isomorphic to $N$. The proof echos a celebrated result of Glebskii et al. and Fagin concerning the existence of almost sure theories. We also provide examples where no such model exists. For (2), we show that if our initial distribution is fim, then almost no random generic types witness instability, IP, or sOP. In the local NIP context, we use results from combinatorics to prove that for any Borel-definable measure, the "average value of witnessing k-instability" across all permutations converges to 0. Some examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Mean-field behavior of the quantum Ising susceptibility and a new lace expansion for the classical Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transverse-field Ising model is widely studied as one of the simplest quantum spin systems. It is known that this model exhibits a phase transition at the critical inverse temperature $\beta_{\mathrm{c}}$, which is determined by the spin-spin couplings and the transverse field $q \geq 0$. Bj\"ornberg [Commun. Math. Phys., 232 (2013)] investigated the divergence rate of the susceptibility for the nearest-neighbor model as the critical point is approached by simultaneously changing the spin-spin coupling $J \geq 0$ and $q$ in a proper manner, with fixed temperature. In this paper, we fix $J$ and $q$ and show that the susceptibility diverges as $(\beta_{\mathrm{c}} - \beta)^{-1}$ as $\beta\uparrow\beta_{\mathrm{c}}$ for $d&gt;4$ assuming an infrared bound on the space-time two-point function. One of the key elements is a stochastic-geometric representation in Bj\"ornberg &amp; Grimmett [J. Stat. Phys., 136 (2009)] and Crawford &amp; Ioffe [Commun. Math. Phys., 296 (2010)]. As a byproduct, we derive a new lace expansion for the classical Ising model (i.e., $q=0$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show local well-posedness of the g-PAM and the $\phi^{K+1}_2$-equation for $K\geq 1$ on the two-dimensional torus when the coefficient field is random and correlated to the driving noise. In the setting considered here, even when the model in the sense of [Hai14] is stationary, naive use of renormalisation constants in general leads to variance blow-up. Instead, we prove convergence of renormalised models choosing random renormalisation functions analogous to the deterministic variable coefficient setting. The main technical contribution are stochastic estimates on the model in this correlated setting which are obtained by a combination of heat kernel asymptotics, Gaussian integration by parts formulae and Hairer--Quastel type bounds [HQ18].</description>
