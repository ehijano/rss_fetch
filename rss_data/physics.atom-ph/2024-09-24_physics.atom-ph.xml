      <title>The ground electronic state of CS: the potential curve, Bohr-Sommerfeld rovibrational spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that for carbon monosulfide ${\rm C}\,{\rm S}$ in the Born-Oppenheimer formalism, by taking into account the RKR turning points found by Coxon and Hajigeorgiou (2023), and asymptotics at small and large internuclear distances, the potential curve $V(R)$ for the electronic ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ is constructed in full generality for the whole range of internuclear distances $R \in [0,\infty)$ with an accuracy of 3-4 significant figures. Solving two-body nuclear Schr\"odinger equation with the potential $V(R)$ the whole rovibrational spectrum for ${}^{12} {\rm C}\,{}^{32} {\rm S}$ dimer is found: the $\sim 14500$ rovibrational energy states with $L_{max}=289$ and $\nu_{max} \sim 82$ with accuracy $\sim 10^{-4}$ hartree in energy.</description>

      <title>A conveyor-belt magneto-optical trap of CaF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15262v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental realization of a conveyor-belt magneto-optical trap for calcium monofluoride (CaF) molecules. The obtained highly-compressed cloud has a mean radius of 64(5) $\mu$m and a peak number density of $3.6(5) \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, a 600-fold increase over the conventional red-detuned MOTs of CaF, and the densest molecular MOT observed to date. Subsequent loading of these molecules into an optical dipole trap yields up to $2.6 \times 10^4$ trapped molecules at a temperature of 14(2) $\mu$K with a peak phase-space density of $\sim 2.4 \times 10^{-6}$. This opens new possibilities for a range of applications utilizing high-density, optically trapped ultracold molecules.</description>

      <title>Rydberg EIT based laser lock to Zeeman sublevels with 0.6 GHz scanning range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a technique for frequency locking a laser to the Zeeman sublevel transitions between the 5P$_{3/2}$ intermediate and 32D$_{5/2}$ Rydberg states in $^{87}$Rb. This method allows for continuous frequency tuning over 0.6 GHz by varying an applied external magnetic field. In the presence of the applied field, the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum of an atomic vapor splits via the Zeeman effect according to the strength of the magnetic field and the polarization of the pump and probe lasers. We show that the 480 nm pump laser, responsible for transitions between the Zeeman sublevels of the intermediate state and the Rydberg state, can be locked to the Zeeman-split EIT peaks. The short-term frequency stability of the laser lock is 0.15 MHz and the long-term stability is within 0.5 MHz. The linewidth of the laser lock is ~0.8 MHz and ~1.8 MHz in the presence and in the absence of the external magnetic field, respectively. In addition, we show that in the absence of an applied magnetic field and adequate shielding, the frequency shift of the lock point has a peak-to-peak variation of 1.6 MHz depending on the polarization of the pump field, while when locked to Zeeman sublevels this variation is reduced to 0.6 MHz. The proposed technique is useful for research involving Rydberg atoms, where large continuous tuning of the laser frequency with stable locking is required.</description>

      <title>Emerging Topological Hall Effect in Fe-doped Monolayer WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological Hall effect (THE) has attracted great attention since it provides an important probe of the interaction between electron and topological spin textures. THE has been considered an experimental signature of the topological spin texture of skyrmions. While THE has been widely reported in chiral magnets, oxide heterostructures, and hybrid systems such as ferromagnet/heavy metal and ferromagnet/topological insulators, the study of monolayer structures is lacking, hindering the understanding of noncollinear spin textures at the atomically thin scale. Here, we show a discernible THE via proximity coupling of Fe-doped monolayer WSe2 (Fe:WSe2) synthesized using chemical vapor deposition on a Pt Hall bar. Multiple characterization methods were employed to demonstrate that Fe atoms substitutionally replace W atoms, making a two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) dilute magnetic semiconductor (DMS) at room temperature. Distinct from the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, we found the transverse Hall resistivity of Fe:WSe2 displaying two additional dip/peak features in the temperature-dependent measurements, consistent with the contribution of THE. The topological Hall effect is attributed to the magnetic skyrmions that emerge from the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions at the Fe:WSe2 and Pt interface. Our work shows that a DMS synthesized from 2D vdW transition metal dichalcogenides is promising for realizing magnetic skyrmions and spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Tunneling of Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.15298v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his celebrated textbook, $\textit{Quantum Mechanics: Nonrelativistic Theory}$, Landau argued that, for single particle systems in 1D, tunneling probability remains the same for a particle incident from the left or the right of a barrier. This left-right symmetry of tunneling probability holds regardless of the shape of the potential barrier. However, there are a variety of known cases that break this symmetry, e.g. when observing composite particles. We computationally (and analytically, in the simplest case) show this breaking of the left-right tunneling symmetry for Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in 1D, modelled by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). By varying $g$, the parameter of inter-particle interaction in the BEC, we demonstrate that the transition from symmetric ($g=0$) to asymmetric tunneling is a threshold phenomenon. Our computations employ experimentally feasible parameters such that these results may be experimentally demonstrated in the near future. We conclude by suggesting applications of the phenomena to design atomtronic diodes, synthetic gauge fields, Maxwell's demons, and black-hole analogues.</description>

      <title>Rotational properties of two interacting cold polar molecules: linear, symmetric, and asymmetric tops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the potential-energy curves and polarization of the dipole moments of two static polar molecules under the influence of an external dc electric field and their anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction. We model the molecules as quantum rigid rotors to take their rotational degrees of freedom into account and consider a selection of linear, symmetric, and asymmetric top molecules. We provide a comprehensive examination of the energy curves and polarization of the dipoles for varying inter-molecular separation and direction of the electric field and find that the properties of the molecules depend strongly on the field's direction at short separations, showing the importance of accounting for molecular rotation. The latter provides insight into the possible effects of accounting for rotational degrees of freedom in molecular dipolar gases.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of Physical Constants, Equivalence Principle Violation, and a Fifth Force from Atomic Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to derive limits on various forms of ``new physics'' using atomic experimental data. Interactions with dark energy and dark matter fields can lead to space-time variations of fundamental constants, which can be detected through atomic spectroscopy. In this study, we examine the effects of a varying nuclear mass $m_{N}$ and nuclear radius $r_{N}$ on two transition ratios: the comparison of the two-photon transition in atomic hydrogen with the hyperfine transition in $^{133}$Cs based clocks, and the ratio of optical clock frequencies in in Al$^{+}$ and Hg$^{+}$. The sensitivity of these frequency ratios to changes in $m_{N}$ and $r_{N}$ enables us to derive new limits on the variations of the proton mass, quark mass, and the QCD parameter $\theta$. Additionally, we consider the scalar field generated by the Yukawa-type interaction of feebly interacting hypothetical scalar particles with Standard Model particles in the presence of massive bodies such as the Sun and Moon. Using the data from the Al$^{+}$/Hg$^{+}$, Yb$^{+}$/Cs and Yb$^{+}$(E2)/Yb$^{+}$(E3) transition frequency ratios, we place constraints on the interaction of the scalar field with photons, nucleons, and electrons for a range of scalar particle masses. We also investigate limits on the Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) violating term ($c_{00}$) in the Standard Model Extension (SME) Lagrangian and the dependence of fundamental constants on gravity.</description>

      <title>Atomic binding corrections for high energy fixed target experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High energy beams incident on a fixed target may scatter against atomic electrons. To a first approximation, one can treat these electrons as at rest. For precision experiments, however, it is important to be able to estimate the size of, and when necessary calculate, sub-leading corrections. We discuss atomic binding corrections to relativistic lepton-electron scattering. We analyze hydrogen in detail, before generalizing our analysis to multi-electron atoms. Using the virial theorem, and many-body sum rules, we find that the corrections can be reduced to measured binding energies, and the expectation value of a single one-body operator. We comment on the phenomenological impact for neutrino flux normalization and an extraction of hadronic vacuum polarization from elastic muon electron scattering at MUonE.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing of acceleration and rotation by interfering magnetically-launched atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of inertial quantities is essential in geophysics, geodesy, fundamental physics and navigation. For instance, inertial navigation systems require stable inertial sensors to compute the position and attitude of the carrier. Here, we present an architecture for a compact cold-atom accelerometer-gyroscope based on a magnetically launched atom interferometer. Characterizing the launching technique, we demonstrate 700 ppm gyroscope scale factor stability over one day, while acceleration and rotation rate bias stabilities of $7 \times 10^{-7}$ m/s$^2$ and $4 \times 10^{-7}$ rad/s are reached after two days of integration of the cold-atom sensor. Hybridizing it with a classical accelerometer and gyroscope, we correct their drift and bias to achieve respective 100-fold and 3-fold increase on the stability of the hybridized sensor compared to the classical ones. Compared to state-of-the-art atomic gyroscope, the simplicity and scalability of our launching technique make this architecture easily extendable to a compact full six-axis inertial measurement unit, providing a pathway towards autonomous positioning and orientation using cold-atom sensors.</description>

      <title>Temperature shift of magnetic-field-dependent photoluminescence features of nitrogen-vacancy ensembles in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently significant attention has been paid to magnetic-field-dependent photoluminescence (PL) features of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. These features are used for microwave-free sensing and are indicative of the spin-bath properties in the diamond sample. Examinating the temperature dependence of the PL features allows to identify both temperature dependent and independent features, and to utilize them in diamond-based quantum sensing and dynamic nuclear polarization applications. Here, we study the thermal variability of many different features visible in a wide range of magnetic fields. To this end, we first discuss the origin of the features and tentatively assign the previously unidentified features to cross relaxation of NV center containing multi-spin systems. The experimental results are compared with theoretically predicted temperature shifts deduced from a combination of thermal expansion and electron-phonon interactions. A deeper insight into the thermal behavior of a wide array of the features may come with important consequences for various applications in high-precision NV thermometry, gyroscopes, solid-state clocks, and biomagnetic measurements.</description>
