      <title>Neural networks consisting of DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks based on soft and biological matter constitute an interesting potential alternative to traditional implementations based on electric circuits. DNA is a particularly promising system in this context due its natural ability to store information. In recent years, researchers have started to construct neural networks that are based on DNA. In this chapter, I provide a very basic introduction to the concept of DNA neural networks, aiming at an audience that is not familiar with biochemistry.</description>

      <title>CARE: a Benchmark Suite for the Classification and Retrieval of Enzymes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1) classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and (2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at https://github.com/jsunn-y/CARE/.</description>
