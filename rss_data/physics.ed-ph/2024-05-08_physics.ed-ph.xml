      <title>Real-World Problem-Solving Class is Correlated with Higher Student Persistence in Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Student persistence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has long been a focus of educational research, with both quantitative and qualitative methods being used to investigate patterns and mechanisms of attrition. Some studies have used machine learning to predict a student's likelihood to persist given measurable classroom factors and institutional data, while others have framed persistence as a function of a student's social integration in the classroom. While these methods have provided insight into broader underlying patterns of attrition in STEM, they have not investigated class structures or teaching methods that promote persistence. In this study we explore how a research-based instructional format for an introductory calculus-based physics class using real world problem-solving (RPS) was correlated with higher persistence for students at a large research-intensive university. We found that the one-year persistence rates for the RPS course were 74% (fall semester) and 90% (spring semester), while the lecture-based class had a persistence rate of 64% and 78%, respectively. In spring, the RPS persistence rate was significantly higher (p=0.037). The RPS also had higher final grades and larger learning gains than the lecture-based class despite lower scores on a physics diagnostic test. We also note that the higher rates of persistence were not completely explained by higher final grades. This study motivates future work to understand the structural mechanisms that promote student persistence in introductory physics courses.</description>
