      <title>A Transformation Theorem for Transverse Signature-Type Changing Semi-Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early eighties Hartle and Hawking put forth that signature-type change may be conceptually interesting, paving the way to the so-called 'no boundary' proposal for the initial conditions for the universe. Such singularity-free universes have no beginning, but they do have an origin of time. In mathematical terms, we are dealing with signature-type changing manifolds where a Riemannian region (i.e., a region with a positive definite metric) is smoothly joined to a Lorentzian region at the surface of transition where time begins.
  We present a transformation prescription to transform an arbitrary Lorentzian manifold into a singular signature-type changing manifold. Then we establish the Transformation Theorem, asserting that, conversely, under certain conditions, such a metric $(M,\tilde{g})$ can be obtained from some Lorentz metric $g$ through the aforementioned transformation procedure. By augmenting the assumption by certain constraints, mutatis mutandis, the global version of the Transformation Theorem can be proven as well. In conclusion, we make use of the Transformation Prescription to demonstrate that the induced metric on the hypersurface of signature change is either Riemannian or a positive semi-definite pseudo metric.</description>

      <title>Minimal submanifolds in spheres and complex-valued eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new proof of a theorem that describes $(\lambda, \mu)$-eigenfunctions on sphere is obtained. This proof is based on a statement that a function $f$ is a $(\lambda, \mu)$-eigenfunction if and only if $f$ and $f^2$ are eigenfunctions for Laplace-Beltrami operator. Also, minimal submanifolds in spheres of codimension 1 are constructed. In the case of $\mathbb{S}^3$ two immersions of Clifford torus and all Lawson $\tau_{n, m}$ surfaces are described in terms of $(\lambda, \mu)$-eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Weighted cscK metric (I): a priori estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold. In this paper we study the existence of constant weighted scalar curvature K\"ahler (weighted cscK) metrics on $X$. More precisely, we establish a priori $C^{k}$-estimates ($k\geq 0$) for the K\"ahler potential associated with these metrics, thereby extending a result due to Chen and Cheng in the classical cscK setting.</description>

      <title>The first Dirichlet eigenvalue and the width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a geodesic ball with non-negative Ricci curvature and mean convex boundary, it is known that the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of this geodesic ball has a sharp lower bound in term of its radius. We show a quantitative explicit inequality, which bounds the width of geodesic ball in terms of the spectral gap between the first Dirichlet eigenvalue and the corresponding sharp lower bound.</description>

      <title>A family of left-invariant SKT metrics on the exceptional Lie group $G_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a complex manifold $(M,J)$, an SKT (or pluriclosed) metric is a $J$-Hermitian metric $g$ whose fundamental form $\omega:=g(J\cdot,\cdot)$ satisfies the condition $\partial\overline{\partial}\omega=0$. As such, an SKT metric can be regarded as a natural generalization of a K\"{a}hler metric. In this paper, the exceptional Lie group $G_2$ is equipped with a left-invariant integrable almost complex structure $\mathcal{J}$ via the Samelson construction and a 7-parameter family of $\mathcal{J}$-Hermitian metrics is constructed. From this 7-parameter family, the members which are SKT are calculated. The result is a 3-parameter family of (left-invariant) SKT metrics on $G_2$. As a special case, the aforementioned family of SKT metrics contains all bi-invariant metrics on $G_2$.</description>

      <title>The topological holonomy group and the complexity of horizontality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [2], it is observed that if in the twistor space associated with an oriented vector bundle of rank $4$ with a positive-definite metric and a metric connection, the horizontality has infinite complexity derived from one of the cases studied in [1], then the complexity is expressed by a dense subset of $S^2$. In the present paper, it is observed that in such a situation, the topological holonomy group is dense in $SO(3)$.</description>

      <title>Scalar curvature rigidity of domains in a warped product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By exploiting the conformality of a warped product metric with a direct product metric, we develop a new connection on a twisted spinor bundle and its associated Dirac operator. We obtain a Llarull type scalar curvature rigidity for a general class of domains in a warped product. Also, we are able to address Gromov dihedral rigidity in hyperbolic space assuming matching angles.</description>

      <title>Gradient Einstein-type warped products: rigidity, existence and nonexistence results via a nonlinear PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for constructing gradient Einstein-type warped metrics. One of these conditions leads us to a general Lichnerowicz equation with analytic and geometric coefficients for this class of metrics on the space of warping functions. In this way, we prove gradient estimates for positive solutions of a nonlinear elliptic differential equation on a complete Riemannian manifold with associated Bakry-\'Emery Ricci tensor bounded from below. As an application, we provide nonexistence and rigidity results for a large class of gradient Einstein-type warped metrics. Furthermore, we show how to construct gradient Einstein-type warped metrics, and then we give explicit examples which are not only meaningful in their own right, but also help to justify our results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any Riemannian metric $g$ on a closed orientable surface $\Sigma$ and any spacelike embedding $f:\Sigma \rightarrow M$ in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold $(M,h)$, the embedding $f$ can be $C^{0}$-approximated by a smooth conformal embedding for $g$. If in addition, $M$ is a quotient of the $(2+1)$-dimensional solid timelike cone by a cocompact lattice of $SO^{\circ}(2,1)$, we show that the set of negatively curved metrics on $\Sigma$ that admit isometric embeddings in $M$ projects into a relatively compact set in the Teichm\"uller space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study Hermitian manifolds whose Bismut connection has parallel torsion, which will be called {\em Bismut torsion parallel manifolds,} or {\em BTP} manifolds for brevity. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition characterizing BTP manifolds in terms of Bismut curvature tensor alone (Theorem 1.1). We also present examples and discuss some general properties for BTP manifolds, as well as give a classification result for non-balanced BTP threefolds (Theorem 1.16).</description>

      <title>The vacuum weighted Einstein field equations on pr-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify solutions of the vacuum weighted Einstein field equations on smooth metric measure spacetimes $(M,g,h\, dvol_g)$ of dimension 4, where the underlying manifold $(M,g)$ is a $pr$-wave. We use this result to provide examples of solutions with some special geometric properties.
  The gradient $\nabla h$ is lightlike or spacelike. In the first case, the underlying manifold is a $pp$-wave. In the second case, the Ricci operator is nilpotent. Moreover, $2$-step nilpotent solutions are also realized on $pp$-waves.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb Z_2$-Harmonic Spinors and 1-forms on Connected sums and Torus sums of 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a pair of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic spinors (resp. 1-forms) on closed Riemannian 3-manifolds $(Y_1, g_1)$ and $(Y_2,g_2)$, we construct $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic spinors (resp. 1-forms) on the connected sum $Y_1 \# Y_2$ and the torus sum $Y_1 \cup_{T^2} Y_2$ using a gluing argument. The main tool in the proof is a parameterized version of the Nash-Moser implicit function theorem established by Donaldson and the second author. We use these results to construct an abundance of new examples of $\mathbb Z_2$-harmonic spinors and 1-forms. In particular, we prove that for every closed 3-manifold $Y$, there exist infinitely many $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic spinors with singular sets representing infinitely many distinct isotopy classes of embedded links, strengthening an existence theorem of Doan-Walpuski. Moreover, combining this with previous results, our construction implies that if $b_1(Y) &gt; 0$, there exist infinitely many $\mathrm{spin}^c$ structures on $Y$ such that the moduli space of solutions to the two-spinor Seiberg-Witten equations is non-empty and non-compact.</description>

      <title>Some Remarks on Wang-Yau Quasi-Local Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review Wang-Yau quasi-local definitions along the line of gravitational Hamiltonian. This makes clear the connection and difference between Wang-Yau definition and Brown-York or even global ADM definition. We make a brief comment on admissibility condition in Wang-Yau quasi-lcoal mass. We extend the positivity proof for Wang-Yau quasi-local energy to allow possible presence of strictly stable apparent horizons through establishing solvability of Dirac equation in certain 3-manifolds that possess cylindrical ends, as in the case of Jang's graph blowing up at marginally outer trapped surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We look at the strong field behavior of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy. In particular, we examine the limit of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy as the defining spacelike 2-surface {\Sigma} approaches an apparent horizon from outside. Assuming any smooth isometric embedding, we find that the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy blows up in this limit, unless the horizon can be isometrically embedded into R3. Moreover, if the horizon cannot be embedded into R3, the optimal embedding equation is not solvable for {\Sigma} near the horizon. We discuss the implications of our results in the conclusion section.</description>

      <title>A proposal of quasi-local mass for 2-surfaces of timelike mean curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quasi-local mass, typically defined as an integral over a spacelike $2$-surface $\Sigma$, should encode information about the gravitational field within a finite, extended region bounded by $\Sigma$. Therefore, in attempts to quantize gravity, one may consider an infinite dimensional space of $2$-surfaces instead of an infinite dimensional space of $4$-dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes. However, existing definitions for quasilocal mass only applies to surfaces outside an horizon whose mean curvature vector is spacelike. In this paper, we propose an extension of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy/mass to surfaces with timelike mean curvature vector, including in particular trapped surfaces. We adopt the same canonical gauge as in the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy but allow the pulled back "killing vector" to the physical spacetime to be spacelike. We define the new quasi-local energy along the Hamiltonian formulation of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy. The new definition yields a positive definite surface energy density and a new divergence free current. Calculations for coordinate spheres in Kerr family spacetime are shown. In the spherical symmetric case, our definition reduces to a previous definition \cite{lundgren2007self}.</description>

      <title>On the blow-up formula of the Chow weights for polarized toric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective toric variety and let $\widetilde{X}$ be the blow-up manifold of $X$ at finitely many distinct tours invariants points of $X$. In this paper, we give an explicit combinatorial formula of the Chow weight of $\widetilde{X}$ in terms of the base toric manifold $X$ and the symplectic cuts of the Delzant polytope. We then apply this blow-up formula to the projective plane and see the difference of Chow stability between the toric blow-up manifolds and the manifolds of blow-ups at general points. Finally, we detect the blow-up formula of the Futaki-Ono invariant which is an obstruction for asymptotic Chow semistability of a polarized toric manifold.</description>

As a consequence we prove that strictly pseudoconvex bounded domains with $C^2$ boundary and bounded domains with squeezing function tending to 1 at every point of the boundary, admit a complete K\"ahler metric with negatively pinched holomorphic bisectional curvature everywhere.</description>

      <title>Marginally outer trapped tubes in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove two results which are relevant for constructing marginally outer trapped tubes (MOTTs) in de Sitter spacetime. The first one holds more generally, namely for spacetimes satisfying the null convergence condition and containing a timelike conformal Killing vector with a "temporal function". We show that all marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs) in such a spacetime are unstable. This prevents application of standard results on the propagation of stable MOTSs to MOTTs. On the other hand, it was shown recently that, for every sufficiently high genus, there exists a smooth, complete family of CMC surfaces embedded in the round 3-sphere S3. This family connects a Lawson minimal surface with a doubly covered geodesic 2-sphere. We show by a simple scaling argument that this result translates to an existence proof for complete MOTTs with CMC sections in de Sitter spacetime. Moreover, the area of these sections increases strictly monotonically. We compare this result with an area law obtained before for holographic screens.</description>

      <title>On harmonic and biharmonic maps from gradient Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study harmonic and biharmonic maps from gradient Ricci solitons. We derive a number of analytic and geometric conditions under which harmonic maps are constant and which force biharmonic maps to be harmonic. In particular, we show that biharmonic maps of finite energy from the two-dimensional cigar soliton must be harmonic.</description>

      <title>On riemannian connections and semi-simplicity of a Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13475v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a almost product structure defined by a spray, we give a necessary and sufficient condition, for a linear connection with vanishing torsion to be Riemannian and, for the semi-simplicity of Lie algebra of projectable vector fields which commute with a spray. We show the equivalence of the semi-simplicity of a finite dimensional Lie algebra to the coincidence of the derived ideal with its algebra, to the interiority of any derivation of the algebra and, to the semi-simplicity of its adjoint representation.</description>

      <title>Spectral constant rigidity of warped product metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theorem of Llarull says that if a smooth metric $g$ on the $n$-sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$ is bounded below by the standard round metric and the scalar curvature $R_g$ of $g$ is bounded below by $n (n - 1)$, then the metric $g$ must be the standard round metric. We prove a spectral Llarull theorem by replacing the bound $R_g \geq n (n - 1)$ by a lower bound on the first eigenvalue of an elliptic operator involving the Laplacian and the scalar curvature $R_g$. We utilize two methods: spinor and spacetime harmonic function.</description>

      <title>Compact K\"ahler manifolds with quasi-positive holomorphic sectional curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a "pseudo-effective" version of the holonomy principle for compact K\"{a}hler manifolds with nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature. As applications, we prove that if a compact complex manifold $M$ admits a K\"{a}hler metric $\omega$ with nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature and $(M,\omega)$ has no nonzero truly flat tangent vector at some point (which is satisfied when the holomorphic sectional curvature is quasi-positive), then $M$ is projective and rationally connected. This answers a problem raised up by Matsumura and Yang and extends Yau's conjecture. We also get the structure theorem of a compact simply connected K\"{a}hler manifold with nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature. Furthermore, we show that a compact K\"{a}hler manifold admits a Hermitian metric with positive real bisectional curvature is a projective and rationally connected manifold.</description>

      <title>The Ambrose-Singer Theorem for cohomogeneity one Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize isometric actions whose principal orbits are hypersurfaces through the existence of a linear connection satisfying a set of covariant equations in the same spirit as the Ambrose-Singer Theorem for homogeneous space. These results are then used to describe isometric cohomogeneity one foliations in terms of such connections. Finally, we provide explicit examples of these objects in Euclidean spaces and real hyperbolic spaces.</description>

      <title>Balanced and Aeppli Parameters for the Heterotic Moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we fix the complex structure and explore the moduli space of the heterotic system by considering two different yet "dual" deformation paths starting from a K\"ahler solution. They correspond to deformation along the Bott-Chern cohomology class and the Aeppli cohomology class respectively. Using the implicit function theorem, we prove the local existence of heterotic solutions along these two paths and hence establish an initial step to construct local moduli coordinates around a K\"ahler solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a survey on the Strominger system and a geometric flow known as the anomaly flow. We will discuss various aspects of non-K\"ahler geometry on Calabi-Yau threefolds. Along the way, we discuss balanced metrics and balanced classes, the Aeppli cohomology class associated to a solution to the Strominger system, the equations of motion of heterotic supergravity, and a version of Ricci flow in this special geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n$ be an integer with $3 \leq n \leq 7$, and let $g$ be a Riemannian metric on $B^2 \times T^{n-2}$ with scalar curvature at least $-n(n-1)$. We establish an inequality relating the systole of the boundary to the infimum of the mean curvature on the boundary. As a consequence, we obtain a new positive energy theorem where equality holds for the Horowitz-Myers metrics.</description>

      <title>Ricci-DeTurck Flow from Initial Metric with Morrey-type Integrability Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the short-time existence theory of Ricci-DeTurck flow starting from rough metrics which satisfy a Morrey-type integrability condition. Using the rough existence theory, we show the preservation and improvement of distributional scalar curvature lower bounds provided the singular set for such metrics is not too large. As an application, we use the Ricci flow smoothing to study the removable singularity for scalar curvature rigidity in the compact case under Morrey regularity conditions. Our result supplements those of Jiang-Sheng-Zhang.</description>

      <title>Large-$n$ asymptotics for Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of bordered hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry and spectral theory of Weil-Petersson random surfaces with genus-$g$ and $n$ cusps in the large-$n$ limit. We show that for a random hyperbolic surface in $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ with $n$ large, the number of small Laplacian eigenvalues is linear in $n$ with high probability. By work of Ballmann, Matthiesen and Mondal [7], this result is optimal up to a multiplicative constant. We also study the relative frequency of simple and non-simple closed geodesics, showing that on random surfaces with many cusps, most closed geodesics with lengths up to $\log(n)$ scales are non-simple. Our main technical contribution is a novel large-$n$ asymptotic formula for the Weil-Petersson volume $V_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of genus-$g$ hyperbolic surfaces with $k$ geodesic boundary components and $n-k$ cusps with $k$ fixed, building on work of Manin and Zograf [31].</description>
