      <title>Physically Valid Biomolecular Interaction Modeling with Gauss-Seidel Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecular interaction modeling has been substantially advanced by foundation models, yet they often produce all-atom structures that violate basic steric feasibility. We address this limitation by enforcing physical validity as a strict constraint during both training and inference with a uniffed module. At its core is a differentiable projection that maps the provisional atom coordinates from the diffusion model to the nearest physically valid conffguration. This projection is achieved using a Gauss-Seidel scheme, which exploits the locality and sparsity of the constraints to ensure stable and fast convergence at scale. By implicit differentiation to obtain gradients, our module integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks for end-to-end ffnetuning. With our Gauss-Seidel projection module in place, two denoising steps are sufffcient to produce biomolecular complexes that are both physically valid and structurally accurate. Across six benchmarks, our 2-step model achieves the same structural accuracy as state-of-the-art 200-step diffusion baselines, delivering approximately 10 times faster wall-clock speed while guaranteeing physical validity.</description>

      <title>Communication System Design using Synthetic Photoisomerizable Azobenzene-Regulated K+(SPARK) channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecules exhibit a remarkable property of transforming signals from their environment. This paper presents a communication system design using a light-modulated protein channel: Synthetic Photoisomerizable Azobenzene-regulated K+ (SPARK). Our approach involves a comprehensive design incorporating the SPARK-based receiver, encoding methods, modulation techniques, and detection processes. By analyzing the resulting communication system, we determine how different parameters influence its performance. Furthermore, we explore the potential design in terms of bioengineering and demonstrate that the data rate scales up with the number of receptors, indicating the possibility of achieving high-speed communication.</description>

      <title>Design of DNA Strand Displacement Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA strand displacement (SD) reactions are central to the operation of many synthetic nucleic acid systems, including molecular circuits, sensors, and machines. Over the years, a broad set of design frameworks has emerged to accommodate various functional goals, initial configurations, and environmental conditions. Nevertheless, key challenges persist, particularly in reliably predicting reaction kinetics. This review examines recent approaches to SD reaction design, with emphasis on the properties of single reactions, including kinetics, structural factors, and limitations in current modelling practices. We identify promising innovations while analysing the factors that continue to hinder predictive accuracy. We conclude by outlining future directions for achieving more robust and programmable behaviour in DNA-based systems.</description>

      <title>An Angle-Based Algorithmic Framework for the Interval Discretizable Distance Geometry Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distance Geometry plays a central role in determining protein structures from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data, a task known as the Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (MDGP). A subclass of this problem, the Discretizable Distance Geometry Problem (DDGP), allows a recursive solution via the combinatorial Branch-and-Prune (BP) algorithm by exploiting specific vertex orderings in protein backbones. To accommodate the inherent uncertainty in NMR data, the interval Branch-and-Prune (\textit{i}BP) algorithm was introduced, incorporating interval distance constraints through uniform sampling. In this work, we propose two new algorithmic frameworks for solving the three-dimensional interval DDGP (\textit{i}DDGP): the interval Angular Branch-and-Prune (\textit{i}ABP), and its extension, the interval Torsion-angle Branch-and-Prune (\textit{i}TBP). These methods convert interval distances into angular constraints, enabling structured sampling over circular arcs. The \textit{i}ABP method guarantees feasibility by construction and removes the need for explicit constraint checking. The \textit{i}TBP algorithm further incorporates known torsion angle intervals, enforcing local chirality and planarity conditions critical for protein geometry. We present formal mathematical foundations for both methods and a systematic strategy for generating biologically meaningful \textit{i}DDGP instances from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures. Computational experiments demonstrate that both \textit{i}ABP and \textit{i}TBP consistently outperform \textit{i}BP in terms of solution rate and computational efficiency. In particular, \textit{i}TBP yields solutions with lower RMSD variance relative to the original PDB structures, better reflecting biologically plausible conformations.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Agent for Modular Task Execution in Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved relevant biomolecular information, including FASTA sequences, SMILES representations, and literature, and answered mechanistic questions with improved contextual accuracy compared to standard LLMs. It then generated chemically diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of molecules with QED &gt; 0.6 increased from 34 to 55. The number of molecules satisfying empirical drug-likeness filters also rose; for example, compliance with the Ghose filter increased from 32 to 55 within a pool of 100 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models, providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.</description>
