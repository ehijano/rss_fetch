      <title>Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Fibered Link States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the patterns of multipartite entanglement in Chern-Simons theory with compact gauge group $G$ and level $k$ for states defined by the path integral on "link complements", i.e., compact manifolds whose boundaries consist of $n$ topologically linked tori. We focus on link complements which can be described topologically as fibrations over a Seifert surface. We show that the entanglement structure of such fibered link complement states is controlled by a topological invariant, the monodromy of the fibration. Thus, the entanglement structure of a Chern-Simons link state is not simply a function of the link, but also of the background manifold in which the link is embedded. In particular, we show that any link possesses an embedding into some background that leads to GHZ-like entanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all fibered links with periodic monodromy have GHZ-like entanglement, i.e., a partial trace on any link component produces a separable state.</description>

      <title>String islands, discrete theta angles and the 6D $\mathcal{N} = (1,1)$ string landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complete classification of the landscape of 6D $\mathcal{N} = (1,1)$ string vacua remains an open problem. In this work we prove a classification theorem for 6D $\mathcal{N} = (1,1)$ asymmetric orbifolds utilizing a correspondence with orbifolds of chiral 2D SCFTs with $c= 24$ (or $c= 12$). Interestingly, this class of theories can give rise to 6D vacua in which the only massless degrees of freedom reside in the gravity multiplet, with no moduli other than the dilaton, thus corresponding to truly isolated vacua, called string islands. It is expected that there exist five new type II islands with as-yet-unknown constructions. In this work we construct them all using asymmetric $\mathbb{Z}_n$-orbifolds of Type II on $T^4$ with $n = 5,8,10,12$. We show that the cases $n = 5,8$ admit non-trivial discrete theta angles which have important consequences for both the string and particle charge lattices. In fact they provide examples of BPS-incompleteness and the strongest failure of the lattice weak gravity conjecture. Our work is expected to finalize our understanding of all perturbative 6D $\mathcal{N} = (1,1)$ theories.</description>

      <title>Causality Bounds on the Primordial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theories (EFTs) parametrize our ignorance of the underlying UV theory through their Wilson coefficients. However, not all values of these coefficients are consistent with fundamental physical principles. In this paper, we explore the consequences of imposing causal propagation on the comoving curvature perturbation in the EFT of inflation, particularly its impact on the primordial power spectrum and the effective sound speed $c_s^\text{eff}$. We investigate scenarios where $c_s^\text{eff}$ undergoes a transition, remaining consistent with CMB constraints at early times but later experiencing a drastic change, becoming highly subluminal. Such scenarios allow the primordial power spectrum to grow at small scales, potentially leading to the formation of primordial black holes or the generation of scalar-induced gravitational waves. We find the generic feature that in a causal theory, luminal sound speeds imply a free theory, effectively constraining the dynamics. Additionally, we obtain that when considering natural values for the Wilson coefficients, maintaining the validity of the EFT and the weakly coupled regime, and enforcing causal propagation of the EFT modes, the power spectrum cannot increase drastically. This imposes significant constraints on the parameter space of models aiming to produce such features.</description>

      <title>Local Quenches from a Krylov Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate local quench dynamics in two-dimensional conformal field theories using Krylov space methods. We derive Lanczos coefficients, spread complexity, and Krylov entropies for local joining and splitting quenches in theories on an infinite line, a circle, a finite interval, and at finite temperature. We examine how these quantities depend on the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory and find that both spread complexity and Krylov entropy are proportional to it. Interestingly, Krylov entropies evolve logarithmically with time, mirroring standard entanglement entropies, making them useful for extracting the central charge. In the large central charge limit, using holography, we establish a connection between the rate of spread complexity and the proper momentum of the tip of the end-of-the world brane, which probes the bulk analogously to a point particle. Our results further demonstrate that spread complexity and Krylov entropies are powerful tools for probing non-equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Codimension one defects in free scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study various aspects of codimension one defects in free scalar field theory, with particular emphasis on line defects in two-dimensions. These defects are generically non-conformal, but include conformal and topological defects as special cases. Our analysis is based on the interplay between two complementary descriptions, the first involving matching conditions imposed on fields and their derivatives across the defect, and the second on the resummation of perturbation theory in terms of renormalized defect couplings. Using either description as appropriate we compute a variety of observables: correlators of fields in the presence of such defects; the defect anomalous dimension; multiple defects and their fusion; canonical quantization and instabilities; ring shaped defects with application to the g-theorem and the entanglement entropy of accelerating defects; defects on the torus and Cardy formulas for the asymptotic density of states of the defect Hilbert space; and quenches produced by spacelike defects. The simplicity of the model allows for explicit computation of all these quantities, and provides a starting point for more complicated theories involving interactions.</description>

      <title>Applications of de Sitter Causality Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find explicit de Sitter shockwave solutions in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. We use these to determine the dimensional-dependent "stretching" of the de Sitter Penrose diagram in the presence of a shock or black hole. This stretching sets the scale at which superluminalities in de Sitter can be considered resolvable. We then consider an RFF coupling for a spin-1 particle and a Gauss-Bonnet coupling for a spin-2 particle and analyze these in terms of our proposed de Sitter causality criteria. We briefly discuss the connections between our results and corresponding results in anti de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Radially symmetric scalar field solutions in the presence of cuscuton term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate radially symmetric solutions in arbitrary dimensions in scalar field models in the presence of the cuscuton term. We introduce a first-order formalism compatible with the equation of motion which supports field configurations engendering minimum energy and show that the cuscuton term does not induce instabilities in the solutions. To illustrate the general results, we study two distinct classes of models and present analytical solutions and the corresponding energy densities.</description>

      <title>Homotopy Manin Theories: Generalising Third-Way, Yang-Mills and Integrable Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manin theories are a class of non-topological deformations of Chern-Simons theories that naturally realise the third-way mechanism and furthermore admit localisation despite not being supersymmetric in the usual sense. In this paper, we extend this construction to higher dimensions, thereby producing a large class of examples of third-way-type theories. Furthermore, the construction naturally yields Yang-Baxter integrable deformations of the principal chiral model as well as gravitational models various dimensions.</description>

      <title>Model spaces as constrained Hamiltonian systems: I. Application to $\mathrm{SU}(2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by group-theoretical questions that arise in the context of asymptotic symmetries in gravity, we study model spaces and their quantization from the viewpoint of constrained Hamiltonian systems. More precisely, we propose a definition of a model space for a generic Lie group $G$ as a suitable second class constrained system associated to the cotangent bundle $T^{*}G$. Before turning to the non-compact infinite-dimensional groups relevant in the gravitational setting, we work out all details in the simplest case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Besides recovering well-known results on the quantum theory of angular momentum from a unified perspective, the analysis sheds some light on the definition and properties of spin-weighted/monopole spherical harmonics.</description>

      <title>Dual Non-Lorentzian Backgrounds for Matrix Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of non-Lorentzian geometries arising from BPS decoupling limits of string theory that are central to matrix theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence. We focus on duality transformations between ten-dimensional non-Lorentzian geometries coupled to matrix theory on D-branes. We demonstrate that T- and S-duality transformations exhibit novel asymmetric properties: depending not only on the choice of transformation but also on the value of the background fields, the codimension of the foliation structure of the dual non-Lorentzian background may be different or the same. This duality asymmetry underlies features observed in the study of non-commutativity and Morita equivalence in matrix and gauge theory. Finally, we show how the holographic correspondence involving non-commutative Yang-Mills fits into our framework, from which we further obtain novel holographic examples with non-Lorentzian bulk geometries.</description>

      <title>Probing non-equilibrium steady states of the Klein-Gordon field with Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The NESS arises from bringing two semi-infinite heat baths into thermal contact along a hypersurface. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the resulting transition rates with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not properly couple to the heat flow, resulting in the detector to merely register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.</description>

      <title>Positivity of the Veneziano Amplitude in Ten Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Veneziano amplitude describing the tree-level scattering of four open superstrings is expected to be consistent with unitarity in ten spacetime dimensions. While this follows indirectly from the no-ghost theorem, a direct proof at the level of the amplitude has only been found for $D\leq 6$. In this note, we close this gap by providing a complete proof for the partial-wave positivity of the Veneziano amplitude in $D\leq 10$, derived directly from its definition in terms of the Euler beta function. We also demonstrate that this proof can be modified to show positivity of a wider family of amplitudes relevant to the $S$-matrix bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Hall algebras of one-dimensional sheaves on surfaces and Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We begin the systematic study of cohomological Hecke operators of modifications of coherent sheaves on a smooth surface $X$, along a fixed proper curve $Z \subset X$. We develop the necessary geometric foundations in order to define the $T$-equivariant cohomological Hall algebra $\mathbf{HA}^{\mathbf{D}, T}_{X,Z}$ of the moduli stack of coherent sheaves on $X$ with set-theoretic support on $Z$, in the setting of a general motivic formalism $\mathbf{D}$. The algebra $\mathbf{HA}^{\mathbf{D}, A}_{X,Z}$ is functorial with respect to closed immersions $Z' \subset Z$ and transformations of the motivic formalism $\mathbf{D}$, and only depends on the formal neighborhood $\widehat{X}_Z$ of $Z$ in $X$.
  Assume $\mathbf{D}$ gives rise to Borel-Moore homology. When $X$ is a resolution of a Kleinian singularity and $Z$ is the exceptional divisor, we explicitly identify $\mathbf{HA}^T_{X,Z}$ with a completed nonstandard positive half $\mathbb{Y}^+_\infty(\mathfrak{g})$ of the affine Yangian $\mathbb{Y}(\mathfrak{g})$ of the corresponding affine ADE type Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Let $Z_1,Z_2 \subset X$ be curves with $Z_1\cap Z_2$ being zero-dimensional. We conjecture a PBW type theorem relating the COHAs of the pairs $(X, Z_1\cup Z_2), (X, Z_1)$, and $(X, Z_2)$ and partially prove it in several interesting cases, including all Kleinian resolutions of singularities and elliptic surfaces of types $D$ and $E$.
  Our main tools are: (i) a continuity theorem describing the behavior of COHAs of objects in the heart of $t$-structures $\tau_n$ when the sequence $(\tau_n)_n$ converges in an appropriate sense to a fixed $t$-structure $\tau_\infty$; (ii) a theorem relating the action of the braid group $B_Q$ by derived autoequivalences on the preprojective algebra of a quiver $Q$ with the algebraic action of $B_Q$ on the associated COHA $\mathbf{HA}^T_Q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently proposed (arxiv:2502.08887) that the time crystal Lagrangian introduced by Shapere and Wilczek in 2012 could be a model of dark energy. I point out that the model has an instability that drives its energy density to negative values, which may render it unsuitable as a model of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Three-Body Non-Locality in Particle Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of entanglement and Bell non-locality among multi-particle quantum systems offers a profound avenue for testing and understanding the limits of quantum mechanics and local real hidden variable theories. In this work, we examine non-local correlations among three massless spin-1/2 particles generated from the three-body decay of a massive particle, utilizing a framework based on general four-fermion interactions. By analyzing several inequalities, we address the detection of deviations from quantum mechanics as well as violations of two key hidden variable theories: fully local-real and bipartite local-real theories. Our approach encompasses the standard Mermin inequality and the tight $4 \times 4 \times 2$ inequality introduced by Laskowski et al., providing a comprehensive framework for probing three-partite non-local correlations.

      <title>'t Hooft anomalies in metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I review some recent results on understanding the physics of metals in an exact non-perturbative way through the powerful field-theoretic concepts of emergent symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies. A 't Hooft anomaly is a discrete topological property that quantum field theories with global symmetries can have. I explain how many of the properties of metals can in fact be viewed as direct consequences of the anomaly. This allows a structural understanding of metals, including non-Fermi liquids, to be obtained even in the absence of any exact solution for the strongly coupled dynamics. I then outline the main limitations and outstanding questions.</description>

      <title>Dyonic Taub-NUT-AdS Black Branes: Thermodynamics and Phase Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent developments in the thermodynamics of Taub-NUT spaces and the absence of Misner strings in Taub-NUT solutions with flat horizons, we investigated the phase structure of dyonic Taub-NUT solutions. We follow the treatment proposed in arXiv:2206.09124 and arXiv:2304.06705 to introduce the nut parameter as a conserved charge to the first law. Although the calculated quantities satisfy the first law, we have found a larger class of charges that satisfy the first law and depend on some arbitrary parameter which we call $\alpha$. We choose to describe phase diagrams as NUT parameter-Temperature graphs to show borders of big and small black hole phases. We study the phase structure of these spaces in a mixed ensemble (i.e., we fix the electric potential, the nut parameter, and the magnetic charge), which we classify into different cases depending on the value of $\alpha$. In some of these cases we have first-order phase transitions that end with critical points. These classes could include up to four critical points, again, depending on $\alpha$ and the other quantities.</description>

      <title>Structure of center vortex matter in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of center vortices is studied in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory for the first time to illuminate the interplay between elementary (center charge $\pm 1$) and doubly charged vortices. Unlike in SU(3), where charge $+2$ vortices are simply elementary vortices with reversed orientations in spacetime, these possibilities are physically distinct in SU(4). Visualizations of the vortex structure in three-dimensional slices reveal the various ways in which doubly charged objects manifest, as the convergence and matching of elementary vortices or as isolated doubly charged loops. An algorithm is described to classify every doubly charged chain as one of these three types. A collection of vortex statistics is considered to quantify the vortex structure. Many of these pertain to the novel doubly charged objects, including their relative proportions and chain lengths, which are analyzed to highlight the differences between each chain type. Three different lattice spacings are employed to investigate the approach to the continuum limit. Vortex matching chains are found to be shorter on average but also more prevalent than vortex convergences, ascribed to their interpretation as extended center monopoles. In addition, the lengths of both vortex convergences and vortex matchings are observed to follow an exponential distribution, allowing the introduction of a constant probability for a doubly charged chain to split into two elementary vortices as it propagates. Combined, these findings provide a characterization of the vortices that comprise center vortex structures in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Color-magnetic correlations in SU(N) lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by color-magnetic instabilities in QCD, we investigate field-strength correlations in both SU(2) and SU(3) lattice QCD.In the Euclidean Landau gauge, we numerically calculate the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation, $C_{\perp}(r) \equiv \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \perp)) \rangle$ with $\perp \equiv x, y$, and the parallel-type one, $C_{\parallel}(r) \equiv \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \parallel) \rangle$ with $\parallel~\equiv z, t$. In the Landau gauge, all two-point field-strength correlations $\langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s')\rangle$ are described by these two quantities, due to the Lorentz and global SU($N_c$) color symmetries. Curiously, the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ is found to be always negative for arbitrary $r$, except for the same-point correlation. The parallel-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\parallel}(r)$ is always positive. In the infrared region, $C_{\perp}(r)$ and $C_{\parallel}(r)$ strongly cancel each other, which leads to an approximate cancellation for the sum of the field-strength correlations as $\sum_{\mu, \nu} \langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^a_{\mu\nu}(s')\rangle \propto C_{\perp}(|s-s'|)+ C_{\parallel}(|s-s'|) \sim 0$. Next, we decompose the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ into quadratic, cubic and quartic terms of the gluon field $A_\mu$. The quadratic term is always negative, which is explained by the Yukawa-type gluon propagator $\langle A_\mu(s)A_\mu(s')\rangle \propto e^{-mr}/r$ with $r\equiv |s-s'|$ in the Landau gauge. The quartic term gives a relatively small contribution. In the infrared region, the cubic term is positive and tends to cancel with the quadratic term, resulting in a small value of $C_{\perp}(r)$.</description>

      <title>Non-interacting holographic dark energy with Torsion via Hubble Radius</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconstruct a holographic dark energy model with a scalar torsion $\phi$ under the assumption of no interaction between dark energy and dark matter. We show that the accelerating expansion can occur by setting the IR cut-off to the Hubble radius as $L=H^{-1}$ with the Hubble parameter $H$. Motivated by two physical choices based on Friedmann equations and the holographic principle, tellingly, spin-induced torsion at non-zero matter density $\rho_m \neq 0$ and $H$-dependence of torsion in empty space $\rho_m =0$, we propose a time-dependent scalar torsion $\phi(t) = k H(t) ({\rho_{m}(t)}/ \rho_c^0)$ with a dimensionless constant $k$ and the current critical density $\rho_c^0$. As a result, we find minima $(\omega_X^{0})_{min}$ of the current equation of state for dark energy for various values of the free parameter $c$, yielding $-1 &lt; (\omega_X^{0})_{min} &lt; -0.778$ as $c$ changes from $1$ to $0.654$. Also, we get the values of the current dimensionless ratio, $(\phi_0/H_{0})_{min}$ corresponding to the minima $(\omega^{0}_{X})_{min}$, which is consistent with weak torsion assumption $|\phi_0| /H_{0} &lt; 1$, and thus it ensuring model viability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Casimir Wormhole is a Traversable Wormhole powered by a Casimir energy source within a static reference frame. A natural extension of this system is the inclusion of rotation. We will explore two basic configurations: one with radially varying Casimir plates and another with parametrically fixed plates. In both cases, we will show that rotations do not alter the structure of a Casimir wormhole, and the behavior observed in a static frame is reaffirmed. Since the case with radially varying plates predicts a constant angular velocity as a solution, we must introduce an exponential cut-off and an additional scale to prevent rotations at infinity. This adjustment is not necessary when the plates are kept parametrically fixed. Moreover, the consistency of the Einstein Field Equations is ensured with the help of an additional source without an accompanying energy density, which we interpret as a thermal stress tensor.</description>

Abstract: The exploration of the surrounding world and the universe is an important theme in the legacy of humankind. The detection of gravitational waves is adding a new dimension to this grand effort. What are the fundamental physical laws governing the dynamics of the universe? What is the fundamental composition of the universe? How has the universe evolved in the past and how will it evolve in the future? These are the basic questions that press for answers. The space-based gravitational wave detector TianQin will tune in to gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency range ($10^{-4} \sim 1$ Hz, to be specific), opening a new gravitational wave spectrum window to explore many of the previously hidden sectors of the universe. TianQin will discover many astrophysical systems, populating the universe at different redshifts: some will be of new types that have never been detected before, some will have very high signal-to-noise ratios, and some will have very high parameter estimation precision. The plethora of information collected will bring us to new fronts on which to search for the breaking points of general relativity, the possible violation of established physical laws, the signature of possible new gravitational physics and new fundamental fields, and to improve our knowledge on the expansion history of the universe. In this white paper, we highlight the advances that TianQin can bring to fundamental physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of density perturbation and gravitational wave production from cosmological first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted three-dimensional lattice simulations to study the density perturbation and generation of gravitational waves (GWs) through first-order phase transition (FOPTs). Our findings reveal that for the case of $\beta/H = 6$, density perturbations successfully collapse into PBHs. Moreover, smaller values of $\beta/H$ are more conducive to PBH formation, while the strength of the phase transition $\alpha$ has a relatively minor impact on PBH production. We find that for $\alpha &gt; 1$, the dominant contribution to the density perturbation comes from the delay of vacuum decay, whereas for $\alpha &lt; 1$, the bubble walls' moving forward behavior becomes the primary source. Additionally, the power spectrum of density perturbations generated by the phase transition exhibits a slope of $k^3$ at small wavenumbers and $k^{-1.5}$ at large wavenumbers. Furthermore, we calculated the GW power spectra, and the simulation results show a slope of $k^3$ at small wavenumbers and $k^{-2}$ at large wavenumbers. Our numerical simulations confirm that slow PTs can produce PBHs and provide predictions for the GW power spectrum, offering crucial theoretical support for GW detection.</description>

      <title>Love numbers beyond GR from the modified Teukolsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the full set of tidal Love numbers of non-rotating black holes in an effective field theory extension of general relativity. We achieve our results using a recently introduced modified Teukolsky equation that describes the perturbations of black holes in this theory. We show how to identify the Love numbers and their beta functions in a systematic and gauge invariant way, applying analytic continuation on the angular number $\ell$ when necessary. We observe that there are three types of Love numbers: electric, magnetic, and a ``mixing'' type, associated to parity-breaking theories, that we identify here for the first time. The modified Teukolsky equation proves to be very useful as it allows us to obtain all the different Love numbers in a unified framework. We compare our results with previous literature that utilized the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations to compute Love numbers, finding perfect agreement. The method introduced here paves the way towards the computation of Love numbers of rotating black holes beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Orbital Chaos: The Wild Heart of Fuzzy Dark Matter Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the behavior of test particles on top of a galactic-type of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) structure, characterized by the core-halo density profile found in simulations. Our workhorse structure is an anisotropic, time-dependent, virialized core-tail FDM clump resulting from a multicore merger. For our analysis we allow this structure to keep evolving, which implies that the core oscillates and accretes matter from the halo, while the halo dynamics is dominated by its characteristic high kinetic energy. On top of this time-dependent structure that in turn has a time-dependent gravitational potential, we solve the motion equations of test particles with initial conditions associated to circular orbits at different radii. Our results indicate that: 1) no trajectory remains circular, 2) the trajectories are sensitive to initial conditions and 3) the departure of initially near trajectories has always a positive Lyapunov exponent. A qualitative result is that the motion of test particles is more erratic with a bigger Lyapunov exponent within and near the core than in the halo region, which can be understood in terms of the random motion of the core within the core-halo structure. We expect these results warn on the importance of the anisotropic and time-dependent nature of FDM clumps when studying the motion of test particles.</description>

Abstract: We study the stability properties of multi-state configurations of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system without self-interaction, with monopolar and first dipolar components $(1,0,0)$+$(2,1,0)$. We show these configurations studied are stable using numerical simulations, and using criteria of stationarity, unitarity and time dependence consistency. The study covers a range of states with monopolar to dipolar mass ratio between 47 and 0.17. The astrophysical implication of this result is that this type of configurations is at least stable and can be considered physically sound in multi-state ultralight bosonic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization group study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.</description>

Abstract: In this work the effect of anisotropy on computational complexity is considered by CA proposal in holographic two-sided black brane dual of a strongly coupled gauge theory. It is shown that due to confinement-deconfinement phase transition there are two different behaviors: by increase in anisotropy there would be an increase in complexity growth rate in small anisotropy and a decreases in the complexity growth rate in large anisotropy. In the extreme case the very large anisotropy leads to the unity of the complexity growth rate and complexity itself, it means that in this case getting the target state from the reference state is reachable by no effort. Moreover, we suggest that $\frac{1}{M}\frac{dC}{dt}$ is a better representation of system degrees of freedom rather than the complexity growth rate $\frac{dC}{dt}$ and show that how it is related to inverse anisotropic catalysis. In addition, we consider the one-sided black brane dual to the quantum quench and showed that increase in anisotropy comes with decrease in complexity regardless of the anisotropy value which is due to the fact that the system do not experience a phase transition.</description>

      <title>Trans-series from condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19356v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (SVZ) sum rules provide a method to obtain trans-series expansions in many quantum field theories, in which exponentially small corrections are calculated by combining the operator product expansion with the assumption of vacuum condensates. In some solvable models, exact expressions for trans-series can be obtained from non-perturbative results, and this makes it possible to test the SVZ method by comparing its predictions to these exact trans-series. In this paper we perform such a precision test in the example of the fermion self-energy in the Gross-Neveu model. Its exact trans-series expansion can be extracted from the large $N$ solution, at the first non-trivial order in $1/N$. It is given by an infinite series of exponentially small corrections involving factorially divergent power series in the 't Hooft parameter. We show that the first two corrections are associated to two-quark and four-quark condensates, and we reproduce the corresponding power series exactly, and at all loops, by using the SVZ method. In addition, the numerical values of the condensates can be extracted from the exact result, up to order $1/N$.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity as an order parameter for quantum chaotic-integrable transitions</title>

Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently emerged as a new paradigm to characterize quantum chaos in many-body systems. However, which features of Krylov complexity are prerogative of quantum chaotic systems and how they relate to more standard probes, such as spectral statistics or out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), remain open questions. Recent insights have revealed that in quantum chaotic systems Krylov state complexity exhibits a distinct peak during time evolution before settling into a well-understood late-time plateau. In this work, we propose that this Krylov complexity peak (KCP) is a hallmark of quantum chaotic systems and suggest that its height could serve as an `order parameter' for quantum chaos. We demonstrate that the KCP effectively identifies chaotic-integrable transitions in two representative quantum mechanical models at both infinite and finite temperature: the mass-deformed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Our findings align with established results from spectral statistics and OTOCs, while introducing an operator-independent diagnostic for quantum chaos, offering more `universal' insights and a deeper understanding of the general properties of quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>From Operator Product Expansion to Anomalous Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method for computing renormalization functions, which is based on the ideas of operator product expansion and large momentum expansion. In this method, the renormalization $Z$-factors are determined by the ultraviolet finiteness of Wilson coefficients in the dimensional regularization scheme. The ultraviolet divergence is extracted solely from two-point functions at the large momentum limit. We develop this method in scalar field theories and provide a general framework for computing anomalous dimensions of field, mass, couplings and composite operators. In particular, it is applied to 6-dimensional cubic scalar theory and 4-dimensional quartic scalar theory. We demonstrate this method by computing the anomalous dimension of the $\phi^Q$ operator in cubic theory up to four loops for arbitrary $Q$, which is in agreement with the known result in the large $N$ limit. The idea of computing anomalous dimensions from operator production expansion is general and can be extended beyond scalar theories, and it is demonstrated by examples of Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model with general operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-simply laced quivers, despite the lack of complete Lagrangian descriptions, play an important role in characterising moduli spaces of supersymmetric field theories. Notably, the moduli space of instantons in non-simply laced gauge groups can be understood by means of such quivers. We generalise the notion of non-simply laced unitary quivers to those whose edges carry two labels $(p,q)$, dubbed $(p,q)$-edged quivers. The special case of $(p,1)$ corresponds to a conventional non-simply laced edge studied in the literature. In the case of unframed $(p,q)$-edged quivers, we show how to parametrise the lattice of magnetic fluxes upon ungauging the decoupled $\mathrm{U}(1)$, and how one can pick sublattices thereof corresponding to different global forms of the quiver related by discrete gauging. This form of discrete gauging can be applied to any unframed unitary quivers, not just ones with generalised edges. We utilise both the Hilbert series and the superconformal index to study moduli spaces and 't Hooft anomalies. In particular, we study mixed 't Hooft anomalies between a one-form symmetry and a zero-form continuous topological symmetry in various $(p,q)$-edged quivers. We also provide an alternative realisation of the moduli space of $\mathfrak{so}(2n+1)$ instantons via gauging discrete symmetries in supersymmetric QCD with a symplectic gauge group and a large number of flavours.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a renormalization-inspired perturbation expansion we show that oscillons in a generic field theory in (1+1) dimensions arise as dressed $Q$-balls of a universal (up to the leading nonlinear order) complex field theory. This theory reveals a close similarity to the integrable complex sine-Gordon model which possesses exact multi-$Q$-balls. We show that excited oscillons, with characteristic modulations of their amplitude, are two-oscillons bound states generated from a two $Q$-ball solution.</description>

      <title>(Quasi-)normal modes of rotating black holes and new solitons in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the scalar field (quasi-)normal modes of recently derived rotating black holes within the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory at the Chern-Simons point in five dimensions. We also examine the mode spectrum of these probes on new static gravitational solitons. These solitons, featuring a regular center, are constructed from static black holes with gravitational hair via a double analytic continuation. By imposing ingoing boundary conditions at the horizons of rotating black holes, ensuring regularity at the soliton centers, and imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions at infinity, we obtain numerical spectra for the rotating black holes and solitons. For static black holes, we demonstrate analytically that the imaginary part of the mode frequencies is negative. Our analysis of the massless Klein-Gordon equation on five-dimensional geometries reveals an infinite family of gaped, massive three-dimensional Klein-Gordon fields, despite the presence of a non-compact extended direction. For the static solitons, the frequencies are real and non-equispaced, whereas in the rotating black holes, counter-rotating modes are absorbed more quickly, and the imaginary part of the co-rotating modes approaches zero as extremality is approached. Additionally, we show that both the rotating black holes and solitons can be equipped with non-trivial torsion, leading to a novel branch of solutions.</description>

      <title>String Theory in a Pinch: Resolving the Gregory-Laflamme Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin enough black strings are unstable to growing ripples along their length, eventually pinching and forming a naked singularity on the horizon. We investigate how string theory can resolve this singularity. First, we study the string-scale version of the static non-uniform black strings that branch off at the instability threshold: "string-ball strings", which are linearly extended, self-gravitating configurations of string balls obtained in the Horowitz-Polchinski (HP) approach to near-Hagedorn string states. We construct non-uniform HP strings in spatial dimensions $d\leq 6$ and show that, as the inhomogeneity increases, they approach localized HP balls. We also examine the thermodynamic properties of the different phases in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles. We find that, for a sufficiently small mass, the uniform HP string will be stable and not evolve into a non-uniform or localized configuration. Building on these results and independent evidence from the evolution of the black string instability with $\alpha'$ corrections, we propose that, at least in $d=4,5$, string theory slows and eventually halts the pinching evolution at a classically stable stringy neck. In $d\geq 6$ this transition is likely to occur into a puffed-up string ball. The system then enters a slower phase in which the neck gradually evaporates into radiation. We discuss this scenario as a framework for understanding how string theory resolves the formation of naked singularities.</description>

      <title>Exploring types I and IIA effective actions through T-duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-established that compactification of type I string theory on a circle $S^{(1)}$ transforms under T-duality into type I' theory, which is the compactification of type IIA string theory on the orbifold $\tilde{S}^{(1)}/\mathbb{Z}_2$, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ combines world-sheet parity with spacetime parity along the dual circle $\tilde{S}^{(1)}$. We propose that the classical effective action of type I, when reduced on a circle, should transform under the Buscher rules into the corresponding orbifold reduction of the classical effective action of type IIA theory. This T-duality symmetry can serve as a powerful constraint to determine the bosonic couplings in the 10-dimensional effective actions of both type I and type IIA theories, particularly those couplings that remain non-vanishing under orbifold reduction.
  In the classical type IIA effective action at the critical dimension, bosonic fields appear at the 2-derivative, 8-derivative, and higher-order levels. In contrast, the type I effective action includes additional 4-derivative, 6-derivative, and higher-order couplings, which arise from the anomalous Ramond-Ramond (R-R) gauge transformation in the Green-Schwarz mechanism. We demonstrate that our proposal uniquely fixes the leading 2-derivative couplings in both type I and type IIA theories, with the exception of the Chern-Simons coupling in type IIA theory, which vanishes under orbifold reduction. Additionally, we observe that the higher-derivative couplings in the 10-dimensional type I effective action, stemming from the anomalous R-R gauge transformation, are exclusively associated with higher-genus contributions. These terms cannot map to any corresponding terms in the 10-dimensional type IIA effective action, as recent findings indicate that only classical effective actions remain invariant under T-duality upon circular reduction.</description>

      <title>Toolkit for General 2d Scalar Potential in LCT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present efficient algorithms for obtaining the Hamiltonian in Lightcone Conformal Truncation (LCT) for a 2d scalar field with a generic potential. We apply this method to the sine-Gordon and sinh-Gordon models in $1+1d$, and find precise agreement with integrability results when the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the deforming cosine/cosinh potential is in the range $ \Delta \leq 1$. The agreement provides additional evidence for a recent conjecture for how to compute the effective lightcone Hamiltonian in this class of models. In addition, to high precision, we provide the first direct confirmation for the conjectured self-duality of the sinh-Gordon model ($\Delta &lt; 0)$, which relates $\Delta \leftrightarrow 4/\Delta$. As the dimension approaches the upper limit $\Delta=1$ from below, we show analytically that the Hamiltonian matrix elements exactly reproduce those of a free Majorana fermion, demonstrating how bosonization is manifested in the LCT basis. We comment on the possible extension of the approach to $\Delta &gt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Re-parameterization Invariance of FRW Model: Supervariable and BRST Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization of a $(0 + 1)$-dimensional cosmological Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model. This quantization leverages the classical infinitesimal and continuous re-parameterization symmetry transformations of the system. To derive the nilpotent re-parameterization invariant BRST-anti-BRST symmetry transformations for the scale factor and corresponding momentum variables present in the cosmological FRW model, we employ the modified Bonora-Tonin supervariable approach (MBTSA) to BRST formalism. Through this approach, we also establish the BRST-anti-BRST invariant Curci-Ferrari (CF)-type restriction for this cosmological re-parameterization invariant model. Further, we obtain the off-shell nilpotent quantum BRST-anti-BRST symmetry transformations for other variables within the model using the (anti-)chiral supervariable approach (ACSA) to BRST formalism. Within the framework of ACSA, the CF-type restriction is demonstrated through two key aspects: $(i)$ the invariance of the coupled Lagrangians under symmetry transformations, and $(ii)$ the absolute anti-commutativity of the conserved BRST-anti-BRST charges. Notably, applying the MBTSA to a physical cosmological system, specifically a one-dimensional one, constitutes a novel contribution to this work. Additionally, in the application of ACSA, we restrict our analysis to (anti-)chiral super expansions of supervariables, leading to the unique observation of the absolute anti-commutativity of the conserved BRST-anti-BRST charges. Moreover, we highlight that the CF-type restriction demonstrates a universal nature, remaining consistent across any re-parameterization invariant models in general D-dimensional spacetime.</description>

Abstract: This work is a sequel to [arXiv:2410.18575], and a third and final installment of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how, via a 3d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of certain topologically-twisted 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ and 8d $\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories, one can derive novel Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories that 2-categorify the 3d-Haydys-Witten, Haydys-Witten, and holomorphic Donaldson-Thomas Floer homology of two, four, and five-manifolds, respectively. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the aforementioned twisted gauge theories, these Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories can be shown to be equivalent to corresponding Fukaya-Seidel type $A_{\infty}$-categories. In the 8d case, one can also derive higher $A_{\infty}$-categories, such as a novel Cauchy-Riemann-Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-3-category that 3-categorifies the Haydys-Witten Floer homology of four-manifolds via a 4d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the theory. Together with previous results from [arXiv:2410.18575] and [arXiv:2311.18302], our work furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [3], Doan-Rezchikov [4], and Cao [5].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the vacuum expectation values of conserved charges in two dimensional integrable theories. We study the situations when the ground-state can be described by a single integral equation with a finite support: the thermodynamic limit of the Bethe ansatz equation. We solve this integral equation by expanding around the infinite support limit and write the expectation values in terms of an explicitly calculable trans-series, which includes both perturbative and all non-perturbative corrections. These different types of corrections are interrelated via resurgence relations, which we all reveal. We provide explicit formulas for a wide class of bosonic and fermionic models including the $O(N)$ (super) symmetric nonlinear sigma and Gross-Neveu, the $SU(N)$ invariant principal chiral and chiral Gross-Neveu models along with the Lieb-Liniger and Gaudin-Yang models and the case of the disk capacitor. With numerical analyses we demonstrate that the laterally Borel resummed trans-series is convergent and reproduces the physical result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the real time dynamics of the radiation produced by a local quench in a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) with $d&gt;2$. Using the interpretation of the higher-dimensional twist operator as a conformal defect, we study the time evolution of the entanglement entropy of the radiation across a spherical entangling surface. We provide an analytic estimate for the early- and late-time behavior of the entanglement entropy and derive an upper bound valid at all times. We extend our analysis to the case of a boundary CFT (BCFT) and derive similar results through a detailed discussion of the setup with two conformal defects (the boundary and the twist operator). We conclude with a holographic analysis of the process, computing the time evolution of the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) as the area of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface in a backreacted geometry. This gives a Page-like curve in agreement with the early- and late-time results obtained with CFT methods. The extension to a holographic BCFT setup is generically hard and we consider the case of a tensionless end-of-the-world brane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Renormalization Group Theory we show that oscillons in (1+1)-dimensions can be obtained, at the leading nonlinear order, from $Q$-balls of universal complex field theories. For potentials with a nonzero cubic or quartic term the universal $Q$-ball theory is well approximated by the integrable complex sine-Gordon model. This allows us to generalize the usual perturbative expansion by Fodor et. al. beyond the simplest unmodulated oscillon case. Concretely, we explain the characteristic amplitude modulations of excited oscillons as an effect of formation of a two-$Q$-ball (two-oscillon) bound state.</description>

      <title>Simpler Hamiltonian structure of Gravity in degenerate limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze Hamiltonian gravity in the limit of a vanishing (spatial) triad determinant. In the context of Barbero-Immirzi formulation, the Lorentzian constraints in this limit are found to exhibit a formal similarity to the Euclidean constraints of Ashtekar's self-dual formulation, modulo the difference that the spatial diffeomorphisms become trivial. Further, we show that the Carrollian limit of gravity emerges as a special case, thus providing it a geometric interpretation independent of either the speed of light or coupling constants.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Witten Invariants and Mirror Symmetry For Non-Fano Varieties Via Tropical Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under mirror symmetry a non-Fano variety $X$ corresponds to an instanton corrected Hori-Vafa potential $W$. The classical period of $W$ equals the regularized quantum period of $X$, which is a generating function for descendant Gromov-Witten invariants. These periods define closed mirror maps relating complex with symplectic parameters and open mirror maps relating coordinates on the mirror curves.
  We interpret the corrections to $W$ by broken lines in a scattering diagram, so that $W$ is the primitive theta function $\vartheta_1$. We show that, after wall crossing to infinity and application of the closed mirror map, $W=\vartheta_1$ is equal to the open mirror map. By tropical correspondence, $\vartheta_1$ is a generating function for $2$-marked logarithmic Gromov-Witten invariants, which are algebraic analogues of counts of Maslov index $2$ disks. This generalizes the predictions of mirror symmetry to the non-Fano case.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the dynamics of a charged spinning body in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the motion of the spinning body (in the pole-dipole approximation) in the gravitational and electromagnetic fields described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon-Souriau equations. First, we define a novel spin condition for the body with the magnetic dipole moment proportional to spin, which generalizes the one proposed by Ohashi-Kyrian-Semer\'ak for gravity. As a result, we get the whole family of charged spinning particle models in the curved spacetime with remarkably simple dynamics (momentum and velocity are parallel). Applying the reparametrization procedure, for a specific dipole moment, we obtain equations of motion with constant mass and gyromagnetic factor. Next, we show that these equations follow from an effective Hamiltonian formalism, previously interpreted as a classical model of the charged Dirac particle.</description>

      <title>Calculating Bayesian evidence for inflationary models using CONNECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian evidence is a standard tool used for comparing the ability of different models to fit available data and is used extensively in cosmology. However, since the evidence calculation involves performing an integral of the likelihood function over the entire space of model parameters this can be prohibitively expensive in terms of both CPU and time consumption. For example, in the simplest $\Lambda$CDM model and using CMB data from the Planck satellite, the dimensionality of the model space is over 30 (typically 6 cosmological parameters and 28 nuisance parameters). Even the simplest possible model requires $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ calls to an Einstein--Boltzmann solver such as CLASS or CAMB and takes several days.
  Here we present calculations of Bayesian evidence using the CONNECT framework to calculate cosmological observables. We demonstrate that we can achieve results comparable to those obtained using Einstein--Boltzmann solvers, but at a minute fraction of the computational cost. As a test case, we then go on to compute Bayesian evidence ratios for a selection of slow-roll inflationary models.
  In the setup presented here, the total computation time is completely dominated by the likelihood function calculation which now becomes the main bottleneck for increasing computation speed.</description>

      <title>Implications of DES 5YR SNe Dataset for $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark Energy Survey five-year supernovae data (DES 5YR SNe) in conjunction with Planck CMB and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO data has detected a strong dynamical dark energy (DE) deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model.Here we shift the focus of DES data to the pressureless matter sector in the $\Lambda$CDM model by studying the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$. Employing primarily frequentist profile likelihoods, supported by complementary Bayesian methods, we demonstrate that $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift in the DES data up to a point that there is a $2.5 \sigma$ discrepancy with Planck. We relax the traditional $\Omega_m \leq 1$ prior to demonstrate negative DE densities $\Omega_m &gt; 1$ at the highest effective redshift probed. Nevertheless, the largest discrepancy with Planck occurs for profile likelihoods and posteriors peaked at $\Omega_m &lt; 1$ in the traditional $\Lambda$CDM regime. Our findings corroborate earlier observations in Pantheon and Pantheon+ datasets with an independent SNe dataset with a higher effective redshift. In an appendix, we confirm that curvature $\Omega_k$ decreases with effective redshift disfavouring a flat Universe in higher redshift DES SNe at $&gt; 3 \sigma$. Our choice of $\Omega_k$ prior leads to an underestimation of the tension with a flat Universe.</description>

      <title>Instability of nonsingular black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that nonsingular black holes realized in nonlinear electrodynamics are always prone to Laplacian instability around the center because of a negative squared sound speed in the angular direction. This is the case for both electric and magnetic BHs, where the instability of one of the vector-field perturbations leads to enhancing a dynamical gravitational perturbation in the even-parity sector. Thus, the background regular metric is no longer maintained in a steady state. Our results suggest that the construction of stable, nonsingular black holes with regular centers, if they exist, requires theories beyond nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Computing real-time quantum path integrals on Sewed, almost-Lefschetz thimbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to compute real-time path integrals numerically, by Monte-Carlo sampling on near-Lefschetz thimbles. We present a collection of tools based on the Lefschetz thimble methods, which together provide an alternative to existing methods such as the Generalised thimble. These involve a convenient coordinate parameterization of the thimble, direct numerical integration along a radial coordinate into an effective path integral weight and locally deforming the Lefschetz thimble using its Gaussian (non-interacting theory) counterpart in a region about the critical point. We apply this to quantum mechanics, identify possible pitfalls and benefits, and benchmark its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Gravitational memory: new results from post-Newtonian and self-force theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the (displacement) gravitational wave memory due to a quasicircular inspiral of two black holes using a variety of perturbative techniques. Within post-Newtonian theory, we extend previous results for non-spinning binaries to 3.5PN order. Using the gravitational self-force approach, we compute the memory at first order in the mass ratio for inspirals into a Kerr black hole. We do this both numerically and via a double post-Newtonian--self-force expansion which we carry out to 5PN order. At second order in the self-force approach, near-zone calculations encounter an infrared divergence associated with memory, which is resolved through matching the near-zone solution to a post-Minkowskian expansion in the far zone. We describe that matching procedure for the first time and show how it introduces nonlocal-in-time memory effects into the two-body dynamics at second order in the mass ratio, as was also predicted by recent 5PN calculations within the effective field theory approach. We then compute the gravitational-wave memory through second order in the mass ratio (excluding certain possible memory distortion effects) and find that it agrees well with recent results from numerical relativity simulations for near-comparable-mass binaries.</description>

Abstract: Stars have been recognized as optimal laboratories to probe axion properties. In the last decades there have been significant advances in this field due to a better modelling of stellar systems and accurate observational data. In this work we review the current status of constraints on axions from stellar physics. We focus in particular on the Sun, globular cluster stars, white dwarfs and (proto)-neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory treatment of neutrino flavor oscillations in matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study neutrino oscillations in background matter within the quantum field theory formalism where neutrino mass eigenstates are virtual particles. In this case, neutrino mass eigenstates are mixed owing to the interaction with matter. Assuming that neutrinos are Majorana particles, we find the exact propagators for massive neutrinos accounting for the interaction with matter by solving the analog of the Dyson equation. These propagators are used to calculate the transition probability which coincides with the prediction of the standard quantum mechanical treatment of neutrino flavor oscillations in uniform matter. Finally, we analyze the approximations made in our analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group field theory is a background-independent approach to quantum gravity whose starting point is the definition of a quantum field theory on an auxiliary group manifold (not interpreted as spacetime, but rather as the finite-dimensional configuration space of a single "atom" of geometry). Group field theory models can be seen as an extension of matrix and tensor models by additional data, and are traditionally defined through a functional integral whose perturbative expansion generates a sum over discrete geometries. More recently, some efforts have been directed towards formulations of group field theory based on a Hilbert space and operators, in particular in applications to cosmology. This is an attempt to review some of these formulations and their main ideas, to disentangle these constructions as much as possible from applications and phenomenology, and to put them into a wider context of quantum gravity research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of non-relativistic continuum field theories where the Euclidean spatial symmetry of the classical theory is violated in the quantum theory by an Adler-Bell-Jackiw-like anomaly. In particular, the continuous translation symmetry of the classical theory is broken in the quantum theory to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is extended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation streamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an elementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a well-known system.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal gravity in a proper tetrad frame: traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the revised Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity involving four auxiliary scalar fields, introduced to explain the standard cosmological background expansion history without fine-tuning issues. In particular, we simplify the complex field equations within a proper tetrad frame, thereby recasting the original system into a more tractable equivalent differential problem. We show that, by initially postulating the form of the $g_{tt}$ metric component, it is possible to reconstruct the distortion function of the gravitational model. We then describe a step-by-step procedure for solving the vacuum field equations in the case of a static and spherically symmetric spacetime. We apply our technique to find new traversable wormholes supported purely by gravity by employing either analytical, perturbative, or numerical methods. Finally, we discuss the main geometric properties of the obtained solutions. Our results present a feasible avenue for identifying novel compact objects while enhancing the comprehension of nonlocal gravitational theories.</description>
