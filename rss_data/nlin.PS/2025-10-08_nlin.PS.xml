      <title>Complete Synchronization and Pattern Selection through Amplitude Dynamics and Diffusion in Heterogeneous Oscillatory Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an intricate mechanism of pattern formation in globally coupled heterogeneous oscillatory media. In anodic electrochemical etching of silicon, the electrode surface splits into two amplitude-phase regions, while all oscillators remain frequency-locked. Additionally, the relative ratio of the pattern can be tuned via a coupling term. We introduce a heterogeneous, complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with global coupling to reproduce these patterns and study their formation. Neglecting diffusion shows that frequency entrainment arises from amplitude adaptation. Diffusion, on the other hand, enforces the selection of a unique cluster ratio. In quantitative agreement with simulations, a center-manifold reduction yields a Lyapunov functional that predicts the selected ratio. Both of these results establish a theoretical framework that connects experiment and theory. Moreover, they show how heterogeneity and diffusion convert degenerate cluster dynamics into robust pattern selection.</description>

      <title>Resonance with quasinormal modes in long-range kinks' collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a rational scalar field model in (1+1)-dimensions where the long-range character of the kinks is controllable. We show via numerical simulations that kinks with long-range tails on both sides can exhibit resonance windows. The resonant energy exchange mechanism occurs via the excitation of quasinormal modes, which we obtain via a spectral analysis. Additionally, we locate a resonance window in a family of $\phi^{10}$ models with long-range tails on both sides. Moreover, we propose a new algorithm for initializing long-range kink collisions, based on convection-diffusion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear transmission line: shock waves and the simple wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transmission lines we consider are constructed from the nonlinear inductors and the nonlinear capacitors. In the first part of the paper we additionally include linear ohmic resistors. Thus, the dissipation being taken into account leads to the existence of \mbox{shocks -- the} travelling waves with different asymptotically constant values of the voltage (the capacitor charge) and the current before and after the front of the wave. For the particular values of ohmic resistances (corresponding to strong dissipation) we obtain the analytic solution for the profile of a shock wave. Both the charge on a capacitor and current through the inductor are obtained as the functions of the time and space coordinate. In the case of weak dissipation, we obtain the stationary dispersive shock waves. In the second part of the paper we consider the nonlinear lossless transmission line. We formulate a simple wave approximation for such transmission line, which decouples left/right-going waves. The approximation can also be used for the lossy transmission line, which is considered in the first part of the paper, to describe the formation of the shock wave (but, of course, not the shock wave itself).</description>
