      <title>On the gamma transform and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make use of the Laplace transform and gamma function to construct a new integral transform having the property of mapping a derivative to the backward difference, whence we derive a method for solving difference equations and, relying on classical orthogonal polynomials, for obtaining combinatorial identities. A table of some basic functions is given in the Appendix.</description>

      <title>Uniform asymptotic expansions for the zeros of parabolic cylinder functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13936v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real and complex zeros of the parabolic cylinder function $U(a,z)$ are studied. Asymptotic expansions for the zeros are derived, involving the zeros of Airy functions, and these are valid for $a$ positive or negative and large in absolute value, uniformly for unbounded $z$ (real or complex). The accuracy of the approximations of the complex zeros is then demonstrated with some comparative tests using a highly precise numerical algorithm for finding the complex zeros of the function.</description>

      <title>Christoffel Transform and Multiple Orthogonal Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a connection between the Christoffel transform of orthogonal polynomials and multiple orthogonality systems containing a finitely supported measure. In consequence, the compatibility relations for the nearest neighbour recurrence coefficients provide a new algorithm for the computation of the Jacobi coefficients of the one-step or multi-step Christoffel transforms. More generally, we investigate multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with the system of measures obtained by applying a Christoffel transform to each of the orthogonality measures. We present an algorithm for computing the transformed recurrence coefficients, and determinantal formulas for the transformed multiple orthogonal polynomials of type I and type II. Finally, we show that zeros of multiple orthogonal polynomials of an Angelesco or an AT system interlace with the zeros of the polynomial corresponding to the one-step Christoffel transform. This allows us to prove a number of interlacing properties satisfied by the multiple orthogonality analogues of classical orthogonal polynomials. For the discrete polynomials, this also produces an estimate on the smallest distance between consecutive zeros.</description>

      <title>Determinantal Formulas for Rational Perturbations of Multiple Orthogonality Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we studied the Christoffel transforms of multiple orthogonal polynomials by means of adding a finitely supported measure to the multiple orthogonality system. This approach was able to handle the Christoffel transforms of the form $(\Phi\mu_1,\dots,\Phi\mu_r)$ for a polynomial $\Phi$, where $\Phi\mu_j$ is the linear functional defined by $$f(x)\mapsto \int f(x)\Phi(x)d\mu_j(x).$$ For these systems we derived determinantal formulas generalizing Christoffel's classical theorem. In the current paper, we generalize these formulas to consider the case of rational perturbations $$\Big(\frac{\Phi_1}{\Psi_{1}} \mu_1,\dots,\frac{\Phi_r}{\Psi_r}\mu_r\Big),$$ for any polynomials $\Phi_1,\dots,\Phi_r$ and $\Psi_1,\dots,\Psi_r$. This includes the general Christoffel transforms $(\Phi_1\mu_1,\dots,\Phi_r\mu_r)$ with $r$ arbitrary polynomials {$\Phi_1,\dots,\Phi_r$,} as well as the analogous Geronimus transforms. This generalizes a theorem of Uvarov to the multiple orthogonality setting. We allow zeros of the numerators and denominators to overlap which permits addition of pure point measure. The formulas are derived for multiple orthogonal polynomials of type I and type II for any multi-index.</description>

      <title>Maz'ya's $\Phi$-inequalities on domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find necessary and sufficient conditions on the function $\Phi$ for the inequality $$\Big|\int_\Omega \Phi(K*f)\Big|\lesssim \|f\|_{L_1(\mathbb{R}^d)}^p$$ to be true. Here $K$ is a positively homogeneous of order $\alpha - d$, possibly vector valued, kernel, $\Phi$ is a $p$-homogeneous function, and $p=d/(d-\alpha)$. The domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is either bounded with $C^{1,\beta}$ smooth boundary for some $\beta &gt; 0$ or a halfspace in $\mathbb{R}^d$. As a corollary, we describe the positively homogeneous of order $d/(d-1)$ functions $\Phi\colon \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ that are suitable for the bound $$\Big|\int_\Omega \Phi(\nabla u)\Big|\lesssim \int_\Omega |\Delta u|.$$</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to give the answer to the problem of characterization of acting conditions (necessary as well as sufficient) for composition operators in some sequence spaces. We also characterize their boundedness and local boundedness. We focus on composition operators acting to or from the space $bv_p(E)$ of all sequences of $p$-bounded variation; here $p\geq 1$ and $E$ is a normed space.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e-Perron problem for high order differential equations in the class of almost periodic type functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the Poincar\'e-Perron's classical problem of approximation for high order linear differential equations in the class of almost periodic type functions, extending the results for a second order linear differential equation in [23]. We obtain explicit formulae for solutions of these equations, for any fixed order $n\ge 3$, by studying a Riccati type equation associated with the logarithmic derivative of a solution. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions to ensure the existence of a fundamental system of solutions. The fixed point Banach argument allows us to find almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic solutions to this Riccati type equation. A decomposition property of the perturbations induces a decomposition on the Riccati type equation and its solutions. In particular, by using this decomposition we obtain asymptotically almost periodic and also $p$-almost periodic solutions to the Riccati type equation. We illustrate our results for a third order linear differential equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore several applications of the recently introduced spaces of functions of bounded $\beta$-dimensional mean oscillation for $\beta \in (0,n]$ to regularity theory of critical exponent elliptic equations. One interesting consequence of these considerations is the observation that for $F \in L^1$, $\operatorname*{div} F=0$, the solution of \begin{align*} -\operatorname*{div}( |\nabla U|^{n-2} \nabla U) &amp;= F \mbox{ in } \Omega,\newline
  U &amp;=0 \mbox{ on }\partial \Omega. \end{align*}
  satisfies
  \begin{align*} \|\nabla U \|_{L^n} \mathbb \leq C \, \|F\|^{1/(n-1)}_{L^1}, \end{align*} where the constant $C$ is independent of $F$.</description>

      <title>On the Generalization of Weinberger's Inequality with Alternating Signs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For given set of $m$ positive numbers satisfying the conditions: $$ a_1 \geq a_2 \geq , ... \geq a_m \geq 0, $$ the inequality $$ \sum_{s=1}^{m} (-1)^{s-1}a^r_s \geq \left[ \sum_{s=1}^{m} (-1)^{s-1}a_s\right]^r, \quad r &gt; 1, $$ was proved by H. Weinberger. The generalization of Weinberger's result takes the form $$ \sum_{s=1}^{m} (-1)^{s-1}f(a_s) \geq f\left( \sum_{s=1}^{m} (-1)^{s-1}a_s\right), $$ where $f$ is a convex function satisfying the condition $f(0)\leq 0 $. The condition $f(0)\geq 0 $ in the generalization proposed by Bellman was corrected by Olkin as $f(0) \leq 0 $. Bellman gave only a graphical proof for differentiable convex functions. In this paper, we give a mathematical proof for the generalized inequality including the importance of the condition $f(0)\leq 0$. We introduce a set $\mathcal{W}$ of functions so that functions in the intersection of $\mathcal{W}$ and the set of all convex functions are the ones that are desirable in the generalization. In addition, we give a proof of Szeg\"{o}'s inequality which applies to sums with odd number of terms.</description>

      <title>Sampling in the shift-invariant space generated by the bivariate Gaussian function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the space spanned by the integer shifts of a bivariate Gaussian function and the problem of reconstructing any function in that space from samples scattered across the plane. We identify a large class of lattices, or more generally semi-regular sampling patterns spread along parallel lines, that lead to stable reconstruction while having densities close to the critical value given by Landau's limit. At the critical density, we construct examples of sampling patterns for which reconstruction fails.
  In the same vein, we also investigate continuous sampling along non-uniformly scattered families of parallel lines and identify the threshold density of line configurations at which reconstruction is possible. In a remarkable contrast with Paley-Wiener spaces, the results are completely different for lines with rational or irrational slopes.
  Finally, we apply the sampling results to Gabor systems with bivariate Gaussian windows. As a main contribution, we provide a large list of new examples of Gabor frames with non-complex lattices having volume close to 1.</description>
