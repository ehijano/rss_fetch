      <title>Probabilistic approach to longitudinal response prediction: application to radiomics from brain cancer imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Longitudinal imaging analysis tracks disease progression and treatment response over time, providing dynamic insights into treatment efficacy and disease evolution. Radiomic features extracted from medical imaging can support the study of disease progression and facilitate longitudinal prediction of clinical outcomes. This study presents a probabilistic model for longitudinal response prediction, integrating baseline features with intermediate follow-ups. The probabilistic nature of the model naturally allows to handle the instrinsic uncertainty of the longitudinal prediction of disease progression. We evaluate the proposed model against state-of-the-art disease progression models in both a synthetic scenario and using a brain cancer dataset. Results demonstrate that the approach is competitive against existing methods while uniquely accounting for uncertainty and controlling the growth of problem dimensionality, eliminating the need for data from intermediate follow-ups.</description>

      <title>Chilean Avian flu and its marine impacts: an online Statistical Process Control task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid spread of the HPAI H5N1 virus, responsible for the Avian Flu, is causing a great catastrophe on the South American Pacific coast (especially in the south of Peru and north of Chile). Although very little attention has been delivered to this pandemic, it presents a tremendous lethal rate, though the number of infected humans is relatively low. Towards monitoring and statistical control, this work shows the Chilean national statistics from the year 2023, and presents the developed online tool for supporting the government's decision-making. Additionally, a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal model was used to model the joint analysis of the weekly registered animal including spatial covariates as well as specific and shared spatial effects that take into account the potential autocorrelation between the HPAI H5N1 virus per Region. Our findings allow us to identify the hot-spot areas with high amounts of dead bodies (mostly pinnipeds and penguins) and their evolution over time.</description>

      <title>GeoThinneR: An R Package for Efficient Spatial Thinning of Species Occurrences and Point Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present GeoThinneR, an R package for efficient and flexible spatial thinning of species occurrence data. Spatial thinning is a widely used preprocessing step in species distribution modeling (SDM) that can help reduce sampling bias, but existing R implementations rely on brute-force algorithms that scale poorly with large datasets. GeoThinneR implements multiple thinning approaches, including ensuring a minimum distance between points, subsampling points on a grid, and filtering based on decimal precision. To handle large datasets, it introduces two optimized algorithms based on local kd-trees and adaptive neighbor estimation, which greatly reduce memory usage and execution time. Additional functionalities such as group-wise thinning and point prioritization are included to facilitate its use in SDM workflows. We here provide performance benchmarks using both simulated and real-world data to demonstrate substantial performance improvements over existing tools.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Information Capacity of Canonical Signaling Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a unified framework for computing the information capacity of biological signaling systems using Fisher Information. By deriving closed-form or easily computable information capacity formulas, we quantify how well different signaling models, including binomial, multinomial, Poisson, Gaussian, and Gamma distributions, can discriminate among input signals. These expressions clarify how key features such as signal range, noise scaling, pathway length, and receivers' diversity shape the theoretical limits of sensing. In particular, we show how signal-to-noise ratio and fold-change sensitivity arise naturally within the Fisher formalism, and how signal degradation in cascades imposes linear information loss. Our results provide intuitive, analytically grounded tools to benchmark and guide the analysis of real signaling systems, without requiring computationally expensive mutual information estimation. While motivated by cellular communication, the framework generalizes to any system where noisy input-output relationships constrain transmission fidelity, including synthetic biology, sensor networks, and engineered communication channels.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Estimation of Causal Effects Using Proxies of a Latent Interference Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network interference occurs when treatments assigned to some units affect the outcomes of others. Traditional approaches often assume that the observed network correctly specifies the interference structure. However, in practice, researchers frequently only have access to proxy measurements of the interference network due to limitations in data collection or potential mismatches between measured networks and actual interference pathways. In this paper, we introduce a framework for estimating causal effects when only proxy networks are available. Our approach leverages a structural causal model that accommodates diverse proxy types, including noisy measurements, multiple data sources, and multilayer networks, and defines causal effects as interventions on population-level treatments. Since the true interference network is latent, estimation poses significant challenges. To overcome them, we develop a Bayesian inference framework. We propose a Block Gibbs sampler with Locally Informed Proposals to update the latent network, thereby efficiently exploring the high-dimensional posterior space composed of both discrete and continuous parameters. We illustrate the performance of our method through numerical experiments, demonstrating its accuracy in recovering causal effects even when only proxies of the interference network are available.</description>

      <title>Extreme Conformal Prediction: Reliable Intervals for High-Impact Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a popular method to construct prediction intervals for black-box machine learning models with marginal coverage guarantees. In applications with potentially high-impact events, such as flooding or financial crises, regulators often require very high confidence for such intervals. However, if the desired level of confidence is too large relative to the amount of data used for calibration, then classical conformal methods provide infinitely wide, thus, uninformative prediction intervals. In this paper, we propose a new method to overcome this limitation. We bridge extreme value statistics and conformal prediction to provide reliable and informative prediction intervals with high-confidence coverage, which can be constructed using any black-box extreme quantile regression method. The advantages of this extreme conformal prediction method are illustrated in a simulation study and in an application to flood risk forecasting.</description>

      <title>Continuous Temporal Learning of Probability Distributions via Neural ODEs with Applications in Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the continuous--time dynamics of probability distributions from time--dependent data samples is a fundamental problem in many fields, including digital health. The aim is to analyze how the distribution of a biomarker, such as glucose, evolves over time and how these changes may reflect the progression of chronic diseases such as diabetes. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model based on a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture how samples from a continuous-time stochastic process evolve over the time. To model potential distribution shifts over time, we introduce a time-dependent function parameterized by a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) and estimate it non--parametrically using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The proposed model is highly interpretable, detects subtle temporal shifts, and remains computationally efficient. Through simulation studies, we show that it performs competitively in terms of estimation accuracy against state-of-the-art, less interpretable methods such as normalized gradient--flows and non--parameteric kernel density estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method on digital clinical--trial data, showing how the interventions alters the time-dependent distribution of glucose levels and enabling a rigorous comparison of control and treatment groups from novel mathematical and clinical perspectives.</description>

      <title>Big Data and the Computational Social Science of Entrepreneurship and Innovation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large-scale social data explode and machine-learning methods evolve, scholars of entrepreneurship and innovation face new research opportunities but also unique challenges. This chapter discusses the difficulties of leveraging large-scale data to identify technological and commercial novelty, document new venture origins, and forecast competition between new technologies and commercial forms. It suggests how scholars can take advantage of new text, network, image, audio, and video data in two distinct ways that advance innovation and entrepreneurship research. First, machine-learning models, combined with large-scale data, enable the construction of precision measurements that function as system-level observatories of innovation and entrepreneurship across human societies. Second, new artificial intelligence models fueled by big data generate 'digital doubles' of technology and business, forming laboratories for virtual experimentation about innovation and entrepreneurship processes and policies. The chapter argues for the advancement of theory development and testing in entrepreneurship and innovation by coupling big data with big models.</description>

      <title>Identifying Spatiotemporal Patterns in Opioid Vulnerability: Investigating the Links Between Disability, Prescription Opioids and Opioid-Related Mortality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The opioid crisis remains one of the most daunting and complex public health problems in the United States. This study investigates the national epidemic by analyzing vulnerability profiles of three key factors: opioid-related mortality rates, opioid prescription dispensing rates, and disability rank ordered rates. This study utilizes county level data, spanning the years 2014 through 2020, on the rates of opioid-related mortality, opioid prescription dispensing, and disability. To successfully estimate and predict trends in these opioid-related factors, we augment the Kalman Filter with a novel spatial component. To define opioid vulnerability profiles, we create heat maps of our filter's predicted rates across the nation's counties and identify the hotspots. In this context, hotspots are defined on a year-by-year basis as counties with rates in the top 5 percent nationally. Our spatial Kalman filter demonstrates strong predictive performance. From 2014 to 2018, these predictions highlight consistent spatiotemporal patterns across all three factors, with Appalachia distinguished as the nation's most vulnerable region. Starting in 2019 however, the dispensing rate profiles undergo a dramatic and chaotic shift. The initial primary drivers of opioid abuse in the Appalachian region were likely prescription opioids; however, it now appears that abuse is sustained by illegal drugs. Additionally, we find that the disabled subpopulation may be more at risk of opioid-related mortality than the general population. Public health initiatives must extend beyond controlling prescription practices to address the transition to and impact of illicit drug use.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Framework for Multivariate Differential Analysis accounting for Missing Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current statistical methods in differential proteomics analysis generally leave aside several challenges, such as missing values, correlations between peptide intensities and uncertainty quantification. Moreover, they provide point estimates, such as the mean intensity for a given peptide or protein in a given condition. The decision of whether an analyte should be considered as differential is then based on comparing the p-value to a significance threshold, usually 5%. In the state-of-the-art limma approach, a hierarchical model is used to deduce the posterior distribution of the variance estimator for each analyte. The expectation of this distribution is then used as a moderated estimation of variance and is injected directly into the expression of the t-statistic. However, instead of merely relying on the moderated estimates, we could provide more powerful and intuitive results by leveraging a fully Bayesian approach and hence allow the quantification of uncertainty. The present work introduces this idea by taking advantage of standard results from Bayesian inference with conjugate priors in hierarchical models to derive a methodology tailored to handle multiple imputation contexts. Furthermore, we aim to tackle a more general problem of multivariate differential analysis, to account for possible inter-peptide correlations. By defining a hierarchical model with prior distributions on both mean and variance parameters, we achieve a global quantification of uncertainty for differential analysis. The inference is thus performed by computing the posterior distribution for the difference in mean peptide intensities between two experimental conditions. In contrast to more flexible models that can be achieved with hierarchical structures, our choice of conjugate priors maintains analytical expressions for direct sampling from posterior distributions without requiring expensive MCMC methods.</description>

      <title>Detecting Spatial Health Disparities Using Disease Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemiologists commonly use regional aggregates of health outcomes to map mortality or incidence rates and identify geographic disparities. However, to detect health disparities across regions, it is necessary to identify "difference boundaries" that separate neighboring regions with significantly different spatial effects. This can be particularly challenging when dealing with multiple outcomes for each unit and accounting for dependence among diseases and across areal units. In this study, we address the issue of multivariate difference boundary detection for correlated diseases by formulating the problem in terms of Bayesian pairwise multiple comparisons by extending it through the introduction of adjacency modeling and disease graph dependencies. Specifically, we seek the posterior probabilities of neighboring spatial effects being different. To accomplish this, we adopt a class of multivariate areally referenced Dirichlet process models that accommodate spatial and interdisease dependence by endowing the spatial random effects with a discrete probability law. Our method is evaluated through simulation studies and applied to detect difference boundaries for multiple cancers using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute.</description>

      <title>A Cooperative Statistical Approach for Abnormal Node Detection with Adversary Resistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distinguishing abnormal nodes from those with normal packet loss in clusters helps reduce the loss of clustered network resources. The detection performance of existing detection schemes is limited by the techniques to quantify node behaviors, and most schemes cannot avoid being misled by the falsified information. This paper presents a novel probabilistic abnormal node detection scheme CSD -- Cooperative Statistical Detection -- for accurate and efficient detection in the existence of falsified detection data in clustered networks. Specifically, employing the likelihood ratio test (LRT) based detection method to measure node forwarding behaviors, we propose a modified Z-score based falsification-resistant mechanism to filter out falsifications. We show that both the false alarm and missed detection probabilities can decrease exponentially if and only if the transmissions from the nodes falsifying the data are less than half of the total. Furthermore, the optimal threshold of the modified Z-score method is derived, which guarantees perfect detection of our CSD under any falsification strategy in the proposed detection model. Evaluation results validate the effectiveness, robustness, and superiority of our scheme compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

We show that the proposed method is more than 1000 times faster than the standard Ferguson-Klass algorithm without a significant loss of precision. This method can open an avenue for computationally efficient and scalable Bayesian nonparametric models which go beyond conjugacy assumptions, as demonstrated in the examples section.</description>

      <title>Data-driven stochastic 3D modeling of the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in battery cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A stochastic 3D modeling approach for the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in hierarchically structured cathodes of lithium-ion batteries is presented. The binder-conductive additive phase of these electrodes consists of carbon black, polyvinylidene difluoride binder and graphite particles. For its stochastic 3D modeling, a three-step procedure based on methods from stochastic geometry is used. First, the graphite particles are described by a Boolean model with ellipsoidal grains. Second, the mixture of carbon black and binder is modeled by an excursion set of a Gaussian random field in the complement of the graphite particles. Third, large pore regions within the mixture of carbon black and binder are described by a Boolean model with spherical grains. The model parameters are calibrated to 3D image data of cathodes in lithium-ion batteries acquired by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. Subsequently, model validation is performed by comparing model realizations with measured image data in terms of various morphological descriptors that are not used for model fitting. Finally, we use the stochastic 3D model for predictive simulations, where we generate virtual, yet realistic, image data of nanoporous binder-conductive additives with varying amounts of graphite particles. Based on these virtual nanostructures, we can investigate structure-property relationships. In particular, we quantitatively study the influence of graphite particles on effective transport properties in the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase, which have a crucial impact on electrochemical processes in the cathode and thus on the performance of battery cells.</description>

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in networks is an important step in modelling relationships and interactions between entities. We consider the challenge of bootstrapping an inhomogeneous random graph when only a single observation of the network is made and the underlying data generating function is unknown. We address this problem by considering embeddings of the observed and bootstrapped network that are statistically indistinguishable. We utilise an exchangeable network test that can empirically validate bootstrap samples generated by any method. Existing methods fail this test, so we propose a principled, distribution-free network bootstrap using k-nearest neighbour smoothing, that can pass this exchangeable network test in many synthetic and real-data scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of this work in combination with the popular data visualisation method t-SNE, where uncertainty estimates from bootstrapping are used to explain whether visible structures represent real statistically sound structures.</description>

      <title>Estimating treatment effects with competing intercurrent events in randomized controlled trials</title>

Abstract: The analysis of randomized controlled trials is often complicated by intercurrent events (ICEs) -- events that occur after treatment initiation and affect either the interpretation or existence of outcome measurements. Examples include treatment discontinuation or the use of additional medications. In two recent clinical trials for systemic lupus erythematosus with complications of ICEs, we classify the ICEs into two broad categories: treatment-related (e.g., treatment discontinuation due to adverse events or lack of efficacy) and treatment-unrelated (e.g., treatment discontinuation due to external factors such as pandemics or relocation). To define a clinically meaningful estimand, we adopt tailored strategies for each category of ICEs. For treatment-related ICEs, which are often informative about a patient's outcome, we use the composite variable strategy that assigns an outcome value indicative of treatment failure. For treatment-unrelated ICEs, we apply the hypothetical strategy, assuming their timing is conditionally independent of the outcome given treatment and baseline covariates, and hypothesizing a scenario in which such events do not occur. A central yet previously overlooked challenge is the presence of competing ICEs, where the first ICE censors all subsequent ones. Despite its ubiquity in practice, this issue has not been explicitly recognized or addressed in previous data analyses due to the lack of rigorous statistical methodology. In this paper, we propose a principled framework to formulate the estimand, establish its nonparametric identification and semiparametric estimation theory, and introduce weighting, outcome regression, and doubly robust estimators. We apply our methods to analyze the two systemic lupus erythematosus trials, demonstrating the robustness and practical utility of the proposed framework.</description>
