      <title>Comparing QCD+QED via full simulation versus the RM123 method: U-spin window contribution to $a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic corrections to hadronic vacuum polarization contribute significantly to the uncertainty of the Standard Model prediction of the muon anomaly, which poses conceptual and numerical challenges for ab initio lattice determinations. In this study, we compute the non-singlet contribution from intermediate Euclidean current separations in quantum chromo- and electrodynamics (QCD+QED) using C* boundary conditions in two ways: either non-perturbatively by sampling the joint probability distribution directly or by perturbatively expanding from an isospin-symmetric theory. This allows us to compare the predictions and their uncertainties at a fixed lattice spacing and volume, including fully the sea quarks effects in both cases. Treating carefully the uncertainty due to tuning to the same renormalized theory with $N_{\mathrm{f}} = 1 + 2 + 1$ quarks, albeit with unphysical masses, we find it advantageous to simulate the full QCD+QED distribution given a fixed number of samples. This study lays the ground-work for further applications of C* boundary conditions to study QCD+QED at the physical point, essential for the next generation of precision tests of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Chimera baryons and mesons on the lattice: a spectral density analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and test a spectral-density analysis method, based on the introduction of smeared energy kernels, to extract physical information from two-point correlation functions computed numerically in lattice field theory. We apply it to a $Sp(4)$ gauge theory and fermion matter fields transforming in distinct representations, with $N_{\rm f}=2$ Dirac fermions in the fundamental and $N_{\rm as}=3$ in the 2-index antisymmetric representation. The corresponding continuum theory provides the minimal candidate model for a composite Higgs boson with partial top compositeness. We consider a broad class of composite operators, that source flavored mesons and (chimera) baryons, for several finite choices of lattice bare parameters. For the chimera baryons, which include candidate top-quark partners, we provide the first measurements, obtained with dynamical fermions, of the ground state and the lowest excited state masses, in all channels of spin, isospin, and parity. We also measure matrix elements and overlap factors, that are important to realize viable models of partial top compositeness, by implementing an innovative way of extracting this information from the spectral densities. For the mesons, among which the pseudoscalars can be reinterpreted to provide an extension of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model of particle physics, our measurements of the renormalized matrix elements and decay constants are new results. We complement them with an update of existing measurements of the meson masses, obtained with higher statistics and improved analysis. The analysis software is made publicly available, and can be used in other lattice studies, including application to quantum chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <title>Stability of universal properties against perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of universal properties at continuous phase transitions against perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm used to simulate the system. We consider the three dimensional XY model as test bed, and both local (single site Metropolis) and global (single cluster) updates, introducing deterministic truncation-like perturbations and stochastic perturbations in the acceptance probabilities. In (almost) all the cases we find a remarkable stability of the universal properties, even against large perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, with critical exponents and scaling curves consistent with those of the standard XY model within statistical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Universal framework with exponential speedup for the quantum simulation of quantum field theories including QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum simulation framework universally applicable to a wide class of quantum systems, including quantum field theories such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, we generalize an efficient quantum simulation protocol developed for bosonic theories in [Halimeh et al., arXiv:2411.13161] which, when applied to Yang-Mills theory, demonstrated an exponential resource advantage with respect to the truncation level of the bosonic modes, to systems with both bosons and fermions using the Jordan-Wigner transform and also the Verstraete-Cirac transform. We apply this framework to QCD using the orbifold lattice formulation and achieve an exponential speedup compared to previous proposals. As a by-product, exponential speedup is achieved in the quantum simulation of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian, the latter being a special limit of the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian. In the case of Hamiltonian time evolution of a theory on an $L^d$ spatial lattice via Trotterization, one Trotter step can be realized using $\mathcal{O}(L^d)$ numbers of CNOT gates, Hadamard gates, phase gates, and one-qubit rotations. We show this analytically for any matter content and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge group with any $N$. Even when we use the Jordan-Wigner transform, we can utilize the cancellation of quantum gates to significantly simplify the quantum circuit. We also discuss a block encoding of the Hamiltonian as a linear combination of unitaries using the Verstraete-Cirac transform. Our protocols do not assume oracles, but rather present explicit constructions with rigorous resource estimations without a hidden cost, and are thus readily implementable on a quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Long-range Order in a Short-range Quasi-2D XY Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase of spins in the quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) XY model has emerged as a topic of significant interest across multiple physics subfields. Here, we propose a short-range (SR) Q2D XY model defined on a plane perpendicularly intersected by a group of parallel planes, with each plane consisting of nearest-neighbor-coupled XY spins. We perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations to establish the full phase diagram of the Q2D XY model, aided by finite-size scaling. A long-range (LR) ordered phase emerges in the Q2D model when the spins on the parallel planes develop a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical phase. In the LR ordered phase, ordering is anisotropic: LR correlations develop along the direction of the intersection lines, while critical correlations emerge perpendicular to them. Furthermore, the LR ordered phase exhibits Goldstone-mode physics. Our study hence reveals the existence of LR order in a Q2D XY model with finite SR couplings and opens up a new avenue to explore superfluid orders in low dimensions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quantum phase transition and thermal equilibrium in the lattice Thirring model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time evolution of the lattice Thirring model quenched out of equilibrium in both the critical and massive phases and study the appearance of dynamical quantum phase transitions, as nonanalyticities in the Loschmidt rate. Although the presence of a dynamical quantum phase transition in the model does not correspond to quenches across the critical line of the equilibrium phase diagram at zero temperature, we identify a threshold in the energy density of the initial state, necessary for a dynamical quantum phase transition to be present. Moreover, in the case of the gapped quench Hamiltonian, we unveil a connection of this threshold to a transition between different regions in the finite-temperature phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Estimating energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions using a transfer matrix formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for extracting energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions by computing the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix associated with the lattice QCD Hamiltonian. While mathematically and numerically equivalent to the recently introduced Lanczos procedure, our approach introduces a novel prescription for removing spurious eigenvalues using a kernel density estimator (KDE) and Gaussian-convoluted histogram method. This strategy yields a robust and stable estimate of the energy spectrum, outperforming the Cullum-Willoughby filtering technique in efficiency. In addition, we detail how this method can be applied to extract overlap factors from two-point correlation functions, as well as matrix elements from three-point functions with a current insertion. Furthermore, we extend the methodology to accommodate correlation matrices constructed from a variational basis of operators, with its Block formulation. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework by computing the two lowest energy levels for a broad range of hadrons, including several nuclei. Although the signal-to-noise ratio is not significantly improved, the extracted energy levels are found to be more reliable than those obtained with conventional techniques. Within a given statistical ensemble, the proposed method effectively captures both statistical uncertainties and systematic errors, including those arising from the choice of fitting window, making it a robust and practical tool for lattice QCD analysis.</description>

      <title>Testing the dark SU(N) Yang-Mills theory Confined Landscape: From the Lattice to Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.11614v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We pave the way for future gravitational-wave detection experiments, such as the Big Bang Observer and DECIGO, to constrain dark sectors made of SU(N) Yang-Mills confined theories. We go beyond the state-of-the-art by combining first principle lattice results and effective field theory approaches to infer essential information about the non-perturbative dark deconfinement phase transition driving the generation of gravitational-waves in the early universe, such as the order, duration and energy budget of the phase transition which are essential in establishing the strength of the resulting gravitational-wave signal.</description>
