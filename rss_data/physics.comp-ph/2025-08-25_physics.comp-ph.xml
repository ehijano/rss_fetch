      <title>Coupled Continuous-Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Solver for Compound Flood Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several recent tropical cyclones, e.g., Hurricane Harvey (2017), have lead to significant rainfall and resulting runoff. When the runoff interacts with storm surge, the resulting floods can be greatly amplified and lead to effects that cannot be correctly modeled by simple superposition of its distinctive sources. In an effort to develop accurate numerical simulations of runoff, surge, and compounding floods, we develop a locally conservative coupled DG-CG discretization of the shallow water equations and integrate it into the Advanced Circulation Model (ADCIRC). We also modify the continuity equation to include spatially and temporally variable rainfall into the model using parametric rainfall models. We demonstrate the capabilities of the scheme though a sequence of physically relevant numerical tests, including small scale test cases based on laboratory measurements and large scale experiments with Hurricane Harvey in the Gulf of Mexico. The results highlight the conservation properties and robustness of the developed method and show the potential of compound flood modeling using our approach.</description>

      <title>graph framework: A Domain Specific Compiler for Building Physics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern supercomputers are increasingly relying on Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) and other accelerators to achieve exa-scale performance at reasonable energy usage. The challenge of exploiting these accelerators is the incompatibility between different vendors. A scientific code written using CUDA will not operate on a AMD gpu. Frameworks that can abstract the physics from the accelerator kernel code are needed to exploit the current and future hardware. In the world of machine learning, several auto differentiation frameworks have been developed that have the promise of abstracting the math from the compute hardware. However in practice, these framework often lag in supporting non-CUDA platforms. Their reliance on python makes them challenging to embed within non python based applications. In this paper we present the development of a graph computation framework which compiles physics equations to optimized kernel code for the central processing unit (CPUs), Apple GPUs, and NVidia GPUs. The utility of this framework will be demonstrated for a Radio Frequency (RF) ray tracing problems in fusion energy.</description>

      <title>Training a Foundation Model for Materials on a Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models for materials modeling are advancing quickly, but their training remains expensive, often placing state-of-the-art methods out of reach for many research groups. We introduce Nequix, a compact E(3)-equivariant potential that pairs a simplified NequIP design with modern training practices, including equivariant root-mean-square layer normalization and the Muon optimizer, to retain accuracy while substantially reducing compute requirements. Built in JAX, Nequix has 700K parameters and was trained in 500 A100-GPU hours. On the Matbench-Discovery and MDR Phonon benchmarks, Nequix ranks third overall while requiring less than one quarter of the training cost of most other methods, and it delivers an order-of-magnitude faster inference speed than the current top-ranked model. We release model weights and fully reproducible codebase at https://github.com/atomicarchitects/nequix</description>

      <title>Application of a Pressured-Based OpenFOAM Solver for Rotating Detonation Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to develop a simulation framework for rotating detonation engines (RDEs) using multicomponentFluid solver in OpenFOAM v12 and to demonstrate reducing the computational costs by adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and dynamic load balancing (DLB). RDEs have been extensively studied for improvements in efficiency for power generation and aircraft propulsion systems. A well-established framework, showing both high accuracy and cost efficiency, is required to facilitate further research and development in RDEs. The multicomponentFluid solver is validated against two problems: one-dimensional planar detonation simulation and two-dimensional RDE simulation, in which the present study's results are compared to reference results of experiments and simulations, respectively. In the problems, the present simulation results agree well with the validation data both qualitatively (e.g., pressure distribution and temperature field) and quantitatively (e.g., detonation velocity, mass flux, and specific impulse and thrust). In the two-dimensional RDE simulation, we propose a detonation velocity correction method for fair comparison with Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) detonation velocity. Moreover, the two-dimensional RDE simulation is optimized using AMR and DLB. By adopting both, computational costs decrease by up to 11.2 times. The effect of each of them is examined as well, which highlights the importance of DLB.</description>

      <title>Advancing Quantum Transport Calculations: An Effective Medium Theory with Plane-Wave Basis and PAW Potentials in Eigenstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an effective medium theory based on density functional theory that is implemented in VASP using the PAW method with a plane wave basis set. The transmission coefficient is derived through three complementary approaches: the current density relation J=nqv, the field operator method, and the nonquilibrium Green's function formalism. We compare transmission coefficients calculated using EMT-PW with results from NEGF-DFT, based on the NanoDCAL package utilizing a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set, for both periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions. The minor discrepancies observed are attributed to differences in basis sets, pseudopotentials, and the treatment of lead regions. Notably, the EMT-PW framework avoids the common issue of overcompleteness encountered in non-equilibrium transport theories and allows for the decomposition of the total transmission coefficient into contributions from individual eigenstates. Furthermore, when combined with an effective gate model, EMT-PW is shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing current characteristics in nanodevices under applied gate voltages. By leveraging one-electron wavefunctions in eigenstates, this method provides a robust foundation for exploring the quantum statistics of electrons and current quantum correlations within the second quantization framework.</description>

      <title>Conditionally adaptive augmented Lagrangian method for physics-informed learning of forward and inverse problems using artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations (PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms, reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third, to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth, we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex, high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>A simulation-based training framework for machine-learning applications in ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has advanced significantly in its ability to probe more observables and simultaneously generate multi-dimensional datasets. These advances present new challenges in data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Machine learning (ML) models can drastically reduce the workload of experimentalists; however, the lack of training data for ML -- and in particular deep learning -- is a significant obstacle. In this work, we introduce an open-source synthetic ARPES spectra simulator - aurelia - for the purpose of generating the large datasets necessary to train ML models. As a demonstration, we train a convolutional neural network to evaluate ARPES spectra quality -- a critical task performed during the initial sample alignment phase of the experiment. We benchmark the simulation-trained model against actual experimental data and find that it can assess the spectra quality more accurately than human analysis, and swiftly identify the optimal measurement region with high precision. Thus, we establish that simulated ARPES spectra can be an effective proxy for experimental spectra in training ML models.</description>

      <title>QED cascade initiation via reflection of a multipetawatt laser pulse from a self-organized parabolic plasma mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-sustained or avalanche-type cascade is an intriguing prediction of strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED) that has yet to be observed in laboratories. It is accompanied by the conversion of electromagnetic energy into gamma photons and electron-positron ($e^-e^+$) pairs, whose number increases exponentially over time. We investigate a simple configuration to initiate a QED cascades: it is based on the superposition of an incident multipetawatt laser pulse and its reflection from a solid target. The incident laser pulse &lt;&lt;deforms&gt;&gt; the initially flat target surface, creating a parabolic mirror that focuses the reflected radiation. For the considered setup the threshold laser power is about $7\,\text{PW}$. With a $27\,\text{PW}$ laser pulse, positron production exhibits clear signatures of an avalanche-type cascade, including exponential growth and more than 15 positron generations with similar energy spectra. Therefore, observing an avalanche-type QED cascade does not require the use of multiple laser channels with precise spatio-temporal synchronization, as previously supposed.</description>

      <title>FIRE-GNN: Force-informed, Relaxed Equivariance Graph Neural Network for Rapid and Accurate Prediction of Surface Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work function and cleavage energy of a surface are critical properties that determine the viability of materials in electronic emission applications, semiconductor devices, and heterogeneous catalysis. While first principles calculations are accurate in predicting these properties, their computational expense combined with the vast search space of surfaces make a comprehensive screening approach with density functional theory (DFT) infeasible. Here, we introduce FIRE-GNN (Force-Informed, Relaxed Equivariance Graph Neural Network), which integrates surface-normal symmetry breaking and machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP)-derived force information, achieving a twofold reduction in mean absolute error (down to 0.065 eV) over the previous state-of-the-art for work function prediction. We additionally benchmark recent invariant and equivariant architectures, analyze the impact of symmetry breaking, and evaluate out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrating that FIRE-GNN consistently outperforms competing models for work function predictions. This model enables accurate and rapid predictions of the work function and cleavage energy across a vast chemical space and facilitates the discovery of materials with tuned surface properties</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of the time fractional nonlinear Fisher-KPP diffusion-reaction equation using the local domain boundary element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fisher-KPP partial differential equation has been employed in science to model various biological, chemical, and thermal phenomena. Time fractional extensions of Fisher's equation have also appeared in the literature, aiming to model systems with memory. The solution of the time fractional Fisher-KPP equation is challenging due to the interplay between the nonlinearity and the nonlocality imposed by the fractional derivatives. An accurate method that for the solution of time fractional diffusion problems is the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The conventional BEM has a high computational cost and memory requirements since it leads to dense coefficient matrices. For nonlinear transient problems, its efficiency is further reduced due to the appearance of volume integrals. In the present work an extension of the recently proposed Local Domain Boundary Element Method (LD-BEM) is presented for the solution of nonlinear time fractional Fisher-KPP problems. The implemented numerical method is used to examine various two-dimensional problems related to the Fisher-KPP equation using different definitions of the fractional derivative.</description>

      <title>Double excitations in molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double excitations in organic molecules have garnered significant interest as a result of their importance in singlet fission and photophysics. These excitations play a crucial role in understanding the photoexcitation processes in polyenes. To describe photoexcited states with both single and double excitation character, we use a first-principles many-body theory that combines the GW / Bethe-Salpeter equation and the configuration interaction (CI) methods. Specifically, we develop and employ two CI-based methods: screened configuration interaction singles and doubles (scrCISD) and screened configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (scrCIS(D)), applied to an effective many-body Hamiltonian that incorporates screening. We apply these methods to Thiel's set of molecules, which exhibit excited states predominantly characterized by single excitations with a partial double excitation character. Our results indicate that the scrCISD method systematically underestimates the excitation energies compared to the best theoretical estimates, while the scrCIS(D) method shows good agreement with these estimates. Furthermore, we used the scrCISD method to calculate the binding energies of the dominantly doubly excited correlated triplet pair states, $\mathrm{TT^1}$, in pentacene dimers, finding that the $\mathrm{TT^1}$ binding energies agree well with empirical calculations.</description>

      <title>M2C: An Open-Source Software for Multiphysics Simulation of Compressible Multi-Material Flows and Fluid-Structure Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M2C (Multiphysics Modeling and Computation) is an open-source software for simulating multi-material fluid flows and fluid-structure interactions under extreme conditions, such as high pressures, high temperatures, shock waves, and large interface deformations. It employs a finite volume method to solve the compressible Navier-Stokes equations and supports a wide range of thermodynamic equations of state. M2C incorporates models of laser radiation and absorption, phase transition, and ionization, coupled with continuum dynamics. Multi-material interfaces are evolved using a level set method, while fluid-structure interfaces are tracked using an embedded boundary method. Advective fluxes across interfaces are computed using FIVER (FInite Volume method based on Exact multi-material Riemann problems). For two-way fluid-structure interaction, M2C is coupled with the open-source structural dynamics solver Aero-S using a partitioned procedure. The M2C code is written in C++ and parallelized with MPI for high-performance computing. The source package includes a set of example problems for demonstration and user training. Accuracy is verified through benchmark cases such as Riemann problems, interface evolution, single-bubble dynamics, and ionization response. Several multiphysics applications are also presented, including laser-induced thermal cavitation, explosion and blast mitigation, and hypervelocity impact.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information as a witness of non-Markovianity and criticality in the spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing because of its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian serve as a genuine witness of bipartite entanglement and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point. In the paradigmatic spin-boson model, the non-monotonic features of the quantum Fisher information matrix signal changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Universal Multistate Kinetic Models for the In-Silico Discovery of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters exhibit complex photophysical behaviors that cannot be fully captured by the conventional three state model (S0, S1, T1). The lack of kinetic models that incorporate vibronic coupling effects and high lying excited states has long limited the systematic understanding and rational design of these materials. To address this, we developed KinLuv, an extended multistate kinetic model that not only includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2) but also accounts for the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling in the rate constant calculations. Applied to two representative TADF emitters, i.e., DOBNA and DiKTa, KinLuv successfully predicts photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and prompt/delayed fluorescence lifetimes in good agreement with reported experimental results. These findings highlight that incorporating HT vibronic coupling effects and higher lying excited states is essential for quantitatively modeling TADF mechanisms and guiding the design of high performance emitters.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Time Propagators for Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Simulations</title>

Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a novel approach to accelerate electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling real-time, on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials with varying experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Universal Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials: A Tutorial on Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21935</link>

Abstract: Universal machine-learned interatomic potentials (U-MLIPs) have demonstrated broad applicability across diverse atomistic systems but often require fine-tuning to achieve task-specific accuracy. While the number of available U-MLIPs and their fine-tuning applications is rapidly expanding, there remains a lack of systematic guidance on how to effectively fine-tune these models. This tutorial provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to fine-tuning U-MLIPs for computational materials modeling. Using the recently released MACE-MP-0 as a representative foundation model, we illustrate the full workflow of dataset preparation, hyperparameter selection, model training, and validation. Beyond methodological guidance, we conduct systematic case studies on solid-state electrolytes, stacking fault defects in metals, semiconductors, solid-liquid interfacial interactions in low-dimensional systems, and more complicated heterointerfaces. These examples demonstrate that fine-tuning substantially improves predictive accuracy while maintaining affordable computational cost, accelerates training convergence, enhances out-of-distribution generalization, and achieves superior data efficiency. Remarkably, fine-tuned foundation models can even capture aspects of long-range physics without explicit corrections. Together, these results highlight that fine-tuning not only provides a practical recipe for applying U-MLIPs, but also offers new insights into their physical fidelity and potential for advancing large-scale atomistic simulations. To support practical applications, we include code examples that enable researchers, particularly those new to the field, to efficiently incorporate fine-tuned U-MLIPs into their workflows.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion and Emergent Universality in Coupled Memory-Driven Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how simple local interactions give rise to emergent exploration patterns is a fundamental question in statistical physics. We introduce a minimal model of two coupled agents that avoid retracing their own paths while being attracted to the trails left by one another. This system is inspired by, but not limited to, pheromone-guided insect navigation. The coupling of self-avoidance and attraction generates rich emergent behavior, including distinct anomalous diffusion regimes, non-Gaussian position distributions, and compressed exponential encounter statistics. Most notably, we identify new universality classes for coupled random walks, characterized by unique scaling laws and distributional properties that, to our knowledge, have not been previously reported. These findings advance the theoretical understanding of coupled stochastic processes with memory and interaction feedback, providing a framework for exploring transport phenomena in a broad range of multi-agent systems beyond biological contexts.</description>
