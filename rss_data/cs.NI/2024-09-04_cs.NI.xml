      <title>Digital Twin-Empowered Routing Management for Reliable Multi-Hop Millimeter Wave V2X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology can replicate physical entities in cyberspace. A mobility DT digitalizes connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and their surrounding traffic environment, allowing to monitor the maneuvering and distribution of CAVs in real-time, which is crucial for managing vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity, especially when millimeter wave (mmWave) is adopted. MmWave V2X relies on dynamic multi-hop communications to ensure high reliability. Therefore, in this paper, the challenges of mmWave V2X are presented to motivate the utilization of DT, and then we introduce the system model for DT-based multi-hop routing management, incorporating two different routing algorithms: with and without future trajectory prediction. For proof of concept, we implement the proposed DT system using Unity-based AWSIM and evaluate the proposed algorithms via simulations. The results show that, compared to the conventional routing algorithm in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), the DT-based algorithms significantly improve the reliability of mmWave V2X, and such improvements can be seen in both fully connected and mixed traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards Battery-Free Wireless Sensing via Radio-Frequency Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse Wi-Fi-based wireless applications have been proposed, ranging from daily activity recognition to vital sign monitoring. Despite their remarkable sensing accuracy, the high energy consumption and the requirement for customized hardware modification hinder the wide deployment of the existing sensing solutions. In this paper, we propose REHSense, an energy-efficient wireless sensing solution based on Radio-Frequency (RF) energy harvesting. Instead of relying on a power-hungry Wi-Fi receiver, REHSense leverages an RF energy harvester as the sensor and utilizes the voltage signals harvested from the ambient Wi-Fi signals to enable simultaneous context sensing and energy harvesting. We design and implement REHSense using a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) RF energy harvester. Extensive evaluation of three fine-grained wireless sensing tasks (i.e., respiration monitoring, human activity, and hand gesture recognition) shows that REHSense can achieve comparable sensing accuracy with conventional Wi-Fi-based solutions while adapting to different sensing environments, reducing the power consumption by 98.7% and harvesting up to 4.5mW of power from RF energy.</description>

      <title>Prioritized Information Bottleneck Theoretic Framework with Distributed Online Learning for Edge Video Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception systems leverage multiple edge devices, such surveillance cameras or autonomous cars, to enhance sensing quality and eliminate blind spots. Despite their advantages, challenges such as limited channel capacity and data redundancy impede their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce the Prioritized Information Bottleneck (PIB) framework for edge video analytics. This framework prioritizes the shared data based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and camera coverage of the region of interest (RoI), reducing spatial-temporal data redundancy to transmit only essential information. This strategy avoids the need for video reconstruction at edge servers and maintains low latency. It leverages a deterministic information bottleneck method to extract compact, relevant features, balancing informativeness and communication costs. For high-dimensional data, we apply variational approximations for practical optimization. To reduce communication costs in fluctuating connections, we propose a gate mechanism based on distributed online learning (DOL) to filter out less informative messages and efficiently select edge servers. Moreover, we establish the asymptotic optimality of DOL by proving the sublinearity of their regrets. Compared to five coding methods for image and video compression, PIB improves mean object detection accuracy (MODA) while reducing 17.8% and reduces communication costs by 82.80% under poor channel conditions.</description>

      <title>User-centric Service Provision for Edge-assisted Mobile AR: A Digital Twin-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future 6G networks are envisioned to support mobile augmented reality (MAR) applications and provide customized immersive experiences for users via advanced service provision. In this paper, we investigate user-centric service provision for edge-assisted MAR to support the timely camera frame uploading of an MAR device by optimizing the spectrum resource reservation. To address the challenge of non-stationary data traffic due to uncertain user movement and the complex camera frame uploading mechanism, we develop a digital twin (DT)-based data-driven approach to user-centric service provision. Specifically, we first establish a hierarchical data model with well-defined data attributes to characterize the impact of the camera frame uploading mechanism on the user-specific data traffic. We then design an easy-to-use algorithm to adapt the data attributes used in traffic modeling to the non-stationary data traffic. We also derive a closed-form service provision solution tailored to data-driven traffic modeling with the consideration of potential modeling inaccuracies. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate that our DT-based approach for user-centric service provision outperforms conventional approaches in terms of adaptivity and robustness.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Wireless Networks for Integrated Sensing and Learning-Oriented Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless networks are envisioned to support both sensing and artificial intelligence (AI) services. However, conventional integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks may not be suitable due to the ignorance of diverse task-specific data utilities in different AI applications. In this letter, a full-duplex unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless network providing sensing and edge learning services is investigated. To maximize the learning performance while ensuring sensing quality, a convergence-guaranteed iterative algorithm is developed to jointly determine the uplink time allocation, as well as UAV trajectory and transmit power. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the baselines and demonstrate the critical tradeoff between sensing and learning performance.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) within non-terrestrial networks (NTN), and optimizing the dynamic functional split between Centralized Units (CU) and Distributed Units (DU) for enhanced energy efficiency in the network. We introduce a novel framework utilizing a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based reinforcement learning approach to dynamically find the optimal RAN functional split option and the best NTN-based RAN network out of the available NTN-platforms according to real-time conditions, traffic demands, and limited energy resources in NTN platforms. This approach supports capability of adapting to various NTN-based RANs across different platforms such as LEO satellites and high-altitude platform stations (HAPS), enabling adaptive network reconfiguration to ensure optimal service quality and energy utilization. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our method, offering significant improvements in energy efficiency and sustainability under diverse NTN scenarios.</description>

      <title>AirCompSim: A Discrete Event Simulator for Air Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air components, including UAVs, planes, balloons, and satellites have been widely utilized since the fixed capacity of ground infrastructure cannot meet the dynamic load of the users. However, since those air components should be coordinated in order to achieve the desired quality of service, several next-generation paradigms have been defined including air computing. Nevertheless, even though many studies and open research issues exist for air computing, there are limited test environments that cannot satisfy the performance evaluation requirements of the dynamic environment. Therefore, in this study, we introduce our discrete event simulator, AirCompSim, which fulfills an air computing environment considering dynamically changing requirements, loads, and capacities through its modular structure. To show its capabilities, a dynamic capacity enhancement scenario is used for investigating the effect of the number of users, UAVs, and requirements of different application types on the average task success rate, service time, and server utilization. The results demonstrate that AirCompSim can be used for experiments in air computing.</description>

      <title>Reliability-considered Multi-platoon's Groupcasting using the Resource Sharing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of 5G platoon communications, the Platoon Leader Vehicle (PLV) employs groupcasting to transmit control messages to Platoon Member Vehicles (PMVs). Due to the restricted transmission power for groupcasting, it may need to pick one PMV as the Platoon Relay Vehicle (PRV) to be responsible for re-groupcasting messages of PLVs. To optimize the usage of limited spectrum resources, resource sharing can adopted to enhance spectrum efficiency within the platoon. This study proposes a resource allocation method, which is called Resource Sharing for Platoon Groupcasting (RSPG), for platoon groupcasting based on transmission reliability. RSPG utilizes tripartite matching to assign a subchannel to either a PLV or PRV that shares the assigned subchannel with the corresponding individual entity (IE), which does not belong to any platoon. The simulation results show that the proposed method performs better in terms of the QoS satisfaction rate of IEs, the number of allocated subchannels for platoons, and spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Infiltrating the Sky: Data Delay and Overflow Attacks in Earth Observation Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Earth Observation (EO) satellites have changed the way we monitor Earth. Acting like moving cameras, EO satellites are formed in constellations with different missions and priorities, and capture vast data that needs to be transmitted to the ground for processing. However, EO satellites have very limited downlink communication capability, limited by transmission bandwidth, number and location of ground stations, and small transmission windows due to high velocity satellite movement. To optimize resource utilization, EO constellations are expected to share communication spectrum and ground stations for maximum communication efficiency.
  In this paper, we investigate a new attack surface exposed by resource competition in EO constellations, targeting the delay or drop of Earth monitoring data using legitimate EO services. Specifically, an attacker can inject high-priority requests to temporarily preempt low-priority data transmission windows. Furthermore, we show that by utilizing predictable satellite dynamics, an attacker can intelligently target critical data from low-priority satellites, either delaying its delivery or irreversibly dropping the data. We formulate two attacks, the data delay attack and the data overflow attack, design algorithms to assist attackers in devising attack strategies, and analyze their feasibility or optimality in typical scenarios. We then conduct trace-driven simulations using real-world satellite images and orbit data to evaluate the success probability of launching these attacks under realistic satellite communication settings. We also discuss possible defenses against these attacks.</description>

      <title>Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Intelligent Channel Access in Dense Wi-Fi Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IEEE 802.11 MAC layer utilizes the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism for channel contention and access. However, in densely deployed Wi-Fi scenarios, intense competition may lead to packet collisions among users. Although many studies have used machine learning methods to optimize channel contention and access mechanisms, most of them are based on AP-centric single-agent models or distributed models, which still suffer poor generalization and insensitivity to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an intelligent channel contention access mechanism that combines Federated Learning (FL) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithms. Additionally, an FL model training pruning strategy and weight aggregation algorithm are designed to enhance the effectiveness of training samples and reduce the average MAC delay. We evaluate and validate the proposed solution using NS3-AI framework. Simulation results show that in static scenarios, our proposed scheme reduces the average MAC delay by 25.24% compared to traditional FL algorithms. In dynamic scenarios, it outperforms Average Federated Reinforcement Learning (A-FRL) and distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms by 25.72% and 45.9%, respectively.</description>

      <title>DTRAN: A Special Use Case of RAN Optimization using Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G networks underscores the critical role of advanced computer-aided tools, such as network digital twins (DTs), in fostering autonomous networks and ubiquitous intelligence. Existing solutions in the DT domain primarily aim to model and automate specific tasks within the network lifecycle, which lack flexibility and adaptability for fully autonomous design and management. Unlike the existing DT approaches, we propose RAN optimization using the Digital Twin (DTRAN) framework that follows a holistic approach from core to edge networks. The proposed DTRAN framework enables real-time data management and communication with the physical network, which provides a more accurate and detailed digital replica than the existing approaches. We outline the main building blocks of the DTRAN and describe the details of our specific use case, which is RAN configuration optimization, to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework for a real-world scenario.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes in detail how erasure codes are implemented in the Swarm system. First, in Section 1, we introduce erasure codes, and show how to apply them to files in Swarm (Section 2). In Section 3, we introduce security levels of data availability and derive their respective parameterisations. In Section 4, we describe a construct that enables cross-neighbourhood redundancy for singleton chunks and which completes erasure coding. Finally, in 5, we propose a number of retrieval strategies applicable to erasure-coded files.</description>

      <title>Generating Packet-Level Header Traces Using GNN-powered GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel method combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating packet-level header traces. By incorporating word2vec embeddings, this work significantly mitigates the dimensionality curse often associated with traditional one-hot encoding, thereby enhancing the training effectiveness of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that word2vec encoding captures semantic relationships between field values more effectively than one-hot encoding, improving the accuracy and naturalness of the generated data. Additionally, the introduction of GNNs further boosts the discriminator's ability to distinguish between real and synthetic data, leading to more realistic and diverse generated samples. The findings not only provide a new theoretical approach for network traffic data generation but also offer practical insights into improving data synthesis quality through enhanced feature representation and model architecture. Future research could focus on optimizing the integration of GNNs and GANs, reducing computational costs, and validating the model's generalizability on larger datasets. Exploring other encoding methods and model structure improvements may also yield new possibilities for network data generation. This research advances the field of data synthesis, with potential applications in network security and traffic analysis.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization for On-Board Routing in High-Throughput Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Internet services has led to increasing demand, often exceeding available data rates and compromising the quality of service. While deploying more satellites offers a short-term fix, designing higher-performance satellites with enhanced transmission capabilities provides a more sustainable solution. Achieving the necessary high capacity requires interconnecting multiple modem banks within a satellite payload. However, there is a notable gap in research on internal packet routing within extremely high-throughput satellites. To address this, we propose a real-time optimal flow allocation and priority queue scheduling method using online convex optimization-based model predictive control. We model the problem as a multi-commodity flow instance and employ an online interior-point method to solve the routing and scheduling optimization iteratively. This approach minimizes packet loss and supports real-time rerouting with low computational overhead. Our method is tested in simulation on a next-generation extremely high-throughput satellite model, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to a reference batch optimization and to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Priority based inter-twin communication in vehicular digital twin networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement and boom of autonomous vehicles, vehicular digital twins (VDTs) have become an emerging research area. VDT can solve the issues related to autonomous vehicles and provide improved and enhanced services to users. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of using priorities in acquiring improved response time. However, since VDT is comprised of intra-twin and inter-twin communication, it leads to a reduced response time as traffic congestion grows, which causes issues in the form of accidents. It would be encouraging if priorities could be used in inter-twin communication of VDT for data sharing and processing tasks. Moreover, it would also be effective for managing the communication overhead on the digital twin layer of the cloud. This paper proposes a novel priority-based inter-twin communication in VDT to address this issue. We formulate the problem for priorities of digital twins and applications according to their categories. In addition, we describe the priority-based inter-twin communication in VDT in detail and algorithms for priority communication for intra-twin and inter-twin are designed, respectively. Finally, experiments on different priority tasks are conducted and compared with two existing algorithms, demonstrating our proposed algorithm's effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Low Layer Functional Split Management in 5G and Beyond: Architecture and Self-adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Access Network (RAN) disaggregation is emerging as a key trend in beyond 5G, as it offers new opportunities for more flexible deployments and intelligent network management. A relevant problem in disaggregated RAN is the functional split selection, which dynamically decides which baseband (BB) functions of a base station are kept close to the radio units and which ones are centralized. In this context, this paper firstly presents an architectural framework for supporting this concept relying on the O-RAN architecture. Then, the paper analyzes how the functional split can be optimized to adapt to the different load conditions while minimizing energy costs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Branch Attention Convolutional Neural Network for Online RIS Configuration with Discrete Responses: A Neuroevolution Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of jointly controlling the configuration of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) with unit elements of discrete responses and a codebook-based transmit precoder in RIS-empowered Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) communication systems. The adjustable elements of the RIS and the precoding vector need to be jointly modified in real time to account for rapid changes in the wireless channels, making the application of complicated discrete optimization algorithms impractical. We present a novel Multi-Branch Attention Convolutional Neural Network (MBACNN) architecture for this design objective which is optimized using NeuroEvolution (NE), leveraging its capability to effectively tackle the non-differentiable problem arising from the discrete phase states of the RIS elements. The channel matrices of all involved links are first passed to separate self-attention layers to obtain initial embeddings, which are then concatenated and passed to a convolutional network for spatial feature extraction, before being fed to a per-element multi-layered perceptron for the final RIS phase configuration calculation. Our MBACNN architecture is then extended to multi-RIS-empowered MISO communication systems, and a novel NE-based optimization approach for the online distributed configuration of multiple RISs is presented. The superiority of the proposed single-RIS approach over both learning-based and classical discrete optimization benchmarks is showcased via extensive numerical evaluations over both stochastic and geometrical channel models. It is also demonstrated that the proposed distributed multi-RIS approach outperforms both distributed controllers with feedforward neural networks and fully centralized ones.</description>

      <title>SGP-RI: A Real-Time-Trainable and Decentralized IoT Indoor Localization Model Based on Sparse Gaussian Process with Reduced-Dimensional Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) devices are deployed in the filed, there is an enormous amount of untapped potential in local computing on those IoT devices. Harnessing this potential for indoor localization, therefore, becomes an exciting research area. Conventionally, the training and deployment of indoor localization models are based on centralized servers with substantial computational resources. This centralized approach faces several challenges, including the database's inability to accommodate the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the indoor electromagnetic environment, the model retraining costs, and the susceptibility of centralized servers to security breaches. To mitigate these challenges we aim to amalgamate the offline and online phases of traditional indoor localization methods using a real-time-trainable and decentralized IoT indoor localization model based on Sparse Gaussian Process with Reduced-dimensional Inputs (SGP-RI), where the number and dimension of the input data are reduced through reference point and wireless access point filtering, respectively. The experimental results based on a multi-building and multi-floor static database as well as a single-building and single-floor dynamic database, demonstrate that the proposed SGP-RI model with less than half the training samples as inducing inputs can produce comparable localization performance to the standard Gaussian Process model with the whole training samples. The SGP-RI model enables the decentralization of indoor localization, facilitating its deployment to resource-constrained IoT devices, and thereby could provide enhanced security and privacy, reduced costs, and network dependency. Also, the model's capability of real-time training makes it possible to quickly adapt to the time-varying indoor electromagnetic environment.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Status Update in Wireless Networks with Successive Interference Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data collection in an IoT environment requires simple and effective communication solutions to address resource constraints, ensure network efficiency, while achieving scalability. Efficiency is evaluated based on the timeliness of collected data (Age of Information), the energy spent per delivered unit of data, and the effectiveness in utilizing spectrum resources. This paper addresses a random multiple access adaptive system, in which a large number of devices send sporadic messages in non-periodic pattern. In particular, our analysis highlights the potential of Successive Interference Cancellation and identifies an adaptive parameter setting to maximize its benefits as the level of contention on the shared channel varies. An analytical model is defined, easily scalable with the number of nodes and yielding all the relevant metrics. Evidence of the accuracy of the model is given by comparing predicted results against simulations. The model is utilized to assess the trade-off between Age of Information and energy consumption, revealing a sharp relationship between the two. The considered approach lends itself to many generalizations and applications to massive machine-type communications and IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Fast Prototyping of Distributed Stream Processing Applications with stream2gym</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stream processing applications have been widely adopted due to real-time data analytics demands, e.g., fraud detection, video analytics, IoT applications. Unfortunately, prototyping and testing these applications is still a cumbersome process for developers that usually requires an expensive testbed and deep multi-disciplinary expertise, including in areas such as networking, distributed systems, and data engineering. As a result, it takes a long time to deploy stream processing applications into production and yet users face several correctness and performance issues. In this paper, we present stream2gym, a tool for the fast prototyping of large-scale distributed stream processing applications. stream2gym builds on Mininet, a widely adopted network emulation platform, and provides a high-level interface to enable developers to easily test their applications under various operating conditions. We demonstrate the benefits of stream2gym by prototyping and testing several applications as well as reproducing key findings from prior research work in video analytics and network traffic monitoring. Moreover, we show stream2gym presents accurate results compared to a hardware testbed while consuming a small amount of resources (enough to be supported in a single commodity laptop even when emulating a dozen of processing nodes).</description>

      <title>Windowing Optimization for Fingerprint-Spectrum-Based Passive Sensing in Perceptive Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perceptive mobile networks (PMN) have been widely recognized as a pivotal pillar for the sixth generation (6G) mobile communication systems. However, the asynchronicity between transmitters and receivers results in velocity and range ambiguity, which seriously degrades the sensing performance. To mitigate the ambiguity, carrier frequency offset (CFO) and time offset (TO) synchronizations have been studied in the literature. However, their performance can be significantly affected by the specific choice of the window functions harnessed. Hence, we set out to find superior window functions capable of improving the performance of CFO and TO estimation algorithms. We firstly derive a near-optimal window, and the theoretical synchronization mean square error (MSE) when utilizing this window. However, since this window is not practically achievable, we then test a practical "window function" by utilizing the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which may lead to excellent synchronization performance.</description>

      <title>Clutter Suppression, Time-Frequency Synchronization, and Sensing Parameter Association in Asynchronous Perceptive Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant challenges remain for realizing precise positioning and velocity estimation in perceptive vehicular networks (PVN) enabled by the emerging integrated sensing and communication technology. First, complicated wireless propagation environment generates undesired clutter, which degrades the vehicular sensing performance and increases the computational complexity. Second, in practical PVN, multiple types of parameters individually estimated are not well associated with specific vehicles, which may cause error propagation in multiple-vehicle positioning. Third, radio transceivers in a PVN are naturally asynchronous, which causes strong range and velocity ambiguity. To overcome these challenges, 1) we introduce a moving target indication based joint clutter suppression and sensing algorithm, and analyze its clutter-suppression performance and the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the paired range-velocity estimation upon using the proposed clutter suppression algorithm; 2) we design algorithms for associating individual direction-of-arrival estimates with the paired range-velocity estimates based on "domain transformation"; 3) we propose the first viable carrier frequency offset (CFO) and time offset (TO) estimation algorithm that supports passive vehicular sensing in non-line-of-sight environments. This algorithm treats the delay-Doppler spectrum of the signals reflected by static objects as an environment-specific "fingerprint spectrum", which is shown to exhibit a circular shift property upon changing the CFO and/or TO. Then, the CFO and TO are efficiently estimated by acquiring the number of circular shifts, and we also analyse the mean squared error performance of the proposed time-frequency synchronization algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of our algorithms under diverse configurations, while corroborating the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Two-Timescale Synchronization and Migration for Digital Twin Networks: A Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) have emerged as a promising enabler for representing the real-time states of physical worlds and realizing self-sustaining systems. In practice, DTs of physical devices, such as mobile users (MUs), are commonly deployed in multi-access edge computing (MEC) networks for the sake of reducing latency. To ensure the accuracy and fidelity of DTs, it is essential for MUs to regularly synchronize their status with their DTs. However, MU mobility introduces significant challenges to DT synchronization. Firstly, MU mobility triggers DT migration which could cause synchronization failures. Secondly, MUs require frequent synchronization with their DTs to ensure DT fidelity. Nonetheless, DT migration among MEC servers, caused by MU mobility, may occur infrequently. Accordingly, we propose a two-timescale DT synchronization and migration framework with reliability consideration by establishing a non-convex stochastic problem to minimize the long-term average energy consumption of MUs. We use Lyapunov theory to convert the reliability constraints and reformulate the new problem as a partially observable Markov decision-making process (POMDP). Furthermore, we develop a heterogeneous agent proximal policy optimization with Beta distribution (Beta-HAPPO) method to solve it. Numerical results show that our proposed Beta-HAPPO method achieves significant improvements in energy savings when compared with other benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: Open Radio Access Networks (ORAN) is a new architectural approach, having been proposed only a few years ago, and it is an expansion of the current Next Generation Radio Access Networks (NG-RAN) of 5G. ORAN aims to break this closed RAN market that is controlled by a handful of vendors, by implementing open interfaces between the different Radio Access Networks (RAN) components, and by introducing modern technologies to the RAN like machine learning, virtualization, and disaggregation. However, the architectural design of ORAN was recently causing concerns and debates about its security, which is considered one of its major drawbacks. Several theoretical risk analyses related to ORAN have been conducted, but to the best of our knowledge, not even a single practical one has been performed yet. In this poster, we discuss and propose a way for a minimal, future-proof deployment of an ORAN 5G network, able to accommodate various hands-on security analyses for its different elements.</description>

Abstract: Quantum communication is the most secure technique of transmitting data available today. Fiber communication lines and satellite-to-ground links have served as the basis for the most successful quantum networks that have been developed so far. Using a UAV, satellite or both for free-space quantum communication reduces the need for permanent ground connections and takes advantage of the lower loss limit in space, which makes it more efficient. This work surveys the recent development in Quantum Satellites and Quantum UAVs-based networks. Here, the importance of the latest technologies, including quantum artificial intelligence, blockchain quantum machine learning, quantum satellites and quantum UAVs, are explored from network perspectives. Further, this work discussed the role of satellite-based images and artificial intelligence.</description>

Abstract: In Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, matching the radar targets with communication user equipments (UEs) is functional to several communication tasks, such as proactive handover and beam prediction. In this paper, we consider a radar-assisted communication system where a base station (BS) is equipped with a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar that has a double aim: (i) associate vehicular radar targets to vehicular equipments (VEs) in the communication beamspace and (ii) predict the beamforming vector for each VE from radar data. The proposed target-to-user (T2U) association consists of two stages. First, vehicular radar targets are detected from range-angle images, and, for each, a beamforming vector is estimated. Then, the inferred per-target beamforming vectors are matched with the ones utilized at the BS for communication to perform target-to-user (T2U) association. Joint multi-target detection and beam inference is obtained by modifying the you only look once (YOLO) model, which is trained over simulated range-angle radar images. Simulation results over different urban vehicular mobility scenarios show that the proposed T2U method provides a probability of correct association that increases with the size of the BS antenna array, highlighting the respective increase of the separability of the VEs in the beamspace. Moreover, we show that the modified YOLO architecture can effectively perform both beam prediction and radar target detection, with similar performance in mean average precision on the latter over different antenna array sizes.</description>

      <title>On the Application of Reliability Theory to Cellular Network Mobility Performance Analysis</title>

Abstract: Achieving connectivity reliability is one of the significant challenges for 5G and beyond 5G cellular networks. The present understanding of reliability in the context of mobile communication does not adequately cover the stochastic temporal aspects of the network, such as the duration and spread of packet errors that an outage session may cause. Rather, it simply confines the definition to the percentage of successful packet delivery. In this letter, we offer an elaborate modeling of the outage for a cellular mobile network by showcasing the different types of outages and their contiguity characteristic. Thereafter, using the outage metrics, we define two new key performance indicators (KPIs), namely mean outage time and mean time between outages as counterparts to akin KPIs that already exist in classical reliability theory, i.e., mean down time and mean time between failures. Using a system-level simulation where user mobility is a crucial component, it is shown that these newly defined KPIs can be used to quantify the reliability requirements of different user applications in cellular services.</description>

      <title>Optimizing RPL Routing Using Tabu Search to Improve Link Stability and Energy Consumption in IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Internet of Things (IoT) networks, the Routing Protocol forLow-power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a widely adopted standard due toits efficiency in managing resource-constrained and energy-limited nodes.However, persistent challenges such as high energy consumption, unstablelinks, and suboptimal routing continue to hinder network performance,affecting both the longevity of the network and the reliability of datatransmission. This paper proposes an enhanced RPL routing mechanismby integrating the Tabu Search optimization algorithm to address theseissues. The proposed approach focuses on optimizing the parent and childselection process in the RPL protocol, leveraging a composite cost func-tion that incorporates key parameters including Residual Energy, Trans-mission Energy, Distance to Sink, Hop Count, Expected TransmissionCount (ETX), and Link Stability Rate. Through extensive simulations,we demonstrate that our method significantly improves link stability, re-duces energy consumption, and enhances the packet delivery ratio, leadingto a more efficient and longer-lasting IoT network.

Abstract: Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) functioning as autonomous agents are anticipated to play a crucial role in the 6th Generation of wireless networks. Their seamless integration, cost-effectiveness, and the additional controllability through motion planning make them an attractive deployment option for a wide range of applications, both as assets in the network (e.g., mobile base stations) and as consumers of network services (e.g., autonomous delivery systems). However, despite their potential, the convergence of UVs and wireless systems brings forth numerous challenges that require attention from both academia and industry. This paper then aims to offer a comprehensive overview encompassing the transformative possibilities as well as the significant challenges associated with UV-assisted next-generation wireless communications. Considering the diverse landscape of possible application scenarios, problem formulations, and mathematical tools related to UV-assisted wireless systems, the underlying core theme of this paper is the unification of the problem space, providing a structured framework to understand the use cases, problem formulations, and necessary mathematical tools. Overall, the paper sets forth a clear understanding of how unmanned vehicles can be integrated in the 6G ecosystem, paving the way towards harnessing the full potential at this intersection.</description>

      <title>DIDChain: Advancing Supply Chain Data Management with Decentralized Identifiers and Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supply chain data management faces challenges in traceability, transparency, and trust. These issues stem from data silos and communication barriers. This research introduces DIDChain, a framework leveraging blockchain technology, Decentralized Identifiers, and the InterPlanetary File System. DIDChain improves supply chain data management. To address privacy concerns, DIDChain employs a hybrid blockchain architecture that combines public blockchain transparency with the control of private systems. Our hybrid approach preserves the authenticity and reliability of supply chain events. It also respects the data privacy requirements of the participants in the supply chain. Central to DIDChain is the cheqd infrastructure. The cheqd infrastructure enables digital tracing of asset events, such as an asset moving from the milk-producing dairy farm to the cheese manufacturer. In this research, assets are raw materials and products. The cheqd infrastructure ensures the traceability and reliability of assets in the management of supply chain data. Our contribution to blockchain-enabled supply chain systems demonstrates the robustness of DIDChain. Integrating blockchain technology through DIDChain offers a solution to data silos and communication barriers. With DIDChain, we propose a framework to transform the supply chain infrastructure across industries.</description>

      <title>Lifecycle Management of Resum\'es with Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trust in applications is crucial for fast and efficient hiring processes. Applicants must present verifiable credentials that employers can trust without delays or the risk of fraudulent information. This paper introduces a trust framework for managing digital resum\'e credentials, addressing trust challenges by leveraging Decentralized Applications, Decentralized Identifiers, and Verifiable Credentials. We propose a framework for real-time issuance, storage, and verification of Verifiable Credentials without intermediaries. We showcase the integration of the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure as a trust anchor. Furthermore, we demonstrate a streamlined application process, reducing verification times and fostering a reliable credentialing ecosystem across various sectors, including recruitment and professional certification.</description>

      <title>Online-Score-Aided Federated Learning: Taming the Resource Constraints in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While FL is a widely popular distributed ML strategy that protects data privacy, time-varying wireless network parameters and heterogeneous system configurations of the wireless device pose significant challenges. Although the limited radio and computational resources of the network and the clients, respectively, are widely acknowledged, two critical yet often ignored aspects are (a) wireless devices can only dedicate a small chunk of their limited storage for the FL task and (b) new training samples may arrive in an online manner in many practical wireless applications. Therefore, we propose a new FL algorithm called OSAFL, specifically designed to learn tasks relevant to wireless applications under these practical considerations. Since it has long been proven that under extreme resource constraints, clients may perform an arbitrary number of local training steps, which may lead to client drift under statistically heterogeneous data distributions, we leverage normalized gradient similarities and exploit weighting clients' updates based on optimized scores that facilitate the convergence rate of the proposed OSAFL algorithm. Our extensive simulation results on two different tasks -- each with three different datasets -- with four popular ML models validate the effectiveness of OSAFL compared to six existing state-of-the-art FL baselines.</description>

      <title>Palantir: Towards Efficient Super Resolution for Ultra-high-definition Live Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural enhancement through super-resolution (SR) deep neural networks (DNNs) opens up new possibilities for ultra-high-definition (UHD) live streaming over existing encoding and networking infrastructure. Yet, the heavy SR DNN inference overhead leads to severe deployment challenges. To reduce the overhead, existing systems propose to apply DNN-based SR only on carefully selected anchor frames while upscaling non-anchor frames via the lightweight reusing-based SR approach. However, frame-level scheduling is coarse-grained and fails to deliver optimal efficiency. In this work, we propose Palantir, the first neural-enhanced UHD live streaming system with fine-grained patch-level scheduling. Two novel techniques are incorporated into Palantir to select the most beneficial anchor patches and support latency-sensitive UHD live streaming applications. Firstly, under the guidance of our pioneering and theoretical analysis, Palantir constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for lightweight yet accurate SR quality estimation under any possible anchor patch set. Secondly, to further optimize the scheduling latency, Palantir improves parallelizability by refactoring the computation subprocedure of the estimation process into a sparse matrix-matrix multiplication operation.
  The evaluation results suggest that Palantir incurs a negligible scheduling latency accounting for less than 5.7% of the end-to-end latency requirement. When compared to the naive method of applying DNN-based SR on all the frames, Palantir can reduce the SR DNN inference overhead by 20 times (or 60 times) while preserving 54.0-82.6% (or 32.8-64.0%) of the quality gain. When compared to the state-of-the-art real-time frame-level scheduling strategy, Palantir can reduce the SR DNN inference overhead by 80.1% at most (and 38.4% on average) without sacrificing the video quality.</description>
