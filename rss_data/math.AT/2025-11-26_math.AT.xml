      <title>Change Action Derivatives in Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a popular technique in topological data analysis that tracks the lifespans of homological features in a nested sequence of spaces. This data is typically presented in a multi-set called a persistence diagram or a barcode. For single parameter filtrations with homology coefficient taken in a principal ideal domain, the persistence diagram/barcode can be computed using the presentation theorem for finitely generated modules over a PID. One way to reconstruct the persistence diagram/barcode is to consider the rank of the pair group at all intervals, as defined by Edelsbrunner and Harer, which counts the number of homology classes whose lifespans are precisely said intervals respectively.
  In this paper we generalize the rank of the pair group for suitably `tame' filtrations, described as functors from a partially ordered set to a category of chain complexes, and show how it can be captured by a categorical version of the calculus of finite-differences for abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Index invariants and Eta invariants determine Differential KO theory in degrees that are multiples of 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sullivan--Simons developed a Cheeger--Simons differential character analogue for degree (0 mod 2) differential K-theory, giving a complete set of numerical invariants that determine a complex vector bundle with unitary connection on a base manifold X, up to Chern--Simons equivalence of the connection. In this paper we develop a degree (0 mod 8) differential KO-analogue. Namely, given a real vector bundle with orthogonal connection, we construct R/Z -valued eta-invariants in the context of Atiyah--Patodi--Singer and Z2 Atiyah--Singer index invariants that completely determine differential KO-theory in degree (0 mod 8); we call this the differential KO-character. In the second part, for a Riemannian submersion X to B with closed 8k-dimensional spin fibers, we develop two family index theorems in differential KO -theory: one in the differential KO -character model and one in the structured-bundle model. The fact that these two pushforwards agree follows from the Bismut--Cheeger adiabatic limit theorem, providing a new interpretation of that result.</description>

      <title>A note on ideals in derived geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the basic theory of derived quasi-coherent ideals for stacks relative to a given derived algebraic context. We compare different notions of adic completeness with respect to derived ideals, define and compare formal spectra and formal completions along closed immersions, and connect the theory of derived ideals to that of derived extended Rees algebras. A first application is the construction of derived scheme-theoretic images in full generality. We further show that the deformation space of any nonconnectively affine morphism of derived stacks is nonconnectively affine over the base. We close with a first exploration of transmutation cohomology and filtrations thereof in this more general context.</description>

      <title>Algebras over not too little discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18192v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By the introduction of locally constant prefactorization algebras at a fixed scale, we show a mathematical incarnation of the fact that observables at a given scale of a topological field theory propagate to every scale over euclidean spaces. The key is that these prefactorization algebras over $\mathbb{R}^n$ are equivalent to algebras over the little $n$-disc operad. For topological field theories with defects, we get analogous results by replacing $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the spaces modelling corners $\mathbb{R}^p\times\mathbb{R}^{q}_{\geq 0}$. As a toy example in $1d$, we quantize, once more, constant Poisson structures.</description>

      <title>A chain-level model for Chas-Sullivan products in Morse homology with differential graded coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the framework of Morse theory with differential graded coefficients to study certain operations on the total space of a fibration. More particularly, we focus in this paper on a chain-level description of the Chas-Sullivan product on the homology of the free loop space of an oriented, closed and connected manifold. The idea of ''intersecting on the base'' and ''concatenating on the fiber'' are well-adapted to this framework. We also give a Morse theoretical description of other products that follow the same principle. For this purpose, we develop functorial properties with respect to the coefficient in terms of morphisms of A $\infty$ -modules and morphisms of fibrations. We also build a differential graded version of the K{\"u}nneth formula and of the Pontryagin-Thom construction.</description>

      <title>A Computational (Co)homological Approach to Contiguity Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two new algebraic invariants, the (co)homological distances between continuous maps, which provide computable lower bounds for the homotopic distance and strictly refine the classical cup-length estimates. We then define the simplicial cohomological distance between simplicial maps and prove a convergence theorem showing that, after sufficiently many barycentric subdivisions, it recovers the cohomological distance between the corresponding continuous maps. Several explicit computations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>TopER: Topological Embeddings in Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph embeddings play a critical role in graph representation learning, allowing machine learning models to explore and interpret graph-structured data. However, existing methods often rely on opaque, high-dimensional embeddings, limiting interpretability and practical visualization.
  In this work, we introduce Topological Evolution Rate (TopER), a novel, low-dimensional embedding approach grounded in topological data analysis. TopER simplifies a key topological approach, Persistent Homology, by calculating the evolution rate of graph substructures, resulting in intuitive and interpretable visualizations of graph data. This approach not only enhances the exploration of graph datasets but also delivers competitive performance in graph clustering and classification tasks. Our TopER-based models achieve or surpass state-of-the-art results across molecular, biological, and social network datasets in tasks such as classification, clustering, and visualization.</description>

      <title>Four-manifolds, two-complexes and the quadratic bias invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kreck and Schafer produced the first examples of stably diffeomorphic closed smooth 4-manifolds which are not homotopy equivalent. They were constructed by applying the doubling construction to 2-complexes over certain finite abelian groups of odd order. By extending their methods, we formulate a new homotopy invariant on the class of 4-manifolds arising as doubles of 2-complexes with finite fundamental group. As an application we show that, for any $k \ge 2$, there exist a family of $k$ closed smooth 4-manifolds which are all stably diffeomorphic but are pairwise not homotopy equivalent.</description>
