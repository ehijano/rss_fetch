      <title>Benchmark for Non-reciprocal Attack Detection on Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise and secure time synchronization is the backbone of both fundamental physics and advanced technologies. Despite ultra-high precision, security, particularly the unresolved vulnerabilities on physical links beyond traditional cryptography, remains the bottleneck. Here, we develop an analysis framework, the Benchmark Attack Noise Detection (BAND) model, to quantify the security of the high-precision time synchronization when its core assumption, reciprocity, is broken. The model characterizes non-reciprocal attacks through a unified metric, termed attack intensity. Based on the analysis of attack intensity, we accurately predict both instantaneous and accumulating attacks in a 100-km dual-comb two-way time-transfer system. Beyond security considerations, we find that the BAND model can explain intrinsic fiber noise and delay-unsuppressed noise naturally, offering an effective tool to establish an environment-sensitive link model. This work paves the way for a secure large-scale integrated time, sensing and communication networks.</description>

      <title>A Thermal Modeling Toolkit for Continuous-Wave Gaussian Second-Harmonic Generation in KTP Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We release an open-source finite-difference toolkit for computing temperature fields in continuous-wave (CW) second-harmonic generation (SHG) using potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) crystals under Gaussian end-pumping. The toolkit includes modules for geometry and material definitions, boundary and cooling models, and transient and steady-state finite-difference solvers. Users provide beam and crystal parameters along with cooling profiles, and the solver returns spatiotemporal temperature fields with radial and axial profiles as exportable datasets. This implementation consolidates previous work into a single versioned repository with reproducible pipelines and parameterized scenario sweeps covering temperature-dependent versus constant conductivity, convection with or without radiation, and heat-transfer coefficients from $6.5$ to $2.0 \times 10^{4}$~W~m$^{-2}$~K$^{-1}$. The compiled Fortran kernels include built-in benchmark reporting. Validation is performed by reproducing published temperature distributions and trends for KTP under Gaussian CW pumping. The code is available as an open-source GitHub repository and is released under the MIT license as version v1.0.0, with an archived release on Zenodo identified by DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17266421 for citation and long-term access.</description>

      <title>Suspended waveguide-enhanced near-infrared photothermal spectroscopy for ppb-level molecular gas sensing on a chalcogenide chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip waveguide sensors have attracted significant attention recently due to their potential for high level integration. However, so far on-chip gas sensing based on traditional laser absorption spectroscopy has demonstrated low detection sensitivity, due to weak light-gas interaction over a limited interaction distance. On-chip photothermal spectroscopy (PTS) appears to be a powerful technique to achieve higher sensitivity, its performance is yet constrained to parts-per-million (ppm)-level due to small fraction of evanescent field in the light-gas interaction zone and fast thermal dissipation through the solid substrate. Herein, we demonstrated suspended chalcogenide glass waveguide (ChGW)-enhanced PTS that overcomes these limitations, enabling highly sensitive parts-per-billion (ppb)-level molecular gas sensing. We fabricated a nanoscale suspended ChGW with low loss of 2.6 dB/cm using CMOS-compatible two-step patterning process. By establishing an equivalent PTS model to guide the optimization of the ChGW geometry, we achieved a 4-fold increase in the absorption-induced heat source power and a 10.6-fold decrease in the equivalent heat conductivity, resulting in a 45-fold enhancement in photothermal phase modulation efficiency over the non-suspended waveguides. Combining with a high-contrast waveguide facet-formed Fabry-Perot interferometer, we achieved an unprecedented acetylene detection limit of 330 ppb, a large dynamic range close to 6 orders of magnitude, and a fast response of less than 1 s. The overall system exhibits a noise-equivalent absorption coefficient of 3.8x10-7 cm-1, setting a new benchmark for photonic waveguide gas sensors to the best of our knowledge. This work provides a key advancement towards prototyping an integrated sensor-on-a-chip for highly sensitive and background-free photonic sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Cavity Ring-down Spectroscopy with behavior of Hybrid Cavity Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity ring-down (CRD) spectroscopy represents a direct absorption technique of sample absorption measurement. Instead of measuring the amount of the absorbed light, this technique determines the rate at which light intensity decays inside an optical cavity. When using a pulsed or continuous-wave light source, CRD spectroscopy offers considerably higher sensitivity as compared with conventional spectroscopy of absorption, making even very weak absorptions easy to detect.</description>

      <title>Absorption and scattering of light by metal-dielectric nanoeggs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical and plasmonic properties of metal-dielectric nanoeggs were investigated in this study. Frequency dependencies of polarizability, absorption and scattering cross-sections, and radiation efficiency were determined. Expressions describing the size-dependent behavior of surface plasmon resonance frequencies were derived. The causes of blue and red shifts in the maxima of polarizability, absorption, and scattering cross-sections as well as variations in their number and amplitude were identified. Recommendations were proposed regarding the use of materials with maximum radiation efficiency in different spectral ranges.</description>

      <title>JPEG-Inspired Cloud-Edge Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) presents a transformative solution for near-eye displays in augmented and virtual reality. Recent advances in deep learning have greatly improved CGH in reconstructed quality and computational efficiency. However, deploying neural CGH pipelines directly on compact, eyeglass-style devices is hindered by stringent constraints on computation and energy consumption, while cloud offloading followed by transmission with natural image codecs often distorts phase information and requires high bandwidth to maintain reconstruction quality. Neural compression methods can reduce bandwidth but impose heavy neural decoders at the edge, increasing inference latency and hardware demand. In this work, we introduce JPEG-Inspired Cloud-Edge Holography, an efficient pipeline designed around a learnable transform codec that retains the block-structured and hardware-friendly nature of JPEG. Our system shifts all heavy neural processing to the cloud, while the edge device performs only lightweight decoding without any neural inference. To further improve throughput, we implement custom CUDA kernels for entropy coding on both cloud and edge. This design achieves a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 32.15 dB at $&lt;$ 2 bits per pixel with decode latency as low as 4.2 ms. Both numerical simulations and optical experiments confirm the high reconstruction quality of the holograms. By aligning CGH with a codec that preserves JPEG's structural efficiency while extending it with learnable components, our framework enables low-latency, bandwidth-efficient hologram streaming on resource-constrained wearable devices-using only simple block-based decoding readily supported by modern system-on-chips, without requiring neural decoders or specialized hardware.</description>

      <title>Hybrid electrostatic-piezo MEMS photonic integrated modulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have recently emerged as an important technology for quantum information science and artificial neural networks. In particular, PICs with MEMS-based modulators have the advantages of voltage-based control, ultra-low-energy consumption, cryogenic compatibility, and CMOS-foundry support. Here we report a cantilever optical modulator that utilizes hybrid piezoelectric and electrostatic tuning forces together on a monolithic silicon nitride (SiN) PIC platform. The device achieves actuation of visible-wavelength light with quasi-static tuning up to 10 kHz at 1.5 V{\pi}-cm as well as high-speed (&gt;20 MHz) AC modulation with dynamically adjustable (25 - 40 MHz) mechanical resonances. We report the physics of how geometric nonlinearities such as capacitive pull-in give rise to suspended and contacted cantilever modes. These reversible operating regimes generate different strain profiles and boundary conditions which are responsible for the active tuning of the mechanical resonances. Our proof-of-concept electrostatic-piezo modulator shows promising potential in large-scale programmable PICs applied to high-speed optical switching and optomechanical sensing.</description>

      <title>Poisson wavefront imaging in photon-starved scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-photon phase imaging is essential in applications where the signal is limited by short exposure times, faint targets, or the need to protect delicate samples. We address this challenge with Poisson Wavefront Imaging (PWI), an optimization-based method that incorporates Poisson photon statistics and a smoothness prior to improve wavefront reconstruction. By using multiple spatial light modulator's phase patterns, PWI enhances Fisher information, boosting theoretical accuracy and regularizing the retrieval process effectively. In simulations, PWI approaches the theoretical phase error limit, and in experiments it reduces phase error by up to 1.6x compared to the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, achieving 1.8x higher resolution wavefront imaging in low photon regime. This method advances photon-limited imaging with applications in astronomy, semiconductor metrology, and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Photoelectron chiral dichroism induced by lasers without helicity via chiral hole wave-packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) is a method where randomly oriented chiral molecules are photoionized due to irradiation by circularly-polarized lasers, yielding large chiral signals in the photoelectron momentum distribution. Recently, PECD was explored with polarization-tailored light such as bi-chromatic and non-collinear drivers, which still produces significant chiral signals. Yet, all known PECD configurations to date exhibit non-zero time-local chirality. That is, they are driven by an intrinsically helical light source. Nonetheless, 'chiral' light can also be non-helical if its chirality manifests on longer timescales (e.g. an optical centrifuge). It remains unknown whether PECD can arise from non-helical coherent light. Here we predict that PECD indeed emerges from non-helical light by employing a train of linearly-polarized intense laser pulses with a rotating polarization axis, which are phase-coherent and time-delayed. We find strong PECD in the model chiral molecule CBrClFH under a wide parameter regime that can be optimized up to ~8% by tuning delays between pulses, suggesting quantum interference. We directly show that the physical mechanism for this type of PECD differs from the standard case, relying on a chiral hole attosecond wave-packet evolving in the molecule, induced by the first linear pulse. Our work shows that multiple mechanisms can give rise to PECD on longer timescales and provides a novel approach for ultrafast chirality spectroscopy and coherent chiral wave-packet manipulation.</description>

      <title>Rethinking massive multiplexing in whispering gallery mode biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, label-free quantification of multiple analytes in complex biological media remains a major challenge due to limited multiplexing, signal cross-correlations, and inconsistency across sensor samples and measurement runs. We introduce a multiplexed whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) biosensing framework that overcomes these barriers by jointly advancing photonic integration and data analytics. Our glass-chip platform enables massive, parallelized and flexible multiplexing of &gt;10000 microresonators organized into up to 100 sensing channels, with universal and modular chip design and detection hardware, while maintaining loaded Q-factors of 10^6. Our novel hybrid deep-learning framework BioCCF that integrates domain adaptation with cross-channel fusion enables harmonization of responses across sensing chips and extraction of nonlinear correlations in complex mixtures. Using a highly heterogeneous dataset comprising over 200 hours of sensing data acquired from nine chips with different channel configurations, biological replicates, and repeated regeneration cycles, we demonstrate recalibration-free identification of solution (99.3\% accuracy) and quantification of immunoglobulin G components with relative prediction error of 10^-4 under 5 min. The affordability and modularity of the platform enable distributed data acquisition and aggregation into shared repositories, providing a pathway toward continuously improving model generalization, cross-validation and a scalable, community-driven paradigm for biosensing.</description>

      <title>Long-Wave Infrared Spintronic Poisson Bolometers with High Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-sensitivity long-wave infrared (LWIR) detection is crucial for observing weak thermal radiation. Recently, the spintronic Poisson bolometer was proposed as a promising platform for uncooled infrared detection. The Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, establishing a new detection paradigm. In contrast to traditional analog detectors, where signal and noise are continuous currents or voltages, the Poisson bolometer has both signal and noise governed by Poissonian counting statistics regardless of the light source, with the mean count rate modulated by incident radiation. In this work, we integrate a broadband plasmonic absorber optimized for LWIR absorption onto a spintronic Poisson bolometer to enhance thermal coupling and temperature rise in the sensing layer. The plasmonic absorber achieves over 60\% absorptance across the LWIR spectrum, matching the blackbody radiation peak at room temperature. The device exhibits a best noise-equivalent temperature difference (NEDT) of 35 mK at a 50 Hz frame rate and multiple results close to or below 100 mK, demonstrating room-temperature performance among the most sensitive uncooled LWIR detectors reported to date. This work advances uncooled infrared detection toward cryogenic-level sensitivity through the innovation of integrating spintronic materials and plasmonic materials, opening pathways to high-sensitivity LWIR sensing and imaging applications such as remote sensing, high-speed imaging, cryogenic system diagnostics, and industrial monitoring.</description>

      <title>Design of Microlens Arrays for Thermal Imaging with Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) detectors are widely used for their ability to sense thermal radiation. Recently, a room-temperature infrared detector known as the spintronic Poisson bolometer was introduced. Operating in a probabilistic regime governed by Poissonian counting statistics, it establishes a fundamentally different detection mechanism with the potential to relax conventional sensitivity limits. While offering fast digital readout, its sensitivity is currently limited by a small active area and array fill factor. In this work, we present design guidelines for spherical plano-convex microlens arrays that enhance light collection in spintronic Poisson bolometer arrays. Using FDTD simulations of aluminum oxide microlenses, we analyze focal properties, collection efficiency, and concentration factor in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR). A radiometric-stochastic model is used to quantify the resulting sensitivity improvements.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Analysis for Nonlinear Optical Microscopic Chemical Imaging of Nitrogen Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have implemented principal component analysis for microscopic wide-field chemical imaging via coherent Raman spectroscopy. Microscopic imaging of nitrogen gas has been challenging due to extremely weak signals stemming from low order Raman interaction. Wide-field coherent Raman micro-spectroscopy has demonstrated the ability to chemically distinguish nitrogen gas although it has been difficult to quantify spatial-density information due to significant levels of background noise. By subtracting the Gaussian beam shape and removing contributions from uninformative noise simultaneously from the set of images, we can reconstruct the normalized intensity fluctuations. Our analysis demonstrates that nitrogen gas within microvolume can be rapidly monitored under ambient conditions in less than 0.2 seconds. We believe that our work has the potential to improve visualization of microscopic flows due to molecular dynamics of gases and/or liquids otherwise invisible to infrared optical techniques.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Plane--Convex Microcavity for Room-Temperature Polaritons with Geometric \(g\)-Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a plane--convex open microcavity that supports room-temperature polariton spectroscopy and offers a simple geometric handle on the coupling rate. The effective length ($L_{\mathrm{eff}}$) is absolutely calibrated from the free-spectral range, and piezo tuning is performed at near-normal incidence ($k_{\parallel}!\approx!0$) to avoid angle-induced degradation. Using spin-coated PEA$2$PbI$4$ quasi-2D perovskites, we observe clear anti-crossings in reflection, with vacuum Rabi splittings up to $71~\mathrm{meV}$ (reflection) and $87~\mathrm{meV}$ (PL) near $L{\mathrm{eff}}!\approx!3~\mu\mathrm{m}$. A linewidth-corrected analysis converts the apparent splitting into the coherent exciton--photon coupling rate $g$, revealing a robust geometric scaling $g \propto L{\mathrm{eff}}^{-1/2}$ across multiple longitudinal orders and spatial sites, consistent with the filled-mode thin-film limit where the transverse area cancels in the mode volume. The platform establishes a compact, broadly compatible testbed for room-temperature polaritons and provides a practical design rule: shortening $L_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is a reliable geometric lever to strengthen collective coupling in plane--convex microcavities.</description>

      <title>Soliton-Assisted Massive Signal Broadcasting via Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chip-scale all-optical signal broadcasting enables data replication from an optical signal to a large number of wavelength channels, playing a critical role in enabling massive-throughput optical communication and computing systems. The underlying process is four-wave mixing between an optical signal and a multi-wavelength pump source via optical Kerr nonlinearity. To enhance the generally weak nonlinearity, high-quality (Q) microcavities are commonly used to achieve practical efficiency. However, the ultra-narrow linewidths of high Q cavities prohibit achieving massive throughput broadcasting due to Fourier reciprocity. Here, we overcome this challenge by harnessing a parity-time symmetric coupled-cavity system that supports equally spaced exceptional points in the frequency domain. This design seamlessly integrates generation of dissipative Kerr soliton comb source and all-optical signal broadcasting into a unified nonlinear process. As a result, we realize soliton-assisted intracavity massive signal broadcasting with a channel count exceeding 100 over 200 nm wavelength range, resulting in Terabit-per-second aggregated rates. This throughput surpasses the intrinsic microcavity linewidth constraint (~200 MHz) by over three orders of magnitude. We further demonstrate the utility of this approach through an optical convolutional accelerator, highlighting its potential to enable transformative capabilities in photonic computing. Our work establishes a new paradigm for chip-scale photonic processing devices based on non-Hermitian optical design.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning-enabled inverse design of large-scale metasurfaces with full-wave accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in meta-optics have enabled diverse functionalities in compact optical devices; however, conventional forward design approaches become inadequate as device complexity and scale grow. Inverse design offers a powerful alternative but often requires massive computational resources and neglects mutual coupling effects. Here, we propose and experimentally validate a deep-learning-enabled framework for rapid inverse design of large-scale, aperiodic metasurfaces with full-wave accuracy.The framework integrates an inverse design network responsible that maps target near-field responses to metasurface geometries in a non-iterative and scalable manner. A lightweight forward prediction network, integrated as a full-wave solver surrogate within the framework, enables efficient end-to-end training of the inverse design network while capturing mutual coupling effects by considering both local and neighboring geometries.The framework's effectiveness is experimentally verified through a multi-foci metalens and a holographic metasurface. This framework enables the inverse design from micrometer to centimeter scales (&gt; 20k{\lambda}), with near-field responses discrepancies less than 3% compared to full-wave solvers at subwavelength (&lt; {\lambda}/10) resolution.Moreover, it is generalizable to metasurfaces of arbitrary size and operates efficiently without high-performance resources, overcoming the computational bottlenecks of previous inverse design methods.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional spectral singularity lasing in a defective atomic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient scheme for achieving mode-tunable unidirectional reflection lasing (URL) by establishing a coherent gain atomic system to amplify the probe field and ingeniously designing the one-dimensional (1D) defective atomic lattice. This lattice not only replaces the resonant cavity to provide a distributed feedback mechanism but also breaks the spatial symmetry of the probe susceptibility. Correspondingly, the URL can be characterized by a non-Hermitian degenerate spectral singularity (NHDSS), where the two eigenvalues of the inverse scattering matrix are engineered to satisfy $\lambda _{{S^{-1}}}^{+}\simeq \lambda _{{S^{-1}}}^{-}\rightarrow 0$. This intriguing NHDSS depends on the probe susceptibility and the Bragg condition, both of which can be modulated by adjusting the external optical field and lattice structure, rendering the scheme experimentally feasible. Our approach achieves both nonreciprocity and lasing oscillation in a single system, significantly enhancing the efficiency of optical information transmission and facilitating the integration of active photonic devices into compact quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Intracavity-birefringence-enabled soliton states and wavelength control in the (C + L)-band fiber lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compact all-fiber nonlinear-polarization-evolution (NPE) fiber laser capable of outputting wavelength-manipulated multiple laser states in the C + L band. Leveraging the intracavity birefringence-induced filtering effect, without external spectral filters, the laser achieves wavelength-tunable conventional solitons (CSs) and soliton molecules (SMs) with a tuning range of 72.85 nm and 45.54 nm, respectively, by adjusting the polarization states and pump power. Furthermore, wavelength-switchable harmonic mode-locking (over 1 GHz) and dual-wavelength mode-locking can also be achieved in the C + L band. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental realization of wavelength-manipulated multiple soliton states covering the C + L band in a single-fiber-laser oscillator. Two examples of digital multi-letter encoding and transmission are further demonstrated on this platform by means of pump-driven wavelength/soliton states switching. By enabling controllable multi-state solitons and broad spectral tunability within a compact architecture, our work provides a promising source for spectrally diverse and temporally stable pulsed light sources that hold significant promise for applications in microscopy, bioimaging, and LiDAR.</description>

      <title>Meta-GPT: Decoding the Metasurface Genome with Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing artificial intelligence for physical sciences requires representations that are both interpretable and compatible with the underlying laws of nature. We introduce METASTRINGS, a symbolic language for photonics that expresses nanostructures as textual sequences encoding materials, geometries, and lattice configurations. Analogous to molecular textual representations in chemistry, METASTRINGS provides a framework connecting human interpretability with computational design by capturing the structural hierarchy of photonic metasurfaces. Building on this representation, we develop Meta-GPT, a foundation transformer model trained on METASTRINGS and finetuned with physics-informed supervised, reinforcement, and chain-of-thought learning. Across various design tasks, the model achieves &lt;3% mean-squared spectral error and maintains &gt;98% syntactic validity, generating diverse metasurface prototypes whose experimentally measured optical responses match their target spectra. These results demonstrate that Meta-GPT can learn the compositional rules of light-matter interactions through METASTRINGS, laying a rigorous foundation for AI-driven photonics and representing an important step toward a metasurface genome project.</description>

      <title>High-visibility ghost imaging by holographic projection with classical light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By adopting computational holography, we realized the super-bunching effect achieving the peak-to-background ratio 39.77 proposed in the article [arXiv:2510.20421v1]. In this paper, various reference signals from computational holography and corresponding bucket detection signals are used in the intensity correlation algorithm of ghost imaging (GI) scheme. In the experiment, we use two types of target patterns, intensity squared chaotic speckle and artificially designed sparse matrix, performing GI by holographic projection. Those imaging results show that the visibility of ghost image can be significantly improved whether the reference signal is the reconstruction pattern or the target pattern of computational holography. Furthermore, we realize positive and negative copies of ghost image by the aid of computational holography in which symmetrical target patterns are artificially designed. Thus, our study by means of computational holography not only presents a step toward meeting the visibility requirement for practical applications but also broadens the category of intensity correlation algorithm of classical light GI scheme.</description>

      <title>Theory of Remaining Exceptional Points from Nongeneric Splitting in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-Hermitian physics, high-order exceptional points(HOEPs) with eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce are known for their enhanced sensitivity to perturbations. Typically, they exhibit eigenvalue splitting that scales as {\epsilon}^(1/n), which is referred to as the generic response. However, under certain conditions, a nongeneric response of HOEPs occurs where the splitting follows a lower order {\epsilon}^(1/m) (m&lt;n). A nongeneric response of HOEPs with a lower order splitting lead to the remaining EPs. While the presence of these remaining EPs is acknowledged, a thorough elucidation of their fundamental properties has yet to be achieved. In this work, we demonstrate those unsplit eigenvalue points must constitute remaining EPs in a perturbed n-orders HOEPs system. Combining graph theory and topological analysis, the number and splitting order of the remaining EPs is studied. This framework not only resolves a fundamental challenge in HOEPs but also paves the way for exploiting remaining EPs in applications such as anisotropic sensing and the design of Dirac exceptional points.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Detection of Rotational Doppler Shift from Sunlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotational Doppler effect, for which the frequency shift is proportional to the light's orbital angular momentum $\ell$ and the object's rotational speed ($\Delta f \propto\ell \Omega$), has proven to be a powerful tool for detecting the speed of rotational objects. However, the current detection technique is mainly based on coherent laser sources. There is scarce mention of using partially coherent light sources, let alone sunlight. In this work, we collect sunlight and direct it into the laboratory, where it is modulated into a partially coherent probing source and then realize rotational Doppler shift detection. Our study reveals that in low-light conditions, where background noise is stronger than the signal, the superposition of rotational Doppler signals at different wavelengths can significantly enhance the signal strength and improve the signal-to-noise ratio, enabling accurate measurement of the rotational speed of objects. Our research provides experimental validation for the application of sunlight in rotational Doppler shift detection, demonstrating its potential value for passive remote sensing.</description>

      <title>Microparticle laser fragmentation in liquids: mechanisms, energetics, and efficiency quantified with single-pulse, single-particle precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microparticle laser fragmentation in liquids has emerged as a promising approach to generate nanoparticles with high efficiency. Despite its advantages, the underlying fragmentation mechanisms, their connection to the nanoparticle size distribution, and the energy efficiency of the process remain poorly understood. In this study for the first time, microparticle fragmentation is investigated in single-pulse, single-particle experiments on Au microparticles. Determining the absorbed peak fluence enables assessment of the process energetics. Pump-probe microscopy identifies photomechanical fracture of the molten microparticle volume and photothermal phase explosion of its superheated surface as the fragmentation mechanisms. We find that 83% of the absorbed laser energy is converted into cavitation bubble formation, while only 1% contributes to the surface energy of the generated nanoparticles. Despite this small fraction, MP-LFL outperforms laser ablation in liquids. The surface energy generated per absorbed energy is 10 times higher, and the overall energy efficiency is 14 times higher. This gain originates from the confined microparticle geometry, which minimizes energy losses and enhances photomechanical fragmentation via pressure focusing. These results position microparticle fragmentation in liquids as a fundamentally more energy-efficient approach for scalable, laser-based nanoparticle production than laser ablation in liquids.</description>

      <title>Metasurface lasers programmed by optical pump patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurface lasers offer unprecedented control over light emission, yet their spatial and modal characteristics are typically fixed post-fabrication. Here, we introduce a reconfigurable plasmonic metasurface laser platform in which the lasing area geometry, and thus the emission properties, are dynamically programmed via spatially structured optical pumping. Using hexagonal arrays of silver nanoparticles embedded in dye-doped waveguides, we demonstrate lasing at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, including the K and M points. K-point lasing exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in relative intensity between degenerate K and K' modes, with no bias induced by pump geometry, even for geometries that explicitly break symmetry. In contrast, M-point lasing allows deterministic control over emission channels via asymmetric pumping. We further show that spatially separated K-point lasers synchronize in phase and amplitude, undergoing SSB in lockstep. A theoretical density matrix approach cast into stochastic differential equations reproduces the observed real- and Fourier-space intensity distributions and SSB behavior. Our findings establish spatially programmable metasurface lasers as a versatile platform for exploring dynamic phenomena in photonic lattices, with potential applications in vortex beam shaping, optical logic, and true random number generation.</description>

      <title>Third Harmonic Generation in Transparent Longitudinal Epsilon-Near-Zero Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epsilon near zero (ENZ) materials can dramatically enhance local optical fields, enabling nonlinear interactions at relatively low intensities. Yet, near their plasma frequency, conventional isotropic ENZ media remain highly absorptive, limiting nonlinear operations that require good transparency. Longitudinal epsilon near zero metamaterials (LENZ), characterized by a vanishing permittivity along the optical axis provide an exceptional platform for field enhancement while mitigating absorption losses and impedance mismatch. We experimentally show that a Si and ITO multilayer engineered for a LENZ resonance in the near-infrared enables broadband, high pump transmission while still harnessing ENZ enhanced nonlinearity to generate a strong third harmonic signal. This demonstrates that efficient nonlinear processes can be driven without the high-loss conditions typical of isotropic ENZ media and regardless of intrinsic absorption at the harmonic frequency. The resulting third harmonic efficiency is comparable to isotropic ENZ films but without the absorption-induced heating constraints of ENZ operation. The high pump transmission enables transparent LENZ (TLENZ) stacks to be integrated into optical cavities, where resonant field buildup could amplify the nonlinear response without compromising thermal management. These results establish TLENZ multilayers as a robust, versatile platform for transparent, field enhanced nonlinear nanophotonics, combining strong light matter interaction with low-loss operation.</description>

      <title>From Diffraction to Refraction: a coherence-based conceptual framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refraction, traditionally viewed as a geometric event occurring at material interfaces, is now being re-examined through the lens of coherence. Recent studies in optics and photonics, including coherence tomography, Moire interference, and coherence-engineered diffraction, indicate that phase organization alone can bend light even without index discontinuities. Fraunhofer-based analyses further show that angular deflection can arise from intrinsic phase curvature within homogeneous media. Here we introduce a coherence-based constitutive framework that systematizes these observations: refraction can occur inside a bulk medium when coherence itself provides the effective boundary.
  Two near-frequency structured beams write and probe a shared phase field, revealing reproducible angular rotation and coherence-lensing whose direction and magnitude follow the spectral detuning. The key detuning coefficient is:
  Krc = 2 * pi * (1/lambda_r - 1/lambda_w).
  The compact coherence-refraction relation
  n2 * sin(theta_t) - n1 * sin(theta_i) = Krc_parallel / k0, with k0 = 2 * pi / lambda_r,
  retains the form of Snell's law while extending it to coherence-driven regimes. This is not a new law but a quantitative rule linking tangential phase matching to observable deflection within homogeneous media.</description>

      <title>A precision apparatus for high harmonic spectroscopy in bulk solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) in solids has emerged as a powerful spectroscopic method for resolving ultrafast electron dynamics and band structure properties across a wide range of materials. However, quantitative HHG studies require instrumentation capable of delivering stable driving fields, precise crystal alignment, and broadband detection spanning the UV to the extreme ultraviolet (EUV). Here we present an integrated apparatus engineered specifically for high-accuracy, field-strength and orientation-dependent HHG measurements in bulk solids. The system incorporates dispersion-neutral intensity-control for few-cycle pulses, a vacuum HHG module with sub-micrometer and sub-degree sample positioning, and an imaging assembly that stabilizes the focal spot position and enables spatial filtering of the emitted harmonics. A synchronized dual-spectrometer scheme provides simultaneous UV/VUV and EUV radiation detection, while absolute electric field calibration is achieved through gas-phase attosecond streaking. Together, these capabilities establish a versatile and quantitatively reliable platform for solid-state HHG spectroscopy. The methodology is broadly adaptable to various laser sources and material classes, and supports future efforts aimed at reconstructing valence-electron potentials, tracking strong-field dynamics, and mapping electronic structure with sub-cycle temporal resolution.</description>

      <title>Emergent learning: neuromorphic photonic computing with accelerated training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent learning transforms a disordered optical medium into a photonic device capable of storage, recognition, and classification of arbitrary memory patterns. First, we show that the intensity at the output of a multiply scattering system can be described by a dyadic matrix, the optical-synaptic matrix, exhibiting the same form as a Hebbian synaptic matrix containing a single memory. Then, we employ emergent learning - an approach inspired by neuroscience - to exploit the vast dictionary of raw memories inherently available within a disordered optical structure, thereby engineering the optical-synaptic matrix to store a user-defined attractor, or tailored memory. Importantly these photonic structures also works as an optical comparators providing an intensity-based measure of the degree of similitude between a query pattern and the stored pattern, realizing an hardware co-localization between memory and optical operator. Our system has an almost infinite hardware capacity of tailored memories/ operators ($\mathcal{M} \sim 10^{60557}$), thus these tailored memories can be then employed as examples to build a classifier hardware based on intensity comparison without the need of additional digital transformation layers. Remarkably, this Photonic Emergent Learning platform is not only flexible and fabrication-free, but also relies primarily on analog processes, thus shifting the computational burden of training from the digital layers to the optical domain reducing the computational cost and enhancing performance.</description>

We characterize the optical loss and group delay of single-mode and multi-mode silicon waveguides across the telecom O-, S-, C-, and L-bands. For spiral devices with 2.0-{\mu}m-wide waveguides, we measure propagation losses of 0.11 and 0.06 dB/cm at 1310 and 1550 nm, representing 10- and 20-times improvements, respectively, compared to the singlemode waveguides. Additionally, we observe a group delay of 1163 ps for a 9.5 cm-long waveguide with a compact device footprint of (0.30 {\times} 3.00) mm2, yielding a delay loss of 0.5 dB/ns. These results are highly promising for large-scale silicon photonic integration, delay lines, and on-chip programmable systems.</description>

      <title>Fast label-free point-scanning super-resolution imaging for endoscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical endoscopy plays a crucial role in minimally invasive medical diagnostics and therapeutic procedures. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art endoscopic zoom objectives are bulky, requiring multi-element lens actuation, which can limit continued miniaturization. Point-scanning super-resolution approaches improve spatial resolution by illuminating the scene with a reduced-width focused spot, yet mechanical scanning requirements limit applicability in clinical settings. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a Fast label-free point-scanning super-resolution (Flaps) microscopy system, which exploits a multi-level phase-only diffractive optical element (DOE) to generate super-resolution spot(s) and uses a high-speed digital micromirror device (DMD) to deliver the illumination without mechanical scanning. Two imaging architectures are explored: a single super-resolution spot (0.47 Airy spot) or a 5 times 5 super-resolution spot array (0.52 Airy spot) in the far-field; the DMD scans the spot or spot array in the object plane at kHz rates. To demonstrate super-resolution imaging with high-speed acquisition using optical elements suitable for future deployment in endoscopy, we image a label-free resolution test target and fluorescently labelled cells.</description>

      <title>Laser-Induced Deposition of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes in Suspended Core Optical Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate laser-driven deposition of single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in suspended core fibers (SCFs) for the first time. Two samples for each SCF type with three (SCF1) and four (SCF2) air holes are individually inserted in a syringe loaded with a 0.5 mL solution of CNTs dispersed in methanol, and a high-power laser at 980 nm is injected into the fibers during distinct periods: SCF1 (20 and 30 minutes), SCF2 (5 and 10 minutes). The CNT solution thermally expands, accelerating and depositing nanotubes on the fiber tip. The material and dimensions of the CNTs deposited on the SCFs' cross-section are characterized, revealing nanotube bundles increasing in thickness from the fiber core to the bridges and inside the holes. The average maximum CNT thickness widening the bridge edges is, respectively, for SCF1 (2.8 and 2 microns) and SCF2 (1.7 and 1.3 microns). These achievements are significant for nanoparticle deposition and fabrication of microscale devices on tips and inside specialty and hollow fibers, enabling innovative fiber sensors, mode-locked fiber lasers, in-fiber acousto-optic modulators, and broadband photoacoustic transmitters for imaging and neurostimulation.</description>

      <title>Space-time refraction of space-time wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time modulation of refractive index can produce synthetically moving interfaces with arbitrary apparent velocities, including superluminal motion, offering new ways to control light in dynamic media. On the other hand, space-time wave packets are structured waves whose spatio-temporal spectra lie on tilted space-time planes, so their group velocity can be programmed, including superluminal values, even in a uniform medium. Here we develop a general theory of space-time refraction for such structured waves at a planar moving interface and show how a single boundary reshapes their velocity content. By identifying the invariants of a translating boundary, we obtain refraction laws for baseband, X-wave, and sideband packets that apply for arbitrary interface velocities and connect smoothly to static and purely temporal limits. These laws reveal regimes of "space-time anomalous optical push broom," where a moving interface compresses a wide range of incident velocities into a narrow transmitted band, and "velocity spectral optical fission," where an incident X-wave splits into two propagation-invariant branches with distinct velocities. The combined freedom to prepare waves with superluminal group velocity and to prescribe equally unconstrained interface speeds points toward reconfigurable time gating, optical buffering, velocity multiplexing, and controlled emission in moving media, and provides a route to photonic settings capable of emulating dynamical effects traditionally associated with gravitational or quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Thermoplasmonics under optically coupled regime: A Numerical Study of Dimers, Nanolenses, and Switchable Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The management of thermal effects in plasmonic nanostructures is frequently viewed as a detrimental waste rather than a useful, controllable entity. We show that optical coupling of plasmonic nanoparticles enables precise spatiotemporal control over nanoscale heating. Through numerical investigation of experimentally-achievable systems from individual nanoparticles and dimers to nanolenses and switchable clusters, we demonstrate how plasmon hybridization and near-field coupling dictate the magnitude and spatial distribution of temperature. Our results highlight the critical role of polarization and gap distance in tuning the thermal output of dimers, the ability of a trimer nanolens to focus heat into a sub-diffraction volume, and the pronounced thermal difference in a switchable nanoparticle cluster. This work establishes a framework for designing advanced thermoplasmonic systems where heat is not merely a detriment, but a dynamically controllable element for applications in catalysis, health, or active photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Advancing Machine Learning Optimization of Chiral Photonic Metasurface: Comparative Study of Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral photonic metasurfaces provide unique capabilities for tailoring light-matter interactions, which are essential for next-generation photonic devices. Here, we report an advanced optimization framework that combines deep learning and evolutionary algorithms to significantly improve both the design and performance of chiral photonic nanostructures. Building on previous work utilizing a three-layer perceptron reinforced learning and stochastic evolutionary algorithm with decaying changes and mass extinction for chiral photonic optimization, our study introduces a refined pipeline featuring a two-output neural network architecture to reduce the trade-off between high chiral dichroism (CD) and reflectivity. Additionally, we use an improved fitness function, and efficient data augmentation techniques. A comparative analysis between a neural network (NN)-based approach and a genetic algorithm (GA) is presented for structures of different interface pattern depth, material combinations, and geometric complexity. We demonstrate a twice higher CD and the impact of both the corner number and the refractive index contrast at the example of a GaP/air and PMMA/air metasurface as a result of superior optimization performance. Additionally, a substantial increase in the number of structures explored within limited computational resources is highlighted, with tailored spectral reflectivity suggested by our electromagnetic simulations, paving the way for chiral mirrors applicable to polarization-selective light-matter interaction studies.</description>

      <title>Cavity Mediated Two-Qubit Gate: Tuning to Optimal Performance with NISQ Era Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of photon-mediated operations are critical to the realization of scalable quantum information processing platforms and their accurate characterization is essential for the identification of optimal regimes and their experimental realizations. Such light-matter interactions are often studied with a broad variety of analytical and computational methods that are constrained by approximation techniques or by computational scaling. Quantum processors present a new avenue to address these challenges. We consider the case of cavity mediated two-qubit gates. To investigate quantum state transfer between the qubits, we implement simulations with quantum circuits that are able to reliably track the dynamics of the system. Our quantum algorithm, compatible with NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era systems, allows us to map out the fidelity of the state transfer operation between qubits as a function of a broad range of system parameters including the respective detunings between the qubits and the cavity, the damping factor of the cavity, and the respective couplings between the qubits and the cavity. The algorithm provides a robust and intuitive solution, alongside a satisfactory agreement with analytical solutions or classical simulation algorithms in their respective regimes of validity. It allows us to identify under-explored regimes of optimal performance, relevant for heterogeneous quantum platforms, where the two-qubit gate can be rather effective between far-detuned qubits that are neither resonant with each other nor with the cavity. Besides its present application, the method introduced in the current paper can be efficiently used in otherwise untractable variations of the model and in various efforts to simulate and optimize photon-mediated two-qubit gates and other relevant operations in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Unraveling real-time chemical shifts in the ultrafast regime</title>

Abstract: Traditional x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) relies upon a direct mapping between the photoelectron binding energies and the local chemical environment, which is well-characterized by an electrostatic partial charges model for systems in equilibrium. However, the extension of this technique to out-of-equilibrium systems has been hampered by the lack of x-ray sources capable of accessing multiple atomic sites with high spectral and temporal resolution, as well as the lack of simple theoretical procedures to interpret the observed signals. In this work we employ multi-site XPS with a narrowband femtosecond x-ray probe to unravel different ultrafast dissociation processes of a polyatomic molecule, fluoromethane (CH$_{3}$F). We show that XPS can follow the cleavage of both the C-F and C-H bonds in real time, despite these channels lying close in binding energy. Additionally, we apply the partial charges model to describe these dynamics, and verify this extension with both advanced ab-initio calculations and experimental data. These results enable the application of this technique to out-of-equilibrium systems of higher complexity, by correlating real-time information from multiple atomic sites and interpreting the measurements through a viable theoretical modelling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic spectroscopy in solids gives insight into the inner workings of solids, such as reconstructing band structures or probing the topological phase of materials. High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a highly non-linear phenomena and simulations guide interpretation of experimental results. These simulations often rely on the electric dipole approximation, even though the driving fields enter regimes that challenge its accuracy. Here, we investigate effects of including nondipole terms in the light-matter coupling in simulations of HHG in materials with both topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. We show how the inclusion of nondipole terms breaks dipole selection rules, allowing for new polarizations of the generated light. Specifically we find that helicity, completely absent in the dipole approximation, is induced by the nondipole extension, and that this helicity is dependent on the topological phase of the material.</description>

      <title>High-purity frequency-degenerate photon pair generation via cascaded SFG/SPDC in thin film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency-degenerate photon pairs generated using nonlinear photonic integrated devices are a crucial resource for scalable quantum information processing and metrology. However, their realization is hindered by unwanted parametric processes occurring within the same phase matching band, which degrade the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce the purity of the associated quantum states. Here, we propose a dual-pump scheme to produce frequency-degenerate photon pairs, based on cascaded sum-frequency generation and spontaneous parametric down-conversion occurring within a single waveguide, while strongly suppressing parasitic photon pair generation from single-pump processes. This approach significantly simplifies the design compared to microresonator-based methods and enables both pumping and collection of photon pairs entirely in the telecom band. We experimentally validate the concept in a layer-poled thin film lithium niobate waveguide, achieving frequency-degenerate photon pair generation with a brightness of \SI{1.0(3)e5}{\hertz \per \nm \per \square \milli \watt } and a 40 dB suppression of unwanted single-pump processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent topological tools offer a powerful way to classify how phases of nonlinear bosonic resonators are organized. Yet, they remain incomplete. In particular, self-sustained oscillations in the form of limit cycles act as robust organizing centers in phase space that are not captured by existing fixed-point-based approaches. In this work, we extend the flow topology framework for nonlinear resonators to include limit cycles as fundamental topological elements. Using a graph-based construction, we show how periodic attractors impact the global connectivity of phase-space flows. We illustrate the approach with a minimal nonlinear Van der Pol resonator model, where limit cycles coexist with stationary points. Our results provide a unified topological description of stationary and time-periodic phases in nonlinear bosonic systems, with direct relevance to photonic, superconducting, and optomechanical platforms, and raise new questions on synchronization and the extension of flow topology to the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Plasma lens for focusing attosecond pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond pulses provide unique opportunities for studies of time-resolved electron dynamics. However, focusing these pulses, typically ranging from the vacuum ultraviolet to the soft-X-ray region, remains challenging. Conventional refractive lenses are not suitable owing to the large dispersion and the strong absorption, while reflective optics, despite avoiding these issues, still lead to high losses. Here we propose a tunable plasma lens capable of focusing attosecond pulses, and experimentally demonstrate focusing of these pulses at extreme-ultraviolet photon energies around 20 eV and 80 eV. A key advantage is its compatibility with nonlinear frequency conversion processes like high-harmonic generation. The different focusing properties of the fundamental light and the generated harmonic frequencies allow for efficient separation of these components. Consequently, the transmission of high-harmonic generation beamlines can be increased to more than 80%, making this approach highly suitable for photon-demanding applications.</description>

      <title>Emergent scattering regimes in disordered metasurfaces near critical packing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disordered metasurfaces provide a versatile platform for harnessing near- and far-field scattered light. Most research has focused on either particulate topologies composed of individual, well-identified metaatoms or, to a lesser extent, semi-continuous aggregate topologies without well identified inclusions. Here, we uncover an intermediate critical packing regime characterized by metasurface morphologies in which a significant fraction of metaatoms begin to connect. We experimentally demonstrate that, at this threshold, the properties of the scattered light abruptly change and, via a statistical quasinormal mode analysis, interpret this change as a marked transition in the statistics of the photon density of states. Unlike percolation in semicontinuous metal films, this transition affects not only the specular but also the diffuse components of the scattered light in a profound way. Our results introduce critical packing topologies as a novel design strategy for manipulating the spectral and angular characteristics of light using ultrathin optical coatings. Emergent functionalities include colour shifts in diffuse light driven by multiple scattering and surface whitening, with potential applications in display technologies, for example, to reduce glare in electronic screens.</description>

Abstract: Laser treatment has emerged into a cornerstone of industrial manufacturing. This creates the demand to understand in detail the involved physical processes and their dynamics, to control the process, and to keep guard in-situ the laser manufacturing steps. Given the contactless interaction of light with matter, particularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing. This chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical pulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via reflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific nonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques (where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by the duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the transient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \mu s) with respect to the arrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on microscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in laser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and shockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases, shielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring, etc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes for visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk of the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging. The chapter provides a historic survey, highlights important scientific and technological developments and breakthroughs, discusses selected applications, explores the requirements and current limitations, and sheds light on emerging future trends.</description>

Abstract: In the last decades, the subject of laser-induced damage (LID) moved from a topic of scientific interest toward laser material processing for technical applications. When using pulsed lasers, the cumulative effect known as incubation is one of the most fundamental features of the processing event. Incubation manifests by the fact that the critical fluence for LID (known as laser-induced damage threshold, LIDT) depends on the number of pulses N exciting one spot on the sample. In most cases, the threshold fluence decreases with N starting from the single-shot ablation threshold and remains constant for large N. No ablation or damage occurs for any N, if the fluence is kept below the multiple-pulse threshold. In contrast, examples where the LIDT increases with N have been reported. The latter effect is known as laser conditioning and is advantageously used when ramping up the power of high-power laser systems. Incubation has been described for many types of solids; the motivation for these comprehensive efforts is twofold. Firstly, one tries to prevent the damage of optical materials in the beam path of high-energy or high-peak-power lasers. Secondly, one deliberately uses this damage for the sculpting of components. In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the mechanisms of incubation. We are going to look at the parameters controlling LID and highlight the peculiarity of the parameter "number of pulses". We will give an overview of the experimental work done in a variety of materials. There are several physical and chemical mechanisms proposed that govern incubation, and there are several mathematical models to describe the behavior of threshold fluence and ablation rate in dependence on the number of pulses. In a few cases, the two classes of mechanisms are even related to each other. Eventually, we will show the implications that incubation has on real-world laser machining.</description>

      <title>Light in Slices: How to Enable Precise Laser Processing?</title>

Abstract: Ultrashort (femtosecond, fs) laser pulses have fascinating properties as they allow to confine optical energy on extreme scales in space and time. Such fs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light that are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while simultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling, from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence, the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids. We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling of collective optical resonances in dielectric metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces can achieve strong light-matter interaction based on several types of collective (nonlocal) resonances, such as surface lattice resonances (SLRs) and quasi bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs). Spectral selectivity, field enhancement, and high and controllable Q-factors make these resonances appealing for technological applications in lasing, sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photon sources. An emerging challenge focuses on tailoring light-matter interaction via mode coupling and hybridization between the fundamental resonances of a metasurface. While strong coupling phenomena have been demonstrated between various resonant modes, the interplay between collective resonances of different natures has not been observed to date. Here, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrate the onset of coupling and hybridization between symmetry-protected quasi-BICs and SLRs in a dielectric metasurface. We show the emergence of anticrossing (or Rabi splitting) in the strong coupling regime with suppression of reflection, observed under TE-polarised excitation, and the manifestation of an accidental BIC under TM-polarised illumination as a result of energy exchange between the participating collective resonances in the weak coupling regime. The first effect is accompanied by hybridized near fields of the modes. The observed coupling mechanisms can be controlled by modifying the angle of incidence, polarisation, and surrounding environment. This foundational study on the coupling and hybridization of collective resonances offers insights that can be leveraged for the design of metasurfaces with targeted quasi-aBIC and collective hybridized resonances. It could also open new possibilities to control the near fields associated with such resonances, with promising applications in tunable nanophotonics and light manipulation.</description>

Abstract: Membrane-metasurfaces, formed by periodic arrangements of holes in a dielectric layer, are gaining attention for their easier manufacturing via subtractive techniques, unnecessity of substrates, and access to resonant near-fields. Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference, including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and quasi-bound states in the continuum. We also present the applicability of the method to membrane-metasurfaces with non-centrosymmetric unit cells (e.g., conical holes and surface voids). By enabling a deeper insight into the coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of local and collective resonances, our method expands the electromagnetics toolbox to study, understand, and design conventional and membrane-metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Photon-starved imaging through turbulence at the diffraction limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground-based imaging systems struggle to achieve diffraction-limited resolution when atmospheric turbulence and photon scarcity act simultaneously. In this regime, conventional adaptive optics, speckle imaging, and blind deconvolution lack sufficient information diversity to reliably estimate either the scene or the turbulence. We present Turbulence Aware Poisson Blind Deconvolution (TAP-BD), a framework designed for robust image recovery in these extreme conditions. TAP-BD extracts more information from coded-detection through phase diversity and decodes it with a physics-informed optimization that incorporates low photon Poisson statistics. Experiments show that TAP-BD provides reliable reconstructions of both scene and turbulence using only a few tens of measurements, even under strong aberrations and photon-starved conditions where existing methods fail. This capability enables photon-efficient, turbulence resilient imaging for applications such as space situational awareness and long-range remote sensing.</description>

      <title>Photonic Doping of Epsilon-Near-Zero Bragg Microcavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) photonics provides a powerful route to extreme dispersion engineering, strong field confinement, and unconventional wave phenomena. A closely related concept is \textit{photonic doping}, where subwavelength nonmagnetic dielectric materials embedded in ENZ media enable exotic responses such as perfect-magnetic-conductor behavior and simultaneous epsilon- and mu-near-zero states. However, photonic doping has remained limited to microwave and far-infrared regimes due to the intrinsic losses of optical ENZ materials. Here, photonic doping is demonstrated at optical frequencies by embedding a periodic array of dielectric Mie resonators into an ultralow-loss, all-dielectric ENZ platform based on near-cutoff Bragg microcavities. The resulting structures support spectrally isolated, quasi-singular coupled Bragg--Mie resonances spanning electric and magnetic multipolar orders and their overtones. These modes exhibit effective near-zero-index dispersion with fields confined either within or between the nanoparticles. A representative \(14\,\mu\mathrm{m}\)-scale doped structure exhibits quality factors approaching \(10^{4}\) and magnetic-dipole Purcell enhancements exceeding \(5\times10^{3}\) in the near-infrared. The demonstrated platform elevates the photonic doping from a microwave-only concept to a fully optical, low-loss, and multipole-resolved platform, enabling ultra-narrowband Mie-like resonances, enhanced magnetic-light interactions, and new opportunities in multipolar-selective spectroscopy and lasing, low-threshold nonlinear optics and efficient single-photon emission.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution with Fourier measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resolving sources beyond the diffraction limit is important in imaging, communications, and metrology. Current image-based methods of super-resolution require phase information (either of the source points or an added filter) and perfect alignment with the centroid of the object. Both inhibit the practical application of these methods, as uniform motion and/or relative jitter destroy their assumptions. Here, we show that measuring intensity in the Fourier plane enables super-resolution without any of the issues of image-based methods. We start with the shift-invariance of the Fourier transform and the observation that the two-point position problem ${x_1,x_2}$ in the near field corresponds to the single-point wavenumber problem $k\ =2\pi/(x_2-x_1)$ in the far field. We consider the full range of mutual coherence and show that for fully coherent sources, the Fourier method saturates the quantum limit, i.e. it gives the best possible measurement. Similar results hold for sub-Rayleigh constellations of $N$ sources, which can act collectively as a spatially averaged metasurface and/or individually as elements of a phased-array antenna. The theory paves the way to merge Fourier optics with super-resolution techniques, enabling experimental devices that are both simpler and more robust than previous designs.</description>

      <title>Dispersion-Mediated Space-Time States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-time varying media enable unprecedented control over electromagnetic waves, yet most existing studies assume idealized, nondispersive materials and thus fail to capture the intrinsic frequency dispersion of realistic platforms. Here, we develop a general framework for dispersive space-time varying systems that rigorously identifies the physically allowed frequency transitions of waves scattered at moving interfaces. Unlike previous approaches, our method is valid for arbitrary dispersion profiles, including resonances, and does not rely on the commonly used frame hopping approach, allowing treatment of multiple-velocity and accelerated systems. Applying this framework to canonical Drude and Lorentz media, we uncover a family of dispersion-mediated space-time states that arise from the multiple frequency transitions permitted by material dispersion. These states extend beyond conventional nondispersive scattering, revealing qualitatively new regimes of space-time scattering behavior. Beyond the frequency transitions, we derive the scattering coefficients for dispersive moving interfaces and provide a Fourier-domain formulation that yields a complete electromagnetic scattering solution for both monochromatic waves and broadband pulses. Our results establish a rigorous foundation for the design of realistic space-time metamaterials, with immediate relevance to emerging experiments in epsilon-near-zero optical platforms and open pathways for dispersion-engineered wave manipulation.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate element-specific incoherent diffractive imaging (IDI) of single copper nanocubes using intensity correlations of K$\alpha$ fluorescence at a hard X-ray free-electron laser. Combining single particle diffraction classification with IDI, we retrieve the form factor of 88 nm cubes with 20 nm resolution, extending IDI to the destructive single-particle regime with a large gain in resolution. IDI visibility drops sharply above a fluence of $10^2$ J/cm$^2$, consistent with the assumption of amplified spontaneous emission. Our results reveal fundamental limits for high-fluence nanoimaging towards future single-particle X-ray imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials exposed to intense femtosecond X-ray pulses with energies above their K-shell absorption edge can enter an extremely ionized state, which could give rise to nonlinear phenomena, such as saturable absorption and reverse saturable absorption. In this work, we investigate these effects on single copper nanoparticles irradiated by an X-ray free-electron laser pulse. We study the properties of the K$\alpha$ fluorescence for two different short pulse durations and three X-ray incident energies below and above the K-shell absorption edge, and correlate these with incident fluence estimates based on coherent diffraction. We observe that the incident fluence of the pulse and not its duration, is the main factor that modulates the nonlinear response, which leads to an effective shortening of the fluorescence emission. Our findings have implications for fluorescence-based methods for imaging single particles using transiently coherent fluorescence, or diffractive imaging through transient resonances.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems have attracted great attention due to their exotic phenomena beyond Hermitian domains. Here we study the wave-packet dynamics in general one-dimensional NH lattices and uncover several unexpected phenomena. The group velocity of a wave packet during the time evolution in such NH lattices is not only governed by the real part of the band structure but also by its imaginary part. The momentum also evolves due to the imaginary part of the band structure, which can lead to a self-induced Bloch oscillation in the absence of external fields. Furthermore, we discover the wave-packet dynamics can exhibit disorder-free NH jumps even when the energy spectra are entirely real. Finally, we show that the NH jumps can lead to both positive and negative temporal Goos--H\"{a}nchen shifts at the edge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate rapid adiabatic passage (RAP) based super-resolution microscopy in a two-level quantum dot (QD) system. The system consists of a QD interacting with two structured beams, accompanied by chirping and a time delay. The central concept of this work is inspired by the stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy technique. To understand the physical mechanism behind super-resolved spot formation, we employ a variational master equation for the density matrix, incorporating both radiative and non-radiative decay processes. A suitably chosen spatiotemporal envelope of the structured beams enables the formation of a super-resolved image. Unwanted low-intensity circular rings around the focal spot are suppressed using Bessel-modulated truncated structured Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) and super-Gaussian (SG) beams. We also study the temperature dependence of the imaging scheme. The numerical results confirm that at low pulse areas, exciton-phonon coupling distorts the image, whereas at higher pulse areas, exciton-phonon decoupling preserves the image resolution. Hence, the proposed scheme may open up new possibilities for nanoscale imaging and bioimaging applications using QDs.</description>

Abstract: In neuromorphic photonic systems, device operations are typically governed by analog signals, necessitating digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC). However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann architectures incur significant energy costs. We propose an analog electronic memory co-located with photonic computing units to eliminate repeated long-distance data movement. Here, we demonstrate a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with on-chip capacitive analog memory and evaluate its performance in machine learning for in situ training and inference using the MNIST dataset. Our analysis shows that integrating analog memory into a neuromorphic photonic architecture can achieve over 26x power savings compared to conventional SRAM-DAC architectures. Furthermore, maintaining a minimum analog memory retention-to-network-latency ratio of 100 maintains &gt;90% inference accuracy, enabling leaky analog memories without substantial performance degradation. This approach reduces reliance on DACs, minimizes data movement, and offers a scalable pathway toward energy-efficient, high-speed neuromorphic photonic computing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulation is making a significant impact on scientific research. The prevailing tendency of the field is to build quantum simulators that get closer to real-world systems of interest, in particular electronic materials. However, progress in the microscopic design also provides an opportunity for an orthogonal research direction: building quantum many-body systems beyond real-world limitations. This colloquium takes this perspective: Concentrating on synthetic quantum matter in non-standard lattice geometries, such as fractal lattices or quasicrystals, higher-dimensional or curved spaces, it aims at providing a fresh introduction to the field of quantum simulation aligned with recent trends across various quantum simulation platforms, including atomic, photonic, and electronic devices. We also shine light on the novel phenomena which arise from these geometries: Condensed matter physicists may appreciate the variety of different localization properties as well as novel topological phases which are offered by such exotic quantum simulators.

      <title>Deep priors for satellite image restoration with accurate uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Satellite optical images, upon their on-ground receipt, offer a distorted view of the observed scene. Their restoration, including denoising, deblurring, and sometimes super-resolution, is required before their exploitation. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainties related to this restoration helps to reduce the risks of misinterpreting the image content. Deep learning methods are now state-of-the-art for satellite image restoration. Among them, direct inversion methods train a specific network for each sensor, and generally provide a point estimation of the restored image without the associated uncertainties. Alternatively, deep regularization (DR) methods learn a deep prior on target images before plugging it, as the regularization term, into a model-based optimization scheme. This allows for restoring images from several sensors with a single network and possibly for estimating associated uncertainties. In this paper, we introduce VBLE-xz, a DR method that solves the inverse problem in the latent space of a variational compressive autoencoder (CAE). We adapt the regularization strength by modulating the bitrate of the trained CAE with a training-free approach. Then, VBLE-xz estimates relevant uncertainties jointly in the latent and in the image spaces by sampling an explicit posterior estimated within variational inference. This enables fast posterior sampling, unlike state-of-the-art DR methods that use Markov chains or diffusion-based approaches. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on very high-resolution simulated and real Pl\'eiades images, asserting the performance, robustness and scalability of the proposed method. They demonstrate that VBLE-xz represents a compelling alternative to direct inversion methods when uncertainty quantification is required. The code associated to this paper is available in https://github.com/MaudBqrd/VBLExz.</description>

      <title>Observation of gauge field induced non-Hermitian helical skin effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic gauge fields and non-Hermitian skin effects are pivotal to topological phases and non-Hermitian physics, each recently attracting great interest across diverse research fields. Realizing skin effects typically require nonreciprocal couplings or on-site gain and loss. Here, we theoretically and experimentally report that, under gauge fields, reciprocal dissipative couplings can nontrivially give rise to an unprecedented nonreciprocal skin effect, hosting pseudospin degree of freedom and featuring helical transport, dubbed as the ``helical pseudospin skin effect". Before introducing the gauge fields, this model exhibits localized pseudospin edge modes and extended bulk modes, without skin effects. As the gauge field strength is applied from $0$ to $\pi$, we observe the emergence of two distinct pseudospin skin effects and their topological transitions: the hybrid-order and second-order helical pseudospin skin effects. Our findings not only highlight gauge field enriched non-Hermitian topology, but also brings pseudospin-momentum locking into skin effects.</description>

      <title>Full-scatter vector field analysis of an overmoded and periodically-loaded cylindrical structure for the transportation of THz radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly overmoded and periodically loaded structures, such as the iris-line waveguide, offer an attractive solution for the efficient transportation of diffraction-prone THz pulses over long distances (hundreds of meters). This paper presents the full-scatter field theory that allows us to analytically derive all the spectral (modal) coefficients on the discontuities of the iris line. The spectral analysis uses vector fields, superseding scalar field descriptions, to account for diffraction loss as well as polarization effects and ohmic loss on practical conductive surfaces. An advanced application of Lorentz's reciprocity theory, using a generalized guided-field configuration, is developed to reduce complexity of the mode-matching problem over nonuniform sections. The used technique is quite general and applies to a wide class of structures, as it only assumes a paraxial incidence (i.e. a parabolic wave equation) along the axis of the structure. It removes the traditional assumption of very thin screens, allowing for the study of thicker screens in the high-frequency limit, while formulating the problem efficiently by scattering matrices whose coefficients are found analytically. The theory agrees with and expands previously established techniques, including Vainstein's asymptotic limit and the forward-scatter approximation. The used formulation also facilitates accurate visualization of the transient regime at the entrance of the structure and how it evolves to reach steady state.</description>

      <title>Towards an Experimental Device-Independent Verification of Indefinite Causal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical physics, events follow a definite causal order: the past influences the future, but not the reverse. Quantum theory, however, permits superpositions of causal orders -- so-called indefinite causal orders -- which can provide operational advantages over classical scenarios. Verifying such phenomena has sparked significant interest, much like earlier efforts devoted to refuting local realism and confirming quantum entanglement. To date, demonstrations of indefinite causal order have all been based a process called the quantum switch and have relied on device-dependent or semi-device-independent protocols. Achieving a device-independent verification of indefinite causal order would imply that nature allows for correlations that do not respect causality, independent of any experimental assumptions or underlying theoretical description of the experiment. To this end, a recent theoretical development introduced a Bell-like inequality that allows for fully device-independent verification of indefinite causal order in a quantum switch. Here we implement this verification by experimentally violating this inequality. In particular, we measure a value of $1.8328 \pm 0.0045$, which is 18 standard deviations above the Definite Causal Order Bound of $1.75$. Our work presents the first implementation of a device-independent protocol to verify indefinite causal order, albeit in the presence of experimental loopholes. This represents an important step towards the device-independent verification of an indefinite causal order, and provides a context in which to identify loopholes specifically related to the verification of indefinite causal order.</description>

      <title>Mitigating quantum operation infidelity through engineering the distribution of photon losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiport interferometers can be constructed from two-port components in various configurations. We investigate how these configurations influence the performance of quantum operations through asymmetries in optical losses. Using numerical simulations, we analyze the effect of photon-loss distributions on the fidelity of operations involving measurements. For both full- and partial-measurement protocols, we compare rectangular (symmetric-loss) and triangular (asymmetric-loss) architectures. Our results show that asymmetric loss configurations can reduce operation infidelity in several cases, revealing a quantifiable trade-off between fidelity and success probability, with implications for the design of high-fidelity photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>A Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Machine -- A Theory for a Novel Type of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in a Unique Dissipative System and one Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on an interesting dissipative system found in a photonics system. In this dissipative system, we theoretically identified that robust causality is generated and as a result, it becomes possible to produce behavior that can be understood as SSB, and, we experimentally demonstrated this finding. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrated that by combining such dissipative systems as fundamental elements and establishing a certain relationship between them through optical interference, it is possible to create a unique system that generates complex SSB as a whole. This unique SSB can be understood as having a duality with the model of the creation of many-body-like system (MBLS), and by using the correspondence between the many-body-like system and the Ising model, it holds promise as an alternative computational resource for solving combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensate sub-wavelength confinement via superoscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical lattices are essential tools in ultra-cold atomic physics. Here we demonstrate theoretically that sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved in these lattices through superoscillations. This generic wave phenomenon occurs when a local region of the wave oscillates faster than any of the frequencies in its global Fourier decomposition. To illustrate how sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved via superoscillations, we consider a one-dimensional tri-chromatic optical potential confining a spinless Bose-Einstein Condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms. By numerical optimization of the relative phases and amplitudes of the optical trap's frequency components, it is possible to generate superoscillatory spatial regions. Such regions contain multiple density peaks at sub-wavelength spacing. This work establishes superoscillations as a viable route to sub-wavelength BEC confinement in blue-detuned optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics of light's orbital angular momentum under a Lorentz boost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we report on the evolution of photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement in inertial reference frames under a Lorentz boost, covering the general cases of zero and non-zero relative motion between observers of the entangled state. We find that entanglement undergoes significant changes that are observer dependent, asymptotically approaching a minimum at very large velocities close to the light cone from the viewpoint of the stationary observers in the rest frame, and degrading completely from the viewpoint of the moving observer. Our results, as demonstrated through entanglement metrics such as entanglement entropy and purity, show that OAM and OAM entanglement are observer dependent, raising pertinent questions on the invariance of such entangled states to spacetime transformations.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory Analysis of Low-Frequency Vibrational Modes of a Benzoxazolium-Coumarin Donor-pi-Acceptor Chromophore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To elucidate low-frequency vibrational modes, we investigate a benzoxazolium--coumarin (BCO+) donor-pi-acceptor derivative using transmission terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The retrieved complex refractive index reveals distinct modes at 0.62, 0.85, 1.30, 1.81, and 2.07 THz. Gas-phase density functional theory (DFT) agrees well with these features and enables assignment of specific intramolecular motions. Together, THz-TDS and DFT identify the characteristic low-frequency modes of BCO+ and suggest their connection to intramolecular charge transfer-relevant nuclear motions, highlighting that THz-TDS can serve as a sensitive probe of vibrational signatures in donor-pi-acceptor systems.</description>
