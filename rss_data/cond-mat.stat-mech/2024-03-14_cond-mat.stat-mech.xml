      <title>Quantum fluctuating theory for one-dimensional shock waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation and the subsequent dynamics of shock waves in repulsive one-dimensional Bose gases during the free expansion of a density hump. By building coherent Fermi states for interacting Bethe fermions, we define a quantum fluctuating initial state expressed in terms of universal quantities, namely the density and the Luttinger parameter. In the integrable case, this fluctuating state is then evolved by generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) and, differently from non-fluctuating initial states, it develops density ripples on top of the hydrodynamic mean value. Our analysis gives a general theory of quantum ripples and wave breaking in integrable and quasi-integrable one-dimensional liquids and clarifies the role of the interaction strength. In particular, for strongly/intermediately interacting bosons, we find quantum ripples originating from low-energy modes at the Fermi surface interfering when transported by GHD. In the low coupling limit, near the quasicondensate regime, we find instead that density ripples have a semi-classical nature, and their description requires information on the curvature of the Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Relative Resolution: An Analysis with the Kullback-Leibler Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel type of a multiscale approach, called Relative Resolution (RelRes), can correctly retrieve the behavior of various nonpolar liquids, whilst speeding up molecular simulations by almost an order of magnitude. In this approach in a single system, molecules switch their resolution in terms of their relative separation, with near neighbors interacting via fine-grained potentials yet far neighbors interacting via coarse-grained potentials; notably, these two potentials are analytically parameterized by a multipole approximation. Our current work focuses on analyzing RelRes by relating it with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Entropy, which is a useful metric for multiscale errors. In particular, we thoroughly examine the exact and approximate versions of this informatic measure for several alkane systems. By analyzing its dependency on the system size, we devise a formula for predicting the exact KL Entropy of an "infinite" system via the computation of the approximate KL Entropy of an "infinitesimal" system. Demonstrating that the KL Entropy can holistically capture many multiscale errors, we settle bounds for the KL Entropy that ensure a sufficient representation of the structural and thermal behavior by the RelRes algorithm. This, in turn, allows the scientific community for readily determining the ideal switching distance for an arbitrary RelRes system.</description>

      <title>Viral Load Inference in Non-Adaptive Pooled Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical diagnostic testing can be made significantly more efficient using pooled testing protocols. These typically require a sparse infection signal and use either binary or real-valued entries of O(1). However, existing methods do not allow for inferring viral loads which span many orders of magnitude. We develop a message passing algorithm coupled with a PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) specific noise function to allow accurate inference of realistic viral load signals. This work is in the non-adaptive setting and could open the possibility of efficient screening where viral load determination is clinically important.</description>

      <title>A simple reconstruction method to infer nonreciprocal interactions and local driving in complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-based inference of directed interactions in complex dynamical systems is a problem common to many disciplines of science. In this work, we study networks of spatially separate dynamical entities, which could represent physical systems that interact with each other by reciprocal or nonreciprocal, instantaneous or time-delayed interactions. We present a simple approach that combines Markov state models with directed information-theoretical measures for causal inference that can accurately infer the underlying interactions from noisy time series of the dynamical system states alone. Remarkably, this is possible despite the built-in simplification of a Markov assumption and the choice of a very coarse discretization at the level of probability estimation. Our test systems are an Ising chain with nonreciprocal coupling imposed by local driving of a single spin, and a system of delay-coupled linear stochastic processes. Stepping away from physical systems, the approach infers cause-effect relationships, or more generally, the direction of mutual or one-way influence. The presented method is agnostic to the number of interacting entities and details of the dynamics, so that it is widely applicable to problems in various fields.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic behavior near dynamical criticality of a facilitated conservative lattice gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a $2d$-conservative lattice gas exhibiting a dynamical active-absorbing phase transition with critical density $\rho_c$. We derive the hydrodynamic equation for this model, showing that all critical exponents governing the large scale behavior near criticality can be obtained from two independent ones. We show that as the supercritical density approaches criticality, distinct length scales naturally appear. Remarkably, this behavior is different from the subcritical one. Numerical simulations support the critical relations and the scale separation.</description>

      <title>Noise-aware neural network for stochastic dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of system-environment coupling, classical complex systems undergo stochastic dynamics, where rich phenomena can emerge at large spatio-temporal scales. To investigate these phenomena, numerical approaches for simulating stochastic dynamics are indispensable and can be computationally expensive. In light of the recent fast development in machine learning techniques, here, we establish a generic machine learning approach to simulate the stochastic dynamics, dubbed the noise-aware neural network (NANN). One key feature of this approach is its ability to generate the long-time stochastic dynamics of complex large-scale systems by just training NANN with the one-step dynamics of smaller-scale systems, thus reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, this NANN based approach is quite generic. Case-by-case special design of the architecture of NANN is not necessary when it is employed to investigate different stochastic complex systems. Using the noisy Kuramoto model and the Vicsek model as concrete examples, we demonstrate its capability in simulating stochastic dynamics. We believe that this novel machine learning approach can be a useful tool in investigating the large spatio-temporal scaling behavior of complex systems subjected to the influences of the environmental noise.</description>

      <title>Comparative Microscopic Study of Entropies and their Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of eleven microscopic entropy definitions (of Boltzmann-surface, Gibbs-volume, canonical, coarse-grained-observational, entanglement and diagonal type) and three microscopic temperature definitions (based on Boltzmann, Gibbs or canonical entropy). This is done for the archetypal nonequilibrium setup of two systems exchanging energy, modeled here with random matrix theory, based on numerical integration of the Schroedinger equation. We consider three types of pure initial states (local energy eigenstates, decorrelated and entangled microcanonical states) and three classes of systems: (A) two normal systems, (B) a normal and a negative temperature system and (C) a normal and a negative heat capacity system.
  We find: (1) All types of initial states give rise to the same macroscopic dynamics. (2) Entanglement and diagonal entropy sensitively depend on the microstate, in contrast to all other entropies. (3) For class B and C, Gibbs-volume entropies can violate the second law and the associated temperature becomes meaningless. (4) For class C, Boltzmann-surface entropies can violate the second law and the associated temperature becomes meaningless. (5) Canonical entropy has a tendency to remain almost constant. (6) For a Haar random initial state, entanglement or diagonal entropy behave similar or identical to coarse-grained-observational entropy.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It's been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. On the other hand, in static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state exhibits KMS condition of infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the algebra formed by operators that are gravitationally dressed to the static patch observer. In the current work we study the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in double-scaled SYK model. We show that the algebra exhibits a behavior reminiscent of both perspectives. In particular, we prove that it's a Type II$_1$ factor, and the empty state with no chords satisfies the tracial property, thus aligning with the expectation in previous work. Furthermore, we show it's a cyclic separating state by exploring the modular structure of the algebra. We then study various limits of the theory and explore corresponding relations to JT gravity, theory of baby universe, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present a full solution to the energy spectrum of $0$- and $1$- particle irreducible representations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced ClNO$_2$ formation at the interface of sea-salt aerosol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reactive uptake of $\mathrm{N_2O_5}$ on sea-spray aerosol plays a key role in regulating NO$_\mathrm{x}$ concentration in the troposphere. Despite numerous field and laboratory studies, a microscopic understanding of its heterogeneous reactivity remains unclear. Here, we use molecular simulation and theory to elucidate the chlorination of $\mathrm{N_2O_5}$ to form ClNO$_2$, the primary reactive channel within sea-spray aerosol. We find the formation of ClNO$_2$ is markedly enhanced at the air-water interface due to the stabilization of the charge-delocalized transition state, as evident from the formulation of bimolecular rate theory in heterogeneous environments. We explore the consequences of the enhanced interfacial reactivity in the uptake of $\mathrm{N_2O_5}$ using numerical solutions of molecular reaction-diffusion equations as well as their analytical approximations. Our results suggest that the current interpretation of aerosol branching ratios needs to be revisited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the imaginary-time relaxation critical dynamics of the Neel-paramagnetic quantum phase transition in the two-dimensional (2D) dimerized S = 1/2 Heisenberg model. We focus on the scaling correction in the short-time region. A unified scaling form including both short-time and finite-size corrections is proposed. According to this full scaling form, improved short-imaginary-time scaling relations are obtained. We numerically verify the scaling form and the improved short-time scaling relations for different initial states using projector quantum Monte Carlo algorithm.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hilbert-Space Fragmentation on a Superconducting Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isolated interacting quantum systems generally thermalize, yet there are several counterexamples for the breakdown of ergodicity, such as many-body localization and quantum scars. Recently, ergodicity breaking has been observed in systems subjected to linear potentials, termed Stark many-body localization. This phenomenon is closely associated with Hilbert-space fragmentation, characterized by a strong dependence of dynamics on initial conditions. Here, we experimentally explore initial-state dependent dynamics using a ladder-type superconducting processor with up to 24 qubits, which enables precise control of the qubit frequency and initial state preparation. In systems with linear potentials, we observe distinct non-equilibrium dynamics for initial states with the same quantum numbers and energy, but with varying domain wall numbers. This distinction becomes increasingly pronounced as the system size grows, in contrast with disordered interacting systems. Our results provide convincing experimental evidence of the fragmentation in Stark systems, enriching our understanding of the weak breakdown of ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Quantum Magnetism on Complex Networks: What Sets the Total Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider equal antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions between qubits sitting at the nodes of a complex, nonbipartite network. We ask the question: How does the network topology determine the net magnetization of the ground state and to what extent is it tunable? By examining various network families with tunable properties, we demonstrate that (i) graph heterogeneity, i.e., spread in the number of neighbors, is essential for a nonzero total spin, and (ii) other than the average number of neighbors, the key structure governing the total spin is the presence of (disassortative) hubs, as opposed to the level of frustration. We also show how to construct simple networks where the magnetization can be tuned over its entire range across both abrupt and continuous transitions, which may be realizable on existing platforms. Our findings pose a number of fundamental questions and strongly motivate wider exploration of quantum many-body phenomena beyond regular lattices.</description>

      <title>Energy-gap modulation and majorization in three-level quantum Otto engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A three-level quantum system having two energy gaps presents a nontrivial working medium for a quantum heat engine. Our focus lies in understanding the constraints on the ability to modulate these gaps relative to the changes in probability distributions at the two given heat reservoirs. It is seen that an Otto engine in the quasistatic limit is feasible if at least one energy gap shrinks during the first quantum adiabatic stage. We analyze operating conditions under different variations of the gaps, revealing that a definite majorization relation between the hot and cold distributions serves as a sufficient criterion for the engine when both gaps are shrinking. Further, Otto efficiency is enhanced in case majorization holds. On the other hand, majorization becomes a necessary condition when only one of the gaps is shrinking. In the special case where one gap remains fixed, majorization is both necessary and sufficient for engine operation. For an $n$-level system, we note that a well defined change in energy gaps aligns with the majorization relation, thus characterizing the operation of the engine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the question of string order and hidden symmetry breaking in the q-deformed AKLT model, an example of a spin chain that possesses generalized symmetry. We first argue that the non-local Kennedy-Tasaki duality transformation that was previously proposed to relate the string order to a local order parameter leads to a non-local Hamiltonian and thus does not provide a physically adequate description of the symmetry breaking. We then present a modified non-local transformation which is based on a recently developed generalization of Witten's Conjugation to frustration-free lattice models and capable of resolving this issue.</description>

      <title>Onsager vortex clusters on a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Onsager vortex clustered states in a shell-shaped superfluid containing a large number of quantum vortices. In the incompressible limit and at low temperatures, the relevant problem can be boiled down to the statistical mechanics of neutral point vortices confined on a sphere. We analyze rotation free vortex clustered states within the mean field theory in the microcanonical ensemble. We find that the sandwich state, which involves the separating of vortices with opposite circulation and the clustering of vortices with same circulation around the poles and the equator, is the maximum entropy vortex distribution, subject to zero angular momentum constraint. The dipole momentum vanishes for the sandwich state and the quadrupole tensor serves as an order parameter to characterize the vortex cluster structure. For given finite angular momentum, the equilibrium vortex distribution forms a dipole structure, i.e., vortices with opposite sign are separated and are accumulated around the south and north pole, respectively. The conditions for the onset of clustering, and the exponents associated with the quadrupole moment and the dipole moment as functions of energy, are obtained within the mean field theory. At large energies, we obtain asymptotically exact vortex density distributions using the stereographic projection method, which give rise the parameter bounds for the vortex clustered states. The analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with microcanonical Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent currents circulate continuously without requiring external power sources. Here, we extend their theory to include dissipation within the framework of non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonians. Using Green's function formalism, we introduce a non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac distribution and derive an analytical expression for the persistent current that relies solely on the complex spectrum. We apply our formula to two dissipative models supporting persistent currents: ($i$) a phase-biased superconducting-normal-superconducting junction; ($ii$) a normal ring threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the persistent currents in both systems exhibit no anomalies at any emergent exceptional points, whose signatures are only discernible in the current susceptibility. We validate our findings by exact diagonalization and extend them to account for finite temperatures and interaction effects. Our formalism offers a general framework for computing quantum many-body observables of non-Hermitian systems in equilibrium, with potential extensions to non-equilibrium scenarios.</description>

      <title>Parafermions with symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics</title>

Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons have garnered extensive attention for obeying exotic non-Abelian statistics and potential applications to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Although the prior research has predominantly focused on non-Abelian statistics without the necessity of symmetry protection, recent progresses have shown that symmetries can play essential roles and bring about a notion of the symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics. In this work, we extend the concept of SPNA statistics to strongly-correlated systems which host parafermion zero modes (PZMs). This study involves a few fundamental results proved here. First, we unveil a generic unitary symmetry mechanism that protects PZMs from local couplings. Then, with this symmetry protection, the PZMs can be categorized into two nontrivial sectors, each maintaining its own parity conservation, even though the whole system cannot be dismantled into separate subsystems due to nonlinear interactions. Finally, by leveraging the parity conservation of each sector and the general properties of the effective braiding Hamiltonian, we prove rigorously that the PZMs intrinsically obey SPNA statistics. To further confirm the results, we derive the braiding matrix at a tri-junction. In addition, we propose a physical model that accommodates a pair of PZMs protected by mirror symmetry and satisfying the generic theory. This work shows a broad spectrum of strongly-correlated systems capable of hosting fractional SPNA quasiparticles and enriches our comprehension of fundamental quantum statistics linked to the symmetries that govern the exchange dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Pseudoentanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum entanglement plays a central role in explaining the emergence of thermal equilibrium in isolated many-body systems. However, entanglement is notoriously hard to measure, and can in fact be forged: recent works have introduced a notion of pseudoentanglement describing ensembles of many-body states that, while only weakly entangled, cannot be efficiently distinguished from states with much higher entanglement, such as random states in the Hilbert space. In this work we initiate the study of the dynamical generation and propagation of pseudoentanglement. As generic quantum dynamics tends to maximize actual entanglement, we consider constrained models of time evolution: automaton (i.e. reversible classical) circuits that, when fed suitable input states, provably produce the "standard models" of pseudoentangled ensembles--uniformly random subset(-phase) states--at late times, a phenomenon we name 'pseudothermalization'. We examine (i) how a pseudoentangled ensemble on a small subsystem spreads to the whole system as a function of time, and (ii) how a pseudoentangled ensemble is generated from an initial product state. We map the above problems onto a family of classical Markov chains on subsets of the computational basis. The mixing times of such Markov chains are related to the time scales at which the states produced from the dynamics become indistinguishable from Haar-random states at the level of each statistical moment (or number of copies). Based on a combination of rigorous bounds and conjectures supported by numerics, we argue that each Markov chain's relaxation time and mixing time have different asymptotic behavior in the limit of large system size. This is a necessary condition for a cutoff phenomenon: an abrupt dynamical transition to equilibrium. We thus conjecture that our random circuits give rise to asymptotically sharp pseudothermalization transitions.</description>

      <title>On spontaneous breaking of the $\text{SO}(2N)$ symmetry in the Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical Gross-Neveu model for $N$ two-component Dirac fermions in $2+1$ dimensions suffers a continuous phase transition at a critical interaction $g_{c1} \sim 1/N$ at large $N$, at which its continuous symmetry $\text{SO}(2N)$ is preserved and a discrete (Ising) symmetry becomes spontaneously broken. A recent mean-field calculation, however, points to an additional transition at a diffferent critical $g_{c2}\sim -N g_{c1}$, at which $\text{SO}(2N) \rightarrow \text{SO}(N) \times \text{SO}(N)$. To study the latter phase transition we rewrite the Gross-Neveu interaction $g (\bar{\psi} \psi)^2$ in terms of three different quartic terms for the single ($L=1$) $4N$-component real (Majorana) fermion, and then extend the theory to $L&gt;1$. This allows us to track the evolution of the fixed points of the renormalization group transformation starting from $L\gg 1$, where one can discern three distinct critical points which correspond to continuous phase transitions into (1) $\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet mass-order-parameter, (2) $\text{SO}(2N)$-symmetric-tensor mass-order-parameters, and (3) $\text{SO}(2N)$-adjoint nematic-order-parameters, down to $L=1$ value that is relevant to standard Gross-Neveu model. Below the critical value of $L_c (N)\approx 0.35 N$ for $N\gg1$ only the Gross-Neveu critical point (1) still implies a diverging susceptibility for its corresponding ($\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet) order parameter, whereas the two new critical points that existed at large $L$ ultimately become equivalent to the Gaussian fixed point at $L=1$. We interpret this metamorphosis of the $\text{SO}(2N)$-symmetric-tensor fixed point from critical to spurious as an indication that the transition at $g_{c2}$ in the original Gross-Neveu model is turned first-order by fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: Nascent quantum computers motivate the exploration of quantum many-body systems in nontraditional scenarios. For example, it has become natural to explore the dynamics of systems evolving under both unitary evolution and measurement. Such systems can undergo dynamical phase transitions in the entanglement properties of quantum trajectories conditional on the measurement outcomes. Here, we explore dynamics in which one attempts to (locally) use those measurement outcomes to steer the system toward a target state, and we study the resulting phase diagram as a function of the measurement and feedback rates. Steering succeeds when the measurement and feedback rates exceed a threshold, yielding an absorbing-state transition in the trajectory-averaged density matrix. We argue that the absorbing-state transition generally occurs at different critical parameters from the entanglement transition in individual trajectories and has distinct critical properties. The efficacy of steering depends on the nature of the target state: in particular, for local dynamics targeting long-range correlated states, steering is necessarily slow and the entanglement and steering transitions are well separated in parameter space.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Geometry of Nonequilibrium Fluctuations in Cyclically Driven Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium thermal machines under cyclic driving generally outperform steady-state counterparts. However, there is still lack of coherent understanding of versatile transport and fluctuation features under time modulations. Here, we formulate a theoretical framework of thermodynamic geometry in terms of full counting statistics of nonequilibrium driven transports. We find that, besides the conventional dynamic and adiabatic geometric curvature contributions, the generating function is divided into an additional nonadiabatic contribution, manifested as the metric term of full counting statistics. This nonadiabatic metric generalizes recent results of thermodynamic geometry in near-equilibrium entropy production to far-from-equilibrium fluctuations of general currents. Furthermore, the framework proves geometric thermodynamic uncertainty relations of near-adiabatic thermal devices, constraining fluctuations in terms of statistical metric quantities. We exemplify the theory in experimentally accessible driving-induced quantum chiral transport and Brownian heat pump.</description>

Abstract: We investigate quench dynamics of spin ice after removal of a strong magnetic field along the [100] crystal direction, using Monte Carlo simulations and theoretical arguments. We show how the early-time relaxation of the magnetization can be understood in terms of nucleation and growth of strings of flipped spins, in agreement with an effective stochastic model that we introduce and solve analytically. We demonstrate a crossover at longer times to a regime dominated by approximately isotropic clusters, which we characterize in terms of their morphology, and present evidence for a percolation transition as a function of magnetization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution of the first return time to the initial state of a quantum many-body system subject to stroboscopic projective measurements. We show that this distribution can be interpreted as a continuation of the canonical partition function of a spin chain with non-interacting domains at equilibrium, which is entirely characterised by the Loschmidt amplitude of the quantum many-body system. This allows us to show that this probability may decay either algebraically or exponentially asymptotically in time, depending on whether the spin model displays a ferromagnetic or a paramagnetic phase. We illustrate this idea on the example of the return time of $N$ adjacent fermions in a tight-binding model, revealing a rich phase behaviour, which can be tuned by scaling the probing time with $N$. Our analytical predictions are corroborated by exact numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Decodable hybrid dynamics of open quantum systems with Z_2 symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.04274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a class of "open" quantum circuit models with local decoherence ("noise") and local projective measurements, each respecting a global Z_2 symmetry. The model supports a spin glass phase where the Z_2 symmetry is spontaneously broken (not possible in an equilibrium 1d system), a paramagnetic phase characterized by a divergent susceptibility, and an intermediate "trivial" phase. All three phases are also stable to Z_2-symmetric local unitary gates, and the dynamical phase transitions between the phases are in the percolation universality class. The open circuit dynamics can be purified by explicitly introducing a bath with its own "scrambling" dynamics, as in [Bao, Choi, Altman, arXiv:2102.09164], which does not change any of the universal physics. Within the spin glass phase the circuit dynamics can be interpreted as a quantum repetition code, with each stabilizer of the code measured stochastically at a finite rate, and the decoherences as effective bit-flip errors. Motivated by the geometry of the spin glass phase, we devise a novel decoding algorithm for recovering an arbitrary initial qubit state in the code space, assuming knowledge of the history of the measurement outcomes, and the ability of performing local Pauli measurements and gates on the final state. For a circuit with L^d qubits running for time T, the time needed to execute the decoder scales as O(L^d T) (with dimensionality d). With this decoder in hand, we find that the information of the initial encoded qubit state can be retained (and then recovered) for a time logarithmic in L for a 1d circuit, and for a time at least linear in L in 2d below a finite error threshold. For both the repetition and toric codes, we compare and contrast our decoding algorithm with earlier algorithms that map the error model to the random bond Ising model.</description>

Abstract: A procedure is presented for solving the Fokker-Planck equation with constant diffusion but non-stationary drift. It is based on the correspondence between the Fokker-Planck equation and the non-stationary Schr\"odinger equation. The formalism of supersymmetric quantum mechanics is extended by applying the Darboux transformation directly to the non-stationary Schr\"odinger equation. From a solution of a Fokker-Planck equation a solution of the Darboux partner is obtained. For drift coefficients satisfying the condition of shape invariance, a supersymmetric hierarchy of Fokker-Planck equations with solutions related by the Darboux transformation is obtained.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of the development of steady states in one-dimensional Bose gas tubes that are weakly coupled to one another through a density-density interaction. We analyze this development through a Boltzmann collision integral approach. We argue that when the leading order of the collision integral, where single particle-hole excitations are created in individual gases, is dominant, the state of the gas evolves first to a non-thermal fixed point, i.e. a prethermalization plateau. This order is dominant when a pair of tubes are inequivalent with, say, different temperatures or different effective interaction parameters, $\gamma$. We characterize this non-thermal prethermalization plateau, constructing both the quasi-conserved quantities that control the existence of this plateau as well as the associated generalized Gibbs ensemble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergent behavior of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is a fundamental aspect of biology and its origin from inanimate matter. A closed CRN monotonically tends to thermal equilibrium, but when it is opened to external reservoirs, a range of behaviors is possible, including transition to a new equilibrium state, a non-equilibrium state, or indefinite growth. This study shows that slowly driven CRNs are governed by the conserved quantities of the closed system, which are generally far fewer in number than the species. Considering both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, a universal slow dynamics equation is derived with singular perturbation methods, and is shown to be thermodynamically consistent. The slow dynamics is highly robust against microscopic details of the network, which may be unknown in practical situations. In particular, non-equilibrium states of realistic large CRNs can be sought without knowledge of bulk reaction rates. The framework is successfully tested against a suite of networks of increasing complexity and argued to be relevant in the treatment of open CRNs as chemical machines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12288v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study localization and many-body localization transition in one dimensional systems in the presence of deterministic quasi-periodic potential. We use single-particle excitations obtained through single-particle Green's function in real space to characterize the localization to delocalization transition. A single parameter scaling analysis of the ratio of the typical to average value of the local density of states (LDOS) of single particle excitations shows that the critical exponent with which the correlation length $\xi$ diverges at the transition point $\xi \sim |h-h_c|^{-\nu}$, coming from the localized side, satisfies the inequality $\nu \ge 1$ for the non-interacting Aubry-Andre (AA) model. For the interacting system with AA potential, we study single particle excitations produced in highly excited many-body eigenstates across the MBL transition and found that the critical exponent obtained from finite-size scaling of the ratio of the typical to average value of the LDOS satisfies $\nu \ge 1$ here as well. This analysis of local density of states shows that the localization and MBL transition in systems with quasi-periodic potential belong to a different universality class than the localization and MBL transition in systems with random disorder where $\nu \ge 2$. In complete contrast to this, finite-size scaling of the level spacing ratio is known to support the same universality class for MBL transitions in systems with quasiperiodic as well as random disorder potentials. For the interacting systems with quasiperiodic potentials, though finite-size scaling of the level spacing ratio shows a transition at $h_c^{lsr}$ which is close to the transition point obtained from LDOS within numerical precision, the critical exponent obtained from finite-size scaling of level spacing ratio is $\nu \sim 0.54$ in close similarity to the MBL systems with random disorder.</description>

Abstract: Finding collective variables to describe some important coarse-grained information on physical systems, in particular metastable states, remains a key issue in molecular dynamics. Recently, machine learning techniques have been intensively used to complement and possibly bypass expert knowledge in order to construct collective variables. Our focus here is on neural network approaches based on autoencoders. We study some relevant mathematical properties of the loss function considered for training autoencoders, and provide physical interpretations based on conditional variances and minimum energy paths. We also consider various extensions in order to better describe physical systems, by incorporating more information on transition states at saddle points, and/or allowing for multiple decoders in order to describe several transition paths. Our results are illustrated on toy two dimensional systems and on alanine dipeptide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in quantum thermodynamics is to properly quantify the work extractable from out-of-equilibrium systems. While for closed systems, maximum quantum work extraction is defined in terms of the ergotropy functional, this question is unclear in open systems interacting with an environment. The concept of local ergotropy has been proposed, but it presents several problems, such as it is not guaranteed to be non-increasing in time. Here we introduce the concept of extended local ergotropy by exploiting the free evolution of the system-environment compound. At variance with the local ergotropy, the extended local ergotropy is greater, is non-increasing in time, and activates the potential of work extraction in many cases. We then concentrate on specific schemes in which we alternate repeated local unitaries and free system-environment evolution. We provide examples based on the Jaynes-Cummings model, presenting practical protocols and analytic results that serve as proof of principle for the aforementioned advantages.</description>

Abstract: We study the T-system of type $A_\infty$, also known as the octahedron recurrence/equation, viewed as a 2+1-dimensional discrete evolution equation. Generalizing the study of [P. Di Francesco and R. Soto-Garrido. Arctic curves of the octahedron equation. J. Phys. A, 47(28):285204, 34, 2014], we consider initial data along parallel ``slanted" planes perpendicular to an arbitrary admissible direction $(r,s,t)\in {\mathbb Z}_+^3$. The solution of the T-system is interpreted as the partition function of a dimer model on some suitable ``pinecone" graph introduced in [M. Bousquet-M\'elou, J. Propp, and J. West. Perfect matchings for the three-term Gale-Robinson sequences. Electron. J. Combin., 16(1):Research Paper 125, 37, 2009]. The T-system formulation and some exact solutions in uniform or periodic cases allow us to explore the thermodynamic limit of the corresponding dimer models and to derive exact arctic curves separating the various phases of the system.</description>
