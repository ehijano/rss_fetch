      <title>The fermion sign problem in Gauss law sectors of quantum link models with dynamical matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fermion sign problem poses a formidable challenge to the use of Monte Carlo methods for lattice gauge theories with dynamical fermionic matter fields. A meron cluster algorithm recently formulated for gauge fields represented as spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum links coupled to a single flavour of staggered fermions samples only two of the exponentially many Gauss law (GL) sectors at low temperatures, making it possible to simulate either of those two GL sectors at zero temperature in polynomial time. In this article, we analytically identify GL sectors which can be simulated without encountering the fermion sign problem in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Using large-scale exact diagonalization and cluster Monte Carlo methods, we further explore the nature of phases in the GL sectors dominating at zero temperature. The vacuum states lie in sectors which satisfy a staggered Gauss law, in contrast to the zero GL sector familiar in particle physics. Moreover, we prove that while the ground state GL sectors do not suffer from the fermion sign problem, the usual zero-charge GL sector (often considered the physical sector) does. We outline the role of the magnetic energy in causing transitions between GL sectors. We expect our results to be valid for truncated Kogut-Susskind gauge theories, beyond quantum link models.</description>

      <title>On the nature of the QCD chiral phase transition with imaginary chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The order of the thermal chiral phase transition in lattice QCD is known to be strongly cutoff-dependent. A previous study using $N_\mathrm{f}\in[2,6]$ mass-degenerate, unimproved staggered quark flavours on $N_\tau\in\{4,6,8\}$ lattices found that the bare mass regions displaying explicit first-order transitions shrink to zero, with their critical boundary line terminating in a tricritical point before the continuum limit is reached. Here we perform an analogous study for fixed imaginary baryon chemical potential and find the same behaviour: first-order regions observed on coarse lattices disappear in tricritical points with diminishing lattice spacing. These observations are consistent with currently available results from improved staggered discretisations, both at zero and non-zero imaginary chemical potential. Unless additional first-order transitions are found on finer lattices or with chiral lattice actions, this implies a second-order transition in the continuum chiral limit for all these cases, at zero and imaginary chemical potential. Ultimately, implications for the $N_\mathrm{f}=2+1$ QCD phase diagram at the physical point are discussed.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional imaging of hadrons with hard exclusive reactions: advances in experiment, theory, phenomenology, and lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15064</link>

Abstract: Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) have emerged as a powerful framework for exploring the internal structure of hadrons in terms of their partonic constituents. Over the past three decades, the field has witnessed significant theoretical and experimental advancements. The interpretation of GPDs in impact parameter space offers a vivid three-dimensional visualization of hadron structure, correlating longitudinal momentum and transverse spatial distributions, thereby enabling tomographic imaging of hadrons. Furthermore, the link between GPDs and the matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor provides access to fundamental properties of hadrons, including spin decomposition and internal pressure distributions. Notably, recent analyses of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) data have enabled the empirical extraction of the quark pressure profile inside the proton. This white paper presents an overview of recent developments in GPD theory and phenomenology, as well as progress in lattice QCD studies. It outlines the prospects for advancing our understanding of hadron structure through the next generation of dedicated experiments, including the extension of the Jefferson Lab 12~GeV program (and its potential 22~GeV upgrade), J-PARC, COMPASS/AMBER, LHC ultra-peripheral collisions, and the future electron-ion colliders EIC and EicC.</description>

      <title>Statistical repulsion on hyperons in two-color dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the onset of hyperons in baryonic (diquark) matter in two-color QCD (QC$_2$D) by introducing heavy quark doublets that emulate strange quarks. An even number of flavors is required to avoid the sign problem in lattice Monte Carlo simulations. To explore QC$_2$D matter containing both light and heavy quarks, we construct a model in which quarks interact with light-light, light-heavy (hyperonic), and heavy-heavy diquarks via Yukawa couplings. As the quark chemical potential increases, the light diquarks condense first and form baryonic matter, and this onset density can be understood in hadronic terms. In contrast, the onset density of hyperons is substantially higher than that estimated from the hadronic sector of the model. This shift reflects an effective repulsion among baryons induced by the pre-occupied light quarks. The Pauli blocking of light quarks suppresses the attractive diquark correlations responsible, in vacuum, for making hyperons lighter than the sum of the constituent light and heavy quark masses. Implications for three-color QCD are also briefly discussed.</description>
