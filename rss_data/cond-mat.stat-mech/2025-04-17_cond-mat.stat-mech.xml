      <title>Learning transitions in classical Ising models and deformed toric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional probability distributions describe the effect of learning an initially unknown classical state through Bayesian inference. Here we demonstrate the existence of a sharp learning transition for the two-dimensional classical Ising model, all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques. Our results can be extended to study the more general effects of learning on both classical and quantum states.</description>

      <title>Optimizing low-dissipation Carnot-like thermal devices with heat leak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delimiting the bounds of optimal performance for heat engines (HEs), refrigerators (REs), and heat pumps (HPs) is a central goal in thermodynamics. While low-dissipation (LD) models have proven valuable for this purpose, the role of heat leak in such models has received limited attention. Here, we present a unified framework for LD Carnot-like (CL) HEs, REs, and HPs that incorporates heat leaks, and derive new results for the efficiency at maximum power and the power at maximum efficiency. We further investigate the relationship between the bounds of power at fixed efficiency and efficiency at fixed power, demonstrating that these bounds coincide and are described by identical curves across all thermal devices. Finally, we show that the optimal performance of all three devices can be achieved by optimizing the average entropy production rate over the cycle, a result that holds for any CL device and extends beyond the LD assumption.</description>

      <title>Work Statistics and Quantum Trajectories: No-Click Limit and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generalized framework for quantum work statistics in continuously monitored quantum systems that extends the conventional two-point measurement scheme to include the effects of multiple generalized measurements and post-selection of no-click trajectories. By deriving a modified generating function for work, our approach naturally incorporates non-Hermitian dynamics arising from quantum jump processes and reveals deviations from the standard Jarzynski equality due to measurement-induced asymmetries. We illustrate our theoretical framework by analyzing a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model under local spin monitoring. In this model, increased measurement strength projects the system onto the no-click state, leading to a suppression of energy fluctuations and measurement-induced energy saturation, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect.</description>

      <title>Causality, localisation, and universality of monitored quantum walks with long-range hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum resetting protocols can speed up the time in which a quantum walker reaches a target site on a lattice. In these setups, a detector monitors the target site and the walker motion is restarted if the detector has not clicked after a fixed time interval. The optimal resetting rate can be extracted from the time evolution of the probability $S(t)$ that the detector has not clicked up to time $t$. We analyse $S(t)$ for a quantum walk in a one-dimensional lattice when the coupling between sites decays algebraically as $d^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $d$, for $\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. At long-times, $S(t)$ decays with a universal power-law exponent that is independent of $\alpha$. At short times, $S(t)$ exhibits a plethora of phase transitions as a function of $\alpha$. These lead to the identification of two main regimes for the optimal resetting rate. For $\alpha&gt;1$, the resetting rate $r$ is bounded from below by the velocity with which information propagates causally across the lattice. For $\alpha&lt;1$, instead, the long-range hopping tends to localise the walker: The optimal resetting rate depends on the size of the lattice and diverges as $\alpha\to 0$. We derive simple models reproducing the numerical results, shedding light on the interplay of long-range coherent dynamics, symmetries, and local quantum measurement processes in determining equilibrium. Our predictions can be verified in existing experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Strong ergodicity breaking in dynamical mean-field equations for mixed p-spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analytical solution to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin glasses has profoundly shaped our understanding of glassy dynamics, which take place in many diverse physical systems. In particular, the idea that during the aging dynamics, the evolution becomes slower and slower, but keeps wandering in an unbounded space (a manifold of marginal states), thus forgetting any previously found configuration, has been one of the key hypotheses to achieve an analytical solution. This hypothesis, called weak ergodicity breaking, has recently been questioned by numerical simulations and attempts to solve the dynamical mean-field equations (DMFE). In this work, we introduce a new integration scheme for solving DMFE that allows us to reach very large integration times, $t=O(10^6)$, in the solution of the spherical (3+4)-spin model, quenched from close to the mode coupling temperature down to zero temperature. Thanks to this new solution, we can provide solid evidence for strong ergodicity breaking in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics on mixed p-spin glass models. Our solution to the DMFE shows that the out-of-equilibrium dynamics undergo aging, but in a restricted space: the initial condition is never forgotten, and the dynamics takes place closer and closer to configurations reached at later times. During this new restricted aging dynamics, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is richer than expected.</description>

      <title>Universal work extraction in quantum thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the maximum amount of work extractable from a nanoscale quantum system is one of the central problems in quantum thermodynamics. Previous works identified the free energy of the input state as the optimal rate of extractable work under the crucial assumption: experimenters know the description of the given quantum state, which restricts the applicability to significantly limited settings. Here, we show that this optimal extractable work can be achieved without knowing the input states at all, removing the aforementioned fundamental operational restrictions. We achieve this by presenting a universal work extraction protocol, whose description does not depend on input states but nevertheless extracts work quantified by the free energy of the unknown input state. Remarkably, our result partially encompasses the case of infinite-dimensional systems, for which optimal extractable work has not been known even for the standard state-aware setting. Our results clarify that, in spite of the crucial difference between the state-aware and state-agnostic scenarios in accomplishing information-theoretic tasks, whether we are in possession of information on the given state does not influence the optimal performance of the asymptotic work extraction.</description>

      <title>Resonances in reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high dimensions, reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with inexact reflections exhibits slow mixing when the particle ensemble is initialised from a Dirac delta distribution and the uniform distribution is targeted. By quantifying the instantaneous non-uniformity of the distribution with the Sinkhorn divergence, we elucidate the principal mechanisms underlying the mixing problems. In spheres and cubes, we show that the collective motion transitions between fluid-like and discretisation-dominated behaviour, with the critical step size scaling as a power law in the dimension. In both regimes, the particles can spontaneously unmix, leading to resonances in the particle density and the aforementioned problems. Additionally, low-dimensional toy models of the dynamics are constructed which reproduce the dominant features of the high-dimensional problem. Finally, the dynamics is contrasted with the exact Hamiltonian particle flow and tuning practices are discussed.</description>

      <title>Finding periodic orbits in projected quantum many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing general quantum many-body dynamics is a challenging task due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size. The time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) provides a powerful tool to tackle this task by projecting quantum evolution onto a classical dynamical system within a variational manifold. In classical systems, periodic orbits play a crucial role in understanding the structure of the phase space and the long-term behavior of the system. However, finding periodic orbits is generally difficult, and their existence and properties in generic TDVP dynamics over matrix product states have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we develop an algorithm to systematically identify and characterize periodic orbits in TDVP dynamics. Applying our method to the periodically kicked Ising model, we uncover both stable and unstable periodic orbits. We characterize the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser tori in the vicinity of stable periodic orbits and track the change of the periodic orbits as we modify the Hamiltonian parameters. We observe that periodic orbits exist at any value of the coupling constant between prethermal and fully thermalizing regimes, but their relevance to quantum dynamics and imprint on quantum eigenstates diminishes as the system leaves the prethermal regime. Our results demonstrate that periodic orbits provide valuable insights into the TDVP approximation of quantum many-body evolution and establish a closer connection between quantum and classical chaos.</description>

Abstract: The dimensionality of kernels for Lindbladian superoperators is of physical interest in various scenarios out of equilibrium, for example in mean-field methods for driven-dissipative spin lattice models that give rise to phase diagrams with a multitude of non-equilibrium stationary states in specific parameter regions. We show that known criteria established in the literature for unique fixpoints of the Lindblad master equation can be better treated in a graph-theoretic framework via a focus on the connectivity of directed graphs associated to the Hamiltonian and jump operators.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Force Fields via Rotational Entropy Corrections to Free Energy Landscapes of Diffusing Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of accurate interatomic potentials, and related fields of forces, from equilibrium conformational distributions of molecules is a crucial step in coarse-grained modeling. In this work we show that in order to develop accurate lab-frame force fields that preserve translational and rotational diffusion of a molecule, the observed body-fixed free energy landscape must be corrected for conformation-dependent rotational entropy to isolate the potential energy surface. We further demonstrate that even when the instantaneous effects of the correction are small, the resulting lagged correlations of the modeled force can be greatly altered and hence the correction is especially vital when parameterizing friction coefficients using modeled interatomic potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary criticality in 2D interacting topological insulators. Using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we present the first nonperturbative study of the boundary quantum phase diagram in the Kane-Mele-Hubbard-Rashba model. Our results reveal rich boundary critical phenomena at the quantum phase transition between a topological insulator and an antiferromagnetic insulator, encompassing ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. Combining analytical derivation of the boundary theory with unbiased numerically-exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of topological edge states enriches the ordinary transition that renders a continuous boundary scaling dimension and, more intriguingly, leads to a special transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. Our work establishes a novel framework for the nonperturbative study of boundary criticality in two-dimensional topological systems with strong electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Rare-Event-Induced Ergodicity Breaking in Logarithmic Aging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ergodicity breaking and aging effects are fundamental challenges in out-of-equilibrium systems. Various mechanisms have been proposed to understand the non-ergodic and aging phenomena, possibly related to observations in systems ranging from structural glass and Anderson glasses to biological systems and mechanical systems. While anomalous diffusion described by Levy statistics efficiently captures ergodicity breaking, the origin of aging and ergodicity breaking in systems with ultraslow dynamics remain unclear. Here, we report a novel mechanism of ergodicity breaking in systems exhibiting log-aging diffusion. This mechanism, characterized by increasingly infrequent rare events with aging, yields statistics deviating significantly from Levy distribution, breaking ergodicity as shown by unequal time- and ensemble-averaged mean squared displacements and two distinct asymptotic probability distribution functions. Notably, although these rare events contribute negligibly to statistical averages, they dramatically change the system's characteristic time. This work lays the groundwork for microscopic understanding of out-of-equilibrium systems and provides new perspectives on glasses and Griffiths-McCoy singularities.</description>

      <title>Topologically Directed Simulations Reveal the Impact of Geometric Constraints on Knotted Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of knotting and unknotting in polymers or other filaments rely on random processes to facilitate topological changes. Here we introduce a method of \textit{topological steering} to determine the optimal pathway by which a filament may knot or unknot while subject to a given set of physics. The method involves measuring the knotoid spectrum of a space curve projected onto many surfaces and computing the mean unravelling number of those projections. Several perturbations of a curve can be generated stochastically, e.g. using the Langevin equation or crankshaft moves, and a gradient can be followed that maximises or minimises the topological complexity. We apply this method to a polymer model based on a growing self-avoiding tangent-sphere chain, which can be made to model proteins by imposing a constraint that the bending and twisting angles between successive spheres must maintain the distribution found in naturally occurring protein structures. We show that without these protein-like geometric constraints, topologically optimised polymers typically form alternating torus knots and composites thereof, similar to the stochastic knots predicted for long DNA. However, when the geometric constraints are imposed on the system, the frequency of twist knots increases, similar to the observed abundance of twist knots in protein structures.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic states and operations: a generalized resource theory of coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we focus on the concept of macroscopic states, i.e. coarse representations of microscopic details, defined as states that can be inferred solely from the outcomes of macroscopic measurements. Building on the theories of quantum statistical sufficiency and quantum Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through several equivalent formulations, ranging from algebraic to explicitly constructive. We introduce a hierarchy of macroscopicity-non-decreasing operations and develop a resource theory of microscopicity that unifies and generalizes existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, purity, and asymmetry. Finally, we introduce the concept of inferential reference frames and reinterpret macroscopic entropy as a measure of inferential asymmetry, i.e., irretrodictability.</description>

      <title>Competing Bosonic Reactions: Insight from Exactly Solvable Time-Dependent Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the progress on exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models from a perspective of their application to competing reactions of particle creation from a false vacuum. Such models generally predict that, even with identical initial conditions, and for nearly the same other particle parameters, a quantum coherent evolution results in a final particle distribution with significant asymmetry. We use an exact solution of the driven bosonic Tavis-Cummings model for two reaction pathways in order to quantify this effect, reveal a corresponding phase transition, and identify its universality class.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics model for Clifford random tensor networks and monitored quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.02988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an exact mapping of Clifford (stabilizer) random tensor networks (RTNs) and monitored quantum circuits, onto a statistical mechanics model. With Haar unitaries, the fundamental degrees of freedom ('spins') are permutations because all operators commuting with the action of the unitaries on a tensor product arise from permutations of the tensor factors ('Schur-Weyl duality'). For unitaries restricted to the smaller Clifford group, the set of commuting operators, the 'commutant', forming the new 'spin' degrees of freedom, will be larger. We use the recent full characterization of this commutant by Gross et al., Comm. Math. Phys. 385, 1325 (2021), to construct the Clifford statistical mechanics models for on-site Hilbert space dimensions which are powers of a prime number $p$. We show that the Boltzmann weights are invariant under a symmetry group involving orthogonal matrices with entries in the finite number field ${\bf F}_p$. This implies that the symmetry group, and consequently all universal properties of entanglement transitions in Clifford circuits and RTNs will in general depend on, and only on the prime $p$. We show that Clifford monitored circuits with on-site Hilbert space dimension $d=p^M$ are described by percolation in the limits $d \to \infty$ at (a) $p=$ fixed but $M\to \infty$, and at (b) $M= 1$ but $p \to \infty$. In the limit (a) we calculate the effective central charge, and in the limit (b) we derive the following universal minimal cut entanglement entropy $S_A =(\sqrt{3}/\pi)\ln p \ln L_A$ for $d=p$ large at the transition. We verify those predictions numerically, and present extensive numerical results for critical exponents at the transition in monitored Clifford circuits for prime number on-site Hilbert space dimension $d=p$ for a variety of different values of $p$, and find that they approach percolation values at large $p$.</description>

      <title>Scaling theory for the collapse of a trapped Bose gas in a synthetic magnetic field: a critical study at the condensation point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have analytically explored both the zero temperature and the finite temperature scaling theory for the collapse of an attractively interacting 3-D harmonically trapped Bose gas in a synthetic magnetic field. We have considered short-ranged (contact) attractive inter-particle interactions and Hartree-Fock approximation for the same. We have separately studied the collapse of both the condensate and the thermal cloud below and above the condensation point, respectively. We have obtained an anisotropy, artificial magnetic field, and temperature-dependent critical number of particles for the collapse of the condensate. We have found a dramatic change in the critical exponent (from $\alpha=1$ to $0$) of the specific heat ($C_v\propto|T-T_c|^{\alpha}$) when the thermal cloud is about to collapse with the critical number of particles ($N=N_c$) just below and above the condensation point. All the results obtained by us below and around the condensation point are experimentally testable within the present-day experimental set-up for the ultracold systems in the magneto-optical traps.</description>

      <title>Speedups in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation: Mpemba and related effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of our intuition about the behavior of physical systems is shaped by observations at or near thermal equilibrium. However, even a thermal quench can lead to states far from thermal equilibrium, where counterintuitive, anomalous effects can occur. A prime example of anomalous thermal relaxation is the Mpemba effect, in which a system prepared at a hot temperature cools down to the temperature of the cold environment faster than an identical system prepared at a warm temperature. Although reported for water more than 2000 years ago by Aristotle, the recent observations of analogous relaxation speedups in a variety of systems have motivated the search for general explanations. We review anomalous relaxation effects, which all share a nonmonotonic dependence of relaxation time versus initial ``distance" from the final state or from the phase transition. The final state can be an equilibrium or a nonequilibrium steady state. We first review the water experiments and classify the anomalous relaxation phenomena related to the Mpemba effect. We then provide a modern definition of the Mpemba effect, focusing on the theoretical frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, kinetic theory, Markovian dynamics, and phase transitions. We discuss the recent experimental and numerical developments that followed these theoretical advances. These developments paved the way for the prediction and observation of novel phenomena, such as the inverse Mpemba effect. The review is self-contained and introduces anomalous relaxation phenomena in single- and many-body systems, both classical and quantum. We also discuss the broader relevance of the Mpemba effect, including its relation with phase transitions and its experimental implications. We end with perspectives that connect anomalous speedups to ideas for designing optimal heating/cooling protocols, heat engines, and efficient samplers.</description>

      <title>Mining higher-order triadic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical model that demonstrates that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical state of two linked nodes. Leveraging this result, we propose the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions that are often ignored, yet can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.</description>

      <title>Simulating the anharmonic phonon spectrum in critical systems: self-consistent phonons and temperature-dependent effective potential methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and simulating the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of materials affected by strong ionic anharmonicity is a central challenge in material science. Much interest is in material displaying critical displacive behaviour, such as near a ferroelectric transition, charge-density waves, or in general displacive second-order transitions. In these cases, molecular dynamics suffer from a critical slowdown and emergent long-range fluctuations of the order parameter. Two prominent methods have emerged to solve this issue: Self-consistent renormalization of the phonons like the Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) and Self-Consistent Phonons (SCP), and methods that fit the potential energy landscape from short molecular dynamics trajectories, like the Temperature-Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP). Despite their widespread use, the limitations of these methods are often overlooked in the proximity of critical points.
  Here, we establish a guiding rule set for the accuracy of each method on critical quantities: free energy for computing the phase diagrams, static correlation functions for inferring phase stability and critical behaviours, and dynamic correlation functions for vibrational spectra and thermal transport. Also, a new TDEP implementation is introduced to fix the calculation of dynamical spectra, restoring the correct perturbative limit violated by the standard TDEP approach.
  Results are benchmarked both against an exact one-dimensional anharmonic potential and two prototypical anharmonic crystals: the ferroelectric PbTe and the metal-halide perovskite CsSnI3.</description>

      <title>Complex symmetric, self-dual, and Ginibre random matrices: Analytical results for three classes of bulk and edge statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a conjecture about the local bulk statistics of complex eigenvalues has been made based on numerics. It claims that there are only three universality classes, which have all been observed in open chaotic quantum systems. Motivated by these new insights, we compute and compare the expectation values of $k$ pairs of complex conjugate characteristic polynomials in three ensembles of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices representative for the three classes: the well-known complex Ginibre ensemble, complex symmetric and complex self-dual matrices. In the Cartan classification scheme of non-Hermitian random matrices they are labelled as class A, AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$, respectively. Using the technique of Grassmann variables, we derive explicit expressions for a single pair of expected characteristic polynomials for finite as well as infinite matrix dimension. For the latter we consider the global limit as well as zoom into the edge and the bulk of the spectrum, providing new analytical results for classes AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$. For general $k$, we derive the effective Lagrangians corresponding to the non-linear $\sigma$-models in the respective physical systems. Interestingly, they agree for all three ensembles, while the corresponding Goldstone manifolds, over which one has to perform the remaining integrations, are different and equal the three classical compact groups in the bulk. In particular, our analytical results show that these three ensembles have indeed different local bulk and edge spectral statistics, corroborating the conjecture further.</description>

      <title>Transfer matrix approach to quantum systems subject to certain Lindblad evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving for the time evolution of a many particle system whose dynamics is governed by Lindblad equation is hard. We extend the use of the transfer matrix approach to a class of Lindblad equations that admit a closed hierarchy of two point correlators. An example that we treat is the XX spin chain, i.e., free fermions, subject to the local on-site dephasing, but can be extended to other Hermitian dissipators, e.g., non-local dephasing. We find a simple expression of the Green's function in the Laplace domain. The method can be used to get analytical results in the thermodynamic limit, for instance, to get the evolution of the magnetization density and to explicitly see the crossover between ballistic and diffusive behavior, or to show that the correlations between operators at distance $l$ decay with time as $1/t^{\lceil l/2 \rceil+1/2}$. It also provides a fast numerical method to determine the evolution of the density with a complexity scaling with the system size more favorably than in previous methods, easily allowing one to study systems with $\sim 10^6$ spins.</description>

      <title>High-entropy Advantage in Neural Networks' Generalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the central challenges in modern machine learning is understanding how neural networks generalize knowledge learned from training data to unseen test data. While numerous empirical techniques have been proposed to improve generalization, a theoretical understanding of the mechanism of generalization remains elusive. Here we introduce the concept of Boltzmann entropy into neural networks by re-conceptualizing such networks as hypothetical molecular systems where weights and biases are atomic coordinates, and the loss function is the potential energy. By employing molecular simulation algorithms, we compute entropy landscapes as functions of both training loss and test accuracy (or test loss), on networks with up to 1 million parameters, across four distinct machine learning tasks: arithmetic question, real-world tabular data, image recognition, and language modeling. Our results reveal the existence of high-entropy advantage, wherein high-entropy network states generally outperform those reached via conventional training techniques like stochastic gradient descent. This entropy advantage provides a thermodynamic explanation for neural network generalizability: the generalizable states occupy a larger part of the parameter space than its non-generalizable analog at low train loss. Furthermore, we find this advantage more pronounced in narrower neural networks, indicating a need for different training optimizers tailored to different sizes of networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reconsider the dynamics of localized states in the deterministic and stochastic discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Localized initial conditions disperse if the strength of the nonlinear part drops below a threshold. Localized states are unstable in a noisy environment. As expected, an infinite temperature state emerges when multiplicative noise is applied, while additive noise yields unbounded dynamics since conservation of normalization is violated.</description>
