      <title>Quantum Transport Theory of Strongly Correlated Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report reviews recent progress in computing Kubo formulas for general interacting Hamiltonians. The aim is to calculate electric and thermal magneto-conductivities in strong scattering regimes where Boltzmann equation and Hall conductivity proxies exceed their validity. Three primary approaches are explained.
  1. Degeneracy-projected polarization formulas for Hall-type conductivities, which substantially reduce the number of calculated current matrix elements. These expressions generalize the Berry curvature integral formulas to imperfect lattices. 2. Continued fraction representation of dynamical longitudinal conductivities. The calculations produce a set of thermodynamic averages, which can be controllably extrapolated using their mathematical relations to low and high frequency conductivity asymptotics. 3. Hall-type coefficients summation formulas, which are constructed from thermodynamic averages.
  The thermodynamic formulas are derived in the operator Hilbert space formalism, which avoids the opacity and high computational cost of the Hamiltonian eigenspectrum. The coefficients can be obtained by well established imaginary-time Monte Carlo sampling, high temperature expansion, traces of operator products, and variational wavefunctions at low temperatures. We demonstrate the power of approaches 1--3 by their application to well known models of lattice electrons and bosons. The calculations clarify the far-reaching influence of strong local interactions on the metallic transport near Mott insulators. Future directions for these approaches are discussed.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Disorder Operator and Entanglement Entropy at Easy-Plane Deconfined Quantum Criticalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the scaling behavior of the disorder operator and the entanglement entropy (EE) of the easy-plane JQ (EPJQ) model at its transition between the antiferromagnetic XY ordered phase (AFXY) and the valence bond solid (VBS) phase. We find $\mathbf{(1)}$ there exists a finite value of the order parameters at the AFXY-VBS phase transition points of the EPJQ model, and the finite order parameter is strengthened as anisotropy $\Delta$ varies from the Heisenberg limit ($\Delta=1$) to the easy-plane limit ($\Delta=0$); $\mathbf{(2)}$ Both EE and disorder operator with smooth boundary cut exhibit anomalous scaling behavior at the transition points, resembling the scaling inside the Goldstone model phase, and the anomalous scaling becomes strengthened as the transition becomes more first order; $\mathbf{(3)}$ First put forward in Ref. [arXiv:2401.12838], with the finite-size corrections in EE for Goldstone phase is properly considered in the fitting form, the anomalous scaling behavior of EE can be adapted with emergent SO(5) symmetry breaking at the Heisenberg limit ($\Delta=1$). We extend this method in the EPJQ model and observe similar results, which may indicate emergent SO(4) symmetry breaking in the easy-plane regime ($\Delta&lt;1$) or emergent SO(5) symmetry breaking in the Heisenberg limit ($\Delta=1$). These observations provide evidence that the N\'eel-VBS transition in the JQ model setting evolves from weak to prominent first-order transition as the system becomes anisotropic, and the non-local probes such as EE and disorder operator, serve as the sensitive tool to detect such salient yet fundamental features.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Scalings of Quantum Entropies in Long-Range Heisenberg Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, building on state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we perform systematic finite-size scaling of both entanglement and participation entropies for long-range Heisenberg chain with unfrustrated power-law decaying interactions. We find distinctive scaling behaviors for both quantum entropies in the various regimes explored by tuning the decay exponent $\alpha$, thus capturing non-trivial features through logarithmic terms, beyond the case of linear Nambu-Goldstone modes. Our systematic analysis reveals that the quantum entanglement information, hidden in the scaling of the two studied entropies, can be obtained to the same level of order parameters and other usual finite-size observables of quantum many-body lattice models. The analysis and results obtained here can readily apply to more quantum criticalities in 1D and 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Splitting of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman density wave and the nature of chiral gravitons in fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental manifestation of the nontrivial correlations of an incompressible fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state is that an electron added to it disintegrates into more elementary particles, namely fractionally-charged composite fermions (CFs). We show here that the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) density-wave excitation of the $\nu{=}n/(2pn{\pm }1)$ FQH states also splits into more elementary single CF excitons. In particular, the GMP graviton, which refers to the recently observed spin-2 neutral excitation in the vanishing wave vector limit [Liang et al., Nature 628, 78 (2024)], remains undivided for $\nu{=}n/(2n{\pm} 1)$ but splits into two gravitons at $\nu{=}n/(4n{\pm} 1)$ with $n{&gt;}1$. A detailed experimental confirmation of the many observable consequences of the splitting of the GMP mode should provide a unique window into the correlations underlying the FQH effect.</description>

      <title>SO($N$) singlet-projection model on the pyrochlore lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extensive quantum Monte Carlo study of a nearest-neighbor, singlet-projection model on the pyrochlore lattice that exhibits SO($N$) symmetry and is sign-problem-free. We find that in contrast to the previously studied two-dimensional variations of this model that harbor critical points between their ground state phases, the non-bipartite pyrochlore lattice in three spatial dimensions appears to exhibit a first-order transition between a magnetically-ordered phase and some, as yet uncharacterized, paramagnetic phase. We also observe that the magnetically-ordered phase survives to a relatively large value of $N=8$, and that it is gone for $N=9$.</description>

      <title>Magnetization without spin: effective Lagrangian of itinerant electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective Lagrangian of itinerant electron system of finite density at finite magnetic field is found to include Chern-Simons term of electromagnetic potentials of lower scale dimension than those studied before. This term has an origin in many-body wave function and unique topological property that is independent of a spin degree of freedom. The coupling strength is proportional to $\frac{\rho}{eB}$, which is singular at $B=0$ for a constant charge density. The effective Lagrangian at a finite $B$ represents physical effects at $ B \neq 0$ properly. A universal shift of the magnetic field known as Slater-Pauling curve is derived from the effective Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Correlated states controlled by tunable van Hove singularity in moir\'e WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors have emerged as a highly tunable system for the studies of correlated and topological states of matter, such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism, correlated insulators, and topological and Chern insulators. However, the connection between these symmetry-breaking ground states and the underlying band structure singularity in these materials remains largely unexplored. Here, by combining exciton sensing and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) measurements, we demonstrate how the magnetic properties and the correlated insulating states are controlled by the gate tunable van Hove singularity (VHS) in the band structure of twisted bilayer WSe2 (tWSe2). In particular, we demonstrate how the location of the VHS in the tWSe2 band structure can influence 1) the stability of Stoner ferromagnetism, 2) the valley polarizability and the stability of Chern insulators, as well as 3) the layer polarizability and the associated metal-insulator transition. The results are supported by continuum model band structure calculations. Our work highlights an important ingredient for understanding the electronic phase diagram in twisted bilayer TMDs.</description>

      <title>Strength of Kitaev Interaction in Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ and Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kitaev spin liquid is proposed to be promisingly realized in low spin-orbit coupling $3d$ systems, represented by Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ and Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$. However, the existence of Kitaev interaction is still debatable among experiments, and obtaining the strength of Kitaev interaction from first-principles calculations is also challenging. Here, we report the state-dependent anisotropy of Kitaev interaction, based on which a convenient method is developed to rapidly determine the strength of Kitaev interaction. Applying such method and density functional theory calculations, it is found that Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ with $3d^7$ configuration exhibits considerable ferromagnetic Kitaev interaction. Moreover, by further applying the symmetry-adapted cluster expansion method, a realistic spin model is determined for Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$ with $3d^8$ configuration. Such model indicates negligible small Kitaev interaction, but it predicts many properties, such as ground states and field effects, which are well consistent with measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the heavy elements, Sb or Bi, located at the hollow sites of honeycomb lattice, do not contribute to emergence of Kitaev interaction through proximity, contradictory to common belief. The presently developed anisotropy method will be beneficial not only for computations but also for measurements.</description>

      <title>Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices -- Metal-insulator transitions, global antiferromagnetism and enhanced boundary fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hubbard and Heisenberg models on hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions by means of mean-field approximations, spin-wave theory and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. For the Hubbard model we use the auxiliary-field approach and for Heisenberg systems the stochastic series expansion algorithm. We concentrate on bipartite lattices where the QMC simulations are free of the negative sign problem. The considered lattices are characterized by a Dirac like density of states, Schl\"afli indices $\{p,q\}=\{10,3\}$ and $\{8,3\}$, as well as by flat bands, $\{8,8\}$. The Dirac density of states cuts off the logarithmic divergence of the staggered spin susceptibility and allows for a finite $U$ semi-metal to insulator transition. This transition has the same mean-field exponents as for the Euclidean counterpart. In the presence of flat bands we observe the onset of magnetic ordering at any finite $U$. The magnetic state at intermediate coupling can be described as a global antiferromagnet. It breaks the $C_p$ rotational and time reversal symmetries but remains invariant under combined $C_p \mathcal{T}$ transformations. The state is characterized by macroscopic ferromagnetic moments, that globally cancel. We observe that fluctuations on the boundary of the system are greatly enhanced: while spin wave calculations predict the breakdown of antiferromagnetism on the boundary but not in the bulk, QMC simulations show a marked reduction of the staggered moment on the edge of the system.</description>

      <title>Global fermionic mode optimization via swap gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general approach to find an optimal representation of a quantum many body wave function for a given error margin via global fermionic mode optimization. The stationary point on a fixed rank matrix product state manifold is obtained via a joint optimization on the Grassman manifold [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 210402] together with swap gates controlled permutations. The minimization of the global quantity, the block entropy area, guarantees that the method fulfills all criteria with respect to partial derivatives. Numerical results via large scale density matrix renormalization group simulations on strongly correlated molecular systems and two-dimensional fermionic lattice models are discussed.</description>

      <title>Pairing susceptibility in the multi-layer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the interaction, doping, and layer dependence of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing susceptibility of the Hubbard model for a stacked 2D square lattice. We perform a multi-index perturbative expansion up to fourth-order to obtain coefficients in powers of the Hubbard $U$, the inter-layer $V$, and the pair-hopping $J$ interactions. We evaluate the vertex diagrams that contribute to the pairing susceptibility for $\ell= 2,3, 4$ layered models in the U-V-J interaction space. This provides unprecedented access to the pairing amplitudes, allowing us to identify the processes that enhance or reduce pairing. We distinguish pairing within the diagonal channel, $P^{\parallel}_{d}$, and off-diagonal channel, $P^{\perp}_{d}$, and find that, in the absence of $J$, the qualitative behavior of the layered system is equivalent to the single-layer model. In the presence of $J$, we show that pairing is enhanced sublinearly with increasing $\ell$ and is primarily mediated by the $P^{\perp}_{d}$ component and find which coefficients and diagram sets are responsible. Finally, we construct a generalized $\ell$-dependent equation for the d-wave pair susceptibility to speculate pairing beyond $\ell=4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that sublattice-polarized states (SLPSs) appear ubiquitously on the common lattices. We first establish the destructive-interference scenario for the SLPSs, which is further systematized by a point-group-symmetry interpretation. The examples on common one-, two-, and three-dimensional lattices are then demonstrated. We also deduce the symmetry-protected robustness of SLPSs against further-neighbor hoppings. Moreover, the destructive-interference scenario can be generalized to the multi-SLP. The important effects on interaction-driven phases are briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), in which two sheets of monolayer graphene are precisely stacked to a specific angle, has opened up a plethora of new opportunities in the field of topology, superconductivity, and other strongly correlated effects. Most conventional ways of preparing twisted bilayer devices require the use of high process temperatures and solvents and are not well-suited for preparing samples which need to be flipped to be compatible with characterization techniques like STM, ARPES, PFM, SThM etc. Here, we demonstrate a very simple polymer-based method using Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), which can be used for making flipped twisted bilayer graphene devices. This allowed us to produce flipped twisted samples without the need of any solvents and with high quality as confirmed by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy. We believe that this dry flip technique can be readily extended to twist 2D materials beyond graphene, especially air-sensitive materials which require operation under inert atmosphere, where often solvents cannot be used.</description>

      <title>Shaping the topology of twisted bilayer graphene via time-reversal symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking is an effective tool for tuning the transport and topological properties of 2D layered materials. Among these materials, twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has emerged as a promising platform for new physics, characterized by a rich interplay between topological features and strongly correlated electronic behavior. In this study, we utilize time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) to manipulate the topological properties of TBG. By varying the strength of TRSB, we discover a topological phase transition between a topological insulating phase, which exhibits a pair of flat bands with opposite Chern numbers, and a novel insulating state where the Chern number, but not the Berry curvature, of the flat bands vanishes. We demonstrate that this topological transition is mediated by a gap closing at the $\Gamma$ point, and we construct a three-dimensional phase diagram as a function of the twisting angle, the symmetry-breaking parameter, and the mismatch coupling between AA and AB stacking regions. Finally, we show that this novel electronic phase can be identified in the lab by measuring, as a function of the Fermi energy, its non-quantized anomalous Hall conductivity that is induced by the Berry dipole density of the lowest flat bands.</description>

      <title>Electric-field-induced magnetic toroidal moment in a time-reversal-odd antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, antiferromagnets with broken time-reversal (T) symmetry have been found to exhibit ferromagnet-like behaviors (e.g., anomalous Hall effect) despite the absence of net magnetization. However, antiferromagnets characterized by T-odd scalar quantities are expected to exhibit unique properties different from the ferromagnet-like behavior. One such example is the diagonal electrotoroidic (ET) effect, in which the application of an electric field E induces a magnetic toroidal moment, an ordered arrangement of magnetic vortices, in the direction parallel to E. Herein, we report the observation of the diagonal ET effect probed by E-induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism in Co2SiO4 holding a T-odd scalar quantity, magnetic toroidal monopole. Using the ET effect, a pair of domain states related to one another by the T operation is spatially resolved. Furthermore, we reveal the inversion of the domain pattern by a magnetic field, which is explained by trilinear coupling ascribed to the piezomagnetic effect. Our observation of the diagonal ET effect paves the way for the exploration of unique functionalities of T-odd antiferromagnets.</description>

Abstract: Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) is a unique technique to probe the local density of states (LDOS) at the atomic scale by measuring the tunneling conductance between a sharp tip and a sample surface. However, the technique suffers of well-known limitations, the so-called set-point effect, which can potentially introduce artifacts in the measurements. We compare several STS imaging schemes applied to the LDOS modulations of the charge density wave state on atomically flat surfaces, and demonstrate that only constant-height STS is capable of mapping the intrinsic LDOS. In the constant-current STS, commonly used and easier-to-implement, the tip-sample distance variations imposed by the feedback loop result in set-point-dependent STS images and possibly mislead the identification of the CDW gap edges.</description>

      <title>Determination of Optimal Chain Coupling made by Embedding in D-Wave Quantum Annealer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The qubits in a D-wave quantum annealer (D-wave QA) are designed on a Pegasus graph that is different from structure of a combinatorial optimization problem. This situation requires embedding with the chains connected by ferromagnetic (FM) coupling $J_c$ between the qubits. Weak and strong $J_c$ values induce chain breaking and enforcement of chain energy, which reduce the accuracy of quantum annealing (QA) measurements, respectively. In addition, we confirmed that even though the D-Wave Ocean package provides a default coupling $J_c^{\text{default}}$, it is not an optimal coupling $J_c^{\text{optimal}}$ that maximizes the possible correct rate of QA measurements. In this paper, we present an algorithm how $J_c^{\text{optimal}}$ with the maximum probability $p$ for observing the possible lowest energy is determined. Finally, we confirm that the extracted $J_c^{\text{optimal}}$ show much better $p$ than $J_c^{\text{default}}$ in QA measurements of various parameters of frustrated and fully connected combinatorial optimization problems. The open code is available in \textit{https://github.com/HunpyoLee/OptimizeChainStrength}.</description>

      <title>Computational Supremacy of Quantum Eigensolver by Extension of Optimized Binary Configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a quantum eigensolver (QE) which is based on an extension of optimized binary configurations measured by quantum annealing (QA) on a D-Wave Quantum Annealer (D-Wave QA). This approach performs iterative QA measurements to optimize the eigenstates $\vert \psi \rangle$ without the derivation of a classical computer. The computational cost is $\eta M L$ for full eigenvalues $E$ and $\vert \psi \rangle$ of the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ of size $L \times L$, where $M$ and $\eta$ are the number of QA measurements required to reach the converged $\vert \psi \rangle$ and the total annealing time of many QA shots, respectively. Unlike the exact diagonalized (ED) algorithm with $L^3$ iterations on a classical computer, the computation cost is not significantly affected by $L$ and $M$ because $\eta$ represents a very short time within $10^{-2}$ seconds on the D-Wave QA. We selected the tight-binding $\hat{H}$ that contains the exact $E$ values of all energy states in two systems with metallic and insulating phases. We confirmed that the proposed QE algorithm provides exact solutions within the errors of $5 \times 10^{-3}$. The QE algorithm will not only show computational supremacy over the ED approach on a classical computer but will also be widely used for various applications such as material and drug design.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic fragments in periodic solids: Eliminating the need for supercells and background charges in electronic structure calculations of defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date, computational methods for modeling defects (vacancies, adsorbates, etc.) rely on periodic supercells in which the defect is far enough from its repeated image such that they can be assumed non-interacting. Defects in real solids, however, can be spaced microns or more apart, whereas affordable supercells for density functional theory calculations are no wider than a few nanometers. The relative proximity and periodic repetition of the defect's images may lead to unphysical artifacts, especially if the defect is charged and/or open-shell. Furthermore, to avoid divergence of the periodic electrostatics, a compensating background charge must be introduced if the defect is charged. Even if post-hoc corrections are used, this is a source of unquantifiable error and, in some cases, renders energies useless. In this communication, we introduce an embedding formalism such that a pristine, primitive unit cell may be used for the periodic mean field, after which atoms may be moved or charged within an embedded fragment. This fragment can then be treated with a post-Hartree Fock method to capture important electron correlations pertaining to the defect. By eliminating the need for compensating background charges and periodicity of the defect, we circumvent all associated unphysicalities and numerical issues. Furthermore, the primitive cell calculations drastically reduce computational expense compared to supercell approaches. This method is size-intensive with respect to energy differences and can be routinely applied even to multireference defects, localized excited states, etc. using a variety of fragment solvers. In examining with this approach bond-breaking in a fluorine-substituted graphane monolayer, a difficult testing ground for condensed-phase electronic structure methods, we observe key aspects of the dissociation pathway, specifically a covalent-to-ionic avoided crossing.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in twisted bilayer and twisted trilayer graphene has generated tremendous interest. The key feature of these systems is an interplay between interlayer coupling and a moir\'e superlattice that gives rise to low-energy flat bands with strong correlations. Flat bands can also be induced by moir\'e patterns in lattice-mismatched and or twisted heterostructures of other two-dimensional materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Although a wide range of correlated phenomenon have indeed been observed in the moir\'e TMDs, robust demonstration of superconductivity has remained absent. Here we report superconductivity in 5 degree twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ (tWSe$_2$) with a maximum critical temperature of 426 mK. The superconducting state appears in a limited region of displacement field and density that is adjacent to a metallic state with Fermi surface reconstruction believed to arise from antiferromagnetic order. A sharp boundary is observed between the superconducting and magnetic phases at low temperature, reminiscent of spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity. Our results establish that moir\'e flat-band superconductivity extends beyond graphene structures. Material properties that are absent in graphene but intrinsic among the TMDs such as a native band gap, large spin-orbit coupling, spin-valley locking, and magnetism offer the possibility to access a broader superconducting parameter space than graphene-only structures.</description>

      <title>Even Integer Quantum Hall Effect in Materials with Hidden Spin Texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is invisible in the band structure when inversion symmetry exists, whether spins are trivially degenerate or strongly coupled to momentum due to SOC is presumed to make little difference in transport measurements, such as magnetoresistance and quantum oscillations. In this work, however, we show that hidden Rashba SOC in a centrosymmetric two-dimensional material can lead to the quantum Hall effect with only even-integer plateaus, unlike a spinless electron gas. Here, two Rashba layers that are degenerate but with opposite SOC due to inversion symmetry, hybridize with each other and create two doubly-degenerate bands with hidden spin texture. Correspondingly, two branches of Landau levels interact, resulting in significant suppression of spin splitting due to the balancing of intralayer SOC and interlayer hybridization. Furthermore, we show that breaking inversion symmetry restores the ordinary quantum Hall fluid by introducing spin-split Fermi surfaces. Our theory can apply to centrosymmetric materials with strong SOC, as demonstrated in a recent experiment on the two-dimensional semiconductor Bi$_2$O$_2$Se.</description>

      <title>Path-integral approaches to strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems</title>

Abstract: The core of this thesis is the path-integral formulation of quantum field theory and its ability to describe strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems of finite size. Collective behaviors can be efficiently described in such systems through the implementation of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in mean-field approaches. However, as the thermodynamic limit does not make sense in finite-size systems, the latter can not exhibit any SSB and the symmetries which are broken down at the mean-field level must therefore be restored. The efficiency of theoretical approaches in the treatment of finite-size quantum systems can therefore be studied via their ability to restore spontaneously broken symmetries. In this thesis, a zero-dimensional $O(N)$ model is taken as a theoretical laboratory to perform such an investigation with many state-of-the-art path-integral techniques: perturbation theory combined with various resummation methods (Pad\'e-Borel, Borel-hypergeometric, conformal mapping), enhanced versions of perturbation theory (transseries derived via Lefschetz thimbles, optimized perturbation theory), self-consistent perturbation theory based on effective actions (auxiliary field loop expansion (LOAF), Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism, 4PPI effective action, ...), functional renormalization group (FRG) techniques (FRG based on the Wetterich equation, DFT-FRG, 2PI-FRG). Connections between these different techniques are also emphasized. In addition, the path-integral formalism provides us with the possibility to introduce collective degrees of freedom in an exact fashion via Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations: the effect of such transformations on the aforementioned methods is also examined in detail.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic framework to classify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids in two spatial dimensions. This framework can deal with all topological quantum spin liquids, which may be either Abelian or non-Abelian, chiral or non-chiral. It can systematically treat a general symmetry, which may include both lattice symmetry and internal symmetry, may contain anti-unitary symmetry, and may permute anyons. The framework applies to all types of lattices, and can systematically distinguish different lattice systems with the same symmetry group using their Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies. We apply this framework to classify $U(1)_{2N}$ chiral states and non-Abelian Ising$^{(\nu)}$ states enriched by a $p6\times SO(3)$ or $p4\times SO(3)$ symmetry, and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological orders and $U(1)_{2N}\times U(1)_{-2N}$ topological orders enriched by a $p6m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p4m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p6m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ or $p4m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, where $p6$, $p4$, $p6m$ and $p4m$ are lattice symmetries, while $SO(3)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ are spin rotation and time reversal symmetries, respectively. In particular, we identify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids that are not easily captured by the usual parton-mean-field approach, including examples with the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order.</description>

Abstract: The realization of topological insulators induced by correlation effects is one of the main issues of modern condensed matter physics. An intriguing example of the correlated topological insulators is a magnetic Chern insulator induced by a noncoplanar multiple-Q magnetic order. Although the realization of the magnetic Chern insulator has been studied in the classical limit of the Kondo lattice model, research on the magnetic Chern insulator in the original Kondo lattice model is limited. Here, we investigate the possibility of the many-body Chern insulator with the noncoplanar triple-Q magnetic order in the Kondo lattice model on a triangular lattice. Using the many-variable variational Monte Carlo method, we reveal that the triple-Q magnetic order becomes a ground state at quarter filling in an intermediate Kondo coupling region. We also show that the many-body Chern number is quantized to one in the triple-Q magnetic ordered phase utilizing the polarization operators. Our results provide a pathway for the realization of the many-body Chern insulator in correlated electron systems.</description>

Abstract: Two dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) probes the nonlinear optical response of correlated systems. An interesting application is the study of fractionalized excitations, which are challenging to distinguish unambiguously in linear response. Here we demonstrate how the sensitivity of optical matrix elements to variations in the photon polarization allows one to probe different aspects of low lying excitations in models of the candidate fractionalized materials Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which host effective one-dimensional spin chains when subjected to a [110] magnetic field. We show how both fractionalized spinon excitations or conventional magnons can be picked out in the 2DCS response, and how the response from polarized spin chains can be used to probe the dipolar-octupolar mixing angle $\theta$ through the relative intensity of one- and two-magnon signals. Further, we find that a $[001]$ polarization of the probe field is particularly sensitive to lower band edge of the spinon continuum and can be used as a measure of the proximity of a quantum critical point in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. 2DCS can thus be employed to provide invaluable and detailed information both on the constituent degrees of freedom of a quantum material and on their collective behaviour.</description>

Abstract: The family of cubic noncentrosymmetric 3-4-3 compounds has become a fertile ground for the discovery of novel correlated metallic and insulating phases. Here, we report the synthesis of a new heavy fermion compound, Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$. It is an isoelectronic analog of the prototypical Kondo insulator Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pt$_3$ and of the recently discovered Weyl-Kondo semimetal Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$. In contrast to the volume-preserving Pt-Pd substitution, structural and chemical analyses reveal a positive chemical pressure effect in Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$ relative to its heavier counterparts. Based on the results of electrical resistivity, Hall effect, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements, we identify an energy gap of 65-70 meV, about eight times larger than that in Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pt$_3$ and about 45 times larger than that of the Kondo-insulating background hosting the Weyl nodes in Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$. We show that this gap as well as other physical properties do not evolve monotonically with increasing atomic number, i.e., in the sequence Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$-Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$-Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pt$_3$, but instead with increasing partial electronic density of states of the $d$ orbitals at the Fermi energy. To understand under which condition topological states form in these materials is a topic for future studies.</description>

Abstract: Gauging a finite subgroup of a global symmetry can map conventional phases and phase transitions to unconventional ones. In this work, we study, as a concrete example, an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauged system with global symmetry $U(1)$, namely, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauged Bose-Hubbard model both in 1-D and in 2-D. In certain limits, there is an emergent mixed 't Hooft anomaly between the quotient $\tilde{U}(1)$ symmetry and the dual $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ symmetry. In 1-D, the superfluid phase is mapped to an intrinsically gapless symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase, as supported by density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. In 2-D, the original superfluid-insulator transition becomes a generalized deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a gapless SPT phase, where a SPT order coexists with Goldstone modes, and a $\tilde{U}(1)$-symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phase. We also discuss the stability of these phases and the critical points to small perturbations and their potential experimental realizations. Our work demonstrates that partial gauging is a simple and yet powerful approach in constructing novel phases and quantum criticalities.</description>

Abstract: Hedgehog and antihedgehog spin textures in magnets behave as emergent monopoles and antimonopoles, which give rise to astonishing transport and electromagnetic phenomena. Using the Kondo-lattice model in three dimensions, we theoretically study collective spin-wave excitation modes of magnetic hedgehog lattices which have recently been discovered in itinerant magnets such as MnSi1-xGex and SrFeO3. It is revealed that the spin-wave modes, which appear in the sub-terahertz regime, have dominant amplitudes localized at Dirac strings connecting hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs and are characterized by their translational oscillations. It is found that their spectral features sensitively depend on the number and configuration of the Dirac strings and, thus, can be exploited for identifying the topological phase transitions associated with the monopole-antimonopole pair annihilations.</description>

Abstract: We study the ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with quenched disorder at $T = 0$ in one and two dimensions by means of stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations using a rigorous zero-temperature scheme. Using a sample-replication method and averaged Binder ratios, we determine the critical shift and width exponents $\nu_\mathrm{s}$ and $\nu_\mathrm{w}$ as well as unbiased critical points by finite-size scaling. Further, scaling of the disorder-averaged magnetisation at the critical point is used to determine the order-parameter critical exponent $\beta$ and the critical exponent $\nu_{\mathrm{av}}$ of the average correlation length. The dynamic scaling in the Griffiths phase is investigated by measuring the local susceptibility in the disordered phase and the dynamic exponent $z'$ is extracted. By applying various finite-size scaling protocols, we provide an extensive and comprehensive comparison between the different approaches on equal footing. The emphasis on effective zero-temperature simulations resolves several inconsistencies in existing literature.</description>

      <title>Gauge Field Dynamics in Multilayer Kitaev Spin Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kitaev spin liquid realizes an emergent static $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field with vison excitations coupled to Majorana fermions. We consider Kitaev models stacked on top of each other, weakly coupled by Heisenberg interaction $\propto J_\perp$. This inter-layer coupling breaks the integrability of the model and makes the gauge fields dynamic. \new{Conservation laws and topology keeps single visons immobile. However, an inter-layer vison pairs can hop with a hopping amplitude linear in $J_\perp$ confined to the layer, but their motion is strongly influenced by the type of stacking. For AA stacking, an interlayer pair has a two-dimensional motion but for the AB or ABC stacking, sheet conservation laws restrict its motion to a one-dimensional channel within the plane. For all stackings, an intra-layer vison-pair is constrained to move out-of-plane only.} Depending on the anisotropy of the Kitaev couplings $K_x, K_y, K_z$, the intra-layer vison pairs can display either coherent tunnelling or purely incoherent hopping. When a magnetic field opens a gap for Majorana fermions, there exist two types of intra-layer vison pairs - a bosonic and a fermionic one. Only the bosonic pair obtains a hopping rate linear in $J_\perp$. We use our results to identify the leading instabilities of the spin liquid phase induced by the inter-layer coupling.</description>

      <title>Magnetic versus nonmagnetic polymorphs of RuBr$_3$ under pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pressure evolution of the crystal structure and magnetism of the honeycomb $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ is studied using high-pressure x-ray diffraction, magnetometry, and density-functional band-structure calculations. Hydrostatic compression transforms antiferromagnetic $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ ($R\bar 3$) into paramagnetic $\alpha'$-RuBr$_3$ ($P\bar 1$) where short Ru-Ru bonds cause magnetism collapse above 1.3 GPa at 0 K and 2.5 GPa at 295 K. Below this critical pressure, the N\'eel temperature of $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ increases with the slope of 1.8 K/GPa. Pressure tunes $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ away from the Kitaev limit, whereas increased third-neighbor in-plane coupling and interlayer coupling lead to a further stabilization of the collinear zigzag state. Both $\alpha$- and $\alpha'$-RuBr$_3$ are metastable at ambient pressure, but their transformation into the thermodynamically stable $\beta$-polymorph is kinetically hindered at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Correlation effects in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene: An auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) presents a fascinating platform for investigating the effects of electron interactions in topological flat bands. The Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) model provides a simplified quantitative description of the flat bands. Introducing long-range Coulomb interactions leads to an interacting BM (IBM) Hamiltonian, a momentum-space continuum description which offers a very natural starting point for many-body studies of MATBG. Accurate and reliable many-body computations in the IBM model are challenging, however, and have been limited mostly to special fillings, or smaller lattice sizes. We employ state-of-the-art auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method to study the IBM model, which constrains the sign problem to enable accurate treatment of large system sizes. We determine ground-state properties and quantify errors compared to mean-field theory calculations. Our calculations identify correlated metal states and their competition with the insulating Kramers inter-valley coherent state at both half-filling and charge neutrality. Additionally, we investigate one- and three-quarter fillings, and examine the effect of many-body corrections beyond single Slater determinant solutions. We discuss the effect that details of the IBM Hamiltonian have on the results, including different forms of double-counting corrections, and the need to establish and precisely specify many-body Hamiltonians to allow more direct and quantitative comparisons with experiments in MATBG.</description>

      <title>Barrier height inhomogeneity and origin of 1/f-noise in topological insulator-based photo-detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) with symmetry-protected surface states, offer exciting opportunities for next-generation photonic and optoelectronic device applications. The heterojunctions of TIs and semiconductors (e.g. Si, Ge) have been observed to excellent photo-responsive characteristics. However, the realization of high-frequency operations in these heterojunctions can be hindered by unwanted 1/f (or Flicker) noise and phase noise. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of 1/f noise figures becomes paramount for the effective utilization of such materials.Here we report optoelectronic response and 1/f noise characteristics of a p-n diode fabricated using topological insulator, Bi2Se3 and silicon for potential photo-detector. Through meticulous temperature-dependent current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements, we ascertain crucial parameters like barrier height, ideality factor, and reverse saturation current of the photodetector. The low-frequency 1/f conductance noise spectra suggest a significant presence of trap states influencing the optoelectronic transport properties. The forward noise characteristics exhibit typical 1/f features, having a uni-slope across four decades of frequency, suggesting a homogeneous distribution of barrier height. The spectral and photocurrent-dependent responses show the power law behavior of noise level on photon flux. The hybrid heterojunction demonstrates excellent photo-response and reasonably low noise level, promising signatures for the room-temperature visible photodetector applications.</description>

      <title>Representation Theory for Massless Quasiparticles in Bogoliubov-de Gennes Systems</title>

Abstract: Gapless quasiparticles can exist in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians in the mean field description of superconductors (SCs), fermionic superfluids (SFs) and quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The mechanism of gapless quasiparticles in superconductors was studied in literature based on the homotopy theory or symmetry-indicators. However, important properties of the gapless quasiparticles including the degeneracy, the energy-momentum dispersion and the responses to external probe fields need to be determined. In the present work, we investigate gapless quasiparticles in general BdG systems by using projective representation theory for the full `symmetry' groups formed by combinations of lattice, spin and charge operations. We find that (I) charge conjugation (or effective charge conjugation) symmetry can yield gapless quasiparticles with linear, quadratic or higher order dispersions at high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone; (II) different quantum numbers protected level crossing can give rise to zero modes along high symmetry lines; (III) combined spatial inversion and time reversal symmetry can protect zero modes appearing at generic $k$ points. To obtain the low energy properties of gapless quasiparticles, the $k\cdot p$ theory is provided using a high efficient method--the Hamiltonian approach. Based on generalized band representation theory for BdG systems, several lattice models are constructed to illustrate the above results. Our theory provides a method to classify nodal SCs/SFs/QSLs with given symmetries, and enlightens the realization of Majorana type massless quasiparticles in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Anomalous Metal States in Iron-Based Interface Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.15488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of the anomalous metal state has been a major puzzle in condensed matter physics for more than three decades. Here, we report systematic investigation and modulation of the anomalous metal states in high-temperature interface superconductor FeSe films on SrTiO3 substrate. Remarkably, under zero magnetic field, the anomalous metal state persists up to 20 K in pristine FeSe films, an exceptionally high temperature standing out from previous observations. In stark contrast, for the FeSe films with nano-hole arrays, the characteristic temperature of the anomalous metal state is considerably reduced. We demonstrate that the observed anomalous metal states originate from the quantum tunneling of vortices adjusted by the Ohmic dissipation. Our work offers a perspective for understanding the origin and modulation of the anomalous metal states in two-dimensional bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic bosonic $t$-$J$ models and their quantum simulation in tweezer arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02322v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of optical tweezer arrays with strong interactions -- via dipole-exchange of molecules and van-der-Waals interactions of Rydberg atoms -- has opened the door for the exploration of a wide variety of quantum spin models. A next significant step will be the combination of such settings with mobile dopants: This will enable to simulate the physics believed to underlie many strongly correlated quantum materials. Here we propose an experimental scheme to realize bosonic t-J models via encoding the local Hilbert space in a set of three internal atomic or molecular states. By engineering antiferromagnetic (AFM) couplings between spins, competition between charge motion and magnetic order similar to that in high-$T_c$ cuprates can be realized. Since the ground states of the 2D bosonic AFM t-J model we propose to realize have not been studied extensively before, we start by analyzing the case of two dopants -- the simplest instance in which their bosonic statistics plays a role, and contrast our results to the fermionic case. We perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations on six-legged cylinders, and find a strong tendency for bosonic holes to form stripes. This demonstrates that bosonic, AFM t-J models may contain similar physics as the collective phases in strongly correlated electrons.</description>

      <title>Post-experiment coincidence counting method for coincidence detection techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, two coincidence detection techniques, the coincidence angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (cARPES) and the coincidence inelastic neutron scattering (cINS), have been proposed to detect directly the two-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons in particle-particle channel or two-spin channel. In the original proposals, a coincidence detector is introduced for the coincidence detection of two photoelectric processes or two neutron-scattering processes. In this article, we present a {\it post-experiment} coincidence counting method for the proposed coincidence detection techniques without a coincidence detector. It requires a {\it pulse} photon or neutron source. Consider one incident multiphoton or multineutron pulse that causes many photoelectric or neutron-scattering processes within one time window. $I_{d_1}^{(1)}$ and $I_{d_2}^{(1)}$ record the numbers of the emitted photoelectrons or the scattered neutrons which arrive at two detectors $D_1$ and $D_2$, respectively. The coincidence counting is defined by $I_d^{(2)}=I_{d_1}^{(1)} \times I_{d_2}^{(1)}$, which records the coincidence probability of two photoelectric processes or two neutron-scattering processes within this time window. Therefore, $I_d^{(2)}$ involves the two-body correlations of the target electrons. The previously proposed cARPES and cINS can be implemented upon the {\it pulse}-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experimental apparatuses with pulse sources.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that macroscopically-normalizable zero-energy wavefunctions of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in a two-dimensional inhomogeneous magnetic field are spin-polarized and exactly calculable with degeneracy equaling the number of flux quanta linking the whole system. Extending this argument to massless Dirac fermions subjected to magnetic fields that have \textit{zero} net flux but are doubly periodic in real space, we show that there exist \textit{only two} Bloch-normalizable zero-energy eigenstates, one for each spin flavor. This result is immediately relevant to graphene multilayer systems subjected to doubly-periodic strain fields, which at low energies, enter the Hamiltonian as periodic pseudo-gauge vector potentials. Furthermore, we explore various related settings including nonlinearly-dispersing band structure models and systems with singly-periodic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Cuprate-like Electronic Structures in Infinite-Layer Nickelates with Substantial Hole Dopings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting infinite-layer (IL) nickelates offer a new platform for investigating the long-standing problem of high-temperature superconductivity. Many models were proposed to understand its superconducting mechanisms based on the calculated electronic structure, and the multiple Fermi surfaces and multiple orbitals involved create complications and controversial conclusions. Over the past 5 years, the lack of direct measurements of the electronic structure has hindered the understanding of nickelate superconductors. Here we fill this gap by directly resolving the electronic structures of the parent compound LaNiO$_2$ and superconducting La$_{0.8}$Ca$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We find that their Fermi surfaces consist of a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) hole pocket and a three-dimensional (3D) electron pocket at the Brillouin zone corner, whose volumes change upon Ca doping. The Fermi surface topology and band dispersion of the hole pocket closely resemble those observed in hole-doped cuprates. However, the cuprate-like band exhibits significantly higher hole doping in superconducting La$_{0.8}$Ca$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ compared to superconducting cuprates, highlighting the disparities in the electronic states of the superconducting phase. Our observations highlight the novel aspects of the IL nickelates, and pave the way toward the microscopic understanding of the IL nickelate family and its superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems unfolds within a subspace of the state space or operator space, known as the Krylov space. This review presents the use of Krylov subspace methods to provide a compact and computationally efficient description of quantum evolution, with emphasis on nonequilibrium phenomena of many-body systems with a large Hilbert space. It provides a comprehensive update of recent developments, focused on the quantum evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture as well as pure and mixed states. It further explores the notion of Krylov complexity and associated metrics as tools for quantifying operator growth, their bounds by generalized quantum speed limits, the universal operator growth hypothesis, and its relation to quantum chaos, scrambling, and generalized coherent states. A comparison of several generalizations of the Krylov construction for open quantum systems is presented. A closing discussion addresses the application of Krylov subspace methods in quantum field theory, holography, integrability, quantum control, and quantum computing, as well as current open problems.</description>
