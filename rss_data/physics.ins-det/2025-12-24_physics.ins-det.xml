      <title>Millimeter-Resolution Cosmic-Ray Imaging via Projection-Shifted Muon Transmission Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray muon imaging provides a non-destructive inspection technique, yet achieving millimeter-resolution imaging within practical timeframes remains challenging. Here we introduce Projection-shifted MUon transMission tomogrAghy (P$\mu$MA), a hybrid framework that seamlessly integrates transmission and scattering information to enable high-resolution imaging. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on scattering-angle measurements to locate scattering points, P$\mu$MA constructs transmission tracks by connecting hit positions in upstream and downstream detectors. The material-induced angular deflection is then projected as a detectable shift in an imaging plane. This approach allows millimeter-resolution cosmic-ray imaging with as few as two detectors, significantly increasing acceptance and usable muon events, and substantially lowering detector and electronics costs. We also present multi-detector variants that incorporate scattering-angle selection to enhance contrast. Simulations of a 30 mm thick lead block demonstrate a knife-edge width of 1.196 mm. Experiments resolve 2 mm copper sheets within 2 days, surpassing conventional methods under matched conditions.</description>

      <title>First results of the Tritium Absorption InfraRed Spectroscopy (T2ApIR) experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The literature on experimentally verified material properties of tritium is sparse but information about this is crucial in fusion for pellet production (Magnetic Confined Fusion), target fueling (Inertial Confined Fusion), cryogenic distillation, as well as in astroparticle physics for neutrino experiments, and search for rare physics. To improve on this, the T$_2$ApIR experiment has been designed and built at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK), and is in its scientific commissioning phase. The main focus of this experiment is to enable the investigation of the properties of all six hydrogen isotopologues and their mixtures in the gaseous, liquid, and solid phase, as well as the dynamics of their phase changes. In addition, mixtures with noble gases such as xenon and neon can be investigated. This is achieved using a cryogenic setup capable of reaching less than 10 in a measurement cell that allows optical access for infrared absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and a polariscope setup, as well as temperature and pressure measurement.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Performance Characterization of the Second Generation Fermilab Constant Fraction Discriminator Readout ASIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the optimization and performance characterization of the second-generation Fermilab Constant Fraction Discriminator ASIC (FCFD), designed for the readout of AC-coupled low-gain avalanche detector (LGAD) strip-sensors. The FCFD is explicitly engineered to be insensitive to signal-amplitude variations, thereby removing the need for time-walk correction that is required in other LGAD time-stamping readout ASICs. This updated version, referred to as FCFD1.1, incorporates several enhancements over the first iteration to address key challenges in AC-coupled LGAD front-end design. We outline the primary readout-ASIC design considerations for these applications, describe the methodology used to evaluate critical sensor and system parameters, and summarize the additionally implemented features. Performance measurements using injected charge signals and minimum-ionizing particles in test-beams demonstrate a time resolution of approximately 40 ps and a position resolution of roughly \SI{15}{\micro\meter} when tested with beam particles uniformly over the active area of the sensor.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Front-End FERS 5202 Readout System for Muon Radiography Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive characterization of the FERS 5202 front-end readout unit when processing signals from Silicon Photo-multipliers (SiPMs). The readout system's performance is characterized in terms of its charge resolution, dynamic range, and noise performance at the single photoelectron level, which is critical for applications requiring detection of low-light signals such as medical imaging, high-energy physics experiments and photon counting applications. The evaluation encompassed both fundamental performance metrics and practical implementation scenarios using Hamamatsu MPPC devices. This work aims to provide valuable reference data not only for our intended muon radiography application but also for the broader scientific community employing SiPMs in diverse experimental contexts.</description>

      <title>Design and Modeling of a Simple-Structured Continuously Variable Transmission Utilizing Shape Memory Alloy Superelasticity for Twisted String Actuator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted String Actuators (TSAs) are widely used in robotics but suffer from a limited range of Transmission Ratio (TR) variation, restricting their efficiency under varying loads.To overcome this, we propose a novel lightweight, simple-structured Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) mechanism for TSA utilizing Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) superelasticity. The CVT mechanism consists solely of a pair of highly lightweight superelastic SMA rods connecting the ends of twisted strings. These rods deform under external loads, adjusting the inter-string distance to enable continuous TR variation.We develop a comprehensive theoretical model that integrates three critical nonlinearities</description>

      <title>Scalable Relay Switching Platform for Automated Multi-Point Resistance Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In both research and industrial settings, it is often necessary to expand the input/output channels of measurement instruments using relay-based multiplexer boards. In research activities in particular, the need for a highly flexible and easily configurable solution frequently leads to the development of customized systems. To address this challenge, we developed a system optimized for automated direct current (DC) measurements. The result is based on a 4x4 switching platform that simplifies measurement procedures that require instrument routing. The platform is based on a custom-designed circuit board controlled by a microcontroller. We selected bistable relays to guarantee contact stability after switching. We finally developed a system architecture that allows for straightforward expansion and scalability by connecting multiple platforms. We share both the hardware design source files and the firmware source code on GitHub with the open-source community. This work presents the design and development of the proposed system, followed by the performance evaluation. Finally, we present a test of our designed system applied to a specific case study: the DC analysis of complex resistive networks through multi-point resistance measurements using only a single voltmeter and current source.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the BIFROST spectrometer through virtual experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Monte Carlo ray tracing package McStas, we illustrate the possibilities of creating virtual experiments of the neutron spectrometer BIFROST at the European Spallation Source, ESS. With this model, we are able to benchmark BIFROST with respect to expected intensity, $Q$- and energy-resolution. The simulations reproduce the expected resolution behavior and quantify effects that are difficult to capture analytically, including a wavelength-dependent edge enhancement arising from a combination of the long-pulsed source and the pulse-shaping chopper. Furthermore, we present an antiferromagnetic (AF) spin wave simulation, which we use to create realistic datasets at different instrument operation settings. Our virtual experiments focus on realistic dispersive dynamics and illustrate how the virtual experiment approach reveal resolution effects, not easily calculable via analytical models. This demonstrates the crucial role of numerical simulations in the planning of challenging experiments.</description>

      <title>An Instrument for Physical Vapor Deposition onto Cryo-EM Samples for Microsecond Time-Resolved Cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser flash melting and revitrification experiments have recently improved the time resolution of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to the microsecond timescale, making it fast enough to observe many of the protein motions that are associated with function. The technique has also opened up a new dimension for cryo-EM sample preparation, making it possible to deposit compounds onto a cryo-EM sample while it is frozen, so that upon flash melting, the embedded particles experience an altered environment. For example, we have recently shown that depositing ultrathin silicon dioxide membranes onto a cryo-EM sample causes particles to detach from the interface upon flash melting, removing preferred particle orientation. These experiments also point towards a new strategy for initiating protein dynamics in time resolved experiments by depositing reagents, which will then mix with the sample upon flash melting. Here, we describe an apparatus for physical vapor deposition of compounds onto cryo-EM samples, detailing its design and operation. As a demonstration, we determine that the minimum thickness of silicon dioxide sealing membranes in a laser flash melting experiment is just over two monolayers. We propose that our design can form the basis for an integrated platform for microsecond time-resolved cryo-EM experiments.</description>

      <title>URANOS -- a novel voxel engine Neutron Transport Monte-Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: URANOS is a newly developed 3D neutron transport Monte-Carlo code from thermal to fast energy domains. It was originally developed for the CASCADE detector. The purpose of this simulation program is to provide a fast computational workflow and an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for small to medium-sized projects. It features a ray-casting algorithm based on a voxel engine. The simulation domain is defined layerwise, whereas the geometry is extruded from a pixel matrix of materials, identified by specific numbers. Input files are a stack of pictures, all other settings, including the configuration of predefined sources, can be adjusted via the GUI. The scattering kernel features the treatment of elastic and inelastic collisions, absorption and absorption-like processes like evaporation. Cross sections, energy distributions and angular distributions are taken from evaluated data bases. In order to simulate boron-lined detectors it also models the charged particle transport following the conversion by computing the energy loss in the boron and its consecutive layer. The electron track is then projected onto a readout unit by longitudinal and transversal diffusion. URANOS is freely available and can be used to simulate the response function of boron-lined or epithermal neutron detectors, small-scale laboratory setups and especially transport studies of cosmic-ray induced environmental neutrons. It offers an easy accessibility and comparably simple interface capable of handling complex geometries. URANOS therefore offers possibilities to understand and simulate the neutron environment at instruments, which would otherwise require extensive modeling and training on dedicated packages.</description>

      <title>Verification of the Outer Space Treaty with Cosmic Protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Outer Space Treaty (OST) was opened to signatures in 1967, and since then 117 countries, including China, the United States, Russia, have become part of it. Among other stipulations the treaty bans the placement of nuclear weapons in outer space. Recently the US government has raised worries that Russia is testing nuclear-armed anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) components, with the possibility that it will place a nuclear weapon in space. Such a device, if detonated, would destroy most of the satellites in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This danger is compounded by the lack of a verification mechanism for the OST. No methodologies of verification have been proposed in the open peer reviewed literature. This study presents a concept and a feasibility study for verifying a satellite's compliance to the OST by observing the neutrons induced by spallation from the $\sim$GeV protons in the inner Van Allen radiation belts. The calculations show that a 9U CubeSat sized detection platform can identify a thermonuclear weapon from the distance of 4 km in approximately one week of observation. This conceptual study will stimulate and inform future research and development of verification platforms for OST.</description>

      <title>Precision Bounds for Characterising Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements, alongside quantum states and processes, form a cornerstone of quantum information processing. However, unlike states and processes, their efficient characterisation remains relatively unexplored. We resolve this asymmetry by introducing a comprehensive framework for efficient detector estimation that reveals the fundamental limits to extractable parameter information and errors arising in detector analysis - the \emph{detector quantum Fisher information}. Our development eliminates the need to optimise for the best probe state, while highlighting aspects of detector analysis that fundamentally differ from quantum state estimation. Through proofs, examples and experimental validation, we demonstrate the relevance and robustness of our proposal for current quantum detector technologies. By formalising a dual perspective to state estimation, our framework completes and connects the triad of efficient state, process, and detector tomography, advancing quantum information theory with broader implications for emerging technologies reliant on precisely calibrated measurements.</description>

      <title>Calibration Method of Spacecraft-Inertial Sensor Center-of-Mass Offset for the Taiji Gravitational Wave Detection Mission under Science Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately calibrating the center-of-mass (CoM) offset between the spacecraft (SC) and the inertial sensor test mass (TM) is crucial for space-based gravitational-wave (GW) antennas, such as LISA and Taiji. Current calibration methods require additional spacecraft maneuvers that disrupt science data continuity and inter-satellite links, compromising the coherence of gravitational wave signals. Here, we present a maneuver-free calibration scheme that directly estimates the CoM offset vector using only standard science-mode measurements from inertial sensors, interferometers, and differential wavefront sensors. By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis. For LISA-like missions, where data continuity is paramount for detecting faint gravitational wave signals, this method will enhance scientific output and reliability.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Walk in Fast Timing: The Role of Dual Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07127v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply lessons from fast timing detector R$\&amp;$D to strategies for initial calibration of large timing arrays at future colliders. Detector R$\&amp;$D often benefits from detailed information about the sensor and front-end signal (waveform capture) as well as a quality time reference and tracking. On the other hand, the systems for charged particle (MIP) timing under construction for the CERN High Luminosity LHC log only limited information for each timing channel -- usually amplitude and the time of the leading edge. Furthermore the high event rates certainly present a challenge for \textit{in situ }calibration of the large (compared to intrinsic) time jitter of the leading edge with pulse amplitude -- amplitude walk. In the examples presented here we find a simple linear dependence of walk on the inverse of the pulse slope at threshold for the dynamic range (in amplitude) suitable to charged particle timing. We present a straightforward calibration method for the small variation in the corresponding coefficient from channel-to-channel.</description>

      <title>Low-energy threshold demonstration for dark matter searches in TREX-DM with an $^{37}$Ar source produced at CNA HiSPANoS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the successful implementation of an $^{37}$Ar calibration source in the TREX-DM detector, a high-pressure time projection chamber designed for low-mass dark matter searches. The $^{37}$Ar source was produced through fast neutron activation of CaO powder at the HiSPANoS facility of Centro Nacional de Aceleradores (CNA) in Spain, yielding $O(1)$ kBq of activity. Using a novel combined GEM-Micromegas readout system, we successfully detected both characteristic emissions from $^{37}$Ar decay (2.82 keV and 270 eV) and achieved unprecedented energy threshold performance in TREX-DM, approaching the single-electron ionization energy of argon.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Optimization of BEGe Detector Event Selection in the VIP Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The VIP collaboration operates a Broad Energy Germanium detector at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory to measure radiation in the few keV to 100 keV range, aiming to search for spontaneous collapse induced radiation and atomic transitions that violate the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Here we present a machine learning based upgrade for the BEGe detector using an event selection strategy aimed at improving the efficiency in detecting low energy events down to 10 keV. The method employs a denoising autoencoder to suppress electronic and microphonic noises and to reconstruct pulse shapes, followed by a convolutional neural network that classifies waveforms as normal single site or events with anomalies. The workflow was validated on a dataset comprising more than 20000 waveforms recorded in 2021. The classifier achieves a receiver operating characteristic curve with an area under the curve of 0.99 and an accuracy of 95 percent. Applying this procedure lowers the minimum detectable energy of the final spectrum to approximately 10 keV. It also yields a measurable enhancement in spectral quality, including an improvement of about 14 percent in the signal to background ratio and a reduction of the energy resolution for the characteristic Pb and Bi gamma lines. These developments enhance the sensitivity of the BEGe detector to rare low energy signals and provide a scalable framework for future precision tests of quantum foundations in low background environments.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen bonding in water under extreme confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluids under extreme confinement exhibit unique structures and intermolecular bonding, distinct from their bulk analogs, driving innovative applications at the water-energy nexus. Probing confined water experimentally at the length scale of intermolecular and surface forces has, however, remained a challenge. Here, we report direct molecular-level observations of hydrogen bonding in water confined inside individual carbon nanotubes, enabled by in-situ vibrational electron energy-loss spectroscopy with nanoscale resolution. Hydrogen bonding is probed via the intramolecular O-H stretching frequency, which serves as a sensitive spectral signature of the local intermolecular bonding environment. Water in larger carbon nanotubes exhibit the bonded O-H vibrations of bulk water, but at smaller diameters, the frequency blueshifts to near the free O-H stretch found in water vapor and hydrophobic surfaces, indicating a highly dispersed, non-H-bonded environment. Theoretical analysis based on quantum vibrational oscillators indicates that enhanced damping rates, corresponding to rapid hydrogen-bond fluctuations, leads the bimodal spectral peaks to merge into a single broad feature, matching the experimental observation. Furthermore, cryogenic experiments provide insights into complex structural phase transitions of confined water. This research reveals the quantum and dynamic nature of hydrogen bonds under confinement and the potential impact of unveiling molecular-level structure and bonding in confined fluids.</description>

      <title>A Linear Collider Vision for the Future of Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19983v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we review the physics opportunities at linear $e^+e^-$ colliders with a special focus on high centre-of-mass energies and beam polarisation, take a fresh look at the various accelerator technologies available or under development and, for the first time, discuss how a facility first equipped with a technology mature today could be upgraded with technologies of tomorrow to reach much higher energies and/or luminosities. In addition, we will discuss detectors and alternative collider modes, as well as opportunities for beyond-collider experiments and R\&amp;D facilities as part of a linear collider facility (LCF). The material of this paper will support all plans for $e^+e^-$ linear colliders and additional opportunities they offer, independently of technology choice or proposed site, as well as R\&amp;D for advanced accelerator technologies. This joint perspective on the physics goals, early technologies and upgrade strategies has been developed by the LCVision team based on an initial discussion at LCWS2024 in Tokyo and a follow-up at the LCVision Community Event at CERN in January 2025. It heavily builds on decades of achievements of the global linear collider community, in particular in the context of CLIC and ILC.</description>

      <title>Aerogel RICH Counter at the Belle II Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the design, operation, and performance of a novel proximity-focusing Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector equipped with a multilayer focusing aerogel radiator, developed for the forward region of the Belle II spectrometer at the SuperKEKB $e^+e^-$ collider. The system achieves effective separation of charged pions, kaons, and protons across the full kinematic range of the experiment, from 0.5 GeV/c to 4 GeV/c. To date, the detector has successfully operated in data-taking, contributing to the collection and analysis of nearly 600/fb of Belle II $e^+e^-$ collision data.</description>
