      <title>Treatment of seeds by cold ambient air plasma: Combining impedance measurements with water sorption modeling to understand the impact of seed hydration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we focus on the plasma seed interaction and more specifically-on the feedback exerted by the seeds on the plasma properties. Dormant Arabidopsis seeds with different water contents (WC), namely 3 %DW, 10 %DW and 30%DW were exposed to cold ambient air plasma (C2AP) generated in a dielectric barrier device (DBD). It is found that increasing WC enhances the capacitive current of the DBD, generates a greater number of low energy streamers (characterized by current peaks lower than 10 mA) that preferentially interplay with the seeds. Since the resistive and capacitive components of the seeds modify the C2AP electrical properties, impedance measurements have been carried out to measure their main dielectric parameters before/after plasma exposure (seeds resistance, capacitance, complex relative permittivity, tangent loss and conductivity). WC significantly changes dielectric losses at low frequencies (&lt; 1 kHz) due to polarization relaxation of the polar molecules (i.e. water). LCRmetry further reveals that C2AP does not substantially alter seeds dielectric parameters, i.e. it neither adds or removes significant amounts of new materials, meaning that the relative starch, protein and lipid contents remain essentially unaffected. However, it cannot be discounted that some bulk properties of the Arabidopsis seeds may be modified, especially regarding their porosity. This characteristic could facilitate penetration of plasma-generated reactive oxygen species into the internal seed tissues, leading to the grafting of oxygenated groups. Water sorption isotherms have been achieved on Arabidopsis seeds and fitted with four thermodynamic models, including the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller model and the Generalized D'Arcy and Watt model. It is demonstrated that C2AP primarily strengthens water-seed affinity by modifying molecular interactions rather than changing the seed's moisture layer.</description>

      <title>Self-generated magnetic field in three-dimensional ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-generated magnetic field in three-dimensional (3D) single-mode ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (ARTI) relevant to the acceleration phase of a direct-drive inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosion is investigated. It is found that stronger magnetic fields up to a few thousands of T can be generated by 3D ARTI than by its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart. The Nernst effects significantly alter the magnetic fields convection and amplify the magnetic fields. The scaling law for the magnetic flux obtained in the 2D simulations performs reasonably well in the 3D cases. While the magnetic field significantly accelerates the bubble growth in the short-wavelength 2D modes through modifying the heat fluxes, the magnetic field mostly accelerates the spike growth but has little influence on the bubble growth in 3D ARTI.</description>

      <title>The importance of temperature-dependent collision frequency in PIC simulation on nanometric density evolution of highly-collisional strongly-coupled dense plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method is a powerful plasma simulation tool for investigating high-intensity femtosecond laser-matter interaction. However, its simulation capability at high-density plasmas around the Fermi temperature is considered to be inadequate due, among others, to the necessity of implementing atomic-scale collisions. Here, we performed a one-dimensional with three-velocity space (1D3V) PIC simulation that features the realistic collision frequency around the Fermi temperature and atomic-scale cell size. The results are compared with state-of-the-art experimental results as well as with hydrodynamic simulation. We found that the PIC simulation is capable of simulating the nanoscale dynamics of solid-density plasmas around the Fermi temperature up to $\sim$2~ps driven by a laser pulse at the moderate intensity of $10^{14-15}$~$\mathrm{W/cm^{2}}$, by comparing with the state-of-the-art experimental results. The reliability of the simulation can be further improved in the future by implementing multi-dimensional kinetics and radiation transport.</description>

      <title>A Platform for All-optical Thomson/ Compton Scattering with Versatile Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dual-beam platform for all-optical electron-photon scattering, or Thomson/Compton scattering, with adjustable collision-angle and parameter tuning ability has been developed, which, in principle, can be used for the verification of strong-field quantum electrodynamics effects. Combining this platform with a 200 TW Ti:Sapphire laser system, we demonstrated the generation of inverse Compton scattering X/gamma-rays with tunable energies from tens of keV to MeV. The polarization of X/gamma radiation was manipulated by controlling the polarization of scattering laser. In the near future, by combining this experimental platform with multi-PW laser facilities, it is proposed to experimentally generate X/gamma radiation with orbital angular momentum for the nuclear isomer excitation, and more importantly, to explore the regime transition from nonlinear Thomson scattering to nonlinear Compton scattering, eventually to demonstrate the verification of theories on extremely strong field quantum electrodynamics effects.</description>

      <title>Parametric decay instability of circularly polarized Alfv\'en wave in magnetically dominated plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate parametric decay instability (PDI) of circularly polarized Alfv\'en wave into daughter acoustic wave and backward Alfv\'en wave in magnetically-dominated plasma, in which the magnetization parameter $\sigma$ (energy density ratio of background magnetic field to matter) exceeds unity. We analyze relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), focusing on wave frequencies sufficiently lower than the plasma and cyclotron frequencies. We derive analytical formulae for the dispersion relation and growth rate of the instability as a function of the magnetization $\sigma$, wave amplitude $\eta$, and plasma temperature $\theta$. We find that PDI persists even in high magnetization $\sigma$, albeit with a decreased growth rate up to $\sigma\to\infty$. Our formulae are useful for estimating the decay of Alfv\'en wave into acoustic wave and heat in high magnetization $\sigma$ plasma, which is a ubiquitous phenomenon such as in pulsars, magnetars, and fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis for the behavior of beryllium and magnesium crystals at ultrahigh pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper presents ab initio results on the structural phase stability of beryllium and magnesium crystals under high and ultrahigh pressures (multi-terapascal regime). Magnesium is shown to undergo a number of structural transformations which markedly reduce the crystal packing factor. As for beryllium, its high-pressure body-centered cubic phase remains stable even under ultrahigh pressures. Changes in the electronic structure of Be and Mg crystals under compression are analyzed and some interesting effects are revealed. Specifically, a narrow band gap appears in the electronic structure of magnesium under pressures above 2.5 TPa. For the metals of interest, PT-diagrams are constructed and compared with available experimental and theoretical results from other investigations.</description>

      <title>Inelastic collisions facilitating runaway electron generation in weakly-ionized plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dreicer generation is one of the main mechanisms of runaway electrons generation, in particular during tokamak startup. In fully ionized plasma it is described as a diffusive flow from the Maxwellian core into high energies under the effect of the electric field. In this work we demonstrate a critical role of the non-differential nature of inelastic collisions in weakly ionized plasma during tokamak startup, where some electrons experience virtually no collisions during acceleration to the critical energy. We show that using the Fokker-Planck collisional operator can underestimate the Dreicer generation rate by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.03524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magneto-inertial range dominated by magnetic helicity has been studied using results of the numerical simulations, laboratory measurements, solar, solar wind, and the Earth's and planets' magnetosphere observations (spacecraft measurements). The spectral data have been compared with the theoretical results based on the distributed chaos notion in the frames of the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology. The transition from magnetohydrodynamics to kinetics in the electron and Hall magnetohydrodynamics, and in a fully kinetic 3D approach, as well as in the solar wind, solar photosphere, and at the special events (reconnections, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, isolated flux tube interchanges, etc.) in the magnetosphere of Earth, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury has been also discussed.</description>

      <title>Identification of the weak-to-strong transition in Alfv\'enic turbulence from space plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasma turbulence is a ubiquitous dynamical process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales in astrophysical and space plasma systems. Although the theory of anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence has successfully described phenomena in nature, its core prediction of an Alfvenic transition from weak to strong MHD turbulence when energy cascades from large to small scales has not been observationally confirmed. Here we report the first observational evidence for the Alfvenic weak-to-strong transition in MHD turbulence in the terrestrial magnetosheath using the four Cluster spacecraft. The observed transition indicates the universal existence of strong turbulence regardless of the initial level of MHD fluctuations. Moreover, the observations demonstrate that the nonlinear interactions of MHD turbulence play a crucial role in the energy cascade, widening the directions of the energy cascade and broadening the fluctuating frequencies. Our work takes a critical step toward understanding the complete picture of turbulence cascade, connecting the weak and strong MHD turbulence systems. It will have broad implications in star formation, energetic particle transport, turbulent dynamo, and solar corona or solar wind heating.</description>
