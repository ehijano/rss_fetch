      <title>Dust production rates in Jupiter-family comets II: Trends and population insights from ATLAS photometry of 116 JFCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) have orbital periods of less than 20 years and therefore undergo more frequent sublimation compared to other comet populations. The JFCs therefore represent the ideal dynamical population for investigating the dust production rates at high-cadence. We analyzed observations by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) of 74 JFCs that reached perihelion in 2022 and 2023. The work contained in this study builds upon our previous work (Gillan et al. 2024), for a total of 116 JFCs over a four-year period. Using the Afrho parameter, we measured the dust production rates of each JFC as a function of heliocentric distance. We found that there remained a clear preference for JFCs to reach their maximum A(0)frho post-perihelion, with 170P/Christensen, 254P/McNaught and P/2020 WJ5 (Lemmon) reaching a maximum A(0)frho between 200-400 days after perihelion. However, all JFCs reached their maximum dust production within 10% of their orbital period relative to perihelion. Fitting A(0)fp as a function of Rh^n, we measured statistically significant differences in the distribution of pre-perihelion and post-perihelion activity index n, with average activity indices of -5.2 +/- 4.5 and -3.2 +/- 2.7 respectively. We derived upper limits for the nuclear radii of comets 444P/WISE-PANSTARRS and 459P/Catalina as Rn \leq 1.5 +/- 0.2 km and Rn \leq 1.7 +/- 0.1 km respectively. We measured six outbursts in comets 97P/Metcalf-Brewington, 99P/Kowal 1, 118P/Shoemaker-Levy 4, 285P/LINEAR and 382P/Larson. From our four years of observing JFC outbursts in the ATLAS data, the average increase in magnitude was - 1.3 +/- 0.8.</description>

      <title>JWST Coronagraphic Images of 14 Her c: a Cold Giant Planet in a Dynamically Hot, Multi-planet System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most observed multi-planet systems are coplanar, in a dynamically "cold" configuration of concentric orbits like our own Solar System. With the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we have detected 14 Her c, the first mature and cold exoplanet directly imaged in a dynamically "hot", multi-planet system. With large eccentricities and a nonzero mutual inclination, the present-day architecture of this system points to a turbulent past and ongoing angular momentum exchange between the planetary orbits of 14 Her b and c. The temperature of 14 Her c rivals both the coldest imaged exoplanet and the coldest known brown dwarf. Moreover, its photometry at 4.4 mu is consistent with the presence of carbon disequilibrium chemistry and water ice clouds in its atmosphere. 14 Her c presents a unique laboratory to study giant planet formation, dynamical evolution of multi-planet system architectures, and atmospheric composition and dynamics in extremely cold worlds.</description>

      <title>Improved H2-He and H2-H2 Collision-Induced Absorption Models and Application to Outer-Planet Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using state-of-the-art ab initio interaction-induced dipole and potential-energy surfaces for hydrogen-helium (H2-He) pairs, we compute the rototranslational collision-induced absorption coefficient at 40-400 K for frequencies covering 0-4000 cm-1. The quantum mechanical scattering calculations account for the full anisotropic interaction potential, replacing the isotropic approximation. The absorption data are expected to be accurate with an uncertainty of 2% or better up to 2500 cm-1. The uncertainty is slightly higher at the highest frequencies where the rototranslational absorption is largely obscured by the rovibrational band. Our improved agreement with measurements at 200-800 cm-1 results from the improvement of the potential energy surface. The previously available rototranslational data set for H2-H2 pairs (Fletcher et al., Astrophys. J. Supp. 235, 24 (2018)) is also extended up to 4000 cm-1. In the rovibrational band previous isotropic potential calculations for H2-He (Gustafsson et al. J. Chem. Physics. 113, 3641 (2000)) and H2-H2 (Borysow, Icarus 92, 273 (1992)) have been extended to complement the rototranslational data set. The absorption coefficients are tabulated for ortho-to-para ratios from normal-H2 to pure para-H2, as well as equilibrium-H2, over 40-400 K. The effect of these updates are simulated for the cold atmosphere of Uranus and warmer atmosphere of Jupiter. They are equivalent to a brightness temperature difference of a fraction of a degree in the rototranslational region but up to 4 degrees in the rovibrational region. Our state-of-the-art modifications correct an otherwise +2% error in determining the He/H2 ratio in Uranus from its spectrum alone.</description>

      <title>Down But Not Out: The Case of Long-Period Comet C/2021 O3 (Panstarrs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine ground- and space-based observations of long-period comet C/2021 O3 (Panstarrs) (perihelion distance 0.287 au) in order to investigate its reported near-perihelion destruction. Pre-perihelion photometric observations show a remarkably small heliocentric dependence of the scattered light, $\propto r_H^{-s}$ with $s = 2.59\pm0.21$, distinct from values reported in other long-period comets, for which $s$ = 4 is the canonical standard. The index is smaller than expected of coma production by equilibrium sublimation of either supervolatiles (for which $s \sim$ 4 is expected), or water ice ($s \sim$ 6 to 8) across the $\sim$4 au to 2 au range. The absolute magnitude deduced from the pre-perihelion data is $H$ = 13.0$\pm$0.3 (coma scattering cross-section $\sim$225 km$^2$ for an assumed geometric albedo 0.04) while, after perihelion, the cross-section fades by a factor of 25 to $H$ = 16.5 ($\sim$9 km$^2$). STEREO spacecraft observations near perihelion show a long debris trail whose properties are consistent with forward scattering from radius $\sim$7 $\mu$m particles. The data show that the nucleus of C/2021 O3 was not destroyed at perihelion. Although the lightcurve from 3.9 au inbound to 0.8 au outbound cannot be uniquely interpreted, a simple and plausible explanation is provided by seasonal dimming on a nucleus having high obliquity and an asymmetric distribution of near-surface volatiles. The survival of the nucleus against rotational disruption suggests a pre-perihelion nucleus radius $r_n \gtrsim$ 1.0 km while the photometric limit to the radius of the nucleus after perihelion is $r_n &lt; 1.7$ km (geometric albedo 0.04 assumed).</description>

      <title>Study of Venera Spacecraft Trajectories and Wider Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, there is no doubt that the early years of the USSR space program put them way ahead of the competition (the USA). Nonetheless, although this was not what the Russians wished to present to the world, the interplanetary campaign, centred around missions to the planet Venus (the Venera program) was also beset with difficulties. Many of the early Venera probes failed, despite making it to a heliocentric orbit, but naturally the success rate improved with time. The result is that there are now many Venera probes in heliocentric orbits, either completely intact, or the main bus after a successful deployment of the lander; together with the associated Blok-L upper stages. This paper is a response to some previous quite contentious research proposing that a certain member of a new class of objects, designated $2005\ VL_1$ may in fact be the Venera-2 probe. In this paper we look into the invariance of the Earth Tisserand parameter in an attempt to establish if there are indeed any members of this class which could be Venera probes. It is found, with extremely small probability, that compared to a sample of randomly chosen NEOs, members of the class of Dark Comet have an Earth Tisserand unusually close to 3, a property shared by the Venera missions. Furthermore there are particular associations of 3 Dark Comets with 3 of these probes, the most significant being $2010\ RF_{12}$ with the Venera-12 mission</description>

      <title>MINDS: Detection of an inner gas disk caused by evaporating bodies around HD 172555</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanisms such as collisions of rocky bodies or cometary activity give rise to dusty debris disks. Debris disks trace the leftover building blocks of planets, and thus also planetary composition. HD 172555, a stellar twin of beta Pic, hosts a debris disk thought to have resulted from a giant collision. It is known for its extreme mid-infrared silica dust feature, indicating a warm population of silica-rich grains in the asteroid belt (~5 au), cold CO observed by ALMA, and small bodies evaporating as they approach close to the star. Our JWST MIRI/MRS observations now reveal emission from an inner gaseous disk (&lt;0.5 au) that arises from the evaporation of close-in material. For the first time in a debris disk, we detect neutral atomic chlorine and sulfur, as well as ionized nickel. We recovered the neutral sulfur line in ~20-year-old Spitzer data, showing it is long-lived and stable. Ionized iron, previously seen only in beta Pic, is also detected. All lines are broadened by Keplerian rotation, pinpointing the gas location. The HD 172555 system serves as a unique laboratory to study the composition of planetesimals, asteroids, and comets beyond the Solar System. The comparison to beta Pic reveals, that the gas in HD 172555 is hotter, closer to the star, and poor in argon -- suggesting it originates from evaporating rocky bodies near the star, while beta Pic's gas may trace volatile-rich bodies from larger separations.</description>

      <title>Impact chronology of leftover planetesimals</title>

Abstract: After the formation of the Moon the terrestrial planets were pummelled by impacts from planetesimals left over from terrestrial planet formation. This work attempts to reproduce the impact rates set by modern crater chronologies using leftover planetesimals from three different dynamical models of terrestrial planet formation. I ran dynamical simulations for 1 billion years using leftover planetesimals from the Grand Tack, Depleted Disc and Implantation models of terrestrial planet formation with the GENGA N-body integrator. I fit the cumulative impacts on the Earth and Mars using a function that is a sum of exponentials with different weighing factors and e-folding times. Most fits require three or four terms. The fitted timescales cluster around t1=10 Myr, t2=35 Myr, t3=100 Myr and t4&gt;200 Myr. I attribute them to dynamical losses of planetesimals through different mechanisms: high-eccentricity Earth crossers and the nu6 secular resonance, Earth crossers, Mars crossers, and objects leaking on to Mars crossing orbits from beyond Mars. I place a constraint on the initial population using the known Archean terrestrial spherule beds, and I conclude that the Archean impacts were mostly created by leftover planetesimals. The inferred mass in leftover planetesimals at the time of the Moon's formation was about 0.015 Earth masses. The third time constant is comparable to that of modern crater chronologies. As such, the crater chronologies are indicative of impacts by an ancient population of Mars crossers. The initial perihelion distribution of the leftovers is a major factor in setting the rate of decline: to reproduce the current crater chronologies the number of Earth crossers at the time of the Moon's formation had to be at most half of the Mars crossers. These results together place constraints on dynamical models of terrestrial planet formation.</description>
