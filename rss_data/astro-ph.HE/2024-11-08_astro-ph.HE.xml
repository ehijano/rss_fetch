      <title>Breaking boundaries: extending the orbit averaged Fokker-Planck equation inside the loss cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a new formulation of loss cone theory as a reaction-diffusion system, which is orbit averaged and accounts for loss cone events through a sink term. This formulation can recover the standard approach based on boundary conditions, and is derived from a simple physical model that overcomes many of the classical theoretical constraints. The relaxed distribution of disruptive orbits in phase space has a simple analytic form, and it predicts accurately the pericentre of tidal disruption events at disruption, better than other available formulas. This formulation of the problem is particularly suitable for including more physics in tidal disruptions and the analogous problem of gravitational captures, e.g. strong scatterings, gravitational waves emission, physical stellar collisions, and repeating partial disruptions - that can all act on timescale shorter than two-body relaxation. This allows to explore in a simple way dynamical effects that might affect tidal disruption events rates, tackling the expected vs observed rate tension and the over-representation of E+A galaxies.</description>

      <title>Variety of disc wind-driven explosions in massive rotating stars. II. Dependence on the progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the variance of supernova(SN)-like explosions associated with the core collapse of rotating massive stars into a black hole-accretion disc system under changes in the progenitor structure. Our model of the central engine evolves the black hole and the disc through the transfer of matter and angular momentum and includes the contribution of the disc wind. We perform two-dimensional, non-relativistic, hydrodynamics simulations using the open-source hydrodynamic code Athena++, for which we develop a method to calculate self-gravity for axially symmetric density distributions. For a fixed model of the wind injection, we explore the explosion characteristics for progenitors with zero-age main-sequence masses from 9 to 40 $M_\odot$ and different degrees of rotation. Our outcomes reveal a wide range of explosion energies with $E_\mathrm{expl}$ spanning from $\sim 0.3\times10^{51}$~erg to $ &gt; 8\times 10^{51}$~erg and ejecta mass $M_\mathrm{ej}$ from $\sim 0.6$ to $&gt; 10 M_\odot$. Our results are in agreement with some range of the observational data of stripped-envelope and high-energy SNe such as broad-lined type Ic SNe, but we measure a stronger correlation between $E_\mathrm{expl}$ and $M_\mathrm{ej}$. We also provide an estimate of the $^{56}$Ni mass produced in our models which goes from $\sim0.04\;M_\odot$ to $\sim 1.3\;M_\odot$. The $^{56}$Ni mass shows a correlation with the mass and the angular velocity of the progenitor: more massive and faster rotating progenitors tend to produce a higher amount of $^{56}$Ni. Finally, we present a criterion that allows the selection of a potential collapsar progenitor from the observed explosion energy.</description>

      <title>Probing the origin of the extended flaring branch of Z-type X-ray binaries GX 340+0 and GX 5-1 using AstroSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: `Z' type neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries typically show a `Z'-like three-branched track in their hardness intensity diagram. However, a few such `Z' sources show an additional branch known as the extended flaring branch (EFB). EFB has been poorly studied, and its origin is not known. It is thought to be an extension of the flaring branch (FB) or associated with Fe K$\alpha$ complex or an additional continuum due to the radiative recombination continuum (RRC) process. Using AstroSat observations, we have detected the EFB from two `Z' sources, GX 340+0 and GX 5-1, and performed a broadband spectral analysis in the 0.5-22 keV energy range. During EFB, both sources show the presence of a significant RRC component with absorption edges at $7.91^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ keV and $8.10^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$ keV, respectively along with blackbody radiation and thermal Comptonisation. No signature of RRC was detected during the FB, which is adjoint to the EFB. No Fe K$\alpha$ complex is detected. Interestingly, inside EFB dips of GX 5-1, for the first time, we have detected flaring events of 30-60s, which can be modelled with a single blackbody radiation. During the FB to EFB transition, an increase in the blackbody radius by a factor of 1.5-2 is observed in both sources. Our analysis strongly suggests that EFB is not an extension of FB or caused by the Fe K$\alpha$ complex. Rather, it is caused by a sudden expansion of the hot, thermalised boundary layer and subsequent rapid cooling.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary tracks of binary neutron star progenitors across cosmic times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of gravitational wave sources have advanced our knowledge about the formation of compact object binaries. At present, many questions about the stellar origins of binary neutron stars remain open. We explore the evolution of binary neutron star progenitors with the population synthesis code COSMIC. We identify three dominant evolutionary tracks to form neutron star binaries that merge within the age of the Universe: a scenario that includes a common envelope phase between the first neutron star and its companion, a scenario with almost equal-mass progenitors that evolve quasi-simultaneously and which features a double-core common envelope, and a scenario involving the accretion-induced collapse of an oxygen-neon white dwarf into a neutron star. We show that the distribution of time delays between stellar formation and binary neutron star merger at a given progenitor metallicity does not follow a power-law, but instead features a complex structure that reflects the progenitor properties and the relative contribution of each evolutionary track. We also explore the evolution of the merger rate density with redshift and show that the scenario involving the accretion-induced collapse could be dominant at high redshifts. These results can have important implications for the study of the chemical enrichment of galaxies in r-process elements produced in kilonovae; and of short gamma-ray bursts offsets in their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>Repeating transients in galactic nuclei: confronting observations with theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few years, a mysterious new class of astrophysical objects has been uncovered. These are spatially coincident with the nuclei of external galaxies and show X-ray variations that repeat on timescales of minutes to a month. They manifest in three different ways in the data: stable quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) and quasi-periodic outflows (QPOuts). QPOs are systems that show smooth recurrent X-ray brightness variations while QPEs are sudden changes that appear like eruptions. QPOuts represent systems that exhibit repeating outflows moving at mildly-relativistic velocities of about 0.1-0.3c, where c is the speed of light. Their underlying physical mechanism is a topic of heated debate, with most models proposing that they originate either from instabilities within the inner accretion flow or from orbiting objects. There is a huge excitement especially from the latter class of models as it has been argued that some repeating systems could host extreme mass-ratio inspirals, potentially detectable with upcoming space-based gravitational wave interferometers. Consequently, paving the path for an era of "persistent" multi-messenger astronomy. Here we summarize the recent findings on the topics, including the newest observational data, various physical models and their numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Identifying a point-symmetrical morphology in the core-collapse supernova remnant W44</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I identify a point-symmetrical morphology in the core-collapse supernova remnant (CCSNR) W44 compatible with shaping by three or more pairs of jets in the jittering jet explosion mechanism (JJEM). Motivated by recent identifications of point-symmetrical morphologies in CCSNRs and their match to the JJEM, I revisit the morphological classification of CCSNR W44. I examine a radio map of W44 and find the outer bright rim of the radio map to possess a point-symmetric structure compatible with shaping by two energetic pairs of opposite jets rather than an S-shaped morphology shaped by a precessing pair of jets. An inner pair of filaments might hint at a third powerful pair of jets. More pairs of jets were involved in the explosion process. This study adds to the growing evidence that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Numerical Studies of the Collapse of Dense Clouds Induced by Herbig-Haro Stellar Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of Herbig-Haro jets on initiating star formation in dense environments. When molecular clouds are nearing gravitational instability, the impact of a protostellar jet could provide the impetus needed to catalyse star formation. A high-energy-density experiment was carried out at the LULI2000 laser facility, where a supersonic jet generated by a nanosecond laser was used to compress a foam or plastic ball, mimicking the interaction of a Herbig-Haro jet with a molecular cloud. Simulations using the 3D radiation hydrodynamics code TROLL provided comprehensive data for analysing ball compression and calculating jet characteristics. After applying scaling laws, similarities between stellar and experimental jets were explored. Diagnostic simulations, including density gradient, emission and X-ray radiographies, showed strong agreement with experimental data. The results of the experiment, supported by simulations, demonstrated that the impact of a protostellar jet on a molecular cloud could reduce the Bonnor-Ebert mass by approximately 9%, thereby initiating collapse.</description>

      <title>Nailing down the theoretical uncertainties of $\overline{\rm D}$ spectrum produced from dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of cosmic antideuterons ($\overline{\rm D}$) at kinetic energies below a few GeV/n could provide a smoking gun signature for dark matter (DM). However, the theoretical uncertainties of coalescence models have represented so far one of the main limiting factors for precise predictions of the $\overline{\rm D}$ flux. In this Letter we present a novel calculation of the $\overline{\rm D}$ source spectra, based on the Wigner formalism, for which we implement the Argonne $v_{18}$ antideuteron wavefunction that does not have any free parameters related to the coalescence process. We show that the Argonne Wigner model excellently reproduces the $\overline{\rm D}$ multiplicity measured by ALEPH at the $Z$-boson pole, which is usually adopted to tune the coalescence models based on different approaches. Our analysis is based on Pythia~8 Monte Carlo event generator and the state-of-the-art Vincia shower algorithm. We succeed, with our model, to reduce the current theoretical uncertainty on the prediction of the $\overline{\rm D}$ source spectra to a few percent, for $\overline{\rm D}$ kinetic energies relevant to DM searches with GAPS and AMS, and for DM masses above a few tens of GeV. This result implies that the theoretical uncertainties due to the coalescence process are no longer the main limiting factor in the predictions. We provide the tabulated source spectra for all the relevant DM annihilation/decay channels and DM masses between 5 GeV and 100 TeV, on the CosmiXs github repository (https://github.com/ajueid/CosmiXs.git).</description>

      <title>Lack of emission lines in the optical spectra of SAX J1808.4-3658 during reflaring of the 2019 outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectroscopy of the accreting X-ray binary and millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. These observations are the first to be obtained during a reflaring phase. We collected spectroscopic data during the beginning of reflaring of the 2019 outburst and we compare them to previous datasets, taken at different epochs both of the same outburst and across the years. In order to do so, we also present spectra of the source taken during quiescence in 2007, one year before the next outburst. We made use of data taken by the Very Large Telescope (VLT) X-shooter spectrograph on August 31, 2019, three weeks after the outburst peak. For flux calibration, we used photometric data taken during the same night by the 1m telescopes from the Las Cumbres Observatory network that are located in Chile. We compare our spectra to the quiescent data taken by the VLT-FORS1 spectrograph in September 2007. We inspected the spectral energy distribution by fitting our data with a multi-colour accretion disk model and sampled the posterior probability density function for the model parameters with a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We find the optical spectra of the 2019 outburst to be unusually featureless, with no emission lines present despite the high resolution of the instrument. Fitting the UV-optical spectral energy distribution with a disk plus irradiated star model results in a very large value for the inner disk radius of $\sim 5130 \pm 240$ km, which could suggest that the disk has been emptied of material during the outburst, possibly accounting for the emission-less spectra. Alternatively, the absence of emission lines could be due to a significant contribution of the jet emission at optical wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Modelling of the atomic lines emission of fast moving pulsar nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bow shocks generated by pulsars moving through weakly ionized interstellar medium (ISM) produce emission dominated by non-equilibrium atomic transitions. These bow shocks are primarily observed as H$_\alpha$ nebulae. We developed a package, named Shu, that calculates non-LTE intensity maps in more than 150 spectral lines, taking into account geometrical properties of the pulsars' motion and lines of sight. We argue here that atomic (CI, NI, OI) and ionic (SII, NII, OIII, NeIV) transitions can be used as complementary and sensitive probes of ISM. We perform self-consistent 2D relativistic hydrodynamic calculations of the bow shock structure and generate non-LTE emissivity maps, combining global dynamics of relativistic flows, and detailed calculations of the non-equilibrium ionization states. We find that though typically H$_\alpha$ emission is dominant, spectral fluxes in OIII, SII and NII may become comparable for relatively slowly moving pulsars. Overall, morphology of non-LTE emission, especially of the ionic species, is a sensitive probe of the density structures of the ISM.</description>

      <title>Impact of the relativistic Cowling approximation on shear and interface modes of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate shear and interface modes excited in neutron stars with an elastic crust in the full general relativistic framework and compare them to the results obtained within the relativistic Cowling approximation. We observe that the Cowling approximation has virtually no impact on the frequencies or the eigenfunctions of the shear modes; in contrast, the interface modes that arise due to the discontinuities of the shear modulus experience a shift in frequency by several percent when applying the Cowling approximation. Furthermore, we extend a scheme based on the properties of Breit-Wigner resonances, which allows us to estimate the damping times of slowly damped modes; our extension can provide an estimation of the damping time even if the features of the Breit-Wigner resonance are incomplete or if some of them violate the underlying linearity assumption. The proposed scheme is also computationally less expensive and numerically more robust and we provide accurate estimates as well as lower bounds for damping times of shear and interface modes.</description>

      <title>MAUVE: An Ultraviolet Astrophysics Probe Mission Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the mission concept "Mission to Analyze the UltraViolet universE" (MAUVE), a wide-field spectrometer and imager conceived during the inaugural NASA Astrophysics Mission Design School. MAUVE responds to the 2023 Announcement of Opportunity for Probe-class missions, with a budget cap of \$1 billion, and would hypothetically launch in 2031. However, the formulation of MAUVE was an educational exercise and the mission is not being developed further. The Principal Investigator-led science of MAUVE aligns with the priorities outlined in the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey, enabling new characterizations of exoplanet atmospheres, the early-time light curves of some of the universe's most explosive transients, and the poorly-understood extragalactic background light. Because the Principal Investigator science occupies 30% of the observing time available during the mission's 5 yr lifespan, we provide an observing plan that would allow for 70% of the observing time to be used for General Observer programs, with community-solicited proposals. The onboard detector (THISTLE) claims significant heritage from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on Hubble, but extends its wavelength range down to the extreme UV. We note that MAUVE would be the first satellite in decades with the ability to access this regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. MAUVE has a field of view of 900" x 900"  a photometric sensitivity extending to $m_{UV}\leq 24$, and a resolving power of $R\sim1000$. This paper provides full science and mission traceability matrices for this concept, and also outlines cost and scheduling timelines aimed at enabling a within-budget mission and an on-time launch.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent multidimensional Penrose process driven by magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical observations and numerical simulations are providing increasing evidence that resistive effects in plasmas around black holes play an important role in determining the phenomenology observed from these objects. In this spirit, we present a general approach to the study of a Penrose process driven by plasmoids that are produced at reconnection sites along current sheets. Our formalism is meant to determine the physical conditions that make a plasmoid-driven Penrose process energetically viable and can be applied to scenarios that are matter- or magnetic-field-dominated, that is, in magnetohydrodynamical or force-free descriptions. Our approach is genuinely multidimensional and hence allows one to explore conditions that are beyond the ones explored so far and that have been restricted to the equatorial plane, thus providing a direct contact with numerical simulations exhibiting an intense reconnection activity outside the equatorial plane. Finally, our analysis does not resort to ad-hoc assumptions about the dynamics of the plasma or adopts oversimplified and possibly unrealistic models to describe the kinematics of the plasma. On the contrary, we study the dynamics of the plasma starting from a well-known configuration, that of an equilibrium torus with a purely toroidal magnetic field whose "ergobelt", i.e. the portion penetrating the ergosphere, naturally provides a site to compute, self-consistently, the occurrence of reconnection and estimate the energetics of a plasmoid-driven Penrose process.</description>

      <title>Identifying Eccentricity in Binary Black Hole mergers using a Harmonic Decomposition of the Gravitational Waveform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the gravitational waveform emitted by a binary on an eccentric orbit can be naturally decomposed into a series of harmonics. The frequencies of these harmonics depend upon the radial frequency, $f_{\mathrm{r}}$, determined by the time to return to apoapsis, and the azimuthal frequency, $f_{\phi}$, determined by the time to complete one orbit relative to a fixed axis. These frequencies differ due to periapsis advance. Restricting to the (2, 2) multipole, we find that the frequencies can be expressed as $f = 2 f_{\phi} + k f_{\mathrm{r}}$. We introduce a straightforward method of generating these harmonics and show that the majority of the signal power is contained in the $k= -1, 0, 1$ harmonics for moderate eccentricities. We demonstrate that by filtering these three leading harmonics, we are able to obtain a good estimate of the orbital eccentricity from their relative amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Detecting Unmodeled, Source-dependent Signals in Gravitational Waves with SCoRe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New physics and systematic errors can lead to deviations between the models used to analyze gravitational wave data and the actual signal. Such deviations will generally be correlated between detectors and manifest differently across the gravitational wave source parameter space. The previously introduced \ttt{SCoRe} framework uses these features to distinguish these deviations from noise and extract physical information from their source-dependent variation. In this work, we further analyze the hierarchical component of the method -- we include the expected dependence of the deviations on the source parameters into the inference process, obtaining more physically informative results. As a specific example, we study a deviation that scales as a power law of the mass scale of black hole binaries -- as, for example, in Effective Field Theory of gravity. We show how the signal-to-noise ratio of the cross-correlated residual power can be used to recover the power-law index. We demonstrate how both the distribution in source and deviation strength determine which region of source parameter space influences the inference most. Finally, we forecast the constraint on the power law index for a network of two Cosmic Explorer-like detectors with a year of observation period.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Amplification of Chiral Gravitational Waves and the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological vacuum amplification of gravitational waves in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We develop a comprehensive framework to compute graviton production induced by the parity violating Pontryagin coupling and study its imprint on the stochastic gravitational wave background energy power spectrum. We explore gravitational vacuum amplification in four concrete scenarios for the evolution of the Chern-Simons pseudoscalar. We show that a parity-violating contribution dominates over an initially flat spectrum when the velocity of the pseudoscalar quickly interpolates between two asymptotically constant values or when it is nonvanishing and constant through a finite period of time. This is also the case when we parametrize the pseudoscalar evolution by a perfect fluid with radiation- and dust-like equations of state for large enough values of its energy density. The resulting spectra are compared with the sensitivity curves of current and future gravitational wave observational searches.</description>

      <title>X-Ray, UV, and Optical Observations of Proxima Centauri's Stellar Cycle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proxima Cen (GJ 551; dM5.5e) is one of only about a dozen fully convective stars known to have a stellar cycle, and the only one to have long-term X-ray monitoring. A previous analysis found that X-ray and mid-UV observations, particularly two epochs of data from Swift, were consistent with a well sampled 7 yr optical cycle seen in ASAS data, but not convincing by themselves. The present work incorporates several years of new ASAS-SN optical data and an additional five years of Swift XRT and UVOT observations, with Swift observations now spanning 2009 to 2021 and optical coverage from late 2000. X-ray observations by XMM-Newton and Chandra are also included. Analysis of the combined data, which includes modeling and adjustments for stellar contamination in the optical and UV, now reveals clear cyclic behavior in all three wavebands with a period of 8.0 yr. We also show that UV and X-ray intensities are anti-correlated with optical brightness variations caused by the cycle and by rotational modulation, discuss possible indications of two coronal mass ejections, and provide updated results for the previous finding of a simple correlation between X-ray cycle amplitude and Rossby number over a wide range of stellar types and ages.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray in light of the Lorentz Invariance Violation Effects within the Proton Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tiny LIV effects may origin from typical space-time structures in quantum gravity theories. So, it is reasonable to anticipate that tiny LIV effects can be present in the proton sector. We find that, with tiny LIV effects in the proton sector, the threshold energy of photon that can engage in the photopion interactions with protons can be pushed to much higher scales (of order 0.1 eV to 10^3 eV) in comparison with the case without LIV. Therefore, the proton specie in UHECRs can possibly travel a long distance without being attenuated by the photopion processes involving the CMB photons, possibly explain the observed beyond-GZK cut-off events. We also find that, when both the leading order and next leading order LIV effects are present, the higher order LIV terms can possibly lead to discontinuous GZK cut-off energy bands. Observation of beyond-GZK cut-off UHECR events involving protons can possibly constrain the scale of LIV. Such UHECR events can act as a exquisitely probe of LIV effects and shed new lights on the UV LIV theories near the Planck scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the equation for pressure within a neutron star, taking into account a non-zero cosmological constant ($\Lambda$). We then examine the stability of the neutron star's equilibrium state in the presence of cosmological constant. Our analysis shows that the theorem used to assess the stability of stellar structures at equilibrium remains applicable to neutron stars even when a cosmological constant is considered. We further numerically solve the stellar structure equations and determine the mass of neutron star using different equations of state (EOS). Moreover, we observe that the value of the cosmological constant ($\Lambda \geq 10^{-11} \rm m^{-2}$) causes a significant change in the mass-radius relationship of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Rubin ToO 2024: Envisioning the Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST Target of Opportunity program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at Vera C. Rubin Observatory is planned to begin in the Fall of 2025. The LSST survey cadence has been designed via a community-driven process regulated by the Survey Cadence Optimization Committee (SCOC), which recommended up to 3% of the observing time to carry out Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations. Experts from the scientific community, Rubin Observatory personnel, and members of the SCOC were brought together to deliver a recommendation for the implementation of the ToO program during a workshop held in March 2024. Four main science cases were identified: gravitational wave multi-messenger astronomy, high energy neutrinos, Galactic supernovae, and small potentially hazardous asteroids possible impactors. Additional science cases were identified and briefly addressed in the documents, including lensed or poorly localized gamma-ray bursts and twilight discoveries. Trigger prioritization, automated response, and detailed strategies were discussed for each science case. This document represents the outcome of the Rubin ToO 2024 workshop, with additional contributions from members of the Rubin Science Collaborations. The implementation of the selection criteria and strategies presented in this document has been endorsed in the SCOC Phase 3 Recommendations document (PSTN-056). Although the ToO program is still to be finalized, this document serves as a baseline plan for ToO observations with the Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>The impact of periastron passage on the X-ray and optical properties of the Symbiotic System R Aquarii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-epoch Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of the symbiotic system R Aquarii (R Aqr) spanning 22 yr are analysed by means of a reflection model produced by an accretion disc. This methodology helps dissecting the contribution from different components in the X-ray spectra of R Aqr: the soft emission from the jet and extended emission, the heavily-extinguished plasma component of the boundary layer and the reflection contribution, which naturally includes the 6.4 keV Fe fluorescent line. The evolution with time of the different components is studied for epochs between 2000 Sep and 2022 Dec, and it is found that the fluxes of the boundary layer and that of the reflecting component increase as the stellar components in R Aqr approach periastron passage, a similar behaviour is exhibited by the shocked plasma produced by the precessing jet. Using publicly available optical and UV data we are able to study the evolution of the mass-accretion rate $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}$ and the wind accretion efficiency $\eta$ during periastron. These exhibit a small degree of variability with median values of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}$=7.3$\times10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\eta$=7$\times10^{-3}$. We compare our estimations with predictions from a modified Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion scenario.</description>

      <title>No rungs attached: A distance-ladder free determination of the Hubble constant through type II supernova spectral modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ongoing discrepancy in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates obtained through local distance ladder methods and early universe observations poses a significant challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM model, suggesting potential new physics. Type II supernovae (SNe II) offer a promising technique for determining $H_0$ in the local universe independently of the traditional distance ladder approach, opening up a complimentary path for testing this discrepancy. We aim to provide the first $H_0$ estimate using the tailored expanding photosphere method (EPM) applied to SNe II, made possible by recent advancements in spectral modelling that enhance its precision and efficiency. Our tailored EPM measurement utilizes a spectral emulator to interpolate between radiative transfer models calculated with TARDIS, allowing us to fit supernova spectra efficiently and derive self-consistent values for luminosity-related parameters. We apply the method on public data for ten SNe II at redshifts between 0.01 and 0.04. Our analysis demonstrates that the tailored EPM allows for $H_0$ measurements with precision comparable to the most competitive established techniques, even when applied to literature data not designed for cosmological applications. We find an independent $H_0$ value of $74.9\pm1.9$ (stat) km/s/Mpc, which is consistent with most current local measurements. Considering dominant sources of systematic effects, we conclude that our systematic uncertainty is comparable to or less than the current statistical uncertainty. This proof-of-principle study highlights the potential of the tailored EPM as a robust and precise tool for investigating the Hubble tension independently of the local distance ladder. Observations of SNe II tailored to $H_0$ estimation can make this an even more powerful tool by improving the precision and by allowing us to better understand and control systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Bayesian real-time classification of multi-messenger electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of the electromagnetic radiation produced during the merger, compact binary coalescences with neutron stars may result in multi-messenger observations. In order to follow up on the gravitational-wave signal with electromagnetic telescopes, it is critical to promptly identify the properties of these sources. This identification must rely on the properties of the progenitor source, such as the component masses and spins, as determined by low-latency detection pipelines in real time. The output of these pipelines, however, might be biased, which could decrease the accuracy of parameter recovery. Machine learning algorithms are used to correct this bias. In this work, we revisit this problem and discuss two new implementations of supervised machine learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest, which are able to predict the presence of a neutron star and post-merger matter remnant in low-latency compact binary coalescence searches across different search pipelines and data sets. Additionally, we present a novel approach for calculating the Bayesian probabilities for these two metrics. Instead of metric scores derived from binary machine learning classifiers, our scheme is designed to provide the astronomy community well-defined probabilities. This would deliver a more direct and easily interpretable product to assist electromagnetic telescopes in deciding whether to follow up on gravitational-wave events in real time.</description>

      <title>Precession and Split of Tilted, Geometrically Thin Accretion Disk: an Analytical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been observed that many relativistic jets display a kind of cork-screw-like precession. Numerical simulations has suggested that such kind of precession may originate from the precession of the disk. In this work, we introduce an analytical model to describe the precession and split of a tilted, geometrically thin disk. We consider the Lense-Thirring effect from the central (primary) black hole (BH) and the gravitational effect from the companion (secondary) BH far away from the center, both of which could induce the precession of the accretion disk around the spin axis of central black hole. We propose the splitting conditions that when the rate of viscous diffusion cannot catch up with the dynamical frequency at a certain layer of fluid, the disk would split into two parts which precess independently. We presume that the precessions of the inner and outer disks are in accord with the rotation and precession of jet, respectively. By matching the frequencies of the disks to the observed frequencies of jet in the cork-screw-like precession and considering the splitting condition, we are allowed to read four parameters, the innermost radius ($r_{\rm in}$), the outermost radius ($r_{\rm out}$) of the disk, the initial splitting radius ($r_{\rm sp,0}$), and the inflow speed magnitude($\beta$), of the disk. We apply this model to OJ 287. Moreover, considering the inward shrinking of the disks, we find the time variation of the precession angle of jet. This time variation presents a unique feature of our model, which could be distinguishable in the future observation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate formation channels for merging binary black holes (BBHs) in GWTC-3, with a dedicated semiparametric population model. The model first describes or excludes a high-spin (with magnitudes of $\sim0.7$) and high-mass (ranging in $\sim 20-80M_{\odot}$) subpopulation, which was identified by previous works and can be interpreted as hierarchical mergers. We find that the rest of BBH population can be categorized into two subpopulations with different mass and mass-ratio distributions, as indicated by a Bayes factor of $\ln\mathcal{B}=1.8$. One subpopulation, characterized by nearly aligned spins and consistent with isolated-field formation, likely dominates the 10-solar-mass peak in the primary-mass function. The other subpopulation, with isotropic spins and consistent with the dynamical channels, shows a stronger preference for symmetric pairing, and mainly contributes to the 35-solar-mass peak in the primary-mass function. Note that the Bayes factor is not high enough with the currently available data, so that the case of a single population is still acceptable. Additionally, we compare the mass distributions between merging BBHs and black holes (BHs) in high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). We find that the primary mass of the aligned subpopulation is slightly lighter than those of the HMXB BHs, while the isotropic subpopulation is consistent with the HMXB BHs, if the power-law index of its mass function is shifted by 2, as indicated by the dynamical formation channels. However, the spin magnitudes of both subpopulations are significantly smaller than those of the HMXB BHs.</description>

      <title>{\it Insight}-HXMT View of the BHC Swift J1727.8-1613 during its outburst in 2023</title>

Abstract: The transient Galactic black hole candidate Swift\,J1727.8-1613 went through an outburst for the very first time in August 2023 and lasted for almost 6 months. We study the timing and spectral properties of this source using publicly available archival {\it Insight}-HXMT data for the first 10 observation IDs that last from MJD 60181 to 60198 with a total of 92 exposures for all three energy bands. We have detected quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in a frequency range of $0.21 \pm 0.01$ - $1.86 \pm 0.01$ Hz by fitting the power density spectrum. Based on the model-fitted parameters and properties of the QPOs, we classify them as type-C in nature. We also conclude that the origin of the QPOs could be the shock instabilities in the transonic advective accretion flows around black holes. The spectral analysis was performed using simultaneous data from the three on-board instruments LE, ME, and HE of \textit{Insight}-HXMT in the broad energy band of $2-150 $ keV. To achieve the best fit, spectral fitting required a combination of models e.g. interstellar absorption, power-law, multi-color disk-blackbody continuum, Gaussian emission/absorption, and reflection by neutral material. From the spectral properties, we found that the source was in an intermediate state at the start of the analysis period and was transitioning to the softer states. The inner edge of the accretion disk moved inward in progressive days following the spectral nature. We found that the source has a high inclination of $78^\circ-86^\circ$. The hydrogen column density from the model fitting varied in the range of $(0.12 \pm 0.02 - 0.39 \pm 0.08)\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Collisionless conduction in a high-beta plasma: a collision operator for whistler turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The regulation of electron heat transport in high-beta, weakly collisional, magnetized plasma is investigated. A temperature gradient oriented along a mean magnetic field can induce a kinetic heat-flux-driven whistler instability (HWI), which back-reacts on the transport by scattering electrons and impeding their flow. Previous analytical and numerical studies have shown that the heat flux for the saturated HWI scales as the inverse of electron beta. These numerical studies, however, had limited scale separation and consequently large fluctuation amplitudes, which calls into question their relevance at astrophysical scales. To this end, we perform a series of particle-in-cell simulations of the HWI across a range of electron beta and temperature-gradient length scales under two different physical setups. The saturated heat flux in all of our simulations follows the expected inverse-electron-beta scaling, supporting the robustness of the result. We also use our simulation results to develop and implement several methods to construct an effective collision operator for whistler turbulence. The results point to an issue with the standard quasi-linear explanation of HWI saturation, which is analogous to the well-known 90-degree scattering problem in the cosmic ray community. Despite this limitation, the methods developed here can serve as a blueprint for future work seeking to characterize the effective collisionality caused by kinetic instabilities.</description>

      <title>Studying geometry of the ultraluminous X-ray pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 using X-ray and optical polarimetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovery of pulsations from a number of ULXs proved that accretion onto neutron stars can produce luminosities exceeding the Eddington limit by several orders of magnitude. The conditions necessary to achieve such high luminosities as well as the exact geometry of the accretion flow in the neutron star vicinity are, however, a matter of debate. The pulse phase-resolved polarization measurements that became possible with the launch of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) can be used to determine the pulsar geometry and its orientation relative to the orbital plane. They provide an avenue to test different theoretical models of ULX pulsars. In this paper we present the results of three IXPE observations of the first Galactic ULX pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 during its 2023 outburst. We find strong variations in the polarization characteristics with the pulsar phase. The average polarization degree increases from about 5% to 15% as the flux dropped by a factor of three in the course of the outburst. The polarization angle (PA) as a function of the pulsar phase shows two peaks in the first two observations, but changes to a characteristic sawtooth pattern in the remaining data set. This is not consistent with a simple rotating vector model. Assuming the existence of an additional constant polarized component, we were able to fit the three observations with a common rotating vector model and obtain constraints on the pulsar geometry. In particular, we find the pulsar angular momentum inclination with respect to the line of sight of 15-40 deg, the magnetic obliquity of 60-80 deg, and the pulsar spin position angle of -50 deg, which significantly differs from the constant component PA of about 10 deg. Combining these X-ray measurements with the optical PA, we find evidence for at least a 30 deg misalignment between the pulsar angular momentum and the binary orbital axis.</description>

Abstract: We find the inferred properties of the putative gravitational wave background in the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) to be in better agreement with theoretical expectations under the improved noise model. In particular, if the gravitational wave background is from supermassive black hole binaries, the observed gravitational wave emission is the dominant source of the binary energy loss, with no evidence of environmental effects, eccentric orbits, or an overabundance of sources. Our improved noise model addresses the misspecification of noise priors which impacts the inference of temporal correlations of the background. We also find evidence for epoch-correlated temporally-uncorrelated (white) noise which has a stronger impact on the measurement in the presence of Hellings-Downs correlations of the background.</description>

      <title>A search for persistent radio sources toward repeating fast radio bursts discovered by CHIME/FRB</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of persistent radio sources (PRSs) coincident with two repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) supports FRB theories requiring a compact central engine. However, deep non-detections in other cases highlight the diversity of repeating FRBs and their local environments. Here, we perform a systematic search for radio sources towards 37 CHIME/FRB repeaters using their arcminute localizations and a combination of archival surveys and targeted observations. Through multi-wavelength analysis of individual radio sources, we identify two (20181030A-S1 and 20190417A-S1) for which we disfavor an origin of either star formation or an active galactic nucleus in their host galaxies and thus consider them candidate PRSs. We do not find any associated PRSs for the majority of the repeating FRBs in our sample. For 8 FRB fields with Very Large Array imaging, we provide deep limits on the presence of PRSs that are 2--4 orders of magnitude fainter than the PRS associated with FRB\,20121102A. Using Very Large Array Sky Survey imaging of all 37 fields, we constrain the rate of luminous ($\gtrsim$10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$) PRSs associated with repeating FRBs to be low. Within the context of FRB-PRS models, we find that 20181030A-S1 and 20190417A-S1 can be reasonably explained within the context of magnetar, hypernebulae, gamma-ray burst afterglow, or supernova ejecta models -- although we note that both sources follow the radio luminosity versus rotation measure relationship predicted in the nebula model framework. Future observations will be required to both further characterize and confirm the association of these PRS candidates with the FRBs.</description>

Abstract: The paper presents a theoretical model describing the full power spectra of synchrotron radiation generated by relativistic electrons in a turbulent magnetic field. Using the theoretical model, numerical calculations of the complete power spectra of synchrotron radiation were performed for a turbulent field generated by the harmonic method. Additionally, a model sky map was constructed, demonstrating the structure of the spatial inhomogeneity of the synchrotron radiation power distribution as seen by an observer.</description>

      <title>One-loop Gravitational Bremsstrahlung and Waveforms from a Heavy-Mass Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06111v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a heavy-mass effective field theory (HEFT), we study gravitational-wave emission in the scattering of two spinless black holes or neutron stars of arbitrary masses at next-to-leading order in the Post-Minkowskian expansion. We compute the contributions to the one-loop scattering amplitude with four scalars and one graviton which are relevant to the calculation of the waveforms, also presenting expressions of classical tree-level amplitudes with four scalars and up to two radiated gravitons. The latter are obtained using a novel on-shell recursion relation for classical amplitudes with four scalars and an arbitrary number of gravitons. Our one-loop five-point amplitude is expressed in terms of a single family of master integrals with the principal value prescription for linearised massive propagators, which we evaluate using differential equations. In our HEFT approach all hyper-classical iterations and quantum corrections to the amplitude are dropped at the diagrammatic level, thereby computing directly contributions to classical physics. Our result exhibits the expected factorisation of infrared divergences, the correct soft limits, and highly nontrivial cancellations of spurious poles. Finally, using our amplitude result we compute numerically the corresponding next-to-leading corrections to the spectral waveforms and the far-field time-domain waveforms using the Newman-Penrose scalar $\Psi_4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for Galactic binary gravitational waves is a critical challenge for future space-based gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. We propose an innovative approach to simultaneously explore gravitational waves originating from Galactic binaries by developing a new Local Maxima Particle Swarm Optimization (LMPSO) algorithm. Our method identifies local maxima in the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic and applies astrophysical models and the properties of the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic within parameter space to uncover Galactic binary gravitational wave signals in the dataset. This new approach effectively addresses the inaccuracies often associated with signal subtraction contamination, a challenge for traditional iterative subtraction methods, particularly when dealing with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals (e.g., SNR $&lt;$ 15). We also account for the effects of overlapping signals and degeneracy noise. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we use residuals from the LISA mock data challenge (LDC1-4), where 10,982 injected sources with SNR $\ge$ 15 have been removed. For the remaining low-SNR sources (SNR $&lt;$ 15), our method efficiently identifies 6,508 signals, achieving a 63.2\% detection rate.</description>

      <title>Probing protoneutron stars with gamma-ray axionscopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) coupled to nucleons can be efficiently produced in the interior of protoneutron stars (PNS) during supernova (SN) explosions. If these ALPs are also coupled to photons they can convert into gamma rays in the Galactic magnetic field. This SN-induced gamma-ray burst can be observable by gamma-ray telescopes like ${\textit Fermi}$-LAT if the SN is in the field of view of the detector. We show that the observable gamma-ray spectrum is sensitive to the production processes in the SN core. In particular, if the nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung is the dominant axion production channel, one expects a thermal spectrum with average energy $E_a \simeq 50$ MeV. In this case the gamma-ray spectrum observation allows for the reconstruction of the PNS temperature. In case of a sizable pion abundance in the SN core, one expects a second spectral component peaked at $E_a\simeq 200$ MeV due to axion pionic processes. We demonstrate that, through a dedicated LAT analysis, we can detect the presence of this pionic contribution, showing that the detection of the spectral shape of the gamma-ray signal represents a unique probe of the pion abundance in the PNS.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the charge of the graviton using gravitational wave observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the graviton possesses a non-zero charge $q_g$, gravitational waves (GW) originating from astrophysical sources would experience an additional time delay due to intergalactic magnetic fields. This would result in a modification of the phase evolution of the observed GW signal similar to the effect induced by a massive graviton. As a result, we can reinterpret the most recent upper limits on the graviton's mass as constraints on the joint mass-charge parameter space, finding $|q_g|/{e} &lt; 3\times 10^{-34}$ where $e$ represents the charge of an electron. Additionally, we illustrate that a charged graviton would introduce a constant phase difference in the gravitational waves detected by two spatially separated GW detectors due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Using the non-observation of such a phase difference for the GW event GW190814, we establish a mass-independent constraint $|q_g|/e &lt; 2\times 10^{-26}$. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first-ever bounds on the charge of the graviton. We also discuss various caveats involved in our measurements and prospects for strengthening these bounds with future GW observations.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction from a Kerr Black Hole via Magnetic Reconnection within the Plunging Region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection within a highly magnetized plasma has been seen as a viable mechanism to extract the energy from a rotating black hole, as it can generate negative energy plasmoids in the ergoregion. For a typical accreting black hole, the ergoregion is filled with bulk plasma plunging from the innermost-stable-circular orbit (ISCO). In this study, we present an analytical study of the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection process in the plunging region. In contrast to the toroidal plasma, where the magnetic field cannot be derived from the MHD scheme, the magnetic field in the plunging plasma was determined by the ideal-MHD condition. We derive the global magnetic field structure in a fast reconnection model, and we read the expressions for the energies of plasmoids ejected from the reconnection region, for general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes. Then, we demonstrate the behaviors of ejected energies varying with the reconnection locations in the Kerr spacetime, and identify the region where a negative-energy plasmoid can be produced. We find that for a certain magnetization there exists a critical value of the black hole spin, beyond which the energy extraction can occur, and the energy extraction is most efficient for the near-extreme black hole. Moreover, we study the conditions necessary for a plasmoid with positive energy to escape to the infinity, a crucial requirement for effective energy extractions. Considering the escaping conditions, we provide the parameter space in the radius-spin plane in which the energy extraction mechanism is effective.</description>

      <title>Neutrino emission in cold neutron stars: Bremsstrahlung and modified urca rates reexamined</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino emission in cold neutron stars is dominated by the modified urca (murca) process and nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. The standard emission rates were provided by Friman and Maxwell in 1979, effectively based on a chiral Lagrangian framework with pion and rho meson exchange, supplemented by Landau parameters to describe short-range interactions. We reevaluate these rates within the same framework, correcting several errors and removing unnecessary simplifications, notably the triangular approximation - where the Fermi momenta of protons and leptons negligible compared to that of neutrons - in MURCA, and quantify their importance. The impact of rho meson exchange, previously argued to cancel with interference effects, is actually quite relevant. Altogether, the cooling rates are reduced by as much as a factor 2. We provide comprehensive analytical formulas encompassing all contributions, designed for straightforward numerical implementation. Our results are particularly relevant for studies of physics beyond the standard model, where the emission of new particles - such as axions - is typically computed within the same framework we adopt here.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Raining on DUNE and Other Large Volume Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct detection is a powerful means of searching for particle physics evidence of dark matter (DM) heavier than about a GeV with $\mathcal O(kiloton)$ volume, low-threshold detectors. In many scenarios, some fraction of the DM may be boosted to large velocities enhancing and generally modifying possible detection signatures. We investigate the scenario where 100% of the DM is boosted at the Earth due to new attractive long-range forces. This leads to two main improvements in detection capabilities: 1) the large boost allows for detectable signatures of DM well below a GeV at large-volume neutrino detectors, such as DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and JUNO, as possible DM detectors, and 2) the flux at the Earth's surface is enhanced by a focusing effect. In addition, the model leads to a significant anisotropy in the signal with the DM flowing dominantly vertically at the Earth's surface instead of the typical approximately isotropic DM signal. We develop the theory behind this model and also calculate realistic constraints using a detailed GENIE simulation of the signal inside detectors.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection: the plunging bulk plasma and orientation angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconection provides a new avenue to extract energy from a rotating black hole in astrophysical scenarios. There have been many works studying the feasibility of extracting energy via magnetic reconnection in the scheme of magnetohydrodynamics. However, most of them focused on circularly flowing bulk plasma only, and the influence of orientation angle, the angle between flowing direction of bulk plasma and ejection direction of plasmoids, was never carefully considered. In this work, we would like to study the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection, via the so-called Comisso-Asenjo process specifically, in the plunging plasma. More importantly, we analyze the influence of orientation angle in depth. Actually, we consider the magnetic reconnection occurring in bulk plasma with two kinds of streamlines, one being the circular flow and the other being the plunging flow from the ISCO. We find that the plunging plasma has higher energy-extraction efficiency. Moreover, we notice that it is favorable for energy extraction when the orientation angle is suitably increased if the bulk plasma plunges. We further define the covering factor. Under the assumption that the magnetic reconnection occurs equally probable along any direction on any position within ergosphere, this value help us to primitively judge the probability of energy extraction via magnetic reconnection, through which we conclude that the plunging bulk plasma is much more capable in energy extraction than the circularly flowing one.</description>

      <title>Planet Migration in Windy Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accretion of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) could be driven by MHD disc winds rather than turbulent viscosity. With a dynamical prescription for angular momentum transport induced by disc winds, we perform 2D simulations of PPDs to systematically investigate the rate and direction of planet migration in a windy disc. We find that the the strength of disc winds influences the corotation region similarly to the "desaturation" effect of viscosity. The magnitude and direction of torque depend sensitively on the hierarchy between the radial advection timescale across the horseshoe due to disc wind $\tau_{\rm dw}$, the horsehoe libration timescale $\tau_{\rm lib}$ and U-turn timescale $\tau_{\rm U-turn}$. Initially, as wind strength increases and the advection timescale shortens, a non-linear horseshoe drag emerges when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm lib}$, which tends to drive strong outward migration. Subsequently, the drag becomes linear and planets typically still migrate inward when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm U-turn} \sim \tau_{\rm lib}h$, where $h$ is the disc aspect ratio. For a planet with mass ratio of $\sim 10^{-5}$, the zone of outward migration sandwiched between inner and outer inward migration zones corresponds to $\sim $ 10-100 au in a PPD with accretion rates between $10^{-8}$ and $10^{-7}$ $M_\odot \text{yr}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Kinematic censorship and high energy particle collisions in the Schwarzschild background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider near-horizon collisions between two particles moving freely in the Schwarzschild metric in the region outside the horizon. One of them emerges from a white hole. We scrutiny when such a process can lead to the indefinitely large growth of the energy in the center of mass frame in the point of collision. We also trace how the kinematics of collision manifests itself in preserving the principle of kinematic censorship according to which the energy released in any event of collision cannot be literally infinite. According to this principle, the energy released in any event of collision, must remain finite although it can be made as large as one likes. Also, we find that particle decay near the singularity leads to unbounded release of energy independently of its initial value.</description>
