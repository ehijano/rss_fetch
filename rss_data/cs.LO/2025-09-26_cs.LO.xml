      <title>A Unified Formal Theory on the Logical Limits of Symbol Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper synthesizes a series of formal proofs to construct a unified theory on the logical limits of the Symbol Grounding Problem. We demonstrate through a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove that any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot internally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to self-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with any finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently incomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the very "act" of connecting an internal symbol to an external meaning cannot be a product of logical inference within the system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external "judgment" algorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic system. Together, these conclusions formally establish that the grounding of meaning is a necessarily open-ended, non-algorithmic process, revealing a fundamental, G\"odel-style limitation for any self-contained intelligent system.</description>

      <title>Reverse Fa\`a di Bruno's Formula for Cartesian Reverse Differential Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reverse differentiation is an essential operation for automatic differentiation. Cartesian reverse differential categories axiomatize reverse differentiation in a categorical framework, where one of the primary axioms is the reverse chain rule, which is the formula that expresses the reverse derivative of a composition. Here, we present the reverse differential analogue of Faa di Bruno's Formula, which gives a higher-order reverse chain rule in a Cartesian reverse differential category. To properly do so, we also define partial reverse derivatives and higher-order reverse derivatives in a Cartesian reverse differential category. </description>

      <title>A Coalgebraic Model of Quantum Bisimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have shown that defining a behavioural equivalence that matches the observational properties of a quantum-capable, concurrent, non-deterministic system is a surprisingly difficult task. We explore coalgebras over distributions taking weights from a generic effect algebra, which subsumes probabilities and quantum effects, a physical formalism that represents the probabilistic behaviour of an open quantum system. To abide by the properties of quantum theory, we introduce monads graded on a partial commutative monoid, intuitively allowing composition of two processes only if they use different quantum resources, as prescribed by the no-cloning theorem. We investigate the relation between an open quantum system and its probabilistic counterparts obtained when instantiating the input with a specific quantum state. We consider Aczel-Mendler and kernel bisimilarities, advocating for the latter as it characterizes quantum systems that exhibit the same probabilistic behaviour for all input states. Finally, we propose operators on quantum effect labelled transition systems, paving the way for a process calculi semantics that is parametric over the quantum input.</description>

      <title>Composition Direction of Seymour's Theorem for Regular Matroids -- Formally Verified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seymour's decomposition theorem is a hallmark result in matroid theory presenting a structural characterization of the class of regular matroids. Formalization of matroid theory faces many challenges, most importantly that only a limited number of notions and results have been implemented so far. In this work, we formalize the proof of the forward (composition) direction of Seymour's theorem for regular matroids. To this end, we develop a library in Lean 4 that implements definitions and results about totally unimodular matrices, vector matroids, their standard representations, regular matroids, and 1-, 2-, and 3-sums of matrices and binary matroids given by their standard representations. Using this framework, we formally state Seymour's decomposition theorem and implement a formally verified proof of the composition direction in the setting where the matroids have finite rank and may have infinite ground sets.</description>

      <title>A Category Theoretic Approach to Approximate Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper uses category theory to develop an entirely new approach to approximate game theory. Game theory is the study of how different agents within a multi-agent system take decisions. At its core, game theory asks what an optimal decision is in a given scenario. Thus approximate game theory asks what is an approximately optimal decision in a given scenario. This is important in practice as -- just like in much of computing -- exact answers maybe too difficult to compute or even impossible to compute given inherent uncertainty in input.
  We consider first "Selection Functions" which are functions and develop a simple yet robust model of approximate equilibria. We develop the algebraic properties of approximation wrt selection functions and also relate approximation to the compositional structure of selection functions. We then repeat this process successfully for Open Games -- a more advanced model of game theory.</description>

      <title>Relative Constructibility via Generalised Sequential Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We modify Gurevich's definition of sequential algorithms, so that it becomes amenable to computation with arbitrarily large sets on a sufficiently intuitive level. As a result, two classes of abstract algorithms are obtained, namely generalised sequential algorithms (GSeqAs) and generalised sequential algorithms with parameters (GSeqAPs). We derive from each class a relative computability relation on sets which is analogous to the Turing reducibility relation on reals. We then prove that the relative computability relation derived from GSeqAPs is equivalent to the relative constructibility relation in set theory.</description>

      <title>Relating homotopy equivalences to conservativity in dependent type theories with computation axioms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05623v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a conservativity result for extensional type theories over propositional ones, i.e. dependent type theories with propositional computation rules, or computation axioms, using insights from homotopy type theory. The argument exploits a notion of canonical homotopy equivalence between contexts, and uses the notion of a category with attributes to phrase the semantics of theories of dependent types. Informally, our main result asserts that, for judgements essentially concerning h-sets, reasoning with extensional or propositional type theories is equivalent.</description>

      <title>Representing Knowledge and Querying Data using Double-Functorial Semantics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Category theory offers a mathematical foundation for knowledge representation and database systems. Popular existing approaches model a database instance as a functor into the category of sets and functions, or as a 2-functor into the 2-category of sets, relations, and implications. The functional and relational models are unified by double functors into the double category of sets, functions, relations, and implications. In an accessible, example-driven style, we show that the abstract structure of a 'double category of relations' is a flexible and expressive language in which to represent knowledge, and we show how queries on data in the spirit of Codd's relational algebra are captured by double-functorial semantics.</description>

      <title>Fibrational Perspectives on Determinization of Finite-State Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colcombet and Petri\c{s}an argued that automata may be usefully considered from a functorial perspective, introducing a general notion of "V-automaton" based on functors into V. This enables them to recover different standard notions of automata by choosing V appropriately, and they further analyzed the determinization for Rel-automata using the Kleisli adjunction between Set and Rel. In this paper, we revisit Colcombet and Petri\c{s}an's analysis from a fibrational perspective, building on Melli\`es and Zeilberger's recent alternative but related definition of categorical automata as functors satisfying the finitary fiber and unique lifting of factorizations property. In doing so, we improve the understanding of determinization in three regards: Firstly, we carefully describe the universal property of determinization in terms of forward-backward simulations. Secondly, we generalize the determinization procedure for Rel automata using a local adjunction between SpanSet and Rel, which provides us with a canonical forward simulation. Finally, we also propose an alternative determinization based on the multiset relative adjunction which retains paths, and we leverage this to provide a canonical forward-backward simulation.</description>

      <title>The Aldous$\unicode{x2013}$Hoover Theorem in Categorical Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Aldous-Hoover Theorem concerns an infinite matrix of random variables whose distribution is invariant under finite permutations of rows and columns. It states that, up to equality in distribution, each random variable in the matrix can be expressed as a function only depending on four key variables: one common to the entire matrix, one that encodes information about its row, one that encodes information about its column, and a fourth one specific to the matrix entry.
  We state and prove the theorem within a category-theoretic approach to probability, namely the theory of Markov categories. This makes the proof more transparent and intuitive when compared to measure-theoretic ones. A key role is played by a newly identified categorical property, the Cauchy--Schwarz axiom, which also facilitates a new synthetic de Finetti Theorem.
  We further provide a variant of our proof using the ordered Markov property and the d-separation criterion, both generalized from Bayesian networks to Markov categories. We expect that this approach will facilitate a systematic development of more complex results in the future, such as categorical approaches to hierarchical exchangeability.</description>

      <title>Constrained Decoding for Robotics Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the perspective of improved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces logical constraints on action trajectories in dynamical systems. Our method ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL) specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the underlying foundation model. We perform comprehensive evaluation of our approach across state-of-the-art navigation foundation models and we show that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe actions but also for conditional action-generation.

      <title>Efficient &amp; Correct Predictive Equivalence for Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rashomon set of decision trees (DTs) finds importance uses. Recent work showed that DTs computing the same classification function, i.e. predictive equivalent DTs, can represent a significant fraction of the Rashomon set. Such redundancy is undesirable. For example, feature importance based on the Rashomon set becomes inaccurate due the existence of predictive equivalent DTs, i.e. DTs with the same prediction for every possible input. In recent work, McTavish et al. proposed solutions for several computational problems related with DTs, including that of deciding predictive equivalent DTs. This approach, which this paper refers to as MBDSR, consists of applying the well-known method of Quine-McCluskey (QM) for obtaining minimum-size DNF (disjunctive normal form) representations of DTs, which are then used for comparing DTs for predictive equivalence. Furthermore, the minimum-size DNF representation was also applied to computing explanations for the predictions made by DTs, and to finding predictions in the presence of missing data. However, the problem of formula minimization is hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, and the QM method may exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space. This paper first demonstrates that there exist decision trees that trigger the worst-case exponential running time and space of the QM method. Second, the paper shows that, depending on the QM method implementation, the MBDSR approach can produce incorrect results for the problem of deciding predictive equivalence. Third, the paper shows that any of the problems to which the smallest DNF representation has been applied to can be solved in polynomial time, in the size of the DT. The experiments confirm that, for DTs for which the worst-case of the QM method is triggered, the algorithms proposed in this paper are orders of magnitude faster than the ones proposed by McTavish et al.</description>
