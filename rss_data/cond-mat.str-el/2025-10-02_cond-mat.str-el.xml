      <title>Classification of Thouless pumps with non-invertible symmetries and implications for Floquet phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study symmetry preserving adiabatic and Floquet dynamics of one-dimensional systems. Using quasiadiabatic evolution, we establish a correspondence between adiabatic cycles and invertible defects generated by spatially truncated Thouless pump operators. Employing the classification of gapped phases by module categories, we show that the Thouless pumps are classified by the group of autoequivalences of the module category. We then explicitly construct Thouless pump operators for minimal lattice models with $\text{Vec}_G$, Rep($G$), and Rep($H$) symmetries, and show how the Thouless pump operators have the group structure of autoequivalences. The Thouless pump operators, together with Hamiltonians with gapped ground states, are then used to construct Floquet drives. An analytic solution for the Floquet phase diagram characterized by winding numbers is constructed when the Floquet drives obey an Onsager algebra. Our approach points the way to a general connection between distinct Thouless pumps and distinct families of Floquet phases.</description>

      <title>Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopf terms are topological theta terms that are associated with a host of interesting physics, including anyons, statistical transmutation, chiral edge states, and the quantum spin-Hall effect. Here, we show that Hopf terms generically appear in two-dimensional metals without spin-orbit coupling at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order. In the locally ordered, but globally disordered, phase the system is governed by the Hopf term and realizes a Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase. This phase is protected by the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin rotation symmetry, is gapped in the bulk, has chiral gapless edge states, and its spin-Hall conductance is quantized. Lattice models that realize this phase are introduced. In addition, we provide an elementary proof that the $\theta$ angle of the Hopf term must be quantized to multiples of $\pi$ in non-relativistic systems, thereby precluding anyonic skyrmions in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast giant enhancement of second harmonic generation in a strongly correlated cobaltite YbBaCo4O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of ultrafast photoinduced giant enhancement of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency in cobaltite YbBaCo4O7. Upon femtosecond pumping at energies above the band gap, the system exhibits an ultrafast enhancement in SHG intensity, reaching up to 60% higher than the initial value, then decays into a metastable state maintaining the enhancement. The enhancement scales linearly with pump fluence but shows no dependence on pump polarization. A pure electronic process sets in within the first ~200 fs and is accompanied by a pronounced anisotropic amplification of nonlinear susceptibility. We propose this anomalous SHG enhancement originates from ultrafast electronic band renormalization arising from dynamical modification of multi-electron correlations. In stark contrast to conventional asymmetric systems where SHG is typically suppressed upon photoexcitation, our experimental findings shed a new light on ultrafast optical control nonlinear properties in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling functional renormalization group: Nagaoka ferromagnetism and non-Fermi liquid physics in the Hubbard model at $ U = \infty $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an extension of the fermionic functional renormalization group for systems where strong correlations give rise to projected Hilbert spaces. We use our method to calculate the phase diagram and the electronic spectral function of the Hubbard model at infinite on-site repulsion where many-body states involving doubly occupied lattice sites are eliminated from the physical Hilbert space. For a square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping we find that the ground state evolves from a paramagnetic Fermi liquid at low densities via a state with antiferromagnetic stripe order at intermediate densities to an extended Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities. In the strongly correlated magnetic phases, the electrons form an incoherent non-Fermi liquid. Both at high and low densities, the volume of the Fermi surface is not constrained by Luttinger's theorem.</description>

      <title>The Finite-Temperature Behavior of a Triangular Heisenberg Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the classical antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice with up to third-nearest neighbor couplings using nematic bond theory. This approach allows us to compute the free energy and the neutron scattering static structure factor at finite temperatures. We map out the phase diagram with a particular emphasis on finite-temperature phase transitions that break lattice rotational symmetries, spiral spin liquids and the broad specific heat hump that is ubiquitous in the antiferromagnetic 120 degree phase.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of atomic solid hydrogen phases based on Gutzwiller many-body wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply two ab initio many-body methods based on Gutzwiller wave functions, i.e., correlation matrix renormalization theory (CMRT) and Gutzwiller conjugate gradient minimization (GCGM), to the study of crystalline phases of atomic hydrogen. Both methods avoid empirical Hubbard U parameters and are free from double-counting issues. CMRT employs a Gutzwiller-type approximation that enables efficient calculations, while GCGM goes beyond this approximation to achieve higher accuracy at higher computational cost. By benchmarking against available quantum Monte Carlo results, we demonstrate that while both methods are more accurate than the widely used density-functional theory (DFT), GCGM systematically captures additional correlation energy missing in CMRT, leading to significantly improved total energy predictions. We also show that by including the correlation energy from LDA in the CMRT calculation, CMRT+ produces energy in better agreement with the QMC results in these hydrogen lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Fate of entanglement in open quantum spin liquid: Time evolution of its genuine multipartite negativity upon sudden coupling to a dissipative bosonic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological properties of many-body entanglement in quantum spin liquids (QSLs), persisting at arbitrarily long distances, have been intensely explored over the past two decades, but mostly for QSLs viewed as {\em closed} quantum systems. However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\em open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.</description>

      <title>Charge order through crystallization of Frenkel excitons: realization in kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge order is a widely observed and representative example of spontaneous broken symmetries in quantum states of matter. Owing to the large intra-atomic Coulomb energy, the charge redistribution in such an order typically implies significant alteration of the electronic and lattice properties of materials. While the standard description of charge order, namely a "charge density wave" instability of the Fermi surface, has been broadly and successfully applied to good metals, its applicability to correlated ionic materials has been rather limited. Here, we propose an alternative general scenario of charge order - crystallization of long-lived Frenkel excitons - suitable for these ionic materials. We demonstrate this scenario on the recently discovered kagome superconductors and successfully reproduce all the characteristics of experimental observations on both local charge correlations and long-range ordering. The proposed generic scenario offers a long-sought understanding of charge order applicable to modern correlated functional materials.</description>

      <title>Amplified magnetic catalysis in non-Hermitian Euclidean and hyperbolic Dirac liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their iconic linearly vanishing density of states near the zero-energy, half-filled two-dimensional Dirac materials in flat Euclidean and negatively-curved hyperbolic spaces exhibit dynamic mass generation only once a critical interaction strength is surpassed. Application of external magnetic fields onto these systems can, however, trigger the formation of such ordered phases yielding isotropic insulation near the band-center at arbitrarily weak coupling, a phenomenon known as magnetic catalysis. Recently, it has been proposed that a specific type of non-Hermiticity, allowing the system to feature an all-real eigenvalue spectrum otherwise squeezed toward the zero-energy, can bring down the requisite critical coupling of a specific family of ordered phases, commuting class masses, to a desired lower finite value in Dirac systems, a phenomenon known as non-Hermitian catalysis (arXiv:2501.18591). Here, we predict that a confluence of external magnetic fields and such a non-Hermiticity can amplify the magnitude of commuting class masses for subcritical strengths of interactions in Dirac liquids, an emergent phenomenon named non-Hermitian amplification of magnetic catalysis. We anchor this prediction from numerical self-consistent mean-field solutions of the commuting class mass charge-density-wave (antiferromagnetic) order displaying a staggered pattern of average electronic density (magnetization) between the nearest neighboring sites of the half-filled Euclidean honeycomb and hyperbolic {10, 3} and {14, 3} lattices, all featuring emergent non-Hermitian Dirac quasiparticles, after decomposing the nearest-neighbor Coulomb (on-site Hubbard) repulsion in the Hartree channel. We discuss the scaling behavior of these two orders with magnetic field and non-Hermiticity over a wide range of subcritical interactions.. Possible experimental setups to test our predictions are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their comment, the authors attribute our observations of light- and magnetic-field-induced manipulation of the CDW state in RbV3Sb5 to random experimental artifacts such as tip changes, drift, and scan conditions, concluding that no intrinsic effect exists. In this reply, we clarify three points. First, our reported magnetic-field-induced CDW switching has been independently replicated in multiple STM studies and corroborated by transport measurements. Second, in our data, the switching of CDW intensities and Bragg vector ratios exhibit high fidelity (nearly 100 $\%$), and this cannot be explained by random artifacts. Lastly, we disprove the comment's unsubstantiated claim about magnetic field values by showing a system-dependent correlation between z-piezo shift and magnetic field. Taken together, our Reply reaffirms the reproducibility and intrinsic nature of light and magnetic field induced CDW manipulation in RbV3Sb5.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of sliding ferroelectricity through exciton condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity is a phenomenon that arises from the insurgence of spontaneous electronic polarization perpendicular to the layers of two-dimensional (2D) systems upon the relative sliding of the atomic layer constituents. Because of the weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions between layers, sliding and the associated symmetry breaking can occur at low energy cost in materials such as transition-metal dichalcogenides. Here we discuss theoretically the origin and quantitative understanding of the phenomenon by focusing on a prototype structure, the WTe2 bilayer, where sliding ferroelectricity was first experimentally observed. We show that excitonic effects induce relevant energy band renormalizations in the ground state, and exciton condensation contributes significantly to stabilizing ferroelectricity upon sliding beyond previous predictions. Enhanced excitonic effects in 2D and vdW sliding are general phenomena that point to sliding ferroelectricity as relevant for a broad class of important materials, where the intrinsic electric dipole can couple with other quantum phenomena and, in turn, an external electric field can control the quantum phases through ferroelectricity in unexplored ways.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of quantum anomalous Hall effects in moir\'e systems have revealed the emergence of interaction-driven ferromagnetism with significant orbital contributions. To capture this physics, we extend the modern theory of orbital magnetization to Hartree-Fock states and show that the standard expression remains valid with Hartree-Fock orbitals and Hamiltonians. We then benchmark our theory against the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model in a weak field, which yields excellent agreement with direct numerical calculations. Applying our theory to twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers, we find orbital magnetization of order one Bohr magneton per moir\'e cell with a non-monotonic twist-angle dependence. Our work establishes a general theory of orbital magnetization in interacting moir\'e systems and provides quantitative guidance for interpreting recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of terahertz high-harmonic generation by cavity engineering of Dirac semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineered micro- or nano-structures based on nonlinear optical materials offer versatile opportunities for optoelectronic applications. While extensive efforts have been devoted to design tailored microcavities to promote and increase the optical nonlinearities of graphene, the potential of engineering its three-dimensional counterparts -- three-dimensional Dirac semimetals -- remains largely unexplored. Here we report on exceptionally strong terahertz nonlinearities in a cavity-engineered Dirac semimetal microstructure, and demonstrate a giant enhancement of terahertz third- and fifth-order harmonic yields by more than three orders of magnitude. By fabricating a designed structure of metallic metasurface microcavities on a nanometer thin film of the threedimensional Dirac semimetal Cd3As2, we significantly enhance the near-field intensity of a picosecond terahertz excitation pulse in resonance with the microcavity eigenmode. This transiently modifies the nonlinearities of the thin film and drives the nonlinear responses of the Dirac fermions from a weakly to a deeply nonperturbative regime where the observed high-harmonic generation essentially saturates.</description>

      <title>Tunable Wigner Molecules in a Germanium Quantum Dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between Coulomb interactions and kinetic energy underlies many exotic phases in condensed matter physics. In a two-dimensional electronic system, If Coulomb interaction dominates over kinetic energy, electrons condense into a crystalline phase which is referred as Wigner crystal. This ordered state manifests as Wigner molecule for few electrons at the microscopic scale. Observation of Wigner molecules has been reported in quantum dot and moire superlattice systems. Here we demonstrate hole Wigner molecules can be formed in a gate-defined germanium quantum dot with high tunability. By varying voltages applied to the quantum dot device, we can precisely tune the hole density by either changing the hole occupancy or the quantum dot size. For densities smaller than a certain critical value, Coulomb interaction localizes individual holes into ordered lattice sites, forming a Wigner molecule. By increasing the densities, melting process from a Wigner molecule to Fermi liquid-like particles is observed. An intermediate configuration which indicates the coexistence of ordered structure and disordered structure can be formed within a narrow effective density range. Our results provide a new platform for further exploration of the microscopic feature of strong correlated physics and open an avenue to exploit the application of Wigner molecules for quantum information in a very promising spin qubit platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states have emerged as a widely used approach to the numerical study of the ground states of non-stoquastic Hamiltonians. However, existing approaches often rely on a priori knowledge of the sign structure or require a separately pre-trained phase network. We introduce a modified stochastic reconfiguration method that effectively uses differing imaginary time steps to evolve the amplitude and phase. Using a larger time step for phase optimization, this method enables a simultaneous and efficient training of phase and amplitude neural networks. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated on the Heisenberg J_1-J_2 model.</description>

      <title>Quantum speed-up for solving the one-dimensional Hubbard model using quantum annealing</title>

Abstract: The Hubbard model has occupied the minds of condensed matter physicists for most part of the last century. This model provides insight into a range of phenomena in correlated electron systems. We wish to examine the paradigm of quantum algorithms for solving such many-body problems. The focus of our current work is on the one-dimensional model which is integrable, meaning that there exist analytical results for determining its ground state. In particular, we demonstrate how to perform a gate-based quantum computer simulation of quantum annealing for the Hubbard Hamiltonian. We perform simulations for systems with up to 40 qubits to study the scaling of required annealing time for obtaining the ground state. We find that for the half-filled cases considered, there is a substantial quantum speed-up over algorithms based on the Bethe-ansatz equations.</description>

      <title>Reversal of strain state in a Mott insulator thin film by controlling substrate morphology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The V2O3 phase diagram contains two insulating phases and one metallic phase with different lattice structures. The stability of these phases is very sensitive to pressure, offering a mechanism to tune phase transitions by inducing strain in thin films. The most studied source of strain is lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate. In this work, however, we find that the film/substrate thermal expansion mismatch can be made to play a dominant role by modifying the substrate morphology. When grown on sapphire, the lattice mismatch induces compressive strain in the V2O3 films, whereas thermal expansion mismatch induces tensile strain. We find that minute changes in substrate morphology may relax the compressive strain component, allowing the thermally-induced tensile component to overcome it. Thus, by simple annealing of the substrates to create either a flat or stepped morphology, strongly compressive or tensile strains may be induced in the films. This results in either full suppression of the metal-insulator transition or stabilization of insulating phases at all temperatures, exhibiting many orders of magnitude differences in film resistivity. To elucidate the strain relaxation mechanism, we use high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) to image the atomic steps in the substrate and the adjacent crystallographic defects in the V2O3. These findings offer a hitherto underexplored mechanism to tune strain in thin films, deepen our understanding of the effects of structural degrees of freedom on phase stability of a canonical Mott insulator and may allow for applications requiring insulator-metal switching above room temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete analytical solution of the mean-field Hubbard model of undoped and doped graphene rectangulenes. These are non-chiral ribbons of arbitrary length and width, whose dimensions range from simple short acene molecules all the way up to the bulk limit. We rewrite the Hubbard model in the basis of bulk and edge non-interacting eigen-states, and provide explicit expressions for the Coulomb matrix elements. We present a general mean-field decoupling of the Hamiltonian, and discuss in detail the paramagnetic, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic mean-field solutions. We calculate the eigen-energies, occupations, spin densities and addition energies of rectangulenes with lengths and widths ranging from a nanometer to several hundreds of them. We rewrite the exact mean-field tight-binding Hamiltonian back in the site-occupation basis, that can be used to model electronic, thermo-electric, transport and optical properties of experimental-size graphene flakes.</description>

      <title>A Simple and General Equation for Matrix Product Unitary Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix Product Unitaries (MPUs) have emerged as essential tools for representing locality-preserving 1D unitary operators, with direct applications to quantum cellular automata and quantum phases of matter. A key challenge in the study of MPUs is determining when a given local tensor generates an MPU, a task previously addressed through fixed-point conditions and canonical forms, which can be cumbersome to evaluate for an arbitrary tensor. In this work, we establish a simple and efficient necessary and sufficient condition for a tensor $M$ to generate an MPU of size $N$, given by $\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_M^N) = \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_T^N) = 1$, where $\mathbb{E}_M$ and $\mathbb{E}_T$ are the transfer matrices of $M$ and $T = MM^\dagger$. This condition provides a unified framework for characterizing all uniform MPUs and significantly simplifies their evaluation. Furthermore, we show that locality preservation naturally arises when the MPU is generated for all system sizes. Our results offer new insights into the structure of MPUs, highlighting connections between unitary evolution, transfer matrices, and locality-preserving behavior, with potential extensions to higher-dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) models. Employing interacting Dirac fermions on a honeycomb lattice with armchair boundaries, we use determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulation to uncover rich boundary criticalities at the quantum phase transition to a charge density wave (CDW) insulator, including the ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. The Dirac fermions satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition, while the boson field, representing the CDW order, obeys Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at the ordinary and special transitions, respectively, thereby enriching the critical GNY model. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments.</description>

Abstract: We find that the behaviors of the voltage-current characteristics as one enters the low-density insulating state and integer quantum Hall insulating states in the ultra-clean two-dimensional electron system in SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum wells are qualitatively different. The double-threshold voltage-current curves, representative of the electron solid formation at low densities, are not observed in the quantum Hall regime, which does not confirm the existence of a quasi-particle quantum Hall Wigner solid and indicates that quasi-particles near integer filling do not form an independent subsystem.</description>

      <title>Spin Seebeck Effect of Triangular-lattice Spin Supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using thermal tensor-network approach, we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet hosting spin supersolid phase. We focus on the low-temperature scaling behaviors of the normalized spin current across the interface. For the 1D Heisenberg chain, we find a negative spinon spin in the bulk current with algebraic temperature scaling; at low fields, boundary effects induce a second sign reversal at lower temperatures. These benchmark results are consistent with field-theoretical analysis. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with distinct spin-current signatures -- particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence -- distinguishing different spin states. Remarkably, we discover a persistent, negative spin current in the spin supersolid phase, which saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits provide sensitive spin current probes for spin supersolid states in quantum magnets such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Furthermore, our results also establish spin supersolids as a tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>The Symmetry Taco: Equivalences between Gapped, Gapless, and Mixed-State SPTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, offers a unifying framework for describing quantum phases of matter and phase transitions between them. While this approach has seen remarkable success in describing gapped and gapless pure-state phases in $1+1$d, its applicability to open quantum systems remains entirely unexplored. In this work, we propose a natural extension of the SymTFT framework to mixed-state phases by introducing the \textit{symmetry taco}: a bilayer topological order in $2+1$d whose folded geometry naturally encapsulates both strong and weak symmetries of the $1+1$d theory. We use this perspective to identify a series of correspondences, including a one-to-one map between intrinsically gapless SPTs (igSPTs) and certain gapped SPTs, and a mapping between igSPTs and intrinsically average SPTs (iASPTs) arising in $1+1$d mixed states. More broadly, our framework yields a classification of short-range correlated $G$-symmetric Choi states in $1+1$d, provides a route for systematically generating mixed-state SPTs via local decoherence of igSPTs, and allows us to identify a new mixed-state ``anomaly". Besides folding in mixed-state phases into the SymTFT paradigm, the symmetry taco opens new avenues for exploring dualities, anomalies, and non-equilibrium criticality in mixed-state quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial entanglement of wave functions has matured into an enthralling and very active research area. Here, we unearth a completely different kind of entanglement, the entanglement between different time scales. This is feasible through quantics tensor train diagnostics (QTTD), wherein the bond dimension for an $n$-particle correlation function allows diagnosing the temporal entanglement. As examples, we study time-scale entanglement of the Hubbard dimer, the four-site Hubbard ring with and without next-nearest neighbor hopping and the single-impurity Anderson model. Besides introducing the QTTD method, our major finding is that the time-scale entanglement is generically maximal at phase transitions and crossovers. This is independent of the correlation function studied. Thus, QTTD is a universal tool for detecting quantum phase transitions, ground state crossings in finite systems, and thermal crossovers.</description>

Abstract: We examine the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg magnet on four three-dimensional lattices -- simple-cubic, diamond, pyrochlore, and hyperkagome ones -- for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic signs of the exchange interaction in order to illustrate the effect of lattice geometry on the finite-temperature thermodynamic properties with a focus on the specific heat $c(T)$. To this end, we use quantum Monte Carlo simulations or high-temperature expansion series complemented with the entropy method. We also discuss a recent proposal about hidden energy scale in geometrically frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Quantifying non-Hermiticity using single- and many-particle quantum properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian paradigm of quantum systems displays salient features drastically different from Hermitian counterparts. In this work, we focus on one such aspect, the difference of evolving quantum ensembles under $H_{\mathrm{nh}}$ (right ensemble) versus its Hermitian conjugate, $H_{\mathrm{nh}}^{\dagger}$ (left ensemble). We propose a formalism that quantifies the (dis-)similarity of these right and left ensembles, for single- as well as many-particle quantum properties. Such a comparison gives us a scope to measure the extent to which non-Hermiticity gets translated from the Hamiltonian into physically observable properties. We test the formalism in two cases: First, we construct a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian using a set of imperfect Bell states, showing that the non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian does not automatically comply with the non-Hermiticity at the level of observables. Second, we study the interacting Hatano--Nelson model with asymmetric hopping as a paradigmatic quantum many-body Hamiltonian. Interestingly, we identify situations where the measures of non-Hermiticity computed for the Hamiltonian, for single-, and for many-particle quantum properties behave distinctly from each other. Thus, different notions of non-Hermiticity can become useful in different physical scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the measures can qualitatively mark the model's Parity--Time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition. Our findings can be instrumental in unveiling new exotic quantum phases of non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems as well as in preparing resourceful states for quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the secondary low-energy electron emission induced by inelastic electron scattering from graphene and layered materials thereof. By applying a coincidence detection of the primary scattered and the emitted secondary electron we unravel pronounced resonance features otherwise overshadowed by the largely structureless secondary electron energy distribution. Supported by density functional theory calculations we show that these structures are the signature of prominent Feshbach resonances above the vacuum threshold which originate from interlayer states acting as a doorway state for electron emission. Remarkably, some of these doorway states open up only for samples with more than five layers.</description>

      <title>Retrieval of fundamental material parameters of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides from experimental exciton energies: An analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a straightforward and highly accurate method for extracting material parameters such as screening length, bandgap energy, exciton reduced mass, and the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium from experimental magnetoexciton energies available for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Our approach relies on analytical formulations that allow us to calculate the screening length $r_0$ and bandgap energy $E_g$ directly from the experimental $s$-state exciton energies $E_{1s}$, $E_{2s}$, and $E_{3s}$. We also establish a relationship between the surrounding dielectric constant $\kappa$ and the exciton reduced mass $\mu$. This relationship simplifies the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for a magnetoexciton in a TMDC monolayer, transforming it into a one-parameter equation that depends solely on the single material parameter $\mu$. Furthermore, we develop an analytical formula with high accuracy for magnetoexciton energies as a function of the exciton reduced mass: $E(B,\mu)$. Then, the inverse of this formula allows us to calculate the exciton reduced mass from experimental data on magnetoexciton energies. By applying this method, we extract key material parameters, $E_g$, $r_0$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$, from the magnetoexciton energies of monolayer TMDCs, including WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoS$_2$, encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slabs in various current experiments. The material properties we retrieve complement and correct existing experimental and theoretical data. Additionally, we develop an analytical method for calculating diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii with high accuracy compared to numerical calculations. Based on this method, we provide diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii computed using the extracted material parameters.</description>

Abstract: We propose a way to generate a one-dimensional topological superconductor from a monolayer of a transition metal dichalcogenide coupled to a Bernal-stacked bilayer of graphene under a displacement field. With proper gating, this structure may be tuned to form three parallel pads of superconductors creating two planar Josephson junctions in series, in which normal regions separate the superconductors. Two characteristics of the system which are essential for our discussion are spin orbit coupling induced by the transition metal dichalcogenides and the variation of the Fermi velocities along the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that these two characteristics lead to one-dimensional topological superconductivity occupying large parts in the parameter space defined by the two phase differences across the two junctions and the relative angle between the junctions and the lattice. An angle-shaped device in which this angle varies in space, combined with proper phase tuning, can lead to the formation of domain walls between topological and trivial phases, supporting a zero-energy Majorana mode, within the bulk of carefully designed devices. We derive the spectrum of the Andreev bound states and show that Ising spin-orbit coupling leaves the topological superconductor gapless, and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling opens a gap in its spectrum. Our analysis shows that the transition to a gapped topological state is a result of the band inversion of Andreev states.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of quantum Fisher and Wigner-Yanase skew information following a noisy quench</title>

Abstract: We study the effect of noise on the dynamics of the transverse-field Ising model quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin correlations, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the noiseless case, in contrast to the dynamics of entanglement in anisotropic XY chains, both QFI and WYSI increase monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. In contrast, when noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change qualitatively: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with the time scale of a ramp quench, with an exponent determined by the noise intensity. Furthermore, the maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum, scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy quantum annealing.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fragmented Dopant Dynamics in Quantum Spin Lattices: Robust Localization and non-Gaussian Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$-$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is \emph{localized} for all investigated \emph{nonzero} temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, which increases exponentially with decreasing temperature. The dopant, hereby, only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes at rate $\alpha$, the dopant diffuses with a diffusion coefficient, $D_h$, depending non-monotonically on $\alpha$. It initially increases linearly as $D_h \propto \alpha$ for $\alpha \ll 1$ before dropping off as $\alpha^{-1}$ for $\alpha &gt; 1$. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics features self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion, especially for weak spin exchange. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient $D_h$ follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it is exponentially suppressed upon cooling.</description>

      <title>Wannier Center Analysis on Possible Three-Dimensional Topological Phases in \alpha-Type Layered Organic Conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological features of possible three-dimensional (3D) states in \alpha-type layered organic conductors are investigated within a unified framework based on Wannier charge centers (WCCs), aiming to identify their actual topological states. Among the 3D Dirac/Weyl semimetal states of multilayered \alpha-(ET)2I3, the type-I Dirac semimetal state, induced by interlayer spin-orbit coupling (SOC), most effectively explains the observed chiral transport phenomena attributed to the chiral magnetic effect, which originates from the spiral structures of the WCC sheets. In multilayered \alpha-(BETS)2I3, a 3D weak topological insulator (TI) state consistently emerges, irrespective of the presence of interlayer SOC and/or inversion symmetry breaking. The strong TI state suggested by experimental observations appears unlikely to be realized.</description>
