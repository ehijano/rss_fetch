      <title>Generic infinite generation, fixed-point-poor representations and compact-element abundance in disconnected Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semidirect product $\mathbb{G}=\mathbb{L}\rtimes \mathbb{K}$ attached to a compact-group action on a connected, simply-connected solvable Lie group has a dense set of compact elements precisely when the $s\in \mathbb{K}$ operating on $\mathbb{L}$ fixed-point-freely constitute a dense set. This (along with a number of alternative equivalent characterizations) extends the Wu's analogous result for connected Lie $\mathbb{K}$, and also provides ample supplies of examples of almost-connected Lie groups $\mathbb{G}$ which do not have dense sets of compact elements, even though their identity components $\mathbb{G}_0$ do. This corrects prior literature on the subject, claiming the property equivalent for $\mathbb{G}$ and $\mathbb{G}_0$.
  In a related discussion we characterize those connected Lie groups $\mathbb{G}$ with large sets of $d$-tuples generating dense subgroups $\Gamma\le \mathbb{G}$ for which the derived subgroup $\Gamma^{(1)}$ fails to be finitely-generated: $\mathbb{G}$ must either be non-trivial topologically perfect or have non-nilpotent maximal solvable quotient.</description>

      <title>The DeMorganization of a locale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2009, Caramello proved that each topos has a largest dense subtopos whose internal logic satisfies De Morgan law (also known as the law of the weak excluded middle). This finding implies that every locale has a largest dense extremally disconnected sublocale, referred to as its DeMorganization. In this paper, we take the first steps in exploring the DeMorganization in the localic context, shedding light on its geometric nature by showing that it is always a fitted sublocale and by providing a concrete description. Explicit examples of DeMorganizations for toposes that do not satisfy De Morgan law are rather difficult to find. We present a contribution in that direction, with the main result of the paper showing that for any metrizable locale (without isolated points), its DeMorganization coincides with its Booleanization. This, in particular, implies that any extremally disconnected metric locale (without isolated points) must be Boolean, generalizing a well-known result for topological spaces to the localic setting.</description>

      <title>Resolvability in products and squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, $|X| = \Delta(X)$ and $|Y| = \Delta(Y)$. We investigate resolvability of the product $X \times Y$. We prove that: I. If $|X| = |Y| = \omega$ and $X,Y$ are Hausdorff, then $X \times Y$ is maximally resolvable; II. If $2^\kappa = \kappa^+$, $\{|X|, \mathrm{cf}|X|\} \cap \{\kappa, \kappa^+\} \ne \emptyset$ and $\mathrm{cf}|Y| = \kappa^+$, then the space $X \times Y$ is $\kappa^+$-resolvable. In particular, under GCH the space $X^2$ is $\mathrm{cf}|X|$-resolvable whenever $\mathrm{cf}|X|$ is an isolated cardinal; III. ($\frak{r} = \frak{c}$) If $\mathrm{cf}|X| = \omega$ and $\mathrm{cf}|Y| = \mathrm{cf}(\frak{c})$, then the space $X \times Y$ is $\omega$-resolvable. If, moreover, $\mathrm{cf}(\frak{c}) = \omega_1$, then the space $X \times Y$ is $\omega_1$-resolvable.</description>

      <title>Convergence exponent of Pierce expansion digit sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence exponent of Pierce expansion digit sequences. We explore some basic properties of the convergence exponent as a real-valued function defined on the closed unit interval, as well as those of the level sets of the function. Additionally, we further study subsets of the closed unit interval on which the series of positive $s$th powers of the reciprocals of the Pierce expansion digits diverges.</description>

      <title>Semitopology: distributed collaborative action via topology, algebra, and logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce semitopologies, a generalisation of point-set topology that removes the restriction that intersections of open sets need necessarily be open.
  The intuition is that points are participants in some distributed system, and an open set is a collection of participants that can collaborate to update their local state by taking a distributed collaborative action; we call this an actionable coalition. What constitutes an actionable coalition depends on what actions we want to model. Intuitive examples include 'a group of people that is collectively strong enough to lift a rock', where the state update is very simply 'holding rock low' to 'holding rock high' and this update is common to all participants in the actionable coalition. Or, consider 'two people wishing to barter a can of juice for a bar of chocolate', in which case the coalition is any such pair and the state updates differ between participants to flip them between 'has/has no juice' and 'has/has no chocolate'. A characteristic of these systems is that state updates are local to the coalition, voluntary, may vary between participants, and are not assumed subject to permission or synchronisation by a central authority. Peer-to-peer computer networks, including filesharing and blockchain systems, provide motivating examples from computing.
  This monograph presents a comprehensive view of semitopologies which includes point-set semitopology, algebra, and logic inspired by these considerations. This is interesting in and of itself and it provides a conceptual framework within which to understand a useful class of distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Ordered set partition posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lattice of partitions of a set and its d-divisible generalization have been much studied for their combinatorial, topological, and representation-theoretic properties. An ordered set partition is a set partition where the subsets are listed in a specific order. Ordered set partitions appear in combinatorics, number theory, permutation polytopes, and the study of coinvariant algebras. The ordered set partitions of {1,\ldots,n} can be partially ordered by refinement and then a unique minimal element attached, resulting in a lattice Omega_n. This lattice has appeared while studying other combinatorial objects, but not as the central focus. The purpose of this paper is to provide the first comprehensive look at Omega_n. In particular, we show that it admits a recursive atom ordering, and study the action of the symmetric group S_n on associated homology groups, looking in particular at the multiplicity of the trivial representation. We also consider the related posets where every block has size either divisible by some fixed d at least 2 or congruent to 1 modulo d. Open problems and avenues for future research are scattered throughout.</description>
