      <title>Orbital Hall conductivity and orbital diffusion length of Vanadium thin films by Hanle magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spintronics, the spin Hall effect has been widely used to generate and detect spin currents in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling such as Pt and Ta. Recently, its orbital counterpart has drawn attention as a new tool to generate and detect orbital currents and thus investigate orbital transport parameters. In this study, we investigate vanadium (V), a $3d$ transition metal with weak spin-orbit coupling but with a theoretically large orbital Hall conductivity. We measure a large Hanle magnetoresistance in V thin films with a magnitude comparable to that of heavy metals and at least one order of magnitude higher than the spin Hall magnetoresistance observed in a Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/V bilayer, pointing to the orbital Hall origin of the effect. A fit of the magnetic-field dependence and thickness dependence of the Hanle magnetoresistance to the standard diffusion model allows us to quantify the orbital diffusion length (~2 nm) and the orbital Hall conductivity (~78 ($\hbar/2e$) $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$) of V. The obtained orbital Hall conductivity is two orders of magnitude smaller than theoretical calculations of the intrinsic value, suggesting there is an important role of disorder.</description>

      <title>Lithography defined semiconductor moires with anomalous in-gap quantum Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum materials and phenomena have attracted great interest for their potential applications in next-generation microelectronics and quantum-information technologies. In one especially interesting class of quantum materials, moire superlattices (MSL) formed by twisted bilayers of 2D materials, a wide range of novel phenomena are observed. However, there exist daunting challenges such as reproducibility and scalability of utilizing 2D MSLs for microelectronics and quantum technologies due to their exfoliate-tear-stack method. Here, we propose lithography defined semiconductor moires superlattices, in which three fundamental parameters, electron-electron interaction, spin-orbit coupling, and band topology, are designable. We experimentally investigate quantum transport properties in a moire specimen made in an InAs quantum well. Strong anomalous in-gap states are observed within the same integer quantum Hall state. Our work opens up new horizons for studying 2D quantum-materials phenomena in semiconductors featuring superior industry-level quality and state-of-the-art technologies, and they may potentially enable new quantum information and microelectronics technologies.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and transport in materials with flat bands: 2D materials and quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we present our recent works on materials whose common point is the presence of electronic bands of very low dispersion, called "flat bands", which are always the signature of an electronic confinement. A first part is devoted to the cases where this confinement is due to the long-range geometry of the defect-free structure. We have thus studied periodic approximant structures of quasiperiodic Penrose and octagonal tilings, and twisted bilayers of graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) whose rotation angle between the two layers assumes a special value, called "magic angle". In these materials, the flat bands correspond to electronic states distributed over a very large number of atoms (several hundreds or even thousands of atoms) and are very sensitive to small structural distortions such as "heterostrain". Their electronic transport properties cannot be described by usual Bloch-Boltzmann theories, because the interband terms of the velocity operator dominate the intraband terms as far as quantum diffusion is concerned. In twisted bilayer graphene, flat bands can induce a magnetic state and other electron-electron correlation effects. The second part focuses on 2D nanomaterials in the presence of local point defects that cause resonant electronic states (vacancies, adsorbed atoms or molecules). We present studies on monolayer graphene, twisted or Bernal bilayer graphene, carbon nanotubes, monolayer and multilayer black phosphorene, and monolayer TMDs. A recent result is the discovery that the selective functionalization of a Bernal bilayer graphene sublattice leads to a metallic or insulating behavior depending on the functionalized sublattice type. This result, which seems to be confirmed by very recent experimental measurements, suggests that functionalization can be a key parameter to control the electronic properties of two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Half-Metallicity and Giant Wiedemann-Franz Violation in Monolayer NiI$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain engineering provides a powerful pathway to manipulate quantum transport in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate that biaxial strain induces a semiconductor-to-half-metal transition in monolayer NiI$_2$, triggered by the selective closure of its spin-down band gap while maintaining a robust ferromagnetic ground state. This transition is accompanied by a dramatic and non-monotonic violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, with the Lorenz number exceeding seven times the Sommerfeld limit ($L/L_0 \approx 7.17$). The anomaly arises from the strain-sensitive hybridization between Ni-$d$ and I-$p$ orbitals, leading to a pronounced decoupling between charge and heat transport. These findings establish monolayer NiI$_2$ as a tunable platform for spin-caloritronic functionalities and a model system for exploring non-Fermi-liquid behavior in low dimensions, thereby opening avenues for energy-efficient quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Spin pumping driven by magnon-polaritons in a ferromagnet-coplanar superconducting resonator hybrid system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate spin pumping driven by a strongly coupled magnon-photon system using a ferromagnet-coplanar superconducting resonator hybrid system at 1.4 K. Electrical readout via the inverse spin-Hall effect reveals characteristic coupling features, including mode splitting and linewidth broadening, demonstrating the electrical detection of strongly coupled microwave photons and magnons. The magnon-photon coupling strength obtained by combined spin pumping and inverse spin-Hall effect measurements is compared to microwave transmission experiments. Furthermore, microwave power-dependent measurements reveal a decrease in the coupling strength with increasing microwave power alongside the onset of nonlinearities of the superconducting resonator above a critical microwave power threshold.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Fingerprint of Controlled Structural Disorder in Artificial Spin Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the emergence of complexity in disordered interacting systems, central to fields like spin glass physics, remains challenging due to difficulties in systematic experimental tuning. We introduce a tunable artificial spin lattice platform to directly probe the connection between controlled structural disorder and collective spin-wave dynamics. By precisely varying positional and rotational randomness in Ni81Fe19 nanobar arrays from periodic to random, we map the evolution from discrete spectral modes to a complex, dense manifold. Crucially, we establish a quantitative correlation between information-theoretic measures of static disorder and the dynamic spectral complexity derived from the GHz spin-wave response. This correlation provides a dynamic fingerprint of an increasingly complex energy landscape resulting from tuned disorder. Furthermore, thermal probe via thermal Brillouin light scattering reveal significantly richer microstates diversity in disordered states than driven probe using broadband ferromagnetic resonance. Our work presents a unique experimental testbed for studying how the ingredients of glassy physics manifest in high-frequency dynamics, offering quantitative insights into the onset of complexity in interacting nanomagnet systems.</description>

      <title>Dimensionless Hierarchical Topological Phononic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators exhibit unique boundary states that are protected by the topology of the bulk bands, a phenomenon that has now been extended to classical systems such as phononics and mechanics. Typically, nontrivial topology in an $n$-dimensional bulk leads to the emergence of $(n-1)$-dimensional topologically protected boundary states. However, these states can often be gapped out by breaking the symmetry that protects them, resulting in the possible creation of new in-gap higher-order topological modes. A notable example of this is the higher-order topological insulator (HOTI), where gapping out surface states leads to the formation of lower-dimensional topological modes, such as hinge or corner states. This process reduces the spatial dimensionality of the protected modes from $(n-1)$ to $(n-2)$ or even lower. In this work, we propose an alternative method to achieve higher-order topological modes using a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Instead of relying on dimensional reduction, we manipulate the positions of domain walls to gap out the originally topologically protected domain-wall states, thereby inducing new higher-order topological states. These new higher-order topological states can be characterized using a generalized winding number calculation. This approach allows for the realization of multiple (and even infinite) topological orders within simple 1D lattices while maintaining the principle of bulk-boundary correspondence. Our study reveals a new mechanism that enriches topological hierarchies beyond conventional classifications. Such a mechanism could also be extended to higher dimensions, potentially creating intricate networks of topological states and advancing our control over wave phenomena.</description>

      <title>Giant Enhancement of Phonon Electron Coupling in Graphene under Femtosecond Laser Heating at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, phonon electron carrier dragging has emerged as an innovative approach for modulating energy transfer in low dimensional systems. In this Letter, we explore the fundamental mechanisms of electron-phonon coupling and the role of thermal lag behavior in ultrafast heat transport. We present a theoretical investigation of non-equilibrium thermal dynamics in graphene under femtosecond laser excitation, emphasizing the role of phonon branch-resolved electron phonon coupling. This framework provides new insight into ultrafast energy transfer processes at femtosecond timescales and illustrates key deviations from the predictions of the classical two temperature model (TTM), particularly in spatially localized heat transport. Our results show that a 190 fs laser pulse induces a strong non-equilibrium state, followed by momentum redistribution among the excited carriers. This is then followed by effective cooling of the carrier distribution on a 450 fs timescale through phonon emission.</description>

      <title>FeTaX2: A ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose that the van der Waals layered ternary transition metal chalcogenide FeTaX$_2$ (X = S, Se, Te) is a new family of ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulators with sizable bulk gap and Chern number C = -2. The magnetic ordering originates predominantly from the Fe atoms, where strong ferromagnetic exchange interactions between them induce magnetic moments on the Ta sites, yielding a collinear ferrimagnetic ground state. The large topological gap arises from the deep sd-type band inversion between spin-down Ta d$_{z^2}$ and d$_{xy}$ orbitals near the Fermi level-a mechanism unique to d-orbital systems. Remarkably, the Curie temperature of monolayer FeTaX$_2$ is predicted to significantly exceed that of monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Furthermore, both the Curie temperature and topological gap scale positively with the spin orbit coupling strength of the $d$ electrons, suggesting a common physical origin. These findings, if realized experimentally, could open new avenues for the research and application of topological quantum physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene nanoislands (GNIs) are one of the promising building blocks for quantum devices owing to their unique potential. However, direct electrical measurements of GNIs have been challenging due to the requirement of metal catalysts in typical synthesis methods. In this study, we demonstrate electrical transport measurements of GNIs by using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition, which is a catalyst-free method to deposit graphene directly on SiO$_2$ substrates. This approach enables the fabrication of metal electrodes on GNIs, allowing us to measure their quantum transport properties. At low temperatures, one of our devices shows clear Coulomb diamonds with twofold degeneracy, indicating the formation of quantum dots and the vanishing of valley degeneracy. The charge state of the GNI is also modulated by a local side gate, and the tunneling coupling between leads and quantum dots is modulated by changing contact area and metal materials. These results provide device design guidelines toward GNI-based quantum devices for next-generation computing.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit interaction in tubular prismatic nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the spin-orbit interaction in the outer regions of core-shell nanowires that can act as tubular, prismatic conductors. The polygonal cross section of these wires induces non-uniform electron localization along the wire perimeter. In particular, low-energy electrons accumulate in the corner regions, and in the case of narrow shells, conductive channels form along the sharp edges. In contrast, higher-energy electrons are shifted toward the facets. These two groups of states may be separated by large energy gaps, which can exceed the room-temperature energy in the case of triangular geometries. We compare the impact of spin-orbit interaction on the corner and side states of hexagonal and triangular shells grown on hexagonal cores as well as on triangular shells grown on triangular cores. We find that the spin-orbit splitting, and thus the degeneracy of energy states at finite wave vectors, strongly depends on the tube's geometry. We demonstrate that the weak spin-orbit coupling observed in clean wires can be significantly enhanced if the intermixing of core and shell materials takes place. Moreover, we show that the energy spectrum in the presence of spin-orbit interaction allows for estimating the interaction between states and shows that triangular shells can act as three independent wires in the low-energy regime, while they behave as interacting systems at higher energy ranges.</description>

      <title>Generating phase singularities using surface exciton polaritons in an organic natural hyperbolic material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface polaritons (SPs) are electromagnetic waves bound to a surface through their interaction with charge carriers in the surface material. Hyperbolic SPs can be supported by optically anisotropic materials where the in-plane and out-of-plane permittivies have opposite signs. Here we report what we believe to be the first experimental study of hyperbolic surface exciton polaritons (HSEPs). We study the intensity and phase response of HSEPs in the J-aggregate TDBC (a type-II natural hyperbolic material). HSEPs can be used to generate phase singularities; the behaviour of these phase singularities is a consequence of the hyperbolic nature of TDBC. The combined intensity and phase response of non-hyperbolic and hyperbolic SPs suggests that they are topologically distinct. We predict analogous effects for hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride. Our work suggests that organic materials can provide a new platform for the exploration of hyperbolic surface polaritonics at visible frequencies.</description>

      <title>Erbium-implanted WS2 flakes with room-temperature photon emission at telecom wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically addressable spin impurities in crystals along with device engineering provide an attractive route to realizing quantum technologies in the solid state, but reconciling disparate emitter and host material constraints for a given target application is often challenging. Rare-earth ions in two-dimensional (2D) materials could mitigate this problem given the atomic-like transitions of the emitters and the versatile nature of van der Waals systems. Here we combine ion implantation, confocal microscopy, and ab-initio calculations to examine the photon emission of Er-doped WS2 flakes. Optical spectroscopy reveals narrow, long-lived photo-luminescence lines in the telecom band, which we activate after low-temperature thermal annealing. Spectroscopic and polarization-selective measurements show a uniform response across the ensemble, while the fluorescence brightness remains mostly unchanged with temperature, suggesting non-radiative relaxation channels are inefficient. Our results create opportunities for novel solid state devices coupling 2D-hosted, telecom-band emitters to photonic heterostructures separately optimized for photon manipulation.</description>

      <title>Modulated Dirac bands and integer hopping ratios in a honeycomb lattice of phenalenyl-tessellation molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of nanographene molecules called phenalenyl-tessellation molecules (PTMs) exhibits two types of zero modes: a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ type that spreads over the entire molecule and a vacancy-localized type. A periodic system of PTMs is expected to have low-energy bands that strongly reflect the properties of the zero modes of PTMs as effective atoms. In this study, we show that the low-energy Dirac bands in a class of honeycomb PTMs (H-PTM) can be represented by an effective honeycomb model which is determined only by the connections between neighboring effective atoms.The hopping parameters of H-PTM in each direction take positive integer ratios according to the connection order between two PTMs.By structurally designing each PTM, we can change the connection order of the PTMs and hence modulate the energy gap and the Fermi velocity of the Dirac band of the H-PTM. Moreover, we confirm that Dirac bands coexist with vacancy-localized zero modes in the H-PTM with vacancies.The result indicates that the nanographene structure arranging PTMs as effective atoms extends material design freedom that effectively generates a modulated Dirac electron system with coexisting localized electron spins for graphene-based electronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Disentangling contributions to longitudinal magnetoconductivity for Kramers-Weyl nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set out to compute the longitudinal magnetoconductivity for an isolated and isotropic Kramers-Weyl node (KWN), existing in chiral crystals, which forms an exotic cousin of the conventional Weyl nodes resulting from band-inversions. The peculiarities of KWNs are many, the principal one being the presence of two concentric Fermi surfaces at any positive chemical potential ($\mu$) with respect to the nodal point. This is caused by a dominant quadratic-in-momentum dispersion, with the linear-in-momentum Dirac- or Weyl-like terms relegated to a secondary status. In a KWN, the chirally-conjugate node typically serves as a mere doppelg\"anger, being significantly separated in energy. Hence, when $\mu$ is set near such a node, the signatures of a lone node are probed in the transport-measurements. The intrinsic topological quantities in the forms of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment contribute to the linear response, which we determine by exactly solving the semiclassical Bolzmann equations. Another crucial feature is that the two bands at the same KWN node carry actual spin-quantum numbers, thus providing an additional coupling to an external magnetic field ($\boldsymbol B$), and affecting the conductivity. We take this into account as well, and demonstrate that it causes a linear-in-$B$ dependence, on top of the usual $B^2$-dependence.</description>

      <title>Scalable Machine Learning Models for Predicting Quantum Transport in Disordered 2D Hexagonal Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce scalable machine learning models to accurately predict two key quantum transport properties, the transmission coefficient T(E) and the local density of states (LDOS) in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials with magnetic disorder. Using a tight binding Hamiltonian combined with the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism, we generate a large dataset of over 400,000 unique configurations across graphene, germanene, silicene, and stanene nanoribbons with varying geometries, impurity concentrations, and energy levels. A central contribution of this work is the development of a geometrydriven, physically interpretable feature space that enables the models to generalize across material types and device sizes. Random Forest regression and classification models are evaluated in terms of accuracy, stability, and extrapolation ability. Regression consistently outperforms classification in capturing continuous transport behavior on in-domain data. However, extrapolation performance degrades significantly, revealing the limitations of tree-based models in unseen regimes. This study highlights both the potential and constraints of scalable ML models for quantum transport prediction and motivates future research into physics-informed or graph-based learning architectures for improved generalization in spintronic and nanoelectronic device design.</description>

      <title>Squeezing and quantum control of antiferromagnetic magnon pseudospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets have been shown to harbor strong magnon squeezing in equilibrium, making them a potential resource for quantum correlations and entanglement. Recent experiments have also found them to host coherently coupled magnonic excitations forming a magnon pseudospin, in analogy to electronic spin. Here, we delineate the quantum properties of antiferromagnetic magnon pseudospin by accounting for spin non-conserving interactions and going beyond the rotating wave approximation. Employing concrete examples of nickel oxide and hematite, we find strong squeezing of the magnon pseudospin highlighting its important role in determining the eigenmode quantum properties. Via ground state quantum fluctuations engineering, this pseudospin squeezing enables an enhancement and control of coupling between the magnonic modes and other excitations. Finally, we evaluate the quantum superpositions that comprise a squeezed pseudospin ground state and delineate a qubit spectroscopy protocol to detect them. Our results are applicable to any system of coupled bosons and thus introduce quantum fluctuations engineering of a general bosonic pseudospin.</description>

      <title>Momentum-space Metric Tensor from Nonadiabatic Evolution of Bloch Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal a fundamental geometric structure of momentum space arising from the nonadiabatic evolution of Bloch electrons. By extending semiclassical wave packet theory to incorporate nonadiabatic effects, we introduce a momentum-space metric tensor -- the nonadiabatic metric. This metric gives rise to two velocity corrections, dubbed geometric and geodesic velocities, providing a unified and intuitive framework for understanding nonlinear and nonadiabatic transport phenomena beyond Berry phase effects. Furthermore, we show that the nonadiabatic metric endows momentum space with a curved geometry, recasting wave packet dynamics as forced geodesic motion. In this picture, the metric defines distances, the Berry connection acts as a gauge potential, band dispersion serves as a scalar potential, and the toroidal topology of the Brillouin zone imposes periodic boundary conditions. When the nonadiabatic metric is constant, it reduces to an effective mass, allowing electrons to behave as massive particles in flat bands. In a flat Chern band with harmonic attractive interactions, the two-body wave functions mirror the Landau-level wave functions on a torus.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic defects explain n-type conductivity in CrSBr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling native defects is essential for unlocking the full potential of two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors. Here, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles calculations are used to explore the electronic properties of bulk CrSBr. ARPES measurements reveal clear signatures of conduction band filling in as-grown crystals, indicative of unintentional doping. An analysis of intrinsic defects based on density functional theory (DFT) identifies chromium interstitials ($Cr_i$) stabilized between CrSBr layers as the most favorable shallow donors. Bromine-on-sulfur antisites ($Br_S$) and bromine vacancies ($V_{Br}$) are also found to act as potential donors, albeit with deeper ionization energies. Our results shed light on the origin of unintentional $\textit{n}$-type doping of CrSBr and pave the way for new strategies for defect control and electronic property tuning in this van der Waals magnet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters serve as essential on-demand photonic resources, generating quantum states of light such as single photons and entangled photon pairs while serving as interfaces between light and matter. Buried in the solid state, quantum emitters enable a straightforward adoption of advanced nanofabrication techniques, facilitating precise engineering of their photonic environment for scalable quantum technologies. In this review, we introduce the fundamentals of quantum emitters and the key metrics characterising their performance. We highlight three material platforms: quantum dots, defect centres in diamond, and defect centres in silicon carbide. We summarise the recent developments of these platforms and discuss their advancements in quantum applications, including quantum communication, computation, and sensing. Finally, we provide a comparison across the three platforms, along with an outlook on future directions and potential challenges.</description>

      <title>Nickel Doping Unlocks Ambient-condition Photostability in Individual Cesium Lead Bromide Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing efficient single-photon sources is fundamental to advancing photonic quantum technologies. In particular, achieving scalable, cost-effective, stable, high-rate, and high-purity single-photon emission at ambient conditions is paramount for free-space quantum communication. However, fulfilling all the requirements simultaneously under ambient conditions has remained a significant challenge. Here, the scalable, cost-effective ambient condition synthesis of nickel doped (Ni doped) CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (NPQDs) is presented using a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) method. The resulting individual NPQDs demonstrate remarkable photostability, sustaining their performance for over 10 minutes under ambient conditions with environment humidity of ~55%, and exhibit exceptional single-photon purity (&gt;99%) with a narrow emission linewidth (~70 meV). The remarkable photostability could be attributed to the spatial localization of exciton by Ni atoms on the surface of the nanocrystal, reducing its interaction with the environment. Our results demonstrated that NPQDs with outstanding combinations of quantum emitting properties can be both synthesized and operated at ambient conditions. These findings mark a significant step toward scalable, cost-effective quantum light sources for real-world applications, paving the way for robust quantum communication systems and devices.</description>

      <title>Topologically Distinct Berry Phases in a Single Triangular M\"obius Microwave Resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of two distinct Berry phases ($+\frac{2\pi}{3}$ and $-\frac{2\pi}{3}$) generated on the surface of a M\"{o}bius cavity resonator at microwave frequencies supporting the TE$_{1,0,n}$ mode family. This resonator consists of a twisted, mirror-asymmetric prism with a cross-section of the triangular $D_3$ symmetry group, bent around on itself to form a ring. This geometric class supports resonant modes with non-zero electromagnetic helicity (i.e. nonzero $\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$ product) at microwave frequencies. There exist modes with three-fold rotational symmetry as well as those that exhibit no rotational symmetry. The latter result in an accumulated Berry phase whilst the former do not, which is determined from the measured frequency shift of the modes when compared to a mirror-symmetric resonator of otherwise equivalent geometry.</description>

      <title>Structure-Informed Learning of Flat Band 2D Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat electronic bands enhance electron-electron interactions and give rise to correlated states such as unconventional superconductivity or fractional topological phases. However, most current efforts towards flat-band materials discovery rely on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and manual band structures inspection, restraining their applicability to vast unexplored material spaces. While data-driven methods offer a scalable alternative, most existing models either depend on band structure inputs or focus on scalar properties like bandgap, which fail to capture flat-band characteristics. Here, we report a structure-informed framework for the discovery of previously unrecognized flat-band two-dimensional (2D) materials, which combines a data-driven flatness score capturing both band dispersion and density-of-states characteristics with multi-modal learning from atomic structure inputs. The framework successfully identified multiple flat-band candidates, with DFT validation of kagome-based systems confirming both band flatness and topological character. Our results show that the flatness score provides a physically meaningful signal for identifying flat bands from atomic geometry. The framework uncovers multiple new candidates with topologically nontrivial flat bands from unlabeled data, with consistent model performance across structurally diverse materials. By eliminating the need for precomputed electronic structures, our method enables large-scale screening of flat-band materials and expands the search space for discovering strongly correlated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Properties and Optical Signatures in Quasi-1D Metal-Halide Perovskites with Tunable Octahedral Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing the dimensionality of metal-halide perovskites enhances quantum and dielectric confinement, enabling tunable excitonic properties. In one dimension, the arrangement of metal-halide octahedra in chains with corner-, edge-, or face-sharing connectivity allows for additional structural flexibility. This not only expands material design possibilities but also reflects quasi-one-dimensional motifs that arise during perovskite formation but are poorly understood. Using first-principles many-body perturbation theory within the $GW$ and Bethe-Salpeter Equation framework, we provide a comprehensive picture of how one-dimensional confinement, octahedral connectivity and dielectric screening affect optical absorption and exciton photophysics in these materials. Our calculations reveal that increasing octahedral connectivity leads to increased exciton binding and complex, anisotropic optical signatures. However, in experimental compounds, pronounced dielectric screening effects can shift exciton binding energies by several hundred meV, altering these trends. These findings offer insights and design principles for excitonic properties, and aid the interpretation of optical experiments on one-dimensional perovskites.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and study a generalized energy conservation relation for scattering of time-modulated waves, where conventional energy conservation does not hold. Based on this relation, we derive an optical theorem and compute the active power describing the power input or output due to scattering. Notably, the same system may be subject to energy gain, energy loss, or energy conservation depending on the frequency harmonics present in the wave field. Moreover, we show how the optical theorem derived herein may be used for image reconstruction based on measurements of the power. Notably, such measurements do not require information about the phase of the scattered field.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Mechanism of Anyon Superconductivity Emerging from Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\'e materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a time-linear scaling method to simulate open and correlated quantum systems out of equilibrium. The method inherits from many-body perturbation theory the possibility to choose selectively the most relevant scattering processes in the dynamics, thereby paving the way to the real-time characterization of correlated ultrafast phenomena in quantum transport. The open system dynamics is described in terms of an embedding correlator from which the time-dependent current can be calculated using the Meir-Wingreen formula. We show how to efficiently implement our approach through a simple grafting into recently proposed time-linear Green's function methods for closed systems. Electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions can be treated on equal footing while preserving all fundametal conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Probing enhanced electron-phonon coupling in graphene by infrared resonance Raman spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on resonance Raman spectroscopy measurements with excitation photon energy down to 1.16 eV on graphene, to study how low-energy carriers interact with lattice vibrations. Thanks to the excitation energy close to the Dirac point at $\mathbf{K}$, we unveil a giant increase of the intensity ratio between the double-resonant 2D and 2D$^\prime$ peaks with respect to that measured in graphite. Comparing with fully \textit{ab initio} theoretical calculations, we conclude that the observation is explained by an enhanced, momentum-dependent coupling between electrons and Brillouin zone-boundary optical phonons. This finding applies to two dimensional Dirac systems and has important consequences for the modeling of transport in graphene devices operating at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Role of bias and tunneling asymmetries in nonlinear Fermi-liquid transport through an SU($N$) quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01162v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how bias and tunneling asymmetries affect nonlinear current through a quantum dot with $N$ discrete levels in the Fermi liquid regime, using an exact low-energy expansion of the current derived up to terms of order $V^3$ with respect to the bias voltage. The expansion coefficients are described in terms of the phase shift, the linear susceptibilities, and the three-body correlation functions, defined with respect to the equilibrium ground state of the Anderson impurity model. In particular, the three-body correlations play an essential role in the order $V^3$ term, and their coupling to the nonlinear current depends crucially on the bias and tunnel asymmetries. The number of independent components of the three-body correlation functions increases with $N$ the internal degrees of the quantum dots, and it gives a variety in the low-energy transport. We calculate the correlation functions over a wide range of electron fillings of the Anderson impurity model with the SU($N$) internal symmetry, using the numerical renormalization group. We find that the order $V^3$ nonlinear current through the SU($N$) Kondo state, which occurs at electron fillings of $1$ and $N-1$ for strong Coulomb interactions, significantly varies with the three-body contributions as tunnel asymmetries increase. Furthermore, in the valence fluctuation regime toward the empty or fully occupied impurity state, a sharp peak emerges in the coefficient of $V^3$ current in the case at which bias and tunneling asymmetries cooperatively enhance the charge transfer from one of the electrodes.</description>

      <title>Floquet Amorphous Topological Orders in a One-dimensional Rydberg Glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological orders in amorphous systems that lack crystalline symmetry have gained considerable attention recently. Here we propose the Floquet amorphous topological matter, among which the topological orders are explored in experimentally accessible one-dimensional array of randomly pointed Rydberg atoms with periodic driving. The topological properties are comprehensively characterized, considering both the single-particle and many-body perspectives. It is found that the periodic driving leads to rich topological phases of matter. At the single-particle level, we evaluate the real space winding numbers and polarization, revealing robust amorphous topological phases with 0-type and $\pi$-type edge modes. We show a structural disorder induced topological phase transition associated with localization transition in the nonequilibrium system. Remarkably, in the many-body case it is discovered that the amorphous topological order exists in the chain of hardcore bosons, captured by the topological entanglement entropy and the string order. Moreover, feasible experimental probe protocols are also elaborated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems featuring an intricate interplay between skin and boundary modes has attracted enormous theoretical and experimental attention. Still, in dimensions higher than one, this interplay remains much less understood. Here we provide insights from exact analytical solutions of a large class of models in any dimension, $d$, with open boundaries in $d_c \le d$ directions and by tracking their topological origin. Specifically, we show that amoeba theory accounting for the separation gaps of the bulk modes augmented with higher-dimensional generalizations of the biorthogonal polarization and the generalized Brillouin zone approaches accounting for the surface gaps of boundary modes provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems.</description>

      <title>Genuine topological Anderson insulator from impurity induced chirality reversal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a model of Dirac fermions with Haldane type mass impurities which open a global topological gap even in the dilute limit. Surprisingly, we find that the chirality of this mass term, i.e., the sign of the Chern number, can be reversed by tuning the magnitude of the single-impurity scattering. Consequently, the disorder induces a phase disconnected from the clean topological phase, i.e., a genuine topological Anderson insulator. In seeming contradiction to the expectation that mass disorder is an irrelevant perturbation to the clean integer quantum Hall transition, the tri-critical point separating these two Chern insulating phases and a thermal metal phase is located at zero impurity density and connected to the appearance of a zero energy bound state in the continuum corresponding to a divergent Haldane mass impurity. Our conclusions based on the T-matrix expansion are substantiated by large scale Chebyshev-Polynomial-Green-Function numerics. We discuss possible experimental platforms.</description>

Abstract: In transmission electron energy-loss spectroscopy, the cross section in 2D is quenched by kinematic effects once the momentum transfer becomes smaller than a critical value set by $q_z$, the momentum loss parallel to the beam. Our highly momentum ($\Delta q = 0.02$~\r{A}$^{-1}$) and energy ($\Delta E = 45$~meV) resolved setup is instrumental on delivering the unprecedented experimental verification of quenched 2D EEL spectra on freestanding graphene at momentum transfers $q$ below $0.06$\r{A}$^{-1}$. We retrieve the intrinsic uniform dielectric response of graphene from measured spectra by quantifying the kinematic suppression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally observe harmonic oscillations in a bosonic condensate of exciton-polaritons confined within an elliptical trap. These oscillations arise from quantum beats between two size-quantized states of the condensate, split in energy due to the trap's ellipticity. By precisely targeting specific spots inside the trap with nonresonant laser pulses, we control frequency, amplitude, and phase of these quantum beats. The condensate wave function dynamics is visualized on a streak camera and mapped to the Bloch sphere, demonstrating Hadamard and Pauli-Z operations. We conclude that a qubit based on a superposition of these two polariton states would exhibit a coherence time exceeding the lifetime of an individual exciton-polariton by at least two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum acoustic framework has recently emerged as a non-perturbative, coherent approach to electron-lattice interactions, uncovering rich physics often obscured by perturbative methods with incoherent scattering events. Here, we model the strongly coupled dynamics of electrons and acoustic lattice vibrations within this framework, representing lattice vibrations as coherent states and electrons as quantum wavepackets, in a manner distinctively different from tight-binding or discrete hopping-based approaches. We derive and numerically implement electron backaction on the lattice, providing both visual and quantitative insights into electron wavepacket evolution and the formation of acoustic polarons. We investigate polaron binding energies across varying material parameters and compute key observables, including mean square displacement, kinetic energy, potential energy, and vibrational energy. over time. Our findings reveal the conditions that favor polaron formation, which is enhanced by low temperatures, high deformation potential constants, slow sound velocities, and high effective masses. Additionally, we explore the impact of external electric and magnetic fields, showing that while polaron formation remains robust under moderate fields, it is weakly suppressed at higher field strengths. These results deepen our understanding of polaron dynamics and pave the way for future studies into non-trivial transport behavior in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>The impact of hole $g$-factor anisotropy on spin-photon entanglement generation with InGaAs quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) are of particular importance for the deterministic generation of spin-photon entanglement. One promising scheme relies on the Larmor precession of a spin in a transverse magnetic field, which is governed by the in-plane $g$-factors of the electron and valence band heavy-hole. We probe the origin of heavy-hole $g$-factor anisotropy with respect to the in-plane magnetic field direction and uncover how it impacts the entanglement generated between the spin and the photon polarization. First, using polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements on a single QD, we determine that the impact of valence-band mixing dominates over effects due to a confinement-renormalized cubic Luttinger $q$ parameter. From this, we construct a comprehensive hole $g$-tensor model. We then use this model to simulate the concurrence and fidelity of spin-photon entanglement generation with anisotropic hole $g$-factors, which can be tuned via magnetic field angle and excitation polarization. The results demonstrate that post-growth control of the hole $g$-factor can be used to improve spin-photon cluster state generation.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Sub-Wavelength Microwave Polarization Switch Implemented with Directed Surface Acoustic Waves in a Magnonic Crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to switch the polarization of a transmitted electromagnetic wave from vertical to horizontal, or vice versa, is of great technological interest because of its many applications in long distance communication. Binary bits can be encoded in two orthogonal polarizations and transmitted securely from point to point. Polarization switches, however, are usually much larger than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. Consequently, most research in this area has focused on the optical regime where the wavelength is relatively short (~1 micron), so that the switch being much larger than the wavelength is not too inconvenient. However, this changes in the microwave regime where the wavelength is much larger (typically &gt; 1 cm). That makes a microwave ultra-sub-wavelength polarization switch very attractive. Here, we report such a switch made of an array of magnetostrictive nanomagnets (~100 nm lateral dimension) deposited on a piezoelectric substrate to make an "artificial magnonic crystal". A surface acoustic wave (SAW) launched in the substrate with suitable electrodes excites spin waves in the nanomagnets via phonon-magnon coupling, resulting in radiation of electromagnetic waves via magnon-photon coupling. The polarization of the beam radiated in one particular direction at a given frequency can be rotated through ~90 degrees by switching the direction of SAW propagation in the piezoelectric substrate between two mutually orthogonal directions. By aligning the transmitter and the receiver along that particular direction (known only to authorized users), one can communicate securely from point to point, without the need for encryption or cryptography.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kinetic Uncertainty Relations in Mesoscopic Conductors at Strong Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic Uncertainty Relations (KURs) establish quantum transport precision limits by linking signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the system's dynamical activity, valid in the weak-coupling regime where particle-like transport dominates. At strong coupling, quantum coherence challenges the validity of KURs and questions the meaning of the concept of activity itself. Here, we introduce a generalized dynamical activity valid at arbitrary coupling and derive a steady-state quantum KUR (QKUR) expressed in terms of this generalized activity. Explicit expressions are obtained within Green's function and Landauer-B\"uttiker formalisms. This QKUR ensures that uncertainty relations are valid across all coupling strengths, offering a general framework for out-of-equilibrium quantum transport precision analysis. We illustrate these concepts for paradigmatic quantum-coherent mesoscopic devices: a single quantum channel pinched by a quantum point contact and open single- and double-quantum dot systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using first principles techniques, we show that infrared optical response can be used to discriminate between the topological and the trivial phases of two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHI). We showcase germanene and jacutingaite, of recent experimental realization, as prototypical systems where the infrared spectrum is discontinuous across the transition, due to sudden and large discretized jumps of the value of Born effective charges (up to 2). For these materials, the topological transition can be induced via the application of an external electrostatic potential in the field-effect setup. Our results are rationalized in the framework of a low-energy Kane-Mele model and are robust with respect to dynamical effects which come into play when the energy gap of the material is of the same order of the infrared active phonon frequency. In the small gap QSHI germanene, due to dynamical effects, the in-plane phonon resonance in the optical conductivity shows a Fano profile with remarkable differences in the intensity and the shape between the two phases. Instead, the large gap QSHI jacutingaite presents several IR-active phonon modes whose spectral intensities drastically change between the two phases.</description>

Abstract: Ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals with Kagome lattice structures exhibit a strong coupling between magnetism and topological band features. Co3Sn2S2 is a prime example, showing a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE) driven by Berry curvature from the Weyl nodes. We investigated the temperature and angular dependence of Hall conductivity in thick Co3Sn2S2 crystals, aiming to distinguish between topological and conventional magnetic contributions. Our measurements reveal a robust Hall response even at low magnetic fields and temperatures above 77 K, suggesting a dominant topological origin and weak sensitivity to external conditions.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the localized surface plasmon modes of a sub-wavelength spherical nanoparticle composed of a Weyl semimetal, taking into account the axion modification of electrodynamics. We derive analytical solutions for dipole and quadrupole normal modes by employing the quasistatic approximation. The axion term leads to modified Fr\"ohlich conditions, resulting in multiple non-degenerate plasmonic resonances with distinct polarization dependencies. In contrast to isotropic conventional metals, the magnetoelectric properties of Weyl semimetals enable an incident electromagnetic field, with the electric field transverse to the surface of the sphere, to excite a localized surface plasmon.</description>

Abstract: Exploiting quantum interference of charge carriers, epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbide emerges as a game-changing platform for ultra-sensitive bolometric sensing, featuring an intrinsic resistive thermometer response unmatched by any other graphene variant. By achieving low and uniform carrier densities, we have accessed a new regime of strong charge localization that dramatically reduces thermal conductance, significantly enhancing bolometer performance. Here we present scalable graphene-based bolometers engineered for detecting GHz-range photons, a frequency domain essential for superconducting quantum processors. Our devices deliver a state-of-the-art noise equivalent power of 40 zW$/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ at $T=40~$mK, enabled by the steep temperature dependence of thermal conductance, $G_{\rm th}\sim T^4$ for $T&lt;100~$mK. These results establish epitaxial graphene bolometers as versatile and low-back-action detectors, unlocking new possibilities for next-generation quantum processors and pioneering investigations into the thermodynamics and thermalization pathways of strongly entangled quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study electron transport through a Y-shaped junction of helical edge states in a two-dimensional topological insulator (2DTI), focusing on the strongly interacting regime. An experimentally accessible device geometry is proposed, and the corresponding conductance tensor is calculated. These results position Y-junctions of 2DTI as promising platforms for interaction-driven transport and nanoscale device applications in spintronics and topological electronics.</description>

      <title>Flipping of electronic spins in BiFeO$_3$ via chiral $d-d$ excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BiFeO$_3$ is a multiferroic material featuring ferroelectricity and noncollinear antiferromagnetism. Definitive and efficient control of the characteristic spin texture of BiFeO$_3$ is attractive for emerging quantum devices. In this regard, crystal-field $d\rightarrow d$ excitations localized on Fe atomic sites in BiFeO$_3$ provide an avenue for manipulation of the spin texture as they induce a complex interplay among the spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom. In this work, the \textit{ab initio} \textit{GW}-BSE method is used to characterize these excitations within an excitonic picture. We find that the $d-d$ transitions appear as strongly bound, chiral, spin-flip excitons deep within the electronic band gap as a result of the intricate competition between the lattice potential, the antiferromagnetic ordering, the spin-orbit coupling, and the electron-hole interaction. Most crucially, these excitons are composed of electron-hole pairs with opposite spins that constitute almost all of their $\pm \hbar$ total angular momentum. These excitons of specific angular momentum can be selectively excited using circularly polarized light, consequently modulating the local magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio Van der Waals electrodynamics: polaritons and electron scattering from plasmons and phonons in BN-capped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmons and polar phonons are elementary electrodynamic excitations of matter. In 2d and at long wavelengths, they couple to light and act as the system polaritons. They also dictate the scattering of charged carriers. Van der Waals heterostructures offer the opportunity to couple excitations from different layers via long-range Coulomb interactions, modifying both their dispersion and their scattering of electrons. Even when the excitations do not couple, they are still influenced by the screening from all layers, leading to complex dynamical interactions between electrons, plasmons and polar phonons. We develop an efficient ab initio model to solve the dynamical electric response of Van der Waals heterostructures, accompanied by a formalism to extract relevant spectroscopic and transport quantities. Notably, we obtain scattering rates for electrons of the heterostructure coupling remotely with electrodynamic excitations. We apply those developments to BN-capped graphene, in which polar phonons from BN couple to plasmons in graphene. We study the nature of the coupled excitations, their dispersion and their coupling to graphene's electrons. Regimes driven by either phonons or plasmons are identified, as well as a truly hybrid regime at long wavelengths. Those are studied as a function of the graphene's Fermi level and the number of BN layers. In contrast with descriptions in terms of surface-optical phonons, we find that the electron-phonon interaction stems from different modes. Moreover, the dynamical screening of the coupling between BN's LO phonons and graphene's electrons crosses over from inefficient to metal-like depending on the relative value of the phonons' frequency and the energetic onset of interband transitions. While the coupling is significant in general, the associated scattering of graphene's carriers is found to be negligible in the context of electronic transport.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01627v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.</description>

      <title>Imprinting electrically switchable scalar spin chirality by anisotropic strain in a Kagome antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological chiral antiferromagnets, such as Mn$_{3}$Sn, are emerging as promising materials for next-generation spintronic devices due to their intrinsic transport properties linked to exotic magnetic configurations. Here, we demonstrate that anisotropic strain in Mn$_{3}$Sn thin films offers a novel approach to manipulate the magnetic ground state, unlocking new functionalities in this material. Anisotropic strain reduces the point group symmetry of the manganese (Mn) Kagome triangles from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{1}$, significantly altering the energy landscape of the magnetic states in Mn$_{3}$Sn. This symmetry reduction enables even a tiny in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction to induce canting of the Mn spins out of the Kagome plane. The modified magnetic ground state introduces a finite scalar spin chirality and results in a significant Berry phase in momentum space. Consequently, a large anomalous Hall effect emerges in the Kagome plane at room temperature - an effect that is absent in the bulk material. Moreover, this two-fold degenerate magnetic state enables the creation of multiple-stable, non-volatile anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) memory states. These states are field-stable and can be controlled by thermal assisted current-induced magnetization switching requiring modest current densities and small bias fields, thereby offering a compelling new functionality in Mn$_{3}$Sn for spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent experimental observation of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effects in the rhombohedrally stacked pentalayer graphene has motivated theoretical discussions on the possibility of quantum anomalous Hall crystal (QAHC), a topological version of Wigner crystal. Conventional topological Wigner crystals typically have one electron per unit cell. In this work we propose new types of topological Wigner crystals labeled as QAHC-$z$, with $z$ electrons per unit cell. In the pentalayer graphene system, we find parameter regimes where QAHC-2 and QAHC-3 have lower energy than the conventional QAHC-1 at total filling $\nu=1$ per moir\'e unit cell. These states all have total Chern number $C_\mathrm{tot}=1$ and are consistent with the QAH effect observed in the experiments. The larger period QAHC states have lower kinetic energy due to the unique Mexican-hat dispersion of the pentalayer graphene, which can compensate for the loss in the interaction energy. Unlike QAHC-1, QAHC-2 and QAHC-3 break the moir\'e translation symmetry and are sharply distinct from a moir\'e band insulator. We also briefly discuss the competition between integer QAH and fractional QAH states at filling $\nu=2/3$. Moreover, we find that a stronger moir\'e potential can significantly change the phase diagram and even favors a QAHC-1 ansatz with $C=2$ Chern band.</description>

      <title>Four-fold Anisotropic Magnetoresistance in Antiferromagnetic Epitaxial Thin Films of MnPt$_{x}$Pd$_{1-x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets are emerging as promising alternatives to ferromagnets in spintronics applications. A key feature of antiferromagnets is their anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), which has the potential to serve as a sensitive marker for the antiferromagnetic order parameter. However, the underlying origins of this behavior remains poorly understood, particularly, in thin film geometries. In this study, we report the observation of AMR in epitaxial thin films of the collinear L1$_{0}$ antiferromagnet MnPt$_{x}$Pd$_{1-x}$. In the thicker films, AMR is dominated by a non-crystalline two-fold component, which emerges from domain reconfiguration and spin canting under applied magnetic field. As the film thickness is reduced, however, a crystalline four-fold component emerges, accompanied by the appearance of uncompensated magnetic moment, which strongly modifies the magnetotransport properties in the thinner films. We demonstrate that interfacial interactions lead to a large density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level. This enhanced DOS, combined with disorder in the thinner films, stabilizes the uncompensated moment and results in a four-fold modulation of the DOS as the Neel vector rotates, explaining the observed AMR behavior.</description>

      <title>Integrability versus chaos in the steady state of many-body open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad description of an open quantum system gives rise to two types of integrability, since the nonequilibrium steady state can be integrable independently of the Liouvillian. Taking boundary-driven and dephasing spin chains as a representative example, we discriminate Liouvillian and steady-state chaos by combining level spacing statistics and an extension of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to open quantum systems. Moreover, we analyze the structure of the steady states by expanding it in the basis of Pauli strings and comparing the weight of strings of different lengths. We show that the natural expectation that integrable steady states are "simple" (i.e., built from few-body local operators) does not hold: the steady states of both chaotic and integrable models have relevant contributions coming from Pauli strings of all possible lengths, including long-range and many-body interactions. Nevertheless, we show that one can effectively use the operator-size distribution to distinguish chaotic and integrable steady states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have provided compelling and renewed interest in phonon hydrodynamics. At variance with ordinary diffusive heat transport, this regime is primarily governed by momentum-conserving phonon collisions. At the mesoscopic scale it can be described by the viscous heat equations (VHE), that resemble the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in the laminar regime. Here, we show that the VHE can be separated and recast as modified biharmonic equations in the velocity potential and stream function$-$solvable analytically. These two can be merged into a complex potential defining the flow streamlines, and give rise to two distinct temperature contributions, ultimately related to thermal compressibility and vorticity. The irrotational and incompressible limits of the phonon VHE are analyzed, showing how the latter mirrors the NSE for the electron fluid. This work also extends to the electron compressible regime that arises when drift velocities can be higher than plasmonic velocities. Finally, by examining thermal flow within a 2D graphite strip device, we explore the boundary conditions and transport coefficients needed to observe thermal vortices and negative thermal resistance, or heat backflow from cooler to warmer regions. This work provides novel analytical tools to design hydrodynamic phonon flow, highlights its generalization for electron hydrodynamics, and promotes additional avenues to explore experimentally such fascinating phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) Metal Halides present unique and tunable properties. However, direct and oriented synthesis is challenging due to low formation energies that lead to rapid, uncontrolled growth during solution-based processing. Here, we report the solvent-free growth of oriented and n = 1 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). In situ photoluminescence (PL) during deposition reveals formation of the n =1 phase at the ear;y stages of growth. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering (GIWAXS) confirm a single oriented n = 1 phase, independent of the substrate. Co-localized spatially resolved PL and AFM further validate the conformal growth on strained epitaxial $\mbox{MAPbI}_3$ remain stable for over 184 days without any sign of cation exchange. This work highlights the potential of PLD for direct, room-temperature synthesis of 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films and stable 2D/3D heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Spin defects in solids offer promising platforms for quantum sensing and memory due to their long coherence times and compatibility with quantum networks. Here, we integrate a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond with scanning probe microscopy to discover, read out, and spatially map arbitrary spin-based quantum sensors at the nanoscale. Using the boron vacancy (V$_\mathrm{B}^-$) center in hexagonal boron nitride$\unicode{x2013}$an emerging two-dimensional spin system$\unicode{x2013}$as a model, we detect its electron spin resonance indirectly via changes in the spin relaxation time ($T_1$) of a nearby NV center, eliminating the need for optical excitation or fluorescence detection of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$. Cross-relaxation between NV and V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles significantly reduces NV $T_1$, enabling quantitative nanoscale mapping of defect densities beyond the optical diffraction limit and clear resolution of hyperfine splitting in isotopically enriched h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N. Our method demonstrates interactions between 3D and 2D spin sensors, establishing NV centers as versatile probes for characterizing otherwise inaccessible spin defects.</description>

Abstract: Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and superior quality factor. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm the presence of resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. This work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground state properties of materials using IR-active phonons.</description>
