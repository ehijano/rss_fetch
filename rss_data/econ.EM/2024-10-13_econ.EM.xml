      <title>Variance reduction combining pre-experiment and in-experiment data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online controlled experiments (A/B testing) are essential in data-driven decision-making for many companies. Increasing the sensitivity of these experiments, particularly with a fixed sample size, relies on reducing the variance of the estimator for the average treatment effect (ATE). Existing methods like CUPED and CUPAC use pre-experiment data to reduce variance, but their effectiveness depends on the correlation between the pre-experiment data and the outcome. In contrast, in-experiment data is often more strongly correlated with the outcome and thus more informative. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that combines both pre-experiment and in-experiment data to achieve greater variance reduction than CUPED and CUPAC, without introducing bias or additional computation complexity. We also establish asymptotic theory and provide consistent variance estimators for our method. Applying this method to multiple online experiments at Etsy, we reach substantial variance reduction over CUPAC with the inclusion of only a few in-experiment covariates. These results highlight the potential of our approach to significantly improve experiment sensitivity and accelerate decision-making.</description>

      <title>Federated Offline Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning personalized decision policies from observational bandit feedback data across multiple heterogeneous data sources. In our approach, we introduce a novel regret analysis that establishes finite-sample upper bounds on distinguishing notions of global regret for all data sources on aggregate and of local regret for any given data source. We characterize these regret bounds by expressions of source heterogeneity and distribution shift. Moreover, we examine the practical considerations of this problem in the federated setting where a central server aims to train a policy on data distributed across the heterogeneous sources without collecting any of their raw data. We present a policy learning algorithm amenable to federation based on the aggregation of local policies trained with doubly robust offline policy evaluation strategies. Our analysis and supporting experimental results provide insights into tradeoffs in the participation of heterogeneous data sources in offline policy learning.</description>

      <title>Zero-Inflated Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real applications of bandits have sparse non-zero rewards, leading to slow learning speed. Using problem-specific structures for careful distribution modeling is known as critical to estimation efficiency in statistics, yet is under-explored in bandits. We initiate the study of zero-inflated bandits, where the reward is modeled as a classic semi-parametric distribution called zero-inflated distribution. We design Upper Confidence Bound- and Thompson Sampling-type algorithms for this specific structure. We derive the regret bounds under both multi-armed bandits with general reward assumptions and contextual generalized linear bandit with sub-Gaussian rewards. In many settings, the regret rates of our algorithms are either minimax optimal or state-of-the-art. The superior empirical performance of our methods is demonstrated via numerical studies.</description>
