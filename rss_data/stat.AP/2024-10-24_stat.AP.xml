      <title>Improving measurement error and representativeness in nonprobability surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonprobability surveys suffer from representativeness issues due to their unknown selection mechanism. Recent research on nonprobability surveys has primarily focused on reducing such selection bias. But bias due to measurement error is also present, as pointed out by Kennedy, Mercer and Lau (2024) using a benchmarking study in the case of commercial online nonprobability surveys in the United States. Before this study, measurement error bias in nonprobability surveys has mostly been overlooked and statistical methods have been devised for reducing only the selection bias, under the assumption of accuracy of survey responses. Motivated by this case study, our research focuses on combining two key areas in nonprobability sampling research: representativeness and measurement error, specifically aiming to mitigate bias from both sampling and measurement errors. In the context of finite population mean estimation, we propose a new composite estimator that integrates both probability and nonprobability surveys, promising improved results compared to benchmark values from large government surveys. Its performance in comparison to an existing composite estimator is analyzed in terms of mean squared error, analytically and empirically. In the context of the aforementioned case study, we further investigate when the proposed composite estimator outperforms estimator from probability surveys alone.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Australian fertility by age, region, and birthplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fertility differentials by urban-rural residence and nativity of women in Australia significantly impact population composition at sub-national levels. We aim to provide consistent fertility forecasts for Australian women characterized by age, region, and birthplace. Age-specific fertility rates at the national and sub-national levels obtained from census data between 1981-2011 are jointly modeled and forecast by the grouped functional time series method. Forecasts for women of each region and birthplace are reconciled following the chosen hierarchies to ensure that results at various disaggregation levels consistently sum up to the respective national total. Coupling the region of residence disaggregation structure with the trace minimization reconciliation method produces the most accurate point and interval forecasts. In addition, age-specific fertility rates disaggregated by the birthplace of women show significant heterogeneity that supports the application of the grouped forecasting method.</description>

      <title>Equity in the Distribution of Regulatory PM2.5 Monitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unequal exposure to air pollution by race and socioeconomic status is well-documented in the U.S. However, there has been relatively little research on inequities in the collection of PM2.5 data, creating a critical gap in understanding which neighborhood exposures are represented in these datasets. In this study we use multilevel models with random intercepts by county and state, stratified by urbanicity to investigate the association between six key environmental justice (EJ) attributes (%AIAN, %Asian %Black, %Hispanic, %White, %Poverty) and proximity to the nearest regulatory monitor at the census tract-level across the contiguous 48 states. We also separately stratify our models by EPA region. Our results show that most EJ attributes exhibit weak or statistically insignificant associations with monitor proximity, except in rural areas where higher poverty levels are significantly linked to greater monitor distances ($\beta$ = 0.6, 95%CI = [0.49, 0.71]). While the US EPA's siting criteria may be effective in ensuring equitable monitor distribution in some contexts, the low density of monitors in rural areas may impact the accuracy of national-level air pollution monitoring.</description>

      <title>Mosqlimate: a platform to providing automatable access to data and forecasting models for arbovirus disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dengue is a climate-sensitive mosquito-borne disease with a complex transmission dynamic. Data related to climate, environmental and sociodemographic characteristics of the target population are important for project scenarios. Different datasets and methodologies have been applied to build complex models for dengue forecast, stressing the need to evaluate these models and their relative accuracy grounded on a reproducible methodology. The goal of this work is to describe and present Mosqlimate, a web-based platform composed by a dashboard, a data store, model and rediction registries and support for a community of practice in arbovirus forecasting. Multiple API endpoints give access to data for development, open registration of predictive models from different approaches and sharing of predictive models for arboviruses incidence, facilitating interaction between modellers and allowing for proper comparison of the performance of different registered models, by means of probabilistic scores. Epidemiological, entomological, climatic and sociodemographic datasets related to arboviruses in Brazil, are freely available for download, alongside full documentation.</description>

      <title>Massive Genealogies Distinguish Frontier from Steady-State Internal Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of human migration have focused on modern issues of international economics, politics, urbanization, or commuting. Here we make use of very large anonymized genealogies which offer quantitative metrics and models before census data became available. In European and North American data from 1400 to 1950 we find two distinct patterns of lifetime migration. The steady-state pattern shows a universal power-law distribution of migration distance; by its early appearance it cannot be dependent on post-industrial technology. The frontier pattern, in contrast, is not scale-free with its much longer average distances. All migration distances are well fit by a three parameter model; the temporal and geographic patterns of the fitted parameters give new insight to American internal expansion 1620-1950. Frontier migration is also highly directional and asymmetric; gravity models do not apply. The American frontier pattern arose from the colonial-era steady-state within a generation, plateaued for three generations, then returned to a more mobile steady-state, a sequence paralleled by the Steppe migrations that brought the Bronze Age to Neolithic Europe. The transient frontier pattern is enabled by large-scale technological or numeric imbalance and geographic opportunity; when these forces abate, a new steady-state begins.</description>

      <title>Saddlepoint Monte Carlo and its Application to Exact Ecological Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming X is a random vector and A a non-invertible matrix, one sometimes need to perform inference while only having access to samples of Y = AX. The corresponding likelihood is typically intractable. One may still be able to perform exact Bayesian inference using a pseudo-marginal sampler, but this requires an unbiased estimator of the intractable likelihood.
  We propose saddlepoint Monte Carlo, a method for obtaining an unbiased estimate of the density of Y with very low variance, for any model belonging to an exponential family. Our method relies on importance sampling of the characteristic function, with insights brought by the standard saddlepoint approximation scheme with exponential tilting. We show that saddlepoint Monte Carlo makes it possible to perform exact inference on particularly challenging problems and datasets. We focus on the ecological inference problem, where one observes only aggregates at a fine level. We present in particular a study of the carryover of votes between the two rounds of various French elections, using the finest available data (number of votes for each candidate in about 60,000 polling stations over most of the French territory).
  We show that existing, popular approximate methods for ecological inference can lead to substantial bias, which saddlepoint Monte Carlo is immune from. We also present original results for the 2024 legislative elections on political centre-to-left and left-to-centre conversion rates when the far-right is present in the second round. Finally, we discuss other exciting applications for saddlepoint Monte Carlo, such as dealing with aggregate data in privacy or inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Spatial Outliers: the Role of the Local Influence Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the analysis of large spatial datasets, identifying and treating spatial outliers is essential for accurately interpreting geographical phenomena. While spatial correlation measures, particularly Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), are widely used to detect spatial patterns, the presence of abnormal observations frequently distorts the landscape and conceals critical spatial relationships. These outliers can significantly impact analysis due to the inherent spatial dependencies present in the data. Traditional influence function (IF) methodologies, commonly used in statistical analysis to measure the impact of individual observations, are not directly applicable in the spatial context because the influence of an observation is determined not only by its own value but also by its spatial location, its connections with neighboring regions, and the values of those neighboring observations. In this paper, we introduce a local version of the influence function (LIF) that accounts for these spatial dependencies. Through the analysis of both simulated and real-world datasets, we demonstrate how the LIF provides a more nuanced and accurate detection of spatial outliers compared to traditional LISA measures and local impact assessments, improving our understanding of spatial patterns.</description>

      <title>Doubly protected estimation for survival outcomes utilizing external controls for randomized clinical trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Censored survival data are common in clinical trials, but small control groups can pose challenges, particularly in rare diseases or where balanced randomization is impractical. Recent approaches leverage external controls from historical studies or real-world data to strengthen treatment evaluation for survival outcomes. However, using external controls directly may introduce biases due to data heterogeneity. We propose a doubly protected estimator for the treatment-specific restricted mean survival time difference that is more efficient than trial-only estimators and mitigates biases from external data. Our method adjusts for covariate shifts via doubly robust estimation and addresses outcome drift using the DR-Learner for selective borrowing. The approach incorporates machine learning to approximate survival curves and detect outcome drifts without strict parametric assumptions, borrowing only comparable external controls. Extensive simulation studies and a real-data application evaluating the efficacy of Galcanezumab in mitigating migraine headaches have been conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Adaptive partition Factor Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Factor Analysis has traditionally been utilized across diverse disciplines to extrapolate latent traits that influence the behavior of multivariate observed variables. Historically, the focus has been on analyzing data from a single study, neglecting the potential study-specific variations present in data from multiple studies. Multi-study factor analysis has emerged as a recent methodological advancement that addresses this gap by distinguishing between latent traits shared across studies and study-specific components arising from artifactual or population-specific sources of variation. In this paper, we extend the current methodologies by introducing novel shrinkage priors for the latent factors, thereby accommodating a broader spectrum of scenarios -- from the absence of study-specific latent factors to models in which factors pertain only to small subgroups nested within or shared between the studies. For the proposed construction we provide conditions for identifiability of factor loadings and guidelines to perform straightforward posterior computation via Gibbs sampling. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits competing performance across a variety of scenarios compared to existing methods, yet providing richer insights. The practical benefits of our approach are further illustrated through applications to bird species co-occurrence data and ovarian cancer gene expression data.</description>

      <title>Tail-adaptive Bayesian shrinkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.02192v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust Bayesian methods for high-dimensional regression problems under diverse sparse regimes are studied. Traditional shrinkage priors are primarily designed to detect a handful of signals from tens of thousands of predictors in the so-called ultra-sparsity domain. However, they may not perform desirably when the degree of sparsity is moderate. In this paper, we propose a robust sparse estimation method under diverse sparsity regimes, which has a tail-adaptive shrinkage property. In this property, the tail-heaviness of the prior adjusts adaptively, becoming larger or smaller as the sparsity level increases or decreases, respectively, to accommodate more or fewer signals, a posteriori. We propose a global-local-tail (GLT) Gaussian mixture distribution that ensures this property. We examine the role of the tail-index of the prior in relation to the underlying sparsity level and demonstrate that the GLT posterior contracts at the minimax optimal rate for sparse normal mean models. We apply both the GLT prior and the Horseshoe prior to a real data problem and simulation examples. Our findings indicate that the varying tail rule based on the GLT prior offers advantages over a fixed tail rule based on the Horseshoe prior in diverse sparsity regimes.</description>

      <title>A Neural Phillips Curve and a Deep Output Gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.04146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many problems plague empirical Phillips curves (PCs). Among them is the hurdle that the two key components, inflation expectations and the output gap, are both unobserved. Traditional remedies include proxying for the absentees or extracting them via assumptions-heavy filtering procedures. I propose an alternative route: a Hemisphere Neural Network (HNN) whose architecture yields a final layer where components can be interpreted as latent states within a Neural PC. There are benefits. First, HNN conducts the supervised estimation of nonlinearities that arise when translating a high-dimensional set of observed regressors into latent states. Second, forecasts are economically interpretable. Among other findings, the contribution of real activity to inflation appears understated in traditional PCs. In contrast, HNN captures the 2021 upswing in inflation and attributes it to a large positive output gap starting from late 2020. The unique path of HNN's gap comes from dispensing with unemployment and GDP in favor of an amalgam of nonlinearly processed alternative tightness indicators.</description>

      <title>Statistical Response of ENSO Complexity to Initial Condition and Model Parameter Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03281v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying the response of a climate system to perturbations has practical significance. Standard methods in computing the trajectory-wise deviation caused by perturbations may suffer from the chaotic nature that makes the model error dominate the true response after a short lead time. Statistical response, which computes the return described by the statistics, provides a systematic way of reaching robust outcomes with an appropriate quantification of the uncertainty and extreme events. In this paper, information theory is applied to compute the statistical response and find the most sensitive perturbation direction of different El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events to initial value and model parameter perturbations. Depending on the initial phase and the time horizon, different state variables contribute to the most sensitive perturbation direction. While initial perturbations in sea surface temperature (SST) and thermocline depth usually lead to the most significant response of SST at short- and long-range, respectively, initial adjustment of the zonal advection can be crucial to trigger strong statistical responses at medium-range around 5 to 7 months, especially at the transient phases between El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na. It is also shown that the response in the variance triggered by external random forcing perturbations, such as the wind bursts, often dominates the mean response, making the resulting most sensitive direction very different from the trajectory-wise methods. Finally, despite the strong non-Gaussian climatology distributions, using Gaussian approximations in the information theory is efficient and accurate for computing the statistical response, allowing the method to be applied to sophisticated operational systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation of Polychoric Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polychoric correlation is often an important building block in the analysis of rating data, particularly for structural equation models. However, the commonly employed maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is highly susceptible to misspecification of the polychoric correlation model, for instance through violations of latent normality assumptions. We propose a novel estimator that is designed to be robust to partial misspecification of the polychoric model, that is, the model is only misspecified for an unknown fraction of observations, for instance (but not limited to) careless respondents. In contrast to existing literature, our estimator makes no assumption on the type or degree of model misspecification. It furthermore generalizes ML estimation and is consistent as well as asymptotically normally distributed. We demonstrate the robustness and practical usefulness of our estimator in simulation studies and an empirical application on a Big Five administration. In the latter, the polychoric correlation estimates of our estimator and ML differ substantially, which, after further inspection, is likely due to the presence of careless respondents that the estimator helps identify.</description>

      <title>Fair comparisons of causal parameters with many treatments and positivity violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comparing outcomes across treatments is essential in medicine and public policy. To do so, researchers typically estimate a set of parameters, possibly counterfactual, with each targeting a different treatment. Treatment-specific means (TSMs) are commonly used, but their identification requires a positivity assumption -- that every subject has a non-zero probability of receiving each treatment. This assumption is often implausible, especially when treatment can take many values. Causal parameters based on dynamic stochastic interventions can be robust to positivity violations. However, comparing these parameters may be unfair because they may depend on outcomes under non-target treatments. To address this, and clarify when fair comparisons are possible, we propose a fairness criterion: if the conditional TSM for one treatment is greater than that for another, then the corresponding causal parameter should also be greater. We derive two intuitive properties equivalent to this criterion and show that only a mild positivity assumption is needed to identify fair parameters. We then provide examples that satisfy this criterion and are identifiable under the milder positivity assumption. These parameters are non-smooth, making standard nonparametric efficiency theory inapplicable, so we propose smooth approximations of them. We then develop doubly robust-style estimators that attain parametric convergence rates under nonparametric conditions. We illustrate our methods with an analysis of dialysis providers in New York State.</description>
