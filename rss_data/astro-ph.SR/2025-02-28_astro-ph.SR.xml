      <title>Helium Abundance Periods Observed by the Solar Probe Cup on Parker Solar Probe: Encounters 1-14</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe is a mission designed to explore properties of the solar wind closer than ever before. Detailed particle observations from the Solar Probe Cup (SPC) have primarily focused on examining the proton population in the solar wind. However, several periods throughout the Parker mission have indicated that SPC has observed a pronounced and distinctive population of fully ionized helium, He$^{2+}$. Minor ions are imprinted with properties of the solar wind's source region, as well as mechanisms active during outflow, making them sensitive markers of its origin and formation at the Sun. Through a detailed analysis of the He$^{2+}$ velocity distributions functions, this work examines periods where significant and persistent He$^{2+}$ peaks are observed with SPC. We compute the helium abundance and examine the stream's bulk speed, density, temperature, magnetic field topology, and electron strahl properties to identify distinctive solar wind features that can provide insight to their solar source. We find that nearly all periods exhibit an elevated mean helium composition ($8.34\%$) compared to typical solar wind and a majority ($\sim87\%$) of these periods are connected to coronal mass ejections, with the highest abundance reaching $23.1\%$. The helium abundance and number of events increases as the solar cycle approaches maximum with a weak dependence on speed. Additionally, the events not associated with a CME are clustered near the heliospheric current sheet suggesting they are connected to streamer belt outflows. However, there are currently no theoretical explanations that fully describe the range of depleted and elevated helium abundances observed.</description>

      <title>An observational overview of white dwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarf stars are the most common final stage of stellar evolution. Since the serendipitous discovery of the first white dwarf by William Herschel and the first physical models by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Arthur Eddington, there have been a lot of advances in the field fueled by new observational data. With new astrometric measurements enabling us to identify hundreds of thousands of white dwarf candidates, and spectroscopic surveys revealing a plethora of chemical elements in white dwarf atmospheres pointing at spectral evolution and interaction with planetary bodies, there is a lot we can learn from the characterization of observed white dwarfs. Here we provide an observational overview of white dwarf stars, describing how they are identified and characterized, and the main properties of the observed population.</description>

      <title>Elemental Abundances at Coronal Hole Boundaries as a Means to Investigate Interchange Reconnection and the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the slow solar wind is not well understood, unlike the fast solar wind which originates from coronal holes. In-situ elemental abundances of the slow solar wind suggest that it originates from initially closed field lines that become open. Coronal hole boundary regions are a potential source of slow solar wind as there open field lines interact with the closed loops through interchange reconnection. Our primary aim is to quantify the role of interchange reconnection at the boundaries of coronal holes. To this end, we have measured the relative abundances of different elements at these boundaries. Reconnection is expected to modulate the relative abundances through the first ionization potential (FIP) effect. For our analysis we used spectroscopic data from the extreme ultraviolet imaging spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode. To account for the temperature structure of the observed region we computed the differential emission measure (DEM). Using the DEM we were able to infer the ratio between coronal and photospheric abundances, known as the FIP bias. By examining the variation of the FIP bias moving from the coronal hole to the quiet Sun, we have been able to constrain models of interchange reconnection. The FIP bias variation in the boundary region around the coronal hole has an approximate width of 30-50 Mm, comparable to the size of supergranules. This boundary region is also a source of open flux into interplanetary space. We find that there is an additional ~30% open flux that originates from this boundary region.</description>

      <title>Near and Mid UltraViolet Observations of X-6.3 flare on 22nd February 2024 recorded by the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on board Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are regularly observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV), soft X-rays (SXR), and hard X-rays (HXR). However, those in near and mid-UV are sparse. The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) onboard the Aditya-L1, launched on 2nd September, 2023 provides regular observations in the 200-400 nm wavelength range through eleven filters. Here, we report the observation of the X6.3 flare on Feb 22, 2024 using eight narrow band (NB) filters of SUIT. We have also used co-spatiotemporal observations from SDO/AIA, Solar Orbiter/STIX, GONG H$\alpha$, Aditya-L1/SoLEXS and GOES. We obtained light curves over the flaring region from AIA 1600, 1700 \r{A} and GONG H$\alpha$ and compared them with the disk-integrated lightcurve obtained from GOES and SoLEXS SXR and STIX HXR. We find that the flare peaks in SUIT NB01, NB03, NB04, and NB08 filters simultaneously with HXR, 1600, and 1700 \r{A} along with the peak temperature obtained from SoLEXS. In contrast, in NB02 and NB05, the flare peaks $\sim$ 2 minutes later than the HXR peak, while in NB06 and NB07, the flare peaks $\sim$ 3 minutes after the GOES soft X-ray peak. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of a flare in these wavelengths (except in NB03, NB04 and NB05). Moreover, for the first time, we show the presence of a bright kernel in NB02. These results demonstrate the capabilities of SUIT observations in flare studies.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Forward and Inverse PDEs with Limited and Noisy Data: Application to Solar Corona Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I will demonstrate the effectiveness of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) when training data are scarce or noisy. The training data can be located either at the boundaries or within the domain. Additionally, PINNs can be used as an inverse method to determine unknown coefficients in the equations. This study will highlight the application of PINNs in modeling magnetohydrodynamic processes relevant to strongly magnetized plasmas, such as those found in the solar corona.</description>

      <title>Detailed seismic study of Gemma (KIC11026764) using EGGMiMoSA: Unveiling the probing potential of mixed modes for subgiant stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. When leaving the main sequence (MS) for the red-giant branch (RGB), subgiant stars undergo fast structural changes. Consequently, their observed oscillation spectra mirror these changes, constituting key tracers of stellar structure and evolution. However, the complexity of their spectra makes their modelling an arduous task, which few authors have undertaken. Gemma (KIC11026764) is a young subgiant with $45$ precise oscillation modes observed with Kepler, making it the ideal benchmark for seismic modelling. Aims. This study is aimed at modelling the subgiant Gemma, taking advantage of most of the precise seismic information available. This approach enables us to pave the way for the seismic modelling of evolved solar-like stars and provide the relevant insights into their structural evolution. Methods. Using our Levenberg-Marquardt stellar modelling tool, we built a family of models representative of Gemma's measured seismic indicators obtained via our seismic tool, EGGMiMoSA. We studied the structural information these indicators hold by carefully varying stellar parameters. We also complemented the characterisation with information held by \who indicators and non-seismic data. Results. From the extensive set of models we built and using most of the seismic information at hand, including two $\ell=1$ and one $\ell=2$ mixed modes, we were able to probe the chemical transition at the hydrogen-burning shell. Indeed, we have demonstrated that among our models, only the ones with the sharpest chemical gradient are able to reproduce all the seismic information considered. One possibility to account for such a gradient is the inclusion of a significant amount of overshooting, namely $\alpha_{\textrm{ov}}=0.17$, which is unexpected for low-mass stars such as Gemma (expected mass of about $1.15~M_{\odot}$).</description>

      <title>Dynamic Photometric Variability in Three Young Brown Dwarfs in Taurus: Detection of Optical Flares with TESS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $I$-band time-series photometric variability studies of three known nearby ($\sim$ 140 pc) and young ( $\sim$ 1 Myr) brown dwarfs (BD) in the Taurus star-forming region in the Perseus Molecular Cloud. From 10 nights of observations over a time span of 10 years, with a typical run of 3 to 6 hours each night, we estimated that the BDs show unstable short-scale periodicity from 1.5 to 4.8 hours. Using the long-term photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we have conducted a time-resolved variability analysis of CFHT-BD-Tau 3 and CFHT-BD-Tau 4, revealing orbital periods of $\sim$ 0.96 days and $\sim$ 3 days respectively, consistent with earlier studies. We also found two superflares in TESS sector 43 data for CFHT-BD-Tau 4 and estimated the flare energies as $7.09\times10^{35}$ erg and $3.75\times10^{36}$ erg. A magnetic field of $\sim3.39 ~kG$ is required to generate such flare energies on this BD. We performed spot modelling analysis on CFHT-BD-Tau 3 and CFHT-BD-Tau 4 to address the variability detected in the data using the package BASSMAN. Spectral energy distribution and infrared colours of the sources suggest that they have a sufficient amount of circumstellar material around them.</description>

      <title>VLTI/GRAVITY upper limit on near-infrared emission from the nearby 33 Msun black hole Gaia BH3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent astrometric discovery of the nearby (590 pc) massive ($33 M_\odot$) dormant black hole candidate Gaia BH3 offers the possibility to angularly resolve the black hole from its companion star by using optical interferometry. Our aim is to detect emission in the near-infrared K band from the close-in environment of Gaia BH3 caused by accretion. Gaia BH3 was observed with the GRAVITY instrument using the four 8-meter Unit Telescopes of the VLT Interferometer. We searched for the signature of emission from the black hole in the interferometric data using the CANDID, PMOIRED, and exoGravity tools. With a present separation of 18 mas, the Gaia BH3 system can be well resolved angularly by GRAVITY. We did not detect emission from the black hole at a contrast level of $\Delta m = 6.8$ mag with respect to the companion star, that is, $f_\mathrm{BH}/f_* &lt; 0.2\%$. This corresponds to an upper limit on the continuum flux density of $f_\mathrm{BH} &lt; 1.9 \times 10^{-16}$ W m$^{-2}$ ${\mu}$m$^{-1}$ in the K band. In addition, we did not detect emission from the black hole in the hydrogen Br{\gamma} line. The non-detection of near-infrared emission from the black hole in Gaia BH3 indicates that its accretion of the giant star wind is presently occurring at most at a very low rate. This is consistent with the limit of $f_\mathrm{Edd} &lt; 4.9 \times 10^{-7}$ derived previously on the Eddington ratio for an advection-dominated accretion flow. Deeper observations with GRAVITY may be able to detect the black hole as the companion star approaches periastron around 2030.</description>

      <title>Detecting Supernova Axions with IAXO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of IAXO and its intermediate version, BabyIAXO, to detect axions produced in core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Our study demonstrates that these experiments have realistic chances of identifying SN axions, offering crucial insights into both axion physics and SN dynamics. IAXO's sensitivity to SN axions allows for the exploration of regions of the axion parameter space inaccessible through solar observations. In addition, in the event of a nearby SN, $d \sim O(100)$ pc, and sufficiently large axion couplings, $g_{a \gamma} \gtrsim 10^{-11} GeV^{-1}$, IAXO could have a chance to significantly advance our understanding of axion production in nuclear matter and provide valuable information about the physics of SNe, such as pion abundance, the equation of state, and other nuclear processes occurring in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Low-Luminosity Type IIP Supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe. I: Luminosity Function, Volumetric Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the luminosity function and volumetric rate of a sample of Type IIP supernovae (SNe) from the Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe survey (CLU). This is the largest sample of Type IIP SNe from a systematic volume-limited survey to-date. The final sample includes 330 Type IIP SNe and 36 low-luminosity Type II (LLIIP) SNe with $M_{\textrm{r,peak}}&gt;-16$ mag, which triples the literature sample of LLIIP SNe. The fraction of LLIIP SNe is $19^{+3}_{-4}\%$ of the total CLU Type IIP SNe population ($8^{+1}_{-2}\%$ of all core-collapse SNe). This implies that while LLIIP SNe likely represent the fate of core-collapse SNe of $8-12$ \Msun\ progenitors, they alone cannot account for the fate of all massive stars in this mass range. To derive an absolute rate, we estimate the ZTF pipeline efficiency as a function of the apparent magnitude and the local surface brightness. We derive a volumetric rate of $(3.9_{-0.4}^{+0.4}) \times 10^{4}\ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \textrm{yr}^{-1}$ for Type IIP SNe and $(7.3_{-0.6}^{+0.6}) \times 10^{3}\ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \textrm{yr}^{-1}$ for LLIIP SNe. Now that the rate of LLIIP SNe is robustly derived, the unresolved discrepancy between core-collapse SN rates and star-formation rates cannot be explained by LLIIP SNe alone.</description>

      <title>The Non-Uniform Expansion of the Crab Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present extensive proper motion measurements of the Crab Nebula made from Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope MegaPrime/MegaCam images taken in 2007, 2016, and 2019. A total of 19974 proper motion vectors with uncertainty $&lt;10$\,mas\,yr$^{-1}$ located over the majority of the Crab Nebula are used to map the supernova remnant's two-dimensional expansion properties that reflect the dynamics of the original explosion, acceleration of ejecta imparted by spin-down energy from the pulsar, and interaction between the ejecta and surrounding cicumstellar material (CSM). The average convergence date we derive is 1105.5 $\pm$ 0.5 CE, which is 15-35 yr earlier compared to most previous estimates. We find that it varies as a function of position angle around the nebula, with the earliest date and smallest proper motions measured along the equator defined by the east and west bays. The lower acceleration of material along the equatorial plane may be indicative of the supernova's interaction with a disk-like CSM geometry. Comparing our measurements to previous analytical solutions of the Crab's expansion and our own numerical simulation using the moving mesh hydrodynamics code \texttt{Sprout}, we conclude that the ejecta have relaxed closer to homologous expansion than expected for the commonly adopted pulsar spindown age of $\tau \sim 700$ yr and a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) still evolving inside the flat part of the ejecta density profile. These findings provide further evidence that the PWN has broken out of the inner flat part of the supernova ejecta density profile and has experienced ``blowout''.</description>

      <title>Beta decay and electron capture rates on manganese isotopes in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isotopes of manganese in the mass range A equal to 53 to 63 are abundant in the core material of high mass stars and are believed to be of prime importance in the progression of the pre collapse phases. During these late evolutionary phases, nuclear processes associated with weak interactions, including decay and electron capture (EC) on these isotopes, significantly alter the Ye (lepton to baryon ratio) of the cores composition. The temporal change of this parameter is one of the basic elements to simulate a successful explosion. Hence, the decay and EC rates of manganese (Mn) nuclides may serve as an important input in the simulation codes of core collapse supernova. In this paper, we focus on the study of the weak decay characteristics of 55 63Mn nuclides. The strength distributions of Gamow Teller transitions in the directions of decay and EC for these isotopes were calculated employing the proton neutron quasi particle random phase approximation (pn QRPA) model. The decay half life values of Mn isotopes under terrestrial conditions were computed and compared with measured data and previous calculations. The pn QRPA estimated half lives are in good agreement with the experimental values. The and EC rates were later calculated covering a large range of stellar temperatures (001 30) 109 K and densities (10 1011) g/cm3.</description>

Abstract: We report the discovery of a transiting brown dwarf orbiting a low-mass star, TOI-6508b. Today, only ~50 transiting brown dwarfs have been discovered. TOI-6508b was first detected with data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in Sectors 10, 37, and 63. Ground-based follow-up photometric data were collected with the SPECULOOS-South and LCOGT-1.0m telescopes, and RV measurements were obtained with the Near InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS) spectrograph. We find that TOI-6508b has a mass of Mp=72.5+7.6-5.1MJup and a radius of Rp=1.03+/-0.03RJup. Our modeling shows that the data are consistent with an eccentric orbit of 19day and an eccentricity of e=0.28+0.09-0.08. TOI-6508b has a mass ratio of M_BD/Ms=0.40, makes it the second highest mass ratio brown dwarf that transits a low-mass star. The host has a mass of Ms=0.174+/-0.004M_Sun, a radius of Rs=0.205+/-0.006R_Sun, an effective temperature of Teff=2930+/-70K, and a metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.22+/-0.08. This makes TOI-6508b an interesting discovery that has come to light in a region still sparsely populated.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Equation of State from Neutron Star Observables via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have conducted an extensive study using a diverse set of equations of state (EoSs) to uncover strong relationships between neutron star (NS) observables and the underlying EoS parameters using symbolic regression method. These EoS models, derived from a mix of agnostic and physics-based approaches, considered neutron stars composed of nucleons, hyperons, and other exotic degrees of freedom in beta equilibrium. The maximum mass of a NS is found to be strongly correlated with the pressure and baryon density at an energy density of approximately 800 MeV.fm$^{-3}$. We have also demonstrated that the EoS can be expressed as a function of radius and tidal deformability within the NS mass range 1-2$M_\odot$. These insights offer a promising and efficient framework to decode the dense matter EoS directly from the accurate knowledge of NS observables.</description>

      <title>Discovery of WINERED-HVS1: A metal-rich hyper-velocity star candidate ejected from the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a metal-rich red giant star, WINERED-HVS1, which is a candidate for a hyper-velocity star (HVS). Its past trajectory suggests that this star may have been ejected by the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH; Sgr A*) about 14 Myr ago, with a modest ejection velocity of at least 500 km/s. Since WINERED-HVS1 is gravitationally bound to the Milky Way and is not necessarily young, it is not an unambiguous HVS candidate from a kinematic perspective, unlike the previously confirmed A-type main-sequence HVS known as S5-HVS1. Therefore, the chemical characterization of this star is essential for understanding its origin. Through a spectroscopic follow-up observation with Magellan/WINERED, we determined its metallicity [Fe/H]=$-0.136^{+0.040}_{-0.038}$, as well as the abundances for Na, Mg, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, and Sr. The high metallicity value suggests that this star was ejected from the Galactic center and is unlikely to be a halo star with a radial orbit. The abundance pattern of this star -- including the pattern of [$\alpha$/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Mg], and [Ca/Mg] -- is consistent with that of the nuclear star cluster surrounding the SMBH, further supporting our view. This discovery opens a new window to look through the Galactic center environment without the hindrance of dust extinction, by using the HVSs moving in the halo region where dust extinction is minimal.</description>

      <title>The origin and evolution of the normal Type Ia SN 2018aoz with infant-phase reddening and excess emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.12437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SN~2018aoz is a Type Ia SN with a $B$-band plateau and excess emission in the infant-phase light curves $\lesssim$ 1 day after first light, evidencing an over-density of surface iron-peak elements as shown in our previous study. Here, we advance the constraints on the nature and origin of SN~2018aoz based on its evolution until the nebular phase. Near-peak spectroscopic features show the SN is intermediate between two subtypes of normal Type Ia: Core-Normal and Broad-Line. The excess emission could have contributions from the radioactive decay of surface iron-peak elements as well as ejecta interaction with either the binary companion or a small torus of circumstellar material. Nebular-phase limits on H$\alpha$ and He~I favour a white dwarf companion, consistent with the small companion size constrained by the low early SN luminosity, while the absence of [O~I] and He~I disfavours a violent merger of the progenitor. Of the two main explosion mechanisms proposed to explain the distribution of surface iron-peak elements in SN~2018aoz, the asymmetric Chandrasekhar-mass explosion is less consistent with the progenitor constraints and the observed blueshifts of nebular-phase [Fe~II] and [Ni~II]. The helium-shell double-detonation explosion is compatible with the observed lack of C spectral features, but current 1-D models are incompatible with the infant-phase excess emission, $B_{\rm max}-V_{\rm max}$ color, and absence of nebular-phase [Ca~II]. Although the explosion processes of SN~2018aoz still need to be more precisely understood, the same processes could produce a significant fraction of Type Ia SNe that appear normal after $\sim$ 1 day.</description>

Abstract: The origin and acceleration of high-energy particles in space (cosmic rays), constitute important topics in modern astrophysics. Among the The origin and acceleration of high-energy particles, constituting cosmic rays, is likely to remain an important topic in modern astrophysics. Among the two categories - galactic and solar cosmic rays - the latter are much less investigated. Primary source of solar cosmic ray particles are impulsive explosions of the magnetized plasma known as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. These particles, however, are characterized by relatively low energies compared to their galactic counterparts. In this work, we explore resonance wave-wave (RWW) interaction between the polarized electromagnetic radiation emitted by the solar active regions, and the quantum waves associated with high-energy, relativistic electrons generated during solar flares. Mathematically, the RWW interaction problem boils down to analyzing a Klein-Gordon equation (spin less electrons) embedded in the electromagnetic field. We find that RWW could accelerate the relativistic electrons to enormous energies even comparable to energies in the galactic cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Magnetized winds of M-type stars and star-planet magnetic interactions: uncertainties and modeling strategy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: M-type stars are the most common stars in the universe. They are ideal hosts for the search of exoplanets in the habitable zone (HZ), as their small size and low temperature make the HZ much closer in than their solar twins. Harboring very deep convective layers, they also usually exhibit very intense magnetic fields. Understanding their environment, in particular their coronal and wind properties, is thus very important, as they might be very different from what is observed in the solar system. The mass loss rate of M-type stars is poorly known observationally, and recent attempts to estimate it for some of them (TRAPPIST-1, Proxima Cen) can vary by an order of magnitude. In this work, we revisit the stellar wind properties of M-dwarfs in the light of the latest estimates of $\dot{M}$ through Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption at the astropause and slingshot prominences. We outline a modeling strategy to estimate the mass loss rate, radiative loss and wind speed, with uncertainties, based on an Alfv\'en wave driven stellar wind model. We find that it is very likely that several TRAPPIST-1 planets lie within the Alfv\'en surface, which imply that these planets experience star-planet magnetic interactions (SPMI). We also find that SPMI between Proxima Cen b and its host star could be the reason of recently observed radio emissions.</description>

      <title>Origin of high-velocity ejecta and early red excess emission in the infant Type Ia supernova 2021aefx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SN~2021aefx is a normal Type Ia Supernova (SN) with red excess emission over the first $\sim$ 2 days. We present detailed analysis of this SN using our high-cadence KMTNet multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, and publicly available data. We provide the first measurements of its epochs of explosion (MJD 59529.32 $\pm$ 0.16) as well as ``first light'' (MJD 59529.85 $\pm$ 0.55) associated with the main ejecta ${\rm{^{56}Ni}}$ distribution. This places our first detection of SN 2021aefx at $\sim -$0.5 hours since ``first light'', indicating the presence of additional power sources. Our peak-spectrum confirms its Type Ia sub-classification as intermediate between Core-Normal and Broad-Line, and we estimate the ejecta mass to be $\sim$ 1.34 $M_{\odot}$. The pre-peak spectral evolution identifies fast-expanding material reaching $&gt;$ 40,000 km s$^{-1}$ (the fastest ever observed in Type Ia SNe) and at least two distinct homologously-expanding ejecta components: (1) a normal-velocity (12,400 km s$^{-1}$) component consistent with the typical photospheric evolution of Chandrasekhar-mass ejecta; and (2) a high-velocity (23,500 km s$^{-1}$) component visible during the first $\sim$ 3.6 days post-explosion, which locates the component within the outer $&lt;$ 16\% of the ejecta mass. Asymmetric, subsonic explosion processes producing a non-spherical photosphere provide an explanation for the simultaneous presence of the two components, as well as the red excess emission via a slight ${\rm{^{56}Ni}}$ enrichment in the outer $\sim$ 0.5\% of the ejecta mass. Our spectrum from 300 days post-peak advances the constraint against non-degenerate companions and further supports a near-Chandrasekhar-mass explosion origin. Off-center ignited delayed-detonations of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs may be responsible for the observed features of SN 2021aefx in some normal Type Ia SNe.</description>

      <title>X-ray emission from helium star+black hole binaries as probes of tidally induced spin-up of second-born black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidally induced spin-up of stripped helium stars in short-period (&lt;\,1\,d) binaries with black holes has been presented as one of the possible mechanisms to reproduce the high-spin tail of the black hole spin distribution derived from gravitational wave (GW) merger observations. At such short periods, a fraction of the strong stellar wind from the stripped helium stars may be accreted by the black holes, and its gravitational potential energy may be released as observable radiation in the X-ray regime. We estimate the X-ray luminosity and its observability from black holes in orbit with stripped helium stars, which evolve into binary black hole or black hole+neutron star binaries that merge within Hubble time. We post-process recent advancements for estimating X-ray luminosities (via wind accretion onto stellar mass black holes) into two rapid population synthesis codes, BSE and StarTrack. We derive lower limits on the X-ray luminosity distribution from populations of stripped helium+black hole binaries at four metallicities (0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1 $Z_{\odot}$) and two mass transfer stability criteria. We find that a large fraction (0.1-0.5) of stripped-helium stars that get spun up by tides also transfer enough wind matter onto the black hole to produce X-ray luminosities above $10^{35}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$, up to $\sim10^{39}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. Such binaries should be observable as X-ray bright systems at 0.1\,$Z_{\odot}$, 0.5\,$Z_{\odot}$ and $Z_{\odot}$, representative of Sextans A, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Solar neighbourhood, respectively. The formation efficiency of these systems increases with decreasing metallicity. However, accounting for the local star formation rates, our population synthesis predicts $\sim$2 and $\sim$1 such observable binaries in the Milky Way and LMC, respectively, that will produce a binary compact object merger within a Hubble time.

      <title>Kinematics of metallicity populations in Omega Centauri using Gaia Focused Product Release and Hubble Space Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Omega Cen is the largest known globular cluster in the Milky Way. It is also quite a complex object with a large metallicity spread and multiple stellar populations. Despite a number of studies over the past several decades, the series of events that led to the formation of this cluster is still poorly understood. One of its peculiarities is the presence of a metal-rich population which does not show the phenomenon of light-element anti-correlations (C-N, Na-O, Mg-Al), a trait that is considered as characteristic of Galactic Globular Clusters, and is in fact present among more metal-poor Omega Cen stars, leading to speculations that such anomalous population was accreted by the cluster. In this paper, we aim at investigating the kinematics of Omega Cen populations to gain insight on the formation scenario of the cluster. Using the newly released Gaia FPR and DR3 catalogue, we conducted a detailed kinematical analysis of cluster members within Omega Cen. The cluster members were divided into four metallicity populations and their mean proper motion in radial and tangential components were compared with each other. We also performed Gaussian Mixture Model fitting on the metallicity distribution to estimate the number of populations within our sample and an independent analysis of the HST catalogue as confirmation. The mean proper motions (mu_r and mu_t) of the metallicity populations do not show any significant differences. It is also not dependent on the approach chosen to determine the number of metallicity populations. We do find clear signature of rotation in all of the populations (including the metal-rich) with similar velocities.</description>
