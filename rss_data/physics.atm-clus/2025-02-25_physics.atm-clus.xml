      <title>Enhanced response at exceptional points in multi-qubit systems for sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points featuring enhanced energy response to perturbation hold significant potential in detection and measurement of weak signals. Of particular interest is the existence and property of high-order exceptional points in quantum systems, owing to the capability to provide high-order response to perturbations. We investigate the exceptional points in a system of $n$ identical qubits possessing parity-time-reversal symmetry. We prove that owing to an incomplete coalescence of eigenstates, the highest possible order of exceptional point is $n+1$, which is also the upper bound of the order of energy response to perturbation. More interestingly, by considering an Ising-type interaction, we analytically prove that to achieve an $(m+1)$-th order response for any $m \le n$, the system must acquire a nontrivial $m$-body interaction. Finally, we propose a Floquet driving scheme to implement an effective multi-body Ising-type interaction, which can be realized in trapped ions or superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Inducing And Probing Charge Migration In Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technological advancements in generation of ultrafast and intense laser pulses have enabled the real-time observation and control of charge migration in molecules on their natural timescale, which ranges from few femtoseconds to several hundreds of attoseconds. Present thesis discusses the effect of symmetry on the adiabatic attosecond charge migration in different molecular systems. The spatial representation of the charge migration is documented by time-dependent electronic charge and flux densities. Furthermore, the induced charge migration is imaged via time resolved x-ray diffraction (TRXD) with atomic-scale spatiotemporal resolution in few cases.</description>

      <title>Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15201v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.</description>
