      <title>The direction functor for Schreier extensions of monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe that the process of associating an action to any Schreier extension of monoids with commutative and cancellative kernel is functorial. We show that this functor is a generalisation of the direction functor, used to give a categorical description of non-abelian cohomology in terms of extensions. We further prove that our functor is a conservative, product preserving cofibration and from this we conclude that its fibres are endowed with a canonical symmetric monoidal structure. The commutative monoids obtained as connected components of these symmetric monoidal categories are isomorphic to Patchkoria second cohomology monoids of a monoid with coefficients in semimodules.</description>

      <title>On the Semi-Abelianness of Affine Group Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the category of commutative Hopf algebras over a field $k$ is co-semi-abelian. Consequently, the category of affine group $k$-schemes is semi-abelian. We establish coregularity by identifying the orthogonal factorization system of surjections and faithfully flat injections, and we deduce coexactness from Takeuchi's correspondence between normal Hopf ideals and Hopf subalgebras of commutative Hopf $k$-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general notion of $J$-tribe, and construct the $J$-tribe of $J$-frames in a given tribe $\mathcal{T}$, where $J$ a suitable generalized direct category. This construction applies to semi-cubical diagrams for a category of semi-cubes with symmetries and reversals.</description>

      <title>On Gluing Data, Finite Ringed Spaces and schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From descent theory to higher geometry, the idea of gluing has been embedded in many elegant and powerful techniques, proving instrumental for the solution of many problems. In this paper, we introduce a framework that allows to link important geometric objects, such as differentiable manifolds or schemes, to certain finite ringed spaces arising from sheaves on 2 dimensional semisimplicial sets, thus opening the door to their applications in fields such as discrete differential geometry.</description>

      <title>The $G$-Noncommutative Minimal Model Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $G$-equivariant noncommutative minimal model program ($G$-NMMP), as an equivariant generalization of the framework introduced in arXiv:2301.13168. The aim of this program is to construct quasi-convergent paths in the spaces of Bridgeland stability conditions on derived categories of $G$-equivariant coherent sheaves. For finite groups, we employ induction techniques to construct such paths from the non-equivariant setting. In the setting of algebraic group actions, we introduce the notion of $\mathbb T$-stability conditions to reformulate the proposal, and then we construct quasi-convergent paths for equivariant projective spaces from small quantum cohomology.</description>

      <title>The formal spectrum of a tensor-triangulated category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To any essentially small tensor-triangulated category $\mathcal{K}$ and Thomason subset $Y \subseteq \mathrm{Spc}(\mathcal{K})$ we associate a ringed space $(\mathrm{Spf}(\mathcal{K},Y), \mathcal{O}_{\mathrm{Spf}(\mathcal{K},Y)}),$ called the formal spectrum of $(\mathcal{K},Y)$. We establish basic properties of this construction and compute it in several examples from algebraic geometry, chromatic homotopy theory, equivariant homotopy theory, and modular representation theory.</description>

      <title>Cartesian Linearly Distributive Categories: Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linearly distributive categories (LDC) were introduced by Cockett and Seely to provide alternative categorical semantics for multiplicative linear logic. In contrast to Barr's $*$-autonomous categories, LDCs take multiplicative conjunction and disjunction as primitive notions. Thus, a LDC is a category with two monoidal products that interact via linear distributors. A cartesian linearly distributive category (CLDC) is a LDC whose two monoidal products coincide with categorical products and coproducts. Initially, it was believed that CLDCs and distributive categories would coincide, but this was later found not to be the case. Consequently, the study on CLDCs was not pursued further at the time. With recent developments for and applications of LDCs, there has been renewed interest in CLDCs. This paper revisits CLDCs, demonstrating strong structural properties they all satisfy and investigating two key classes of examples: posetal distributive categories and semi-additive categories. Additionally, a previously assumed class of CLDCs, the Kleisli categories of exception monads of distributive categories, is re-examined and it is showed that they are not, in fact, CLDCs.</description>

      <title>A categorical perspective on constraint satisfaction: The wonderland of adjunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The so-called algebraic approach to the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) has been a prevalent method of the study of complexity of these problems since early 2000's. The core of this approach is the notion of *polymorphisms* which determine the complexity of the problem (up to log-space reductions). In the past few years, a new, more general version of the CSP emerged, the promise constraint satisfaction problem (PCSP), and the notion of polymorphisms and most of the core theses of the algebraic approach were generalised to the promise setting. Nevertheless, recent work also suggests that insights from other fields are immensely useful in the study of PCSPs including algebraic topology.
  In this paper, we provide an entry point for category-theorists into the study of complexity of CSPs and PCSPs. We show that many standard CSP notions have clear and well-known categorical counterparts. For example, the algebraic structure of polymorphisms can be described as a set-functor defined as a right Kan extension. We provide purely categorical proofs of core results of the algebraic approach including a proof that the complexity only depends on the polymorphisms. Our new proofs are substantially shorter and, from the categorical perspective, cleaner than previous proofs of the same results. Moreover, as expected, are applicable more widely. We believe that, in particular in the case of PCSPs, category theory brings insights that can help solve some of the current challenges of the field.</description>

      <title>Equivariant recollements and singular equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate equivariant recollements of abelian (resp. triangulated) categories. We first characterize when a recollement of abelian (resp. triangulated) categories induces an equivariant recollement, i.e. a recollement between the corresponding equivariant abelian (resp. triangulated) categories. We further investigate singular equivalences in the context of equivariant abelian recollements. In particular, we characterize when a singular equivalence induced by the quotient functor in an abelian recollement lifts to a singular equivalence induced by the equivariant quotient functor. As applications of our results: (i) we construct equivariant recollements for the derived category of a quasi-compact, quasi-separated scheme where the action comes from a subgroup of the automorphism group of the scheme and (ii) we establish new singular equivalences between certain skew group algebras.</description>

      <title>Stability conditions on irreducible projective curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note revisits stability conditions on the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves on irreducible projective curves. In particular, all stability conditions on smooth curves are classified and a connected component of the stability manifold containing all the geometric stability conditions is identified for singular curves. On smooth curves of positive genus, the set of all non-locally-finite stability conditions gives a partial boundary of any known compactification of the stability manifold. To provide a reasonable full boundary, a notion of regular weak stability condition is proposed based on the definition of Collins-Lo-Shi-Yau and is classified for smooth curves of positive genus. On non-rational singular curves, any locally-finite numerical stability condition is shown to be geometric.</description>
