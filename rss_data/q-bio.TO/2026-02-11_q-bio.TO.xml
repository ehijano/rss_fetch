      <title>A dialog between cell adhesion and topology at the core of morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the development of an organism, cells must coordinate and organize to generate the correct shape, structure, and spatial patterns of tissues and organs, a process known as morphogenesis. The morphogenesis of embryonic tissues is supported by multiple processes that induce the precise physical deformations required for tissues to ultimately form organs with complex geometries. Among the most active players shaping the morphogenetic path are fine-tuned changes in cell adhesion. In this paper, we show that a local, pair-wise property defined at the cell-cell contact level has important global consequences for embryonic tissue topology, being determinant in defining both the geometric and material properties of early embryo tissues.</description>

      <title>scRNA-seq of preeclamptic trophoblasts identifies EBI3, COL17A1, miR-27a-5p, and miR-193b-5p as hypoxia markers: validation of neuradapt as a superior mimetic to cobalt chloride</title>

Abstract: Background. Preeclampsia (PE) complicates 2-8% of pregnancies and involves placental hypoxia and HIF-pathway activation, especially in early-onset PE (eoPE). Chemical mimetics like cobalt (II) chloride (CoCl2) and oxyquinoline derivatives model trophoblast hypoxia in vitro, yet their fidelity in recapitulating PE gene profiles remains unclear. Integrating patient tissue analyses with experimental models may reveal common markers and validate physiologically relevant paradigms.
  Methods. We analyzed scRNA-seq data from 10 eoPE, 7 late-onset PE, and matched control placentas, identifying villous cytotrophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast, and extravillous trophoblast (EVT). BeWo b30 cells were treated for 24 h with CoCl2 (300 $\mu$M) or the oxyquinoline derivative neuradapt (5 $\mu$M) to induce hypoxia. RNA-seq with qPCR validation and small RNA-seq quantified mRNA and microRNA changes; PROGENy inferred pathway activities.
  Results. scRNA-seq revealed highest hypoxia activation in eoPE, with EVT showing maximum activity. Nine genes were upregulated across all trophoblast types (EBI3, CST6, FN1, RFK, COL17A1, LDHA, PKP2, RPS4Y1, RPS26). In vitro, neuradapt induced more specific hypoxia responses than CoCl2 (1284 vs. 3032 differentially expressed genes). Critically, EBI3, FN1, and COL17A1 showed concordant upregulation in tissue and neuradapt-treated cells, whereas CoCl2 produced opposite patterns. MicroRNAs hsa-miR-27a-5p and hsa-miR-193b-5p were consistently elevated in both models; 3'-isoforms of hsa-miR-9-5p and hsa-miR-92b-3p were identified as hypoxia-associated.
  Conclusions. EBI3, COL17A1, miR-27a-5p, and miR-193b-5p emerge as trophoblast hypoxia markers. Neuradapt (a selective HIF-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor) provides a more physiologically relevant in vitro model than CoCl2, recapitulating transcriptomic signatures observed in PE placentas.</description>
