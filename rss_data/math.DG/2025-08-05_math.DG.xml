      <title>Some results on calibrated submanifolds in Euclidean space of cohomogeneity one and two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct calibrated submanifolds in Euclidean space invariant under the action of a Lie group $G$. We first demonstrate the method used in this paper by reproducing the results about special Lagrangians due to Harvey-Lawson. We then show explicitly that an associative submanifold in $\mathbb{R}^7$ invariant under the action of a maximal torus $\mathbb{T}^2 \subset \mathrm{G}_2$ has to be a special Lagrangian submanifold in $\mathbb{C}^3$. Similarly, we also show that a Cayley submanifold in $\mathbb{R}^8$ invariant under the action of a maximal torus $\mathbb{T}^3 \subset \mathrm{Spin}(7)$ has to be a special Lagrangian submanifold in $\mathbb{C}^4$. We construct coassociative submanifolds in $\mathbb{R}^7$ invariant under the action of $\mathrm{Sp}(1)\subset \mathbb{H}$, a special case of which appears in Harvey-Lawson. Finally, we construct cohomogeneity two examples of coassociative submanifolds in $\mathbb{R}^7$ which are invariant under the action of a maximal torus $\mathbb{T}^2 \subset \mathrm{G}_2$.</description>

      <title>The space of Dirac-minimal metrics is connected in dimensions 2 and 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let M be a closed connected spin manifold. Index theory provides a topological lower bound on the dimension of the kernel of the Dirac operator which depends on the choice of Riemannian metric. Riemannian metrics for which this bound is attained are called Dirac-minimal. We show that the space of Dirac-minimal metrics on M is connected if M is of dimension 2 or 4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a generalization of the classical Gauss-Bonnet formula for metrics with logarithmic singularities on compact Riemann surfaces, under the condition that the Gaussian curvature is Lebesgue integrable with respect to the metric's area form. As an application, we establish the Gauss-Bonnet formula for special K\"ahler metrics when their associated cubic differentials are meromorphic on compact Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>Deformations of asymptotically cylindrical associative submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops the deformation theory of asymptotically cylindrical (ACyl) associative submanifolds in ACyl $G_2$-manifolds, laying the foundation for the gluing of ACyl associative submanifolds in twisted connected sum $G_2$-manifolds presented by the author in [Ber22]. We study the moduli space of ACyl associative submanifolds with a fixed asymptotic holomorphic curve and a fixed rate, as well as the moduli space where this asymptotic data is allowed to vary, each endowed with a natural topology. We compute their virtual dimensions and show that in the best-case scenario, the latter embeds as a Lagrangian submanifold in the moduli space of holomorphic curves of the limiting Calabi-Yau 3-fold. These results may also be of independent interest for future.</description>

      <title>Index Theory on Incomplete Cusp Edge Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Dirac-type operators on incomplete cusp edge spaces with invertible boundary families. In particular, we construct the heat kernel for the associated Laplace-type operator and prove that the Dirac operators are essentially self-adjoint and Fredholm on their unique self adjoint domain. Using the asymptotics of the heat kernel and a generalisation of Getzler's rescaling argument we establish an index formula for these operators including a signature formula for the Hodge-de Rham operator on Witt incomplete cusp edge spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we consider a fiberation f: (X, Delta) to Y between two compact Kahler manifolds with generic fiber of f being a smooth log canonical pair with ample canonical divisor, we prove that the current induced by variation of Kahler Einsteins with mixed cone and Poincare singularities is positive, hence generalize the result of Schumacher in the smooth case [22] and the result of Guenancia in the conic case [14]. As application, we prove the surjectivity of Albanese map for a smooth log canonical pair with -(KX + Delta) being nef.</description>

      <title>Cohomologically calibrated affine connections and the Einstein condition on $S^2 \times T^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper applies the recently developed framework of cohomologically calibrated affine connections to the fundamental problem of constructing non-Riemannian Einstein manifolds. In this framework, the torsion of a connection is intrinsically related to the global topology of the manifold, represented by the de Rham cohomology class specified by a set of real parameters. We focus on the product manifold $S^2 \times T^2$, whose third cohomology group is $H^3(S^2 \times T^2; \mathbb{R}) \cong \mathbb{R}^2$. We analyze how the geometry is modeled by the choice of the torsion tensor $T$ within the family $\mathcal{T}_\omega$, defined by the property that each member of this family must have an associated 3-form $T^\flat$ such that it represents the nontrivial cohomology class via Hodge decomposition. Our analysis reveals a dependence on this choice. First, we show that using a torsion tensor, which produces a strictly positive biorthogonal curvature, leads to a non-diagonal Ricci tensor, creating a structural obstacle to any Einstein solution. Conversely, we then show that using the torsion tensor associated with the purelly harmonic 3-form allow us the construction of an explicit non-Riemannian Einstein solution. Our work thus demonstrates that the cohomologically calibrated affine connections allow a family of feasible connections rich enough to allow for several geometries intrinsically justified by the differential topology of the manifold.</description>

      <title>Min-max theory and Yamabe metrics on conical four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence of Yamabe metrics on four-manifolds possessing finitely-many conical points with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-group, using for the first time a min-max scheme in the singular setting. In our variational argument we need to deform continuously regular bubbles into singular ones, while keeping the Yamabe energy sufficiently low. For doing this, we exploit recent positive mass theorems in the conical setting and study how the mass of the conformal blow-up diverges as the blow-up point approaches the singular set.</description>

      <title>Quotients of Invariant Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work it was shown that if a control system $\mathcal{V}\subset TM$ on manifold $M$ has a control symmetry group $G$ then it very often has group quotients (or symmetry reductions) $\mathcal{V}/G$ which are static feedback linearizable (SFL). This, in turn, can be applied to systematically construct dynamic feedback linearizations of $\mathcal{V}$; or to construct partial feedback linearizations, when no dynamic feedback linearization exists. Because of these and related applications, this paper makes a detailed study of symmetry reduction for control systems. We show that a key property involved in the symmetry reduction of control systems is that of transversality of Lie group actions. Generalizing this notion, we provide an analysis of how the geometry of an invariant distribution, and particularly a control system, is altered as a consequence of symmetry reduction. This provides important information toward understanding the unexpectedly frequent occurrence of SFL quotients. Specifically, we detail how the integrability properties and ranks of various canonical sub-bundles of the quotient object differ from those of the given distribution. As a consequence we are able to classify the SFL quotients of $G$-invariant control systems $\mathcal{V}$ based upon the geometric properties of $\mathcal{V}$ and the action $G$. Additionally, we prove that static feedback linearizability is preserved by symmetry reduction and the well-known Sluis-Gardner-Shadwick (S-G-S) test for the static feedback linearization of control systems is extended to Goursat bundles. A generalized S-G-S test to identify if $\mathcal{V}/G$ is a Goursat bundle is also given, based on the Lie algebra of $G$. Finally, we apply all our results to the well-known PVTOL control system and demonstrate that it may be viewed as an invariant control system on a certain 9-dimensional Lie group.</description>

      <title>Homotopy Type of the Space of Fibrations of the Three-sphere by Simple Closed Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the moduli space of all smooth fibrations of a three-sphere by simple closed curves has the homotopy type of a disjoint union of a pair of two-spheres if the fibers are oriented, and of a pair of real projective planes if unoriented, the same as for its finite-dimensional subspace of Hopf fibrations by parallel great circles. This moduli space is the quotient of the diffeomorphism group of the three-sphere (a Fr\'echet Lie group) by its subgroup of automorphisms of the Hopf fibration, which we show is a smooth Fr\'echet submanifold of the diffeomorphism group. Then we show that the moduli space, already known to be a Fr\'echet manifold by [HKMR12], can be modeled on the concrete Fr\'echet space of vector fields on the three-sphere which are "horizontal" and "balanced" with respect to a given Hopf fibration, and see how the structure of this moduli space helps us to determine its homotopy type.</description>

      <title>Geometric post-Lie deformations of post-Lie algebras and regularity structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to derive a class of geometric-type deformations of post-Lie algebras, we first extend the geometrical notions of torsion and curvature for a general bilinear operation on a Lie algebra, then we derive compatibility conditions which will ensure that the post-Lie structure remains preserved. This type of deformation applies in particular to the post-Lie algebra introduced in arXiv:2306.02484v3 in the context of regularity structures theory. We use this deformation to derive a pre-Lie structure for the regularity structures approach given in arXiv:2103.04187v4, which is isomorphic to the post-Lie algebra studied in arXiv:2306.02484v3 at the level of their associated Hopf algebras. In the case of sections of smooth vector bundles of a finite-dimensional manifold, this deformed structure contains also, as a subalgebra, the post-Lie algebra structure introduced in arXiv:1203.4738v3 in the geometrical context of moving frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method to construct closed rigid associative submanifolds in twisted connected sum $G_2$-manifolds. More precisely, we prove a gluing theorem of asymptotically cylindrical (ACyl) associative submanifolds in ACyl $G_2$-manifolds under a hypothesis. This is analogous to the gluing theorem for $G_2$-instantons introduced in [SW15]. We rephrase the hypothesis in the special cases where the ACyl associative submanifolds are obtained from holomorphic curves or special Lagrangians in ACyl Calabi-Yau $3$-folds. In this way we find many new associative submanifolds which are diffeomorphic to $S^3$, $\mathbf R\mathbf P^3$ or $\mathbf R\mathbf P^3\#\mathbf R\mathbf P^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stationary points of the bending energy of curves $\gamma\colon[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}^n$ subject to constraints on the arc-length and the curve's holonomy while simultaneously allowing for a variable bending stiffness along the arc-length of the curve. Physically, this can be understood as a model for an elastic wire with isotropic cross-section of varying thickness. We derive the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations for variations that are compactly supported away from the end points thus obtaining characterizations for elastic curves with variable bending stiffness. Moreover, we provide a collection of alternative characterizations, e.g., in terms of the curvature function. Adding to numerous known results relating elastic curves to dynamics, we explore connections between elastic curves with variable bending stiffness, variable length pendulums and the flow of vortex filaments with finite thickness.</description>

Abstract: Any Lie algebroid $A$ admits a Nash-type blow-up $\mathrm{Nash}(A)$ that sits in a nice short exact sequence of Lie algebroids $0\rightarrow K\rightarrow \mathrm{Nash}(A)\rightarrow \mathcal{D}\rightarrow 0$ with $K$ a Lie algebra bundle and $\mathcal{D}$ a Lie algebroid whose anchor map is injective on an open dense subset. The base variety is a blowup determined by the singular foliation of $A$. We provide concrete examples. Moreover, we extend the construction following Mohsen's to singular subalgebroids in the sense of Androulidakis-Zambon.</description>

      <title>T-duality for transgressive fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the notion of topological T-duality from oriented sphere bundles to transgressive fibrations, a more general type fibration characterised by the abundance of transgressive elements. Examples of transgressive fibrations include principal $\mathrm{U}(n)$-bundles therefore our notion of T-duality belongs to the realm of non-Abelian T-duality. We prove that transgressive T-duals have isomorphic twisted cohomology. We then introduce Clifford--Courant algebroids, show that one can assign such an algebroid to a transgressive fibration and that transgressive T-duals have isomorphic Clifford--Courant algebroids. We provide several examples illustrating different properties of T-dual spaces. A few typos corrected in v2.</description>

      <title>Gradings on nilpotent Lie algebras associated with the nilpotent fundamental groups of smooth complex algebraic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08571v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group $N$ whose Lie algebra $\mathfrak{n}$ is
  $p$-filiform. We show that $\Gamma$ is either abelian or 2-step nilpotent if $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to the fundamental
  group of a smooth complex algebraic variety. Moreover as an application of our result, we give a
  required condition of a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension less than or
  equal to six to be isomorphic to the fundamental group of a smooth complex algebraic variety.</description>

      <title>Stability and rigidity results of space-like hypersurface in the Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish some rigidity theorems for space-like hypersurfaces in Minkowski space by using a Weinberger-type approach with P-functions and integral identities. Firstly, for space-like hypersurfaces $M$ represented as graphs $x_{n+1}=u(x)$ over domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, if higher-order mean curvature ratio $\frac{H_{k}}{H_l}(l&lt;k)$ is constant and the boundary $\partial M$ lies on a hyperplane intersecting with constant angles, then the hypersurface must be a part of hyperboloid. Secondly, for convex space-like hypersurfaces with boundaries on a hyperboloid or light cone, if higher-order mean curvature ratio $\frac{H_{k}}{H_l}(l&lt;k)$ is constant and the angle function between the normal vectors of the hypersurface and the hyperboloid (or the lightcone) on the boundary is constant, then such hypersurfaces must be a part of hyperboloid. These results significantly extend Gao's previous work presented in \cite{Gao1,Gao2}.
  Furthermore, we derive two fundamental integral identities for constant mean curvature (CMC) graphical hypersurfaces $x_{n+1}=u(x)$, $x\in\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, and the boundary lies on a hyperplane. As some applications: we obtain complete equivalence conditions for hyperboloid identification through curvature properties. We also
  establish a geometric stability estimate demonstrating that the square norm of the trace-free second fundamental form $\bar h$ of $M$ is quantitatively controlled by geometric quantities of $\partial\Omega$, as expressed by the inequality: $$ ||\bar h||_{L^2(\Omega)}\leq C(n,K)||H_{\partial\Omega}-H_0||_{L^1(\partial\Omega)}^{1/2}. $$
  Here, $H_{\partial\Omega}$ is the mean curvature of $\partial\Omega$, $H_0$ is some reference constant and $C$ is a constant.
  Finally, analogous estimates are established.</description>

      <title>Hypersurfaces of constant sum Hessian curvature in Hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic Plateau problem in hyperbolic space for constant sum Hessian curvature. More precisely, given a asymptotic boundary $\Gamma$, one seeks a complete hypersurface $\Sigma$ in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ satisfying $\sigma_{n-1}(\kappa)+\alpha\sigma_{n}(\kappa)=\sigma\in (0,n),\,\,\partial \Sigma=\Gamma$ where $\alpha$ is a non-negative number.</description>

      <title>Similarity surfaces, connections, and the measurable Riemann mapping theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies a particular process that approximates solutions of the Beltrami equation (straightening of ellipse fields, a.k.a. measurable Riemann mapping theorem) on $\mathbb{C}$. It passes through the introduction of a sequence of similarity surfaces constructed by gluing polygons, and we explain the relation between their conformal uniformization and the Schwarz-Christoffel formula. Numerical aspects, in particular the efficiency of the process, are not studied, but we draw interesting theoretical consequences. First, we give an independent proof of the analytic dependence, on the data (the Beltrami form), of the solution of the Beltrami equation (Ahlfors-Bers theorem). For this we prove, without using the Ahlfors-Bers theorem, the holomorphic dependence, with respect to the polygons, of the Christoffel symbol appearing in the Schwarz-Christoffel formula. Second, these Christoffel symbols define a sequence of parallel transports on the range, and in the case of a data that is $C^2$ with compact support, we prove that it converges to the parallel transport associated to a particular affine connection, which we identify.</description>

      <title>A Dual Geometric Test for Forward-Flatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forward-flatness is a generalization of static feedback linearizability and a special case of a more general flatness concept for discrete-time systems. Recently, it has been shown that this practically quite relevant property can be checked by computing a unique sequence of involutive distributions which generalizes the well-known static feedback linearization test. In this paper, a dual test for forward-flatness based on a unique sequence of integrable codistributions is derived. Since the main mathematical operations for determining this sequence are the intersection of codistributions and the calculation of Lie derivatives of 1-forms, it is computationally quite efficient. Furthermore, the formulation with codistributions also facilitates a comparison with the existing discrete-time literature regarding the closely related topic of dynamic feedback linearization, which is mostly formulated in terms of 1-forms rather than vector fields. The presented results are illustrated by two examples.</description>

      <title>On Ma\~n\'e's critical value for the two-component Hunter-Saxton system and a infnite dimensional magnetic Hopf-Rinow theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear system of partial differential equations, the magnetic two-component Hunter-Saxton system (M2HS). This system is formulated as a magnetic geodesic equation on an infinite-dimensional Lie group equipped with a right-invariant metric, the $\dot{H}^1$ -metric, which is closely related to the infinite-dimensional Fisher-Rao metric, and the derivative of an infinite-dimensional contact-type form as the magnetic field. We define Ma\~n\'e's critical value for exact magnetic systems on Hilbert manifolds in full generality and compute it explicitly for the (M2HS). Moreover, we establish an infinite-dimensional Hopf-Rinow theorem for this magnetic system, where Ma\~n\'e's critical value serves as the threshold beyond which the Hopf-Rinow theorem no longer holds. This geometric framework enables us to thoroughly analyze the blow-up behavior of solutions to the (M2HS). Using this insight, we extend solutions beyond blow-up by introducing and proving the existence of global conservative weak solutions. This extension is facilitated by extending the Madelung transform from an isometry into a magnetomorphism, embedding the magnetic system into a magnetic system on an infinite-dimensional sphere equipped with the derivative of the standard contact form as the magnetic field. Crucially, this setup can always be reduced, via a dynamical reduction theorem, to a totally magnetic three-sphere, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics.</description>
