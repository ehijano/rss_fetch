      <title>Optimal information injection and transfer mechanisms for active matter reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01799</link>

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is a state-of-the-art machine learning method that makes use of the power of dynamical systems (the reservoir) for real-time inference. When using biological complex systems as reservoir substrates, it serves as a testbed for basic questions about bio-inspired computation -- of how self-organization generates proper spatiotemporal patterning. Here, we use a simulation of an active matter system, driven by a chaotically moving input signal, as a reservoir. So far, it has been unclear whether such complex systems possess the capacity to process information efficiently and independently of the method by which it was introduced. We find that when switching from a repulsive to an attractive driving force, the system completely changes the way it computes, while the predictive performance landscapes remain nearly identical. The nonlinearity of the driver's injection force improves computation by decoupling the single-agent dynamics from that of the driver. Triggered are the (re-)growth, deformation, and active motion of smooth structural boundaries (interfaces), and the emergence of coherent gradients in speed -- features found in many soft materials and biological systems. The nonlinear driving force activates emergent regulatory mechanisms, which manifest enhanced morphological and dynamic diversity -- arguably improving fading memory, nonlinearity, expressivity, and thus, performance. We further perform RC in a broad variety of non-equilibrium active matter phases that arise when tuning internal (repulsive) forces for information transfer. Overall, we find that active matter agents forming liquid droplets are particularly well suited for RC. The consistently convex shape of the predictive performance landscapes, together with the observed phenomenological richness, conveys robustness and adaptivity.</description>

      <title>Delayed Interactions in Active Agents: Stability and Formations</title>

Abstract: Active agents with time-delayed interactions arise naturally in various real-world systems, such as biological systems, transportation networks and robotic swarms. Such systems are typically modeled as Delay Differential Equations (DDEs) that incorporate inertial effects. In this paper, we investigate the stability of pattern formation of active agents with inertia and time delays, in both uncoupled and coupled scenarios. We derive and analyze a high-dimensional linear DDE model that characterizes the stability of such formations. Starting with the uncoupled scenario, where agents are driven only by a virtual leader, we describe the stability spectrum and provide conditions for the delay-independent (absolute) stability of the formations, as well as delay-dependent stability and unstable hyperbolic behavior. Different cases correspond to distinct universality classes of the corresponding spectrum. For the coupled scenario, where agents are driven by both the virtual leader and inter-agent interactions, we consider both symmetric and non-symmetric coupling topologies. Here we also provide an explicit spectrum classification, including the absolute stability criterion. Additionally, we investigate interactions in the large-delay limit, where delays affect inter-agent coupling, while local feedback remains instantaneous. In this limit, we prove rigorously that the stability region in the complex plane of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix converges to a circle centered at the origin, a phenomenon previously observed in delay-coupled networks. Our findings provide a universal framework for understanding stable formations and motions of active agents with delayed interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-like Coherence Derived from the Interaction between Chemical Reaction and Its Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing, which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized, giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.</description>

      <title>Noise equals control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15670</link>

Abstract: Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, this leads to a precise mathematical mapping: the most probable trajectory between two states minimizes an action functional and corresponds to an optimal control strategy. In Langevin dynamics, the noise term itself serves as the control. For general Markov jump processes, such as chemical reaction networks or electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Peliti formalism to identify the `response' (or `momentum') field $\pi$ as the control variable. This resolves a long-standing interpretational problem in the field-theoretic description of stochastic systems: although $\pi$ evolves backward in time, it has a clear physical role as the control that steers the system along rare trajectories. This implies that Nature is constantly sampling control strategies. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks, systems with unstable fixed points, and specifically on stochastic resonance and Brownian ratchets. The noise-control mapping justifies agential descriptions of these phenomena, and builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why probabilities are generically non-smooth functions of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agential behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.</description>
