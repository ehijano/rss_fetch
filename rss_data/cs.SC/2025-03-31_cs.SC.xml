      <title>Computing Isomorphisms between Products of Supersingular Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Deligne-Ogus-Shioda theorem guarantees the existence of isomorphisms between products of supersingular elliptic curves over finite fields. In this paper, we present methods for explicitly computing these isomorphisms in polynomial time, given the endomorphism rings of the curves involved. Our approach leverages the Deuring correspondence, enabling us to reformulate computational isogeny problems into algebraic problems in quaternions. Specifically, we reduce the computation of isomorphisms to solving systems of quadratic and linear equations over the integers derived from norm equations. We develop $\ell$-adic techniques for solving these equations when we have access to a low discriminant subring. Combining these results leads to the description of an efficient probabilistic Las Vegas algorithm for computing the desired isomorphisms. Under GRH, it is proved to run in expected polynomial time.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Approach to Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10515v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cylindrical algebraic decomposition is a classical construction in real algebraic geometry. Although there are many algorithms to compute a cylindrical algebraic decomposition, their practical performance is still very limited. In this paper, we revisit this problem from a more geometric perspective, where the construction of cylindrical algebraic decomposition is related to the study of morphisms between real varieties. It is showed that the geometric fiber cardinality (geometric property) decides the existence of semi-algebraic continuous sections (semi-algebraic property). As a result, all equations can be systematically exploited in the projection phase, leading to a new simple algorithm whose efficiency is demonstrated by experimental results.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Approach to Weighted Answer-set Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logic programs, more specifically, Answer-set programs, can be annotated with probabilities on facts to express uncertainty. We address the problem of propagating weight annotations on facts (eg probabilities) of an ASP to its standard models, and from there to events (defined as sets of atoms) in a dataset over the program's domain. We propose a novel approach which is algebraic in the sense that it relies on an equivalence relation over the set of events. Uncertainty is then described as polynomial expressions over variables. We propagate the weight function in the space of models and events, rather than doing so within the syntax of the program. As evidence that our approach is sound, we show that certain facts behave as expected. Our approach allows us to investigate weight annotated programs and to determine how suitable a given one is for modeling a given dataset containing events.</description>
