      <title>Fastest first-passage time statistics for time-dependent particle injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common scenario in a variety of biological systems is that multiple particles are searching in parallel for an immobile target located in a bounded domain, and the fastest among them that arrives to the target first triggers a given desirable or detrimental process. The statistics of such extreme events -- the \textit{fastest\/} first-passage to the target -- is well-understood by now through a series of theoretical analyses, but exclusively under the assumption that all $N$ particles start \textit{simultaneously\/}, i.e., all are introduced into the domain instantly, by $\delta$-function-like pulses. However, in many practically important situations this is not the case: in order to start their search, the particles often have to enter first into a bounded domain, e.g., a cell or its nucleus, penetrating through gated channels or nuclear pores. This entrance process has a random duration so that the particles appear in the domain sequentially and with a time delay. Here we focus on the effect of such an extended-in-time injection of multiple particles on the fastest first-passage time (fFPT) and its statistics. We derive the full probability density function $H_N(t)$ of the fFPT with an arbitrary time-dependent injection intensity of $N$ particles. Under rather general assumptions on the survival probability of a single particle and on the injection intensity, we derive the large-$N$ asymptotic formula for the mean fFPT, which is quite different from that obtained for the instantaneous $\delta$-pulse injection. The extended injection is also shown to considerably slow down the convergence of $H_N(t)$ to the large-$N$ limit -- the Gumbel distribution -- so that the latter may be inapplicable in the most relevant settings with few tens to few thousands of particles.</description>

      <title>Relevance of spatial quenched disorder in the Diffusive Epidemic Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusive epidemic process is an example of reaction-diffusion system where diffusion constants of healthy and infected particles determine the universality class of the absorbing phase transition. Introducing spatial quenched disorder in the contamination rates and the diffusion rates of each species leads to a rich phase diagram depending on the disorder distribution. Particularly, signature of different infinite disorder fixed points and lack of active phase are reported. The relevance of disorder is correctly predicted by the Harris criterion in light of the effective macroscopic diffusion rates. However, the effective disorder strength depends on which diffusion rate heterogeneities are introduced.</description>

      <title>Persistent exclusion process with time-periodic drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a persistent exclusion process with time-periodic external potential on a 1d periodic lattice through numerical simulations. A set of run-and-tumble particles move on a lattice of length $L$ and tumbling probability $\gamma \ll 1$ and interact among each other via hardcore exclusion. The effect of the external potential has been modeled as a special site where the tumbling probability is $1$. We call it a "defect" site and move its location along the ring lattice with speed $u$. In the case of $\gamma=0$ the system goes to a jammed state when there is no defect. But introduction of the moving defect creates a strongly phase-separated state where almost all active particles are present in a single large cluster, for small and moderate $u$. This striking effect is caused by the long-range velocity correlation of the active particles, induced by the moving defect. For large $u$, a single large cluster is no longer stable and breaks into multiple smaller clusters. For nonzero $\gamma$ a competition develops between the timescales associated with tumbling and defect motion. While the moving defect attempts to create long-range velocity order, bulk tumbling tends to randomize the velocity alignment. If $\gamma$ is comparable to $u/L$, then a relatively small number of tumbles take place during the time the moving defect travels through the entire system. In this case, the defect has enough time to restore the order in the system and our simulations show that the long-range order in velocity and density survive for $\gamma$ values in this range. As $\gamma$ increases further, long range order is destroyed and the system develops multiple regions of high and low density. We characterize the density inhomogeneity in this case by measuring subsystem density fluctuations and present a heatmap in the $\gamma$-$u$ plane showing the regions with most pronounced density inhomogeneities.</description>

      <title>Spin models from nonlinear cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the study of 1D elementary cellular automata (CA) to the nonlinear rules, following our study of the linear rules in Ref.[arXiv:2309.08059]. We thus construct the respective classical spin models and obtain their zero temperature ground states. We argue that these models are examples of frustrated systems where their ground state space can be exactly and systematically calculated. By including quantum fluctuations through the addition of a transverse field, we study their ground state quantum phases and phase transitions. We use rules 30, 54 and 201 as a probe of our two main results: (a) for small transverse fields we identify an order-by-disorder mechanism which stabilizes the classical phase, and (ii) we observe a first-order quantum phase transition between the classical and quantum paramagnetic phases when the transverse field strength equals the classical coupling strength, as for the linear rules.</description>

      <title>Subleading-order theory for condensation transitions in large deviations of sums of independent and identically distributed random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the full distribution $P_{N}\left(A\right)$ of sums $A = \sum_{i=1}^N$ where $x_1, \dots, x_N$ are $N \gg 1$ independent and identically distributed random variables each sampled from a given distribution $p(x)$ with a subexponential $x \to \infty$ tail. We consider two particular cases: (I) the one-sided stretched exponential distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-x^\alpha}$ where $0 &lt; x &lt; \infty$, (II) the two-sided stretched exponential distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-|x|^\alpha}$ where $-\infty &lt; x &lt; \infty$. We assume $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ (in both cases). As follows immediately from known theorems, for both cases (i) typical fluctuations of $\Delta A = A - \left\langle A\right\rangle $ are described by the central-limit theorem, (ii) the tail $A \to \infty$ is described by the big-jump principle $P_{N}\left(A\right) \simeq N p\left(A\right)$, and (iii) in between these two regimes there is a nontrivial intermediate regime which displays anomalous scaling $P_{N}\left(A\right) \sim e^{-N^\beta f(\Delta A/N^\gamma)}$ with anomalous exponents $\beta,\gamma \in (0,1)$ and large-deviation function $f(y)$ that are all exactly known. In practice, although these theoretical predictions of $P_{N}\left(A\right)$ work very well in regimes (i) and (ii), they often perform quite poorly in the intermediate regime (ii), with errors of several orders of magnitude for $N$ as large as $10^4$. We calculate subleading order corrections to the theoretical predictions in the intermediate regime. We find that for $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \alpha_c$, these corrections scale as power laws in $N$, while for $\alpha_c &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ they scale as stretched exponentials, where the threshold value is $\alpha_c = 1/2$ in case (I) and $\alpha_c = 2/3$ in case (II). This difference between the two cases is a result of the mirror symmetry $p(x) = p(-x)$ which holds only in the latter case.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian of two disjoint blocks in the harmonic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian of two disjoint blocks in the harmonic chain on the line and in its ground state. In the regime of large mass, the non vanishing terms are only the on-site and the nearest-neighbour ones. Analytic expressions are obtained for their profiles, which are written in terms of piecewise linear functions that can be discontinuous and display sharp transitions as the separation between the blocks changes. In the regime of vanishing mass, where the matrices characterising the entanglement Hamiltonian contain couplings at all distances, we explore the location of the subdominant terms and some combinations of matrix elements that are useful for the continuum limit, comparing the results with the corresponding ones for the free chiral current. The single-particle entanglement spectra of these entanglement Hamiltonians are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Universality of pseudo-Goldstone damping near critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03503v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems, in particular its critical dynamics near phase transitions, have been always on the cutting edge of studies in diverse fields of physics, e.g., high energy physics, condensed matter, holography, etc. In this work, we investigate the critical damping of collective modes associated with spontaneous breaking of approximate symmetries, which are called pseudo-Goldstone modes, in strongly correlated systems. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh field theory, we find a universal pseudo-Goldstone damping via the critical O($N$) model that has never been found before by other approaches. Different from the conventional damping found in holography and hydrodynamics, the new one is controlled by critical fluctuations, hence is invisible in mean-field systems or strongly correlated systems with classical gravity duals. Since the critical damping depends solely on the universalities of the critical point, irrespective of the microscopic details, our conclusion should be applicable to a wide class of interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Network Study of the Roughening Transition in (2 + 1)D lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the confined phase of (2+1)D lattice gauge theories a roughening transition arises between a weakly confined regime with floppy string excitations and a strongly confined regime with stiff string excitations. In this work, we use an infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm to quantitatively characterize the properties of confined strings. To this end, we stabilize the state with a string excitation by 't Hooft loop operators. While for zero gauge-matter coupling we can use bare 't Hooft loop operators to do so, for finite gauge-matter coupling we have to transform them to emergent ones, which we achieve with an adiabatic protocol. By analyzing the scaling of both a novel order parameter and the entanglement entropy, our approach allows us to accurately determine the roughening transition, even at finite gauge-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Leveraging quantum statistics to enhance heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key focus of designing quantum thermal devices is the potential advantage that can be gleaned from genuine quantum effects when compared to classical devices. The recent experimental realization of the Pauli engine, where energy is extracted via changes in particle statistics as an alternative to conventional heat sources has opened new avenues of research where quantum statistics can be considered as a thermodynamic resource. In this work we propose hybrid quantum heat engines which utilize additional strokes that change the single particle statistics between bosonic and fermionic descriptions during the cycle. To accomplish this we consider the 1D Lieb Liniger gas whereby the s wave interactions can be tuned between the non interacting and the hard core limit, which are described by bosonic and fermionic statistics respectively. We show that by suitably choosing where to implement these statistical strokes during an Otto like cycle, the efficiency and work output can be significantly enhanced when compared to fully bosonic or fully fermionic engines. Furthermore, in the degenerate regime our engine can operate at the Carnot efficiency, due to the interplay between the different contributions of heat and work induced by the statistical strokes. Finally, we highlight how our thermodynamic cycles can realize other thermal operations,such as refrigerators, promising similar statistical enhancements for a wide range of temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates provide distinct chemical environments, which control various cellular processes. The diffusive dynamics and chemical kinetics inside phase-separated condensates can be studied experimentally by fluorescently labeling molecules, providing key insights into cell biology. We discuss how condensates govern the kinetics of chemical reactions and how this is reflected in the stochastic dynamics of labeled molecules. This allows us to reveal how the physics of phase separation influences the evolution of single-molecule trajectories and governs their statistics. We find that, out of equilibrium, the interactions that enable phase separation can induce directed motion and transport at the level of single molecules. Our work provides a theoretical framework to quantitatively analyze single-molecule trajectories in phase-separated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the trajectories of $d$-dimensional cellular automata (CA) can be used to determine the ground states of $(d+1)$-dimensional classical spin models, and we characterise their quantum phase transition, when in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. For each of the 256 one-dimensional elementary CA we explicitly construct the simplest local two-dimensional classical spin model associated to the given CA, and we also describe this method for $d&gt;1$ through selected examples. We illustrate our general observations with detailed studies of: (i) the $d=1$ CA Rule 150 and its $d=2$ four-body plaquette spin model, (ii) the $d=2$ CA whose associated model is the $d=3$ square-pyramid plaquette model, and (iii) two counter-propagating $d=1$ Rule 60 CA that correspond to the two-dimensional Baxter-Wu spin model. For the quantum spin models, we show that the connection to CAs implies a sensitivity on the approach to the thermodynamic limit via finite size scaling for their quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for computing free-energy differences using thermodynamic integration with a neural network potential that interpolates between two target Hamiltonians. The interpolation is defined at the sample distribution level, and the neural network potential is optimized to match the corresponding equilibrium potential at every intermediate time-step. Once the interpolating potentials and samples are well-aligned, the free-energy difference can be estimated using (neural) thermodynamic integration. To target molecular systems, we simultaneously couple Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions and model the rigid-body rotation of molecules. We report accurate results for several benchmark systems: a Lennard-Jones particle in a Lennard-Jones fluid, as well as the insertion of both water and methane solutes in a water solvent at atomistic resolution using a simple three-body neural-network potential.</description>

      <title>Infinite variety of thermodynamic speed limits with general activities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20690v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Activity, which represents the kinetic property of dynamics, plays a central role in obtaining thermodynamic speed limits (TSLs). In this paper, we discuss a unified framework that provides the existing TSLs based on different activities such as dynamical activity and dynamical state mobility. This unification is based on generalized means that include standard means such as the arithmetic, logarithmic, and geometric means, the first two of which respectively correspond to the dynamical activity and the dynamical state mobility. We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes and deterministic chemical reaction networks using different activities. The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force. We numerically and analytically discuss the tightness of the lower bounds on the EPR in the various TSLs.</description>

      <title>A control variate method for threshold crossing probabilities of plastic deformation driven by transient coloured noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid method combining partial differential equation (PDE) and Monte Carlo (MC) techniques to obtain efficient estimates of statistics for plastic deformation related to kinematic hardening models driven by transient coloured noise. Our approach employs a control variate strategy inspired by [CPAM, 75 (3), 455-492, 2022] and relies on a class of PDEs with non-standard boundary conditions, which we derive here. The solutions of those PDEs represent the statistics of models driven by transient white noise and are significantly easier to solve than the coloured noise version. We apply our method to threshold-crossing probabilities, which are used as failure criteria known as ultimate and serviceability limit states under non-stationary excitation. Our contribution provides solid grounds for such calculations and is significantly more computationally efficient in terms of variance reduction compared to standard MC simulations.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of Real Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:1802.04588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct pseudo-Gaussian orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \mathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ independent and identically distributed random numbers as their elements and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu &gt;0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu &lt;0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \mathcal{D}^t \zeta \mathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</description>

      <title>Spectral Signatures of Vibronic Coupling in Trapped Cold Ionic Rydberg Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atoms and ions confined with electric and optical fields form the basis of many current quantum simulation and computing platforms. When excited to high-lying Rydberg states, long-ranged dipole interactions emerge which strongly couple the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom through state-dependent forces. This vibronic coupling and the ensuing hybridization of internal and external degrees of freedom manifest through clear signatures in the many-body spectrum. We illustrate this by considering the case of two trapped Rydberg ions, for which the interaction between the relative vibrations and Rydberg states realizes a quantum Rabi model. We proceed to demonstrate that the aforementioned hybridization can be probed by radio frequency spectroscopy and discuss observable spectral signatures at finite temperatures and for larger ion crystals.</description>

      <title>On the interplay of electronic and lattice screening on exciton binding in two-dimensional lead halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use path integral Monte Carlo to study the energetics of excitons in layered, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in order to elucidate the relative contributions of dielectric confinement and electron-phonon coupling. While the dielectric mismatch between polar perovskite layers and non-polar ligand layers significantly increases the exciton binding energy relative to their three dimensional bulk crystal counterparts, formation of exciton polarons attenuates this effect. The contribution from polaron formation is found to be a non-monotonic function of the lead halide layer thickness, which is clarified by a general variational theory. Accounting for both of these effects provides a description of exciton binding energies in good agreement with experimental measurements. By studying isolated layers and stacked layered crystals of various thicknesses, with ligands of varying polarity, we provide a systematic understanding of the excitonic behavior of this class of materials and how to engineer their photophysics.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Correlations in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits: Partial Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19929v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the notion of quantum chaos is tied to random matrix spectral correlations, also eigenstate properties in chaotic systems are often assumed to be described by random matrix theory. Analytic insights into eigenstate correlations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form factor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary quantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite subsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial times, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity implies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the linear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we prove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result up to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical results by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as well as with numerics for finite-size systems.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved Stochastic Dynamics of Quantum Thermal Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steady-state quantum thermal machines are typically characterized by a continuous flow of heat between different reservoirs. However, at the level of discrete stochastic realizations, heat flow is unraveled as a series of abrupt quantum jumps, each representing an exchange of finite quanta with the environment. In this work, we present a framework that resolves the dynamics of quantum thermal machines into cycles classified as engine-like, cooling-like, or idle. We analyze the statistics of individual cycle types and their durations, enabling us to determine both the fraction of cycles useful for thermodynamic tasks and the average waiting time between cycles of a given type. Central to our analysis is the notion of intermittency, which captures the operational consistency of the machine by assessing the frequency and distribution of idle cycles. Our framework offers a novel approach to characterizing thermal machines with significant relevance to experiments involving mesoscopic transport through quantum dots.</description>

      <title>First- and second-order quantum phase transitions in the long-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of an unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain with longitudinal and transverse fields in the full range of interactions: from all-to-all to nearest-neighbors. First, we solve the model analytically in the strong long-range regime, confirming in the process that a mean-field treatment is exact for this model. We compute the order parameter and the correlations and show that the model exhibits a tricritical point where the phase transition changes from first to second order. This is in contrast with the nearest-neighbor limit where the phase transition is known to be second order. To understand how the order of the phase transition changes from one limit to the other, we tackle the analytically-intractable interaction ranges numerically, using a variational quantum Monte Carlo method with a neural-network-based ansatz, the visual transformer. We show how the first-order phase transition shrinks with decreasing interaction range and establish approximate boundaries in the interaction range for which the first-order phase transition is present. Finally, we establish that the key ingredient to stabilize a first-order phase transition and a tricritical point is the presence of ferromagnetic interactions between spins of the same sublattice on top of antiferromagnetic interactions between spins of different sublattices. Tunable-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic interactions are just one way to implement such staggered interactions.</description>

      <title>Confined active particles with spatially dependent Lorentz force: an odd twist to the "best Fokker-Planck approximation"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a version of the so-called "best Fokker-Planck approximation" (BFPA) to describe the spatial properties of interacting active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs) in arbitrary spatial dimensions. In doing so, we also take into account the odd-diffusive contribution of the Lorentz force acting on a charged particle in a spatially dependent magnetic field, sticking to the overdamped limit. While the BFPA itself does not turn out to be widely useful, our general approach allows to deduce an appropriate generalization of the Fox approximation, which we use to characterize the stationary behavior of a single active particle in an external potential by deriving analytic expressions for configurational probability distributions (or effective potentials). In agreement with computer simulations, our theory predicts that the Lorentz force reduces the effective attraction and thus the probability to find an active particle in the vicinity of a repulsive wall. Even for an inhomogeneous magnetic field, our theoretical findings provide useful qualitative insights, specifically regarding the location of accumulation regions.</description>

      <title>Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among present quantum many-body computational methods, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is one of the most promising approaches for dealing with large-scale complex systems. It has played an extremely important role in understanding quantum many-body physics. However, two dark clouds, namely the sign problem and general measurement issues, have seriously hampered its scope of application. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{O} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{Oe^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and time. Essentially, this scheme solves the long-standing problem of calculating the overlap between different distribution functions in mathematical statistics, which can be widely used in statistical problems, such as quantum many-body computation, big data and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Measuring collective diffusion properties by counting particles in boxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collective diffusion coefficient $D_\mathrm{coll}$ is a key quantity for describing the macroscopic transport properties of soft matter systems. However, measuring $D_\mathrm{coll}$ is a fundamental experimental and numerical challenge, as it either relies on nonequilibrium techniques that are hard to interpret or, at equilibrium, on Fourier-based approaches which are fraught with difficulties associated with Fourier transforms. In this work, we investigate the equilibrium diffusive dynamics of a 2D colloidal suspension experimentally and numerically. We use a "Countoscope" technique, which analyses the statistics of particle number counts $N(t)$ in virtual observation boxes of a series of microscopy images at equilibrium, to measure $D_\mathrm{coll}$ for the first time. We validate our results against Fourier-based approaches and establish best practices for measuring $D_\mathrm{coll}$ using fluctuating counts. We show that Fourier techniques yield inaccurate long-range collective measurements because of the non-periodic nature of an experimental image, yet counting exploits this property by using finite observation windows. Finally, we discuss the potential of our method to advance our understanding of collective properties in suspensions, particularly the role of hydrodynamic interactions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Hamiltonian anyons with applications to quantum heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of a collection of identical particles is intimately linked to the symmetries of their wavefunction under particle exchange. Topological anyons, arising as quasiparticles in low-dimensional systems, interpolate between bosons and fermions, picking up a complex phase when exchanged. Recent research has demonstrated that similar statistical behavior can arise with mixtures of bosonic and fermionic pairs, offering theoretical and experimental simplicity. We introduce an alternative implementation of such statistical anyons, based on promoting or suppressing the population of symmetric states via a symmetry generating Hamiltonian. The scheme has numerous advantages: anyonic statistics emerge in a single particle pair, extending straightforwardly to larger systems; the statistical properties can be dynamically adjusted; and the setup can be simulated efficiently. We show how exchange symmetry can be exploited to improve the performance of heat engines, and demonstrate a reversible work extraction cycle in which bosonization and fermionization replace compression and expansion strokes. Additionally, we investigate emergent thermal properties, including critical phenomena, in large statistical anyon systems.</description>

      <title>Highly Entangled 2D Ground States: Tensor Network, Order Parameter and Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we present analytical results on the exact tensor network representations and correlation functions of the first examples of 2D ground states with quantum phase transitions between area law and extensive entanglement entropy. The tensor networks constructed are one dimension higher than the lattices of the physical systems, allowing entangled physical degrees of freedoms to be paired with one another arbitrarily far away. Contraction rules of the internal legs are specified by a simple translationally invariant set of rules in terms of the tesselation of cubes or prisms in 3D space. The networks directly generalize the previous holographic tensor networks for 1D Fredkin and Motzkin chains. We also analyze the correlation in the spin and color sectors from the scaling of the height function of random surfaces, revealing additional characterizations of the exotic phase transitions.</description>
