      <title>On the Complexity of Vertex-Splitting Into an Interval Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertex splitting is a graph modification operation in which a vertex is replaced by multiple vertices such that the union of their neighborhoods equals the neighborhood of the original vertex. We introduce and study vertex splitting as a graph modification operation for transforming graphs into interval graphs. Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, we consider the problem of deciding whether $G$ can be transformed into an interval graph using at most $k$ vertex splits. We prove that this problem is NP-hard, even when the input is restricted to subcubic planar bipartite graphs. We further observe that vertex splitting differs fundamentally from vertex and edge deletions as graph modification operations when the objective is to obtain a chordal graph, even for graphs with maximum independent set size at most two. On the positive side, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for transforming, via a minimum number of vertex splits, a given graph into a disjoint union of paths, and that splitting triangle free graphs into unit interval graphs is also solvable in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Min-Max Optimization with Product Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of the problem of computing local min-max equilibria of games with a nonconvex-nonconcave utility function $f$. From the work of Daskalakis, Skoulakis, and Zampetakis [DSZ21], this problem was known to be hard in the restrictive case in which players are required to play strategies that are jointly constrained, leaving open the question of its complexity under more natural constraints. In this paper, we settle the question and show that the problem is PPAD-hard even under product constraints and, in particular, over the hypercube.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Decision Trees: A Weighted Graph and $L_1$ Norm Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of the computational power of single-query quantum algorithms is important because they must extract maximal information from one oracle call, revealing fundamental limits of quantum advantage and enabling optimal, resource-efficient quantum computation. This paper proposes a formulation of single-query quantum decision trees as weighted graphs. This formulation has the advantage that it facilitates the analysis of the $L_1$ spectral norm of the algorithm output. This advantage is based on the fact that a high $L_1$ spectral norm of the output of a quantum decision tree is a necessary condition to outperform its classical counterpart. We propose heuristics for maximizing the $L_{1}$ spectral norm, show how to combine weighted graphs to generate sequences with strictly increasing norm, and present functions exhibiting exponential quantum advantage. Finally, we establish a necessary condition linking single-query quantum advantage to the asymptotic growth of measurement projector dimensions.</description>

      <title>Universal Solvability for Robot Motion Planning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Universal Solvability of Robot Motion Planning on Graphs (USolR) problem: given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and p robots, determine whether any arbitrary configuration of the robots can be transformed into any other arbitrary configuration via a sequence of valid, collision-free moves. We design a canonical accumulation procedure that maps arbitrary configurations to configurations that occupy a fixed subset of vertices, enabling us to analyze configuration reachability in terms of equivalence classes. We prove that in instances that are not universally solvable, at least half of all configurations are unreachable from a given one, and leverage this to design an efficient randomized algorithm with one-sided error, which can be derandomized with a blow-up in the running time by a factor of p. Further, we optimize our deterministic algorithm by using the structure of the input graph G = (V, E), achieving a running time of O(p * (|V| + |E|)) in sparse graphs and O(|V| + |E|) in dense graphs. Finally, we consider the Graph Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (EAUS) problem, where given a connected graph G that is not universally solvable for p robots, the question is to check if for a given budget b, at most b edges can be added to G to make it universally solvable for p robots. We provide an upper bound of p - 2 on b for general graphs. On the other hand, we also provide examples of graphs that require Theta(p) edges to be added. We further study the Graph Vertex and Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (VEAUS) problem, where a vertices and b edges can be added, and we provide lower bounds on a and b.</description>

      <title>Optimal Monotone Depth-Three Circuit Lower Bounds for Majority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gurumuhkani et al. (CCC'24) introduced the local enumeration problem $Enum(k, t)$ as follows: for a natural number $k$ and a parameter $t$, given an $n$-variate $k$-CNF with no satisfying assignment with Hamming weight less than $t(n)$, enumerate all satisfying assignments of Hamming weight exactly $t(n)$. They showed that efficient algorithms for local enumeration yield new $k$-SAT algorithms and depth-3 lower bounds for Majority function. As the first non-trivial case, they gave an algorithm for $k = 3$ which in particular gave a new lower bound on the size of depth-3 circuits with bottom fan-in at most 3 computing Majority. In this paper, we give an optimal algorithm that solves local enumeration on monotone formulas for $k = 3$ and all $t \le n/2$. In particular, we obtain an optimal lower bound on the size of monotone depth-3 circuits with bottom fan-in at most 3 computing Majority.</description>

      <title>On the Parallel Complexity of Identifying Groups and Quasigroups via Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the computational complexity of isomorphism testing for finite groups and quasigroups, given by their multiplication tables. We crucially take advantage of their various decompositions to show the following:
  - We first consider the class of groups that admit direct product decompositions, where each indecompsable factor is $O(1)$-generated, and either perfect or centerless. We show any group in this class is identified by the $O(1)$-dimensional count-free Weisfeiler--Leman (WL) algorithm with $O(\log \log n)$ rounds, and the $O(1)$-dimensional counting WL algorithm with $O(1)$ rounds. Consequently, the isomorphism problem for this class is in $\textsf{L}$. This improves upon the previous upper bound of $\textsf{TC}^{1}$, which was obtained using $O(\log n)$ rounds of the $O(1)$-dimensional counting WL (Grochow and Levet; FCT 2023, \textit{J. Comput. Syst. Sci.} 2026).
  - We next consider more generally, the class of groups where each indecomposable factor is $O(1)$-generated. We exhibit an $\textsf{AC}^{3}$ canonical labeling procedure for this class. Here, we accomplish this by showing that in the multiplication table model, the direct product decomposition can be computed in $\textsf{AC}^{3}$, parallelizing the work of Kayal and Nezhmetdinov (ICALP 2009).
  - Isomorphism testing between a central quasigroup $G$ and an arbitrary quasigroup $H$ is in $\textsf{NC}$. Here, we take advantage of the fact that central quasigroups admit an affine decomposition in terms of an underlying Abelian group. Only the trivial bound of $n^{\log(n)+O(1)}$-time was previously known for isomorphism testing of central quasigroups.</description>

      <title>Refining the Complexity Landscape of Speed Scaling: Hardness and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of scheduling jobs on a single speed-scalable processor with the objective of capturing the trade-off between the (weighted) flow time and the energy consumption. This trade-off has been extensively explored in the literature through a number of problem formulations that differ in the specific job characteristics and the precise objective function. Nevertheless, the computational complexity of four important problem variants has remained unresolved and was explicitly identified as an open question in prior work. In this paper, we settle the complexity of these variants.
  More specifically, we prove that the problem of minimizing the objective of total (weighted) flow time plus energy is NP-hard for the cases of (i) unit-weight jobs with arbitrary sizes, and (ii)~arbitrary-weight jobs with unit sizes. These results extend to the objective of minimizing the total (weighted) flow time subject to an energy budget and hold even when the schedule is required to adhere to a given priority ordering.
  In contrast, we show that when a completion-time ordering is provided, the same problem variants become polynomial-time solvable. The latter result highlights the subtle differences between priority and completion orderings for the problem.</description>
