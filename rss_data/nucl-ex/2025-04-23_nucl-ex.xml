      <title>Solid Target production for Astrophysical Reasearch: the European target laboratory partnership in ChETEC-INFRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The joint work of European target laboratories in the ChETEC-INFRA project is presented, to face the new experimental challenges of nuclear astrophysics. In particular, results are presented on innovative targets of 12,13C, 16O, and 19F that were produced, characterized, and, in some cases, tested under beam irradiation. STAR (Solid Targets for Astrophysics Research) is already acting to increase collaboration among laboratories, to achieve shared protocols for target production, and to offer a characterization service to the entire nuclear astrophysics community.</description>

      <title>Particles in finite volumes and a toy model of decaying neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the momentum spectra of particles confined to finite spatial volumes deviate from the continuous spectra used for unconfined particles. In this article, we consider real scalar particles confined to finite volumes with periodic boundary conditions, such that the particles' spectra are discrete. We directly compute the density matrices describing the decay processes $\phi \to \varphi^2$ and $\phi \to \varphi\chi\nu$, and subsequently derive expressions for the decay probabilities both for confined and unconfined particles. The latter decay process is used as a rough toy model for a neutron decaying into a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino. We propose that finite volume effects can have an impact on the outcomes of experiments measuring the neutron lifetime. In addition, our findings at the toy model level suggest that taking into account possible initial correlations between neutrons and their daughter particles might be relevant as well.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a GAGG detector for neutron measurements in underground laboratories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In rare events experiments, such as those devoted to the direct search of dark matter, a precise knowledge of the environmental gamma and neutron backgrounds is crucial for reaching the design experiment sensitivity. The neutron component is often poorly known due to the lack of a scalable detector technology for the precise measurement of low-flux neutron spectra. Gd$_3$Al$_2$Ga$_3$O$_{12}$ (GAGG) is a newly developed, high-density scintillating crystal with a high gadolinium content, which could allow to exploit the high $(n,\gamma)$ cross section of $^{155}$Gd and $^{157}$Gd for neutron measurements in underground environments. GAGG crystals feature a high scintillation light yield, good timing performance, and the capability of particle identification via pulse-shape discrimination. In a low-background environment, the distinctive signature produced by neutron capture on gadolinium, namely a $\beta/\gamma$ cascade releasing up to 9 MeV of total energy, and the efficient particle identification provided by GAGG could yield a background-free neutron capture signal. In this work, we present the characterization of a first GAGG detector prototype in terms of particle discrimination performance, intrinsic radioactive contamination, and neutron response.</description>

      <title>High density symmetry energy: A key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the so-called N3LO Skyrme pseudopotential is extended to include the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions by assuming the similar density, momentum, and isospin dependence as for the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The parameters in these interactions are determined from either experimental information if any or chiral effective field theory or lattice QCD calculations of the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter around nuclear saturation density $\rho_0$. We find that varying the high density behavior of the symmetry energy $E_{\rm sym}(\rho)$ can significantly change the critical density for hyperon appearance in the neutron stars and thus the maximum mass $M_{\rm TOV}$ of static hyperon stars. In particular, a symmetry energy which is soft around $2-3\rho_0$ but stiff above about $4\rho_0$, can lead to $M_{\rm TOV} \gtrsim 2M_\odot$ for hyperon stars and simultaneously be compatible with (1) the constraints on the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter at suprasaturation densities obtained from flow data in heavy-ion collisions; (2) the microscopic calculations of the equation of state for pure neutron matter; (3) the star tidal deformability extracted from gravitational wave signal GW170817; (4) the mass-radius relations of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715 measured from NICER; (5) the observation of the unusually low mass and small radius in the central compact object of HESS J1731-347. Furthermore, the sound speed squared of the hyperon star matter naturally displays a strong peak structure around baryon density of $3-4\rho_0$, consistent with the model-independent analysis on the multimessenger data. Our results suggest that the high density symmetry energy could be a key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle in neutron star physics.</description>

      <title>Simulation Tool Development and Sensitivity Analysis of 160Gd Double Beta Decay Search by the PIKACHU Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta decay (0v2b) has been investigated as a physical process that can provide evidence for the Majorana nature of neutrinos. The theoretical predictions of the 0v2b rate are subject to significant uncertainty, primarily due to nuclear matrix elements (NME). To reduce this uncertainty, experimental measurements of the half-lives of two-neutrino double beta decay (2v2b) in various nuclei are essential as a benchmark for NME calculations. The PIKACHU (Pure Inorganic scintillator experiment in KAmioka for CHallenging Underground sciences) project searches for the previously unobserved 2v2b decay of 160Gd, employing Ce-doped Gd3Ga3Al2O12 (GAGG) single crystals. In the Phase 1 experiment, we aim to improve the current lower limit on the 2v2b half-life of 160Gd by a prior study using a Ce-doped Gd2SiO5 (GSO) crystal. Ultimately, in Phase 2, the project seeks to achieve a sensitivity surpassing the theoretical prediction of 7.4 x 10^20 years, enabling the potential discovery of the 160Gd 2v2b decay. In this paper, we describe the development of background models based on GEANT4 simulations. The modeled backgrounds are contributions from uranium and thorium decay chains, 40K present in GAGG, and 40K gamma-rays from outside of GAGG. Additionally, we developed models for both 2v2b and 0v2b decay by implementing the theoretical kinematics of two-electron emission in double beta decay in the GEANT4 simulation. As a result, our background models successfully reproduced the measured background spectrum through fitting. By generating pseudo background spectra expected in Phase 1 and analyzing them with the combined background and 2v2b models, we evaluated the 2v2b sensitivity of Phase 1 to be 2.78 x 10^19 years (90% C.L.). This paper presents the development of these simulation models and the expected sensitivities for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 based on the pseudo data analyses.</description>
