      <title>StringNET: Neural Network based Variational Method for Transition Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare transition events in meta-stable systems under noisy fluctuations are crucial for many non-equilibrium physical and chemical processes. In these processes, the primary contributions to reactive flux are predominantly near the transition pathways that connect two meta-stable states. Efficient computation of these paths is essential in computational chemistry. In this work, we examine the temperature-dependent maximum flux path, the minimum energy path, and the minimum action path at zero temperature. We propose the StringNET method for training these paths using variational formulations and deep learning techniques. Unlike traditional chain-of-state methods, StringNET directly parametrizes the paths through neural network functions, utilizing the arc-length parameter as the main input. The tasks of gradient descent and re-parametrization in the string method are unified into a single framework using loss functions to train deep neural networks. More importantly, the loss function for the maximum flux path is interpreted as a softmax approximation to the numerically challenging minimax problem of the minimum energy path. To compute the minimum energy path efficiently and robustly, we developed a pre-training strategy that includes the maximum flux path loss in the early training stage, significantly accelerating the computation of minimum energy and action paths. We demonstrate the superior performance of this method through various analytical and chemical examples, as well as the two- and four-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau functional energy.</description>

      <title>PACKMOL- GUI: An All-in-One VMD Interface for Efficient Molecular Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PACKMOL is a widely utilized molecular modeling tool within the computational chemistry community. However, its perceivable advantages have been impeded by the long-standing lack of a robust open-source graphical user interface (GUI) that integrates parameter settings with the visualization of molecular and geometric constraints. To address this limitation, we have developed PACKMOL-GUI, a VMD plugin that leverages the dynamic extensibility of Tcl/Tk toolkit. This GUI enables the configuration of all PACKMOL parameters through an intuitive user panel, while also facilitating the visualization of molecular structures and geometric constraints, including cubes, boxes and spheres, among others via the VMD software. The seamless interaction between VMD and PACKMOL provides an intuitive and efficient all-in-one platform for the packing of complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Based Construction of Molecular Potential and Its Application in Exploring the Deep-Lying-Orbital Effect in HighOrder Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract. Creating soft-Coulomb-type (SC) molecular potential within single-active-electron approximation (SAE) is essential since it allows solving time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations with fewer computational resources compared to other multielectron methods. The current available SC potentials can accurately reproduce the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which is sufficient for analyzing nonlinear effects in laser-molecule interactions like high-order harmonic generation (HHG). However, recent discoveries of significant effects of deep-lying molecular orbitals call for more precise potentials to analyze them. In this study, we present a fast and accurate method based on machine learning to construct SC potentials that simultaneously reproduce various molecular features, including energies, symmetries, and dipole moments of HOMO, HOMO-1, and HOMO-2. We use this ML model to create SC SAE potentials of the HCN molecule and then comprehensively analyze the fingerprints of lower-lying orbitals in HHG spectra emitted during the H-CN stretching. Our findings reveal that HOMO-1 plays a role in forming the second HHG plateau. Additionally, as the H-C distance increases, the plateau structure and the smoothness of HHG spectra are altered due to the redistribution of orbital electron density. These results are in line with other experimental and theoretical studies. Lastly, the machine learning approach using deconvolution and convolution neural networks in the present study is so general that it can be applied to construct molecular potential for other molecules and molecular dynamic processes.</description>

      <title>Electron impact partial ionization cross section and thermal rate coefficients of gaseous refrigerants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have calculated the electron impact partial and total ionization cross sections of important gaseous targets, such as Trifluoromethane (CHF$_3$), 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane $(\mathrm{C_2H_2F_4})$ or R134a, 1,1,1-Trifluoroethane $(\mathrm{C_2H_3F_3})$ or R143a, 1,1,1-Trifluoropropane $(\mathrm{C_3H_5F_3})$ or R263fb, and 3,3,3-Trifluoropropene $(\mathrm{C_3H_3F_3})$ or R1243zf using the binary encounter Bethe model and its variants. The corresponding rate coefficients are calculated for total and partial ionization cross sections using the Maxwell's velocity distribution function. Our data for partial and total ionization along with the rate coefficient showed good agreement with the existing data in the literature. The targets studied are important for plasma applications and are used in gas-based detectors at high-energy physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Feshbach resonances in cold collisions as a benchmark for state of the art ab initio theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resonances in collisions and reactions are a sensitive probe of the intermolecular forces. They may dominate the final quantum state distribution, as recently observed for Feshbach resonances in a cold collision experiment (Science 380, 77 (2023)). This raises the question whether the sensitivity of such measurements is sufficient to assess the quality of theoretical models for the interaction. We here compare measured collision cross sections to those obtained with exact quantum coupled-channels scattering calculations for three different ab initio potential energy surfaces. We find that the ability to test the correct prediction of energy redistribution over molecular degrees of freedom is within reach, requiring only a modest improvement in energy resolution of current experiments. Such improvement will enable the separation of individual resonances and allow for an unambiguous experimental test of different theory approaches.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Parametrization of Molecular Mechanics Force Fields for Expansive Chemical Space Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A force field is a critical component in molecular dynamics simulations for computational drug discovery. It must achieve high accuracy within the constraints of molecular mechanics' (MM) limited functional forms, which offers high computational efficiency. With the rapid expansion of synthetically accessible chemical space, traditional look-up table approaches face significant challenges. In this study, we address this issue using a modern data-driven approach, developing ByteFF, an Amber-compatible force field for drug-like molecules. To create ByteFF, we generated an expansive and highly diverse molecular dataset at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/DZVP level of theory. This dataset includes 2.4 million optimized molecular fragment geometries with analytical Hessian matrices, along with 3.2 million torsion profiles. We then trained an edge-augmented, symmetry-preserving molecular graph neural network (GNN) on this dataset, employing a carefully optimized training strategy. Our model predicts all bonded and non-bonded MM force field parameters for drug-like molecules simultaneously across a broad chemical space. ByteFF demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets, excelling in predicting relaxed geometries, torsional energy profiles, and conformational energies and forces. Its exceptional accuracy and expansive chemical space coverage make ByteFF a valuable tool for multiple stages of computational drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Hydrogen Atom Scattering Experiments Are Not a Sufficient Benchmark to Validate Electronic Friction Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the dynamics of atoms and molecules at metal surfaces, electron-hole pair excitations can play a crucial role. In the case of hyperthermal hydrogen atom scattering, they lead to nonadiabatic energy loss and highly inelastic scattering. Molecular dynamics with electronic friction simulations where friction is computed under an isotropic homogeneous electron gas approximation have previously shown good agreement with measured kinetic energy loss distributions, suggesting that this level of theoretical description is sufficient to describe nonadiabatic effects of atomic scattering. In this work, we show that similar agreement with room temperature experiments can also be achieved with friction derived from density functional theory linear response calculations. The apparent agreement of the homogeneous electron gas approximation with experiment arises from a fortuitous cancellation of errors where friction is overestimated close to the surface and the spin transition is neglected. Only for scattering at low temperatures can both approximations be distinguished and differences rationalised in terms of the number of bounces of the atom on the surface. We identify the signatures of nonadiabatic energy loss of different levels of theory, which future low-temperature scattering experiments will be able to measure.</description>

      <title>Merging Two Molecular Beams of ND$_3$ up to the Liouville Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In low-energy collisions between two dipolar molecules, the long-range dipole-dipole interaction plays an important role in the scattering dynamics. Merged beam configurations offer the lowest collision energies achievable, but they generally can not be applied to most dipole-dipole systems as the electrodes used to merge one beam would deflect the other. This paper covers the design and implementation of a merged electrostatic guide whose geometry was numerically optimized for ND$_3$-ND$_3$ and ND$_3$-NH$_3$ collisions. This device guides both beams simultaneously and makes them converge up to an effective collision angle of 2$\mathrm{^\circ}$, yielding the optimal compromise between spatial overlap and the lowest possible collision energy. We present preliminary data for inelastic ND$_3$-ND$_3$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Photofragmentation of Corannulene (C20H10) and Sumanene (C21H12) cations in gas phase and its Astrophysical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aromatic infrared Bands (AIBs) dominate the mid-infrared spectra of many galactic and extragalactic sources. These AIBs are generally attributed to fluorescent emission from aromatic molecules. Unified efforts from experimentalists and theoreticians to assign these AIB features have recently gotten additional impetus with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) delivers mid-IR spectrum with greatly increased sensitivity and spectral resolution. PAHs in space can exist in either neutral or ionic forms, absorb UV photons and undergo fragmentation, becoming a rich source of small hydrocarbons. This top-down mechanism of larger PAHs fragmenting into smaller species is of utmost importance in photo-dissociation regions (PDR) in space. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the photo-fragmentation pathways of two astronomically significant PAH cations - corannulene (C20H10) and sumanene (C21H12) that are structural motifs of fullerene C60, to understand their sequential fragmentation pathways. The photo-fragmentation experiments exhibit channels that are much different from planar PAHs. The breakdown of carbon skeleton is found to have different pathways for C20H10 and C21H12 because of the number and positioning of pentagon rings; yet the most abundant low mass cations produced by these two species are found to be similar. The low mass cations showcased in this work could be of interest for their astronomical detections. For completeness, the qualitative photo fragmentation behaviour of the dicationic corannulene and sumanene have also been experimented, but the potential energy surface of these dications are beyond the scope of this paper.</description>

      <title>Modeling scale-up of particle coating by atomic layer deposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a promising technique to functionalize particle surfaces for energy applications including energy storage, catalysis, and decarbonization. In this work, we present a set of models of ALD particle coating to explore the transition from lab scale to manufacturing. Our models encompass the main particle coating manufacturing approaches including rotary bed, fluidized bed, and continuously vibrating reactors. These models provide key metrics, such as throughput and precursor utilization, required to evaluate the scalability of ALD manufacturing approaches and their feasibility in the context of energy applications. Our results show that designs that force the precursor to flow through fluidized particles transition faster to a transport-limited regime where throughput is maximized. They also exhibit higher precursor utilization. In the context of continuous processes, our models indicate that it is possible to achieve self-extinguishing processes with almost 100% precursor utilization. A comparison with past experimental results of ALD in fluidized bed reactors shows excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are an important component of the interstellar medium of galaxies and photochemistry plays a key role in the evolution of these species in space. Here, we explore the photofragmentation behaviour of the coronene cation (C24H12+) using time of flight mass spectrometry. The experiments show photodissociation fragmentation channels including the formation of bare carbon clusters (Cn+) and hydrocarbon chains (CnHx+). The mass spectrum of coronene is dominated by peaks from C11+ and C7H+. Density functional theory was used to calculate relative energies, potential dissociation pathways, and possible structures for relevant species. We identify 6-6 to 5-7 ring isomerisation as a key step in the formation of both the bare carbon clusters and the hydrocarbon chains observed in this study. We present the dissociation mechanism outlined here as a potential formation route for C60 and other astrochemically relevant species.</description>

      <title>Structural Descriptors and Information Extraction from X-ray Emission Spectra: Aqueous Sulfuric Acid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning can reveal new insights into X-ray spectroscopy of liquids when the local atomistic environment is presented to the model in a suitable way. Many unique structural descriptor families have been developed for this purpose. We benchmark the performance of six different descriptor families using a computational data set of 24200 sulfur K$\beta$ X-ray emission spectra of aqueous sulfuric acid simulated at six different concentrations. We train a feed-forward neural network to predict the spectra from the corresponding descriptor vectors and find that the local many-body tensor representation, smooth overlap of atomic positions and atom-centered symmetry functions excel in this comparison. We found a similar hierarchy when applying the emulator-based component analysis to identify and separate the spectrally relevant structural characteristics from the irrelevant ones. In this case, the spectra were dominantly dependent on the concentration of the system, whereas adding the second most significant degree of freedom in the decomposition allowed for distinction of the protonation state of the acid molecule.</description>

      <title>Solving multi-pole challenges in the GW100 benchmark enables precise low-scaling GW calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $GW$ approximation is a widely used method for computing electron addition and removal energies of molecules and solids. The computational effort of conventional $GW$ algorithms increases as $O(N^4)$ with the system size $N$, hindering the application of $GW$ to large and complex systems. Low-scaling $GW$ algorithms are currently very actively developed. Benchmark studies at the single-shot $G_0W_0$ level indicate excellent numerical precision for frontier quasiparticle energies, with mean absolute deviations $&lt;10$ meV between low-scaling and standard implementations for the widely used $GW100$ test set. A notable challenge for low-scaling $GW$ algorithms remains in achieving high precision for five molecules within the $GW100$ test set, namely O$_3$, BeO, MgO, BN, and CuCN, for which the deviations are in the range of several hundred meV at the $G_0W_0$ level. This is due to a spurious transfer of spectral weight from the quasiparticle to the satellite spectrum in $G_0W_0$ calculations, resulting in multi-pole features in the self-energy and spectral function, which low-scaling algorithms fail to describe. We show in this work that including eigenvalue self-consistency in the Green's function ($\text{ev}GW_0$) achieves a proper separation between satellite and quasiparticle peak, leading to a single solution of the quasiparticle equation with spectral weight close to one. $\text{ev}GW_0$ quasiparticles energies from low-scaling $GW$ closely align with reference calculations; the mean absolute error is only 12 meV for the five molecules. We thus demonstrate that low-scaling $GW$ with self-consistency in $G$ is well-suited for computing frontier quasiparticle energies.</description>
