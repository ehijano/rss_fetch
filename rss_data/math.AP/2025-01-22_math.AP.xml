      <title>Second-Order $\Gamma$-Limit for the Cahn-Hilliard Functional with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the asymptotic development of order 2 by the $\Gamma$ -convergence of the Cahn-Hilliard functional with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The Dirichlet data are assumed to be well separated from one of the two wells. In the case where there are no interfaces, it is shown that there is a transition layer near the boundary of the domain.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous six-wave kinetic equation in exponentially weighted $L^\infty$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six-wave interactions are used for modeling various physical systems, including in optical wave turbulence [16] (where a cascade of photons displays this kind of behavior) and in quantum wave turbulence [31] (for the interaction of Kelvin waves in superfluids). In this paper, we initiate the analysis of the Cauchy problem for the spatially inhomogeneous six-wave kinetic equation. More precisely, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of non-negative mild solutions to this equation in exponentially weighted $L^\infty_{xv}$ spaces. This is accompanied by an analysis of the long-time behavior of such solutions - we prove that the solutions scatter, that is, they converge to solutions of the transport equation in the limit as $t \to \pm \infty$. Compared with the study of four-wave kinetic equations, the main challenge we face is to address the increased complexity of the geometry of the six-wave interactions.</description>

      <title>Long-time behaviour of the correlated random walk system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the so-called correlated random walk system (also known as correlated motion or persistent motion system), used in biological modelling, among other fields, such as chromatography. This is a linear system which can also be seen as a weakly damped wave equation with certain boundary conditions. We are interested in the long-time behaviour of its solutions. To be precise, we will prove that the decay of the solutions to this problem is of exponential form, where the optimal decay rate exponent is given by the dominant eigenvalue of the corresponding operator. This eigenvalue can be obtained as a particular solution of a system of transcendental equations. A complete description of the spectrum of the operator is provided, together with a comprehensive analysis of the corresponding eigenfunctions and their geometry.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of 1-D evolution equations and their initial data from one passive measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study formally determined inverse problems with passive measurements for one dimensional evolution equations where the goal is to simultaneously determine both the initial data as well as the variable coefficients in such an equation from the measurement of its solution at a fixed spatial point for a certain amount of time. This can be considered as a one-dimensional model of widely open inverse problems in photo-acoustic and thermo-acoustic tomography. We provide global uniqueness results for wave and heat equations stated on bounded or unbounded spatial intervals. Contrary to all previous related results on the subject, we do not impose any genericity assumptions on the coefficients or initial data. Our proofs are based on creating suitable links to the well understood spectral theory for 1D Schr\"odinger operators. In particular, in the more challenging case of a bounded spatial domain, our proof for the inverse problem partly relies on the following two key ingredients, namely (i) Paley-Wiener type theorems due to Kahane \cite{Kahane1957SurLF} and Remling \cite{Remling2002SchrdingerOA} that together provide a quantifiable link between support of a compactly supported function and the upper density of its vanishing Schr\"odinger spectral modes and (ii) a result of Gesztesy and Simon \cite{Gesztesy1999InverseSA} on partial data inverse spectral problems for reconstructing an unknown potential in a 1D Schr\"odinger operator from the knowledge of only a fraction of its spectrum.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit of 3D fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the continuum limit theory of the fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in dimension 3. We show that the solution of discrete fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on hZ^3 will converge strongly in L^2 to the solution of fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on R^3, when h-&gt;0. The key is proving the uniform-in-h Strichartz estimate for discrete fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, by using the uniform estimate of oscillatory integral and Newton polyhedron techniques.</description>

      <title>Stable determination of the potential for the Helmholtz equation in the high frequency limit from boundary measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a triple logarithmic stability estimate of determining the potential in a Helmholtz equation from a partial Dirichlet-to-Neumann map in the high frequency limit. This estimate is proved under the assumption that the potential is known near the boundary of a domain when the dimension is greater than or equal to $3$. In addition, we show a triple logarithmic stability for an interior impedance problem.</description>

      <title>Ground States for the NLS on graphs with an attractive potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the subcritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on quantum graphs with an attractive potential supported in the compact core, and investigate the existence and the nonexistence of Ground States, defined as minimizers of the energy at fixed $L^2$-norm, or mass. We finally reach the following picture: for small and large mass there are Ground States. Moreover, according to the metric features of the compact core of the graph and to the strength of the potential, there may be a region of intermediate masses for which there are no Ground States. The study was originally inspired by the research on quantum waveguides, in which the curvature of a thin tube induces an effective attractive potential.</description>

      <title>Fractional semilinear damped wave equation on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the Cauchy problem for the semilinear damped wave equation for the fractional sub-Laplacian $(-\mathcal{L}_{\mathbb{H}})^{\alpha}$, $\alpha&gt;0$ on the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^{n}$ with power type non-linearity. With the presence of a positive damping term and nonnegative mass term, we derive $L^2-L^2$ decay estimates for the solution of the homogeneous linear fractional damped wave equation on $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, for its time derivative, and for its space derivatives. We also discuss how these estimates can be improved when we consider additional $L^1$-regularity for the Cauchy data in the absence of the mass term. Also, in the absence of mass term, we prove the global well-posedness for $2\leq p\leq 1+\frac{2\alpha}{(\mathcal{Q}-2\alpha)_{+}}$ $(\text{or }1+\frac{4\alpha}{\mathcal{Q}}&lt;p\leq 1+\frac{2\alpha}{(\mathcal{Q}-2\alpha)_{+}})$ in the case of $L^1\cap L^2$ $(\text{or } L^2)$ Cauchy data, respectively. However, in the presence of the mass term, the global (in time) well-posedness for small data holds for $1&lt;p \leq 1+ \frac{2\alpha}{(\mathcal{Q}-2\alpha)_{+}}$. Finally, as an application of the linear decay estimates, we investigate well-posedness for the Cauchy problem for a weakly coupled system with two semilinear fractional damped wave equations with positive mass term on $\mathbb{H}^{n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability threshold for the two-dimensional Couette flow in the whole plane. Our main result establishes that the asymptotic stability threshold is at most $\frac{1}{3}+$ for Sobolev perturbations with additional control over low horizontal frequencies, aligning with the threshold results in periodic domains. As a secondary outcome of our approach, we also prove the asymptotic stability for perturbations in weak Sobolev regularity with size $\nu^{\frac{1}{2}}$.</description>

      <title>Dispersive and Strichartz estimates for Dirac equation in a cosmic string spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the Dirac equation on the cosmic string background, which models a one--dimensional topological defect in the spacetime. We first define the Dirac operator in this setting, classifying all of its selfadjoint extensions, and we give an explicit kernel for the propagator. Secondly, we prove dispersive estimates for the flow, with and without weights. Finally, we prove Strichartz estimates for the flow in a sharp restricted set of indices, which are different from the classical Euclidean ones.</description>

      <title>Quasiconvex relaxation of planar Biot-type energies and the role of determinant constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the quasiconvex relaxation of the Biot-type energy density $\lVert\sqrt{\operatorname{D}\varphi^T \operatorname{D}\varphi}-I_2\rVert^2$ for planar mappings $\varphi\colon\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}^2$ in two different scenarios. First, we consider the case $\operatorname{D}\varphi\in\textrm{GL}^+(2)$, in which the energy can be expressed as the squared Euclidean distance $\operatorname{dist}^2(\operatorname{D}\varphi,\textrm{SO}(2))$ to the special orthogonal group $\textrm{SO}(2)$. We then allow for planar mappings with arbitrary $\operatorname{D}\varphi\in\mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}$; in the context of solid mechanics, this lack of determinant constraints on the deformation gradient would allow for self-interpenetration of matter. We demonstrate that the two resulting relaxations do not coincide and compare the analytical findings to numerical results for different relaxation approaches, including a rank-one sequential lamination algorithm, trust-region FEM calculations of representative microstructures and physics-informed neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation (BBM) is introduced as a regularization of the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) for long water waves \cite{BBM1972}. In this paper, we establish the convergence from the BBM to the KdV for energy class solutions. As a consequence, employing the conservation laws, we extend the known temporal interval of validity for the BBM regularization.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the quantitative weak unique continuation property (QWUCP) for a class of high-dimensional elliptic equations with interior point degeneracy. First, we establish well-posedness results in weighted function spaces. Then, using an innovative approximation method, we derive the three-ball theorem at the degenerate point. Finally, we apply the three-ball theorem to prove QWUCP for two different cases.</description>

      <title>Density results of biharmonic functions on symmetric tensor fields and their applications to inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we discuss density of products of biharmonic functions vanishing on an arbitrarily small part of the boundary. We prove that one can use three or more such biharmonic functions to construct a dense subset of smooth symmetric tensor fields up to order three, in a bounded domain. Furthermore, as an application of the density results, in dimension two or higher, we solve a partial data inverse problem for a biharmonic operator with nonlinear anisotropic third and lower order perturbations. For the inverse problem, we take the Dirichlet data to be supported in an arbitrarily small open set of the boundary and measure the Neumann data on the same set. Note that the analogous problem for linear perturbations are still unknown. So far, partial data problems recovering nonlinear perturbations were studied only up to vector fields. The full data analogues of the inverse problem has recently been studied for three or higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove a bifurcation and multiplicity result for a critical problem involving a degenerate nonlinear operator $\Delta_\gamma^p$. We extend to a generic $p&gt;1$ a result which was proved only when $p=2$. When $p\neq 2$, the nonlinear operator $-\Delta_\gamma^p$ has no linear eigenspaces, so our extension is nontrivial and requires an abstract critical theorem which is not based on linear subspaces. We also prove a new abstract result based on a pseudo-index related to the $\mathbf{Z}_2$-cohomological index that is applicable here. We provide a version of the Lions' Concentration-Compactness Principle for our operator.</description>

      <title>Inverse Stefan problems of determining the time-dependent source coefficient and heat flux function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the Inverse Stefan problem, specifically focusing on determining the time-dependent source coefficient in the parabolic heat equation governing heat transfer in a semi-infinite rod. The problem entails the intricate task of uncovering both temperature- and time-dependent coefficients of the source while accommodating Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Through a comprehensive mathematical model and rigorous theoretical analysis, our study aims to provide a robust methodology for accurately determining the source coefficient from observed temperature and heat flux data in problems with different cases of the source functions. Importantly, we establish the existence and uniqueness, and estimate the continuous dependence of a weak solution upon the given data for some inverse problems, offering a foundational understanding of its solvability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Schilder-type large deviation principle for sticky-reflected Brownian motion with boundary diffusion, both at the static and sample path level in the short-time limit. A sharp transition for the rate function occurs, depending on whether the tangential boundary diffusion is faster or slower than in the interior of the domain. The resulting intrinsic distance naturally gives rise to a novel optimal transport model, where motion and kinetic energy are treated differently in the interior and along the boundary.</description>

      <title>On the hierarchy of plate models for a singularly perturbed multi-well nonlinear elastic energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the celebrated work of Friesecke, James and M\"uller '06 the authors derive a hierarchy of models for plates by carefully analyzing the $\Gamma$-convergence of the rescaled nonlinear elastic energy. The key ingredient of their proofs is the rigidity estimate proved in an earlier work of theirs. Here we consider the case in which the elastic energy has a multi-well structure: this type of functional arises, for example, in the study of solid-solid phase transitions. Since the rigidity estimate fails in the case of compatible wells, we follow Alicandro, Dal Maso, Lazzaroni and Palombaro '18 and add a regularization term to the energy that penalizes jumps from one well to another, leading to good compactness properties. In this setting we recover the full hierarchy of plate models with an explicit dependence on the wells. Finally, we study the convergence of energy minimizers with suitable external forces and full Neumann boundary conditions. To do so, we adapt the definition of optimal rotations introduced by Maor, Mora '21.</description>

      <title>Global Exponential Stabilization for a Simplified Fluid-Particle Interaction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers a system coupling a viscous Burgers equation (aimed to describe a simplified model of $1D$ fluid flow) with the ODE describing the motion of a point mass moving inside the fluid. The point mass is possibly under the action of a feedback control. Our main contributions are that we prove two global exponential stability results. More precisely, we first show that the velocity field corresponding to the free dynamics case is globally exponentially stable. We next show that, in the presence of the feedback control both the velocity field and the distance from the mass point to a prescribed target position decay exponentially. The proofs of these results heavily rely on the use of a special test function allowing both to prove that the mass point stays away from the boundary and to construct a perturbed Lyapunov function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the unconditional well-posedness for the fourth order nonlinear Schrodinger type equations in H^s(\mathbb{T}) when s \geq 1, which include non-integrable case. It is optimal in the sense that the nonlinear terms cannot be defined in the space-time distribution framework for s &lt;1. The main idea is to employ the normal form reduction and a kind of a cancellation property to deal with derivative losses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical study of the 2D Amick-Schonbek Boussinesq system is presented. Numerical evidence is given for the transverse stability of the 1D solitary waves that are line solitary waves of the 2D equations. It is shown that initial data not satisfying the non-cavitation condition can lead to the formation of a gradient catastrophe in finite time. The numerical propagation of localised smooth initial data does not lead to the formation of stable structures localised in both spatial directions. For initial data satisfying the non-cavitation condition, smooth solutions appear to exist for all times.</description>

      <title>Regularity and Uniqueness for a Model of Active Particles with Angle-Averaged Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity and uniqueness of weak solutions of a degenerate parabolic equation, arising as the limit of a stochastic lattice model of self-propelled particles. The angle-average of the solution appears as a coefficient in the diffusive and drift terms, making the equation nonlocal. We prove that, under unrestrictive non-degeneracy assumptions on the initial data, weak solutions are smooth for positive times. Our method rests on deriving a drift-diffusion equation for a particular function of the angle-averaged density and applying De Giorgi's method to show that the original equation is uniformly parabolic for positive times. We employ a Galerkin approximation to justify rigorously the passage from divergence to non-divergence form of the equation, which yields improved estimates by exploiting a cancellation. By imposing stronger constraints on the initial data, we prove the uniqueness of the weak solution, which relies on Duhamel's principle and gradient estimates for the periodic heat kernel to derive $L^\infty$ estimates for the angle-averaged density.</description>

Abstract: In this work, our interest lies in proving the existence of solutions to the following Fractional Lane-Emden Hamiltonian system: $$ \begin{cases} (-\Delta)^s u = H_v(x,u,v) &amp; \text{in }\Omega,\\ (-\Delta)^s v = H_u(x,u,v) &amp; \text{in }\Omega,\\ u=v=0 &amp; \text{in } \R^n\setminus\Omega. \end{cases} $$ The method, that can be traced back to the work of De Figueiredo and Felmer \cite{DF-F}, is flexible enough to deal with more general nonlocal operators and make use of a combination of fractional order Sobolev spaces together with functional calculus for self-adjoint operators.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Harmonic Maps on the Unit Ball with Tangential Anchoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the seminal work of Schoen-Uhlenbeck, many authors have studied properties of harmonic maps satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions. In this article, we instead investigate regularity and symmetry of $\mathbb{S}^2-$valued minimizing harmonic maps subject to a tangency constraint in the model case of the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. In particular, we obtain a monotonicity formula respecting tangentiality on a curved boundary in order to show optimal regularity up to the boundary. We introduce novel sufficient conditions under which the minimizer must exhibit symmetries. Under a symmetry assumption, we present a delineation of the singularities of minimizers, namely that a mimimizer has exactly two point singularities, located on the boundary at opposite points.</description>

      <title>A quantitative study of radial symmetry for solutions to semilinear equations in $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A celebrated result by Gidas, Ni &amp; Nirenberg asserts that positive classical solutions, decaying at infinity, to semilinear equations $\Delta u +f(u)=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ must be radial and radially decreasing. In this paper, we consider both energy solutions in $\mathcal{D}^{1,2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and non-energy local weak solutions to small perturbations of these equations, and study its quantitative stability counterpart.
  To the best of our knowledge, the present work provides the first quantitative stability result for non-energy solutions to semilinear equations involving the Laplacian, even for the critical nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and infinite-speed propagation of solutions to models arising in porous media, when the mobility is highly degenerate (inverse power law). The approach is based on maximum principles for the fractional Laplacian, and allows to derive lower bounds on solutions in a straightforward manner. Finally, in the case of clogged porous media, where the mobility vanishes at points of unbounded density, solutions that become instantaneously bounded are constructed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the discrete fourth-order Schr\"{o}dinger equation on the lattice $h\mathbb{Z}^2$. Uniform Strichartz estimates are established by analyzing frequency localized oscillatory integrals with the method of stationary phase and applying Littlewood-Paley inequalities. As an application, we obtain the precise rate of $L^2$ convergence from the solutions of discrete semilinear equations to those of the corresponding equations on the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ in the contimuum limit $h \rightarrow 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the following Kirchhoff-type biharmonic equation \begin{equation}\label{pr} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \Delta^2 u+ \left(a+b\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|\nabla u|^2d x\right)(-\Delta u+V(x)u)=f(x,u),\quad x\in \mathbb{R}^N,\\ u\in H^{2}(\mathbb{R}^N), \end{array} \right. \end{equation} where $a&gt;0$, $b\geq 0$ and $V(x)$ and $f(x, u)$ are periodic or asymptotically periodic in $x$. We study the existence of Nehari-type ground state solutions of \eqref{pr} with $f(x,u)u-4F(x,u)$ sign-changing, where $F(x,u):=\int_0^uf(x,s)d s$. We significantly extend some results from the previous literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop regularity theory for degenerate elliptic equations with the degeneracy controlled by a weight. More precisely, we show local boundedness and continuity of weak solutions under the assumption of a weighted Orlicz-Sobolev and Poincar\'{e} inequalities. The proof relies on a modified DeGiorgi iteration scheme, developed in arXiv:1608.01630 and arXiv:1703.00774. The Orlicz-Sobolev inequality we assume here is much weaker than the classical $(2\sigma,2)$ Sobolev inequality with $\sigma&gt;1$ which is typically used in the DeGiorgi or Moser iteration.</description>

      <title>Balanced Dynamics in Strongly Coupled Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the modeling of a variety of models of large-scale systems of interacting agents, mathematical models consider that the coupling terms representing the interactions between agents are scaled according to the network size to prevent divergence of the coupling terms. In a previous paper of ours and follow-ups from colleagues, we have explored the behavior of a large-scale system of interacting agents with diffusive coupling. It was shown that the system converges to a Dirac mass, that is free to evolve according to the intrinsic dynamics. We generalize these results to more general coupling functions, and show that, under specific conditions, the divergence of the coupling term does not preclude the well-posedness of limit equations. Instead, the system carries solutions associated to a balanced, so that the net input where leading order, vanishes. We also explore convergence to the balanced state. Such balanced regimes were widely observed in neuroscience and associated with complex regulatory mechanisms. This results offer an alternative, minimalistic perspective on the balance of excitation/inhibition in the brain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) offer a versatile framework for modeling large-scale interactive systems across multiple domains. This paper builds upon a previous work, by developing a state-of-the-art unified approach to decode or design the unknown stationary state of MFGs, in addition to the underlying parameter functions governing their behavior. This result is novel, even in the general realm of inverse problems for nonlinear PDEs. By enabling agents to distill crucial insights from observed data and unveil intricate hidden structures and unknown states within MFG systems, our approach surmounts a significant obstacle, enhancing the applicability of MFGs in real-world scenarios. This advancement not only enriches our understanding of MFG dynamics but also broadens the scope for their practical deployment in various contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the nonlocal quasilinear fractional $p$-Laplace operator $(-\Delta)^s_p$ with $s\in (0,1)$ and $p\in(1,\infty)$, we investigate the nonexistence and existence of nontrivial nonnegative solutions $u$ in the local fractional Sobolev space $W_{\rm loc}^{s,p}(\mathbb R^n)$ that satisfies the inequality $(-\Delta)^s_p u\ge u^q$ weakly in $\mathbb R^n$, where $q\in(0,\infty)$. In addition, nonexistence of nontrivial nonnegative weak solutions in the global fractional Sobolev space $W^{s,p}(\mathbb R^n)$ to the fractional $p$-Laplace equation $(-\Delta)^s_p u= u^q$ are also investigated. The approach taken in this paper is mainly based on some delicate analysis of the fundamental solutions to the fractional $p$-Laplace operator $(-\Delta)^s_p$.</description>

      <title>An inverse problem in cell dynamics: Recovering an initial distribution of telomere lengths from measurements of senescence times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Telomeres are repetitive sequences situated at both ends of the chromosomes of eukaryotic cells. At each cell division, they are eroded until they reach a critical length that triggers a state in which the cell stops to divide: the senescent state. In this work, we are interested in the link between the initial distribution of telomere lengths and the distribution of senescence times. We propose a method to retrieve the initial distribution of telomere lengths, using only measurements of senescence times. Our approach relies on approximating our models with transport equations, which provide natural estimators for the initial telomere lengths distribution. We investigate this method from a theoretical point of view by providing bounds on the errors of our estimators, pointwise and in all Lebesgue spaces. We also illustrate it with estimations on simulations, and discuss its limitations related to the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the periodic homogenization for convex Hamilton-Jacobi equations on perforated domains under the Neumann type boundary conditions. We consider two types of conditions, the oblique derivative boundary condition and the prescribed contact angle boundary condition, which is important in the front propagation. We first establish the representation formula by using the Skorokhod problem and modified Lagrangians. We then obtain the optimal rate of convergence $O(\varepsilon)$ for homogenization by developing techniques in \cite{TY, HJMT} to apply to the Neumann type problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of periodic waves for the perturbed generalized defocusing mKdV equation using the theory of geometric singular perturbation. By Abelian integral and involution operation, we prove that the limit wave speed c_0(h) is monotonic with respect to energy h,and the lower bound of the limit wave speed is found. These works extend the main result of Chen et al. (2018) to the generalized case. Some numerical simulations are conducted to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>An analysis of the entire functions associated with the operator of the KdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the controllability property of partial differential equations (PDEs) is closely linked to the proof of an observability inequality for the adjoint system, which, sometimes, involves analyzing a spectral problem associated with the PDE under consideration. In this work, we study a series of spectral issues that ensure the controllability of the renowned Korteweg-de Vries equation on star-graph. This investigation reduces to determining when certain functions, associated with this spectral problem, are entire. The novelty here lies in presenting this detailed analysis in the context of a star graph structure.</description>

      <title>Existence and regularity in the fully nonlinear one-phase free boundary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider viscosity solution to one-phase free boundary problems for general fully nonlinear operators and free boundary condition depending on the normal vector. We show existence of viscosity solutions via the Perron's method and we prove $C^{2,\alpha}$ regularity of flat free boundaries via a quadratic improvement of flatness. Finally, we obtain the higher regularity of the free boundary via an hodograph transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the three-dimensional quasilinear wave equations under the null condition, a basic model in the study of nonlinear wave-type equations, which was first studied in the seminal works of Christodoulou \cite{Christodoulou86} and Klainerman \cite{Klainerman86}. The main goal of this paper is to show that the lower-order conformal energy for the solution to this model is uniformly bounded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The `lake equation' on a planar domain $D$ with bathymetry $b(x,y)$ is given by $ \partial_t u + (u \cdot {\rm grad}) u= -{\rm grad}\, p \,, \,\,{\rm div} (b u) = 0 \,,\, \text{with}\,\, u \parallel \partial D.$ % \, \,\, \,\,\, \text{),}$$ We focus on Geometric Mechanics aspects, glossing over hard analysis issues. % related to the desingularization. Motivating example is a `rip current' produced by vortex pairs near a beach shore. For uniform slope beach there is a perfect analogy with \ Thomson's vortex rings. The stream function produced by a vortex is defined as the Green function of the operator $- {\rm div} ( {\rm grad} \psi/b)$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions. As in elasticity, the lake equations give rise to pseudoanalytical functions and quasiconformal mappings. Uniformly elliptic equations on closed Riemann surfaces could be called `planet equations'.</description>

      <title>On photonic band gaps in two-dimensional photonic crystal fibres. Analysis in the vicinity of the low-dielectric light line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider `off-axis' electromagnetic wave propagation down the homogeneous direction of a low-loss two-dimensional periodic dielectric (or photonic crystal fibre) near the light line of the low-dielectric material constituent. Numerous physical and numerical experiments demonstrate the presence of photonic band gaps in the vicinity of this `critical' light line. We mathematically analyse the existence of photonic band gaps near the line and characterise them in terms of frequency gaps in the spectrum of the Maxwell equations restricted to the line. We apply the results to both one-dimensional photonic crystal fibres, and a genuinely two-dimensional photonic crystal fibres with `thin' inclusions, namely ``ARROW'' fibres. In the case of ARROW fibres, by an asymptotic analysis, in terms of the small inclusion parameter, we demonstrate the existence of low frequency photonic band gaps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an alternative construction of the quasi-Fuchsian flows introduced by Ghys in \cite{Ghys-92}. Our approach is based on the coupled vortex equations that allows to see these flows as thermostats on the unit tangent bundle of the Blaschke metric uniquely determined by a conformal class and a holomorphic quadratic differential. We also give formulas for the marked length spectrum of a quasi-Fuchsian flow.</description>

      <title>On the characterization of the Dirichlet and Fucik spectra for the one-dimensional asymmetric p-Laplace operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10599v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the Dirichlet spectrum $\Lambda^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ of the asymmetric $p$-Laplace operator $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on an interval $(0,L)$ where
  \[ \Delta^{a,b}_p u:= \left(a^{p}[(u')^{+}]^{p-1}-b^{p}[(u')^{-}]^{p-1}\right)'. \] We characterize completely the set $\Lambda^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ and the respective eigenfunctions in terms of the corresponding ones for the classical one-dimensional $p$-Laplace operator and establish that only the eigenfunctions associated to the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on $(0,L)$ have definite sign and, furthermore, its eigenspace is formed precisely by two non-collinear half-lines in $C^1[0,L]$ if and only if $a \neq b$. Our approach also allows to characterize the Fu\v c\'ik spectrum $\Sigma^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ of $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on $(0,L)$ from a disjoint enumerate union of hyperboles closely related to the classical counterpart and corresponding solutions. All results are novelty even for $p = 2$.</description>

      <title>A Littlewood-Paley approach to the Mittag-Leffler function in the frequency space and applications to nonlocal problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$, $\beta&gt;0$ and $\alpha/2&lt;|s|\leq 1$. In a previous work, we obtained all possible values of the Lebesgue exponent $p=p(\gamma)$ for which the Fourier transform of $ E_{\alpha,\beta}(e^{\dot{\imath}\pi s} |\cdot|^{\gamma} )$ is an $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ function, when $\gamma&gt;(d-1)/2$. We recover the more interesting lower regularity case $0&lt;\gamma\leq (d-1)/2$, using tools from the Littlewood-Paley theory. This question arises in the analysis of certain space-time fractional diffusion and Schr\"{o}dinger problems and has been solved for the particular cases $\alpha\in (0,1)$, $\beta=\alpha,1$, and $s=-1/2,1$ via asymptotic analysis of Fox $H$-functions. The Littlewood-Paley theory provides a simpler proof that allows considering all values of $\beta,\gamma&gt;0$ and $s\in (-1,1]\setminus [-\alpha/2,\alpha/2]$. This enabled us to prove various key estimates for a general class of nonlocal space-time problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish maximal function estimates, Lebesgue differentiation theory, Calder\'on-Zygmund decompositions, and John-Nirenberg inequalities for translation invariant Hausdorff contents. We further identify a key structural component of these results -- a packing condition satisfied by these Hausdorff contents which compensates for the non-linearity of the capacitary integrals. We prove that for any outer capacity, this packing condition is satisfied if and only if the capacity is equivalent to its induced Hausdorff content. Finally, we use this equivalence to extend the preceding theory to general outer capacities which are assumed to satisfy this packing condition.</description>

      <title>A trajectorial approach to the gradient flow of McKean-Vlasov SDEs with mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the gradient flow representation of diffusion with mobility $b$ with respect to the modified Wasserstein quasi-metric $W_h$, where $h(r)=rb(r)$. The appropriate selection of the free energy functional depends on the specific form of the generalized entropy. Different from the JKO scheme, we derive the trajectorial version of the relative entropy dissipation identity for the McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation (SDE) with Nemytskii-type coefficients, utilizing techniques from stochastic analysis. Based on this, we demonstrate that the trajectorial average of the solution process to the McKean-Vlasov SDE, with respect to the underlying measure, corresponds to the rate of dissipation of the free energy. As an application, we present the energy dissipation of the Fermi-Dirac-Fokker-Planck equation, a model widely used in physics and biology to describe saturation effects. Inspired by numerical simulations, we propose two questions on condensation phenomena and non-exponential convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for Quasiconvex and Relaxed Variational Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish that discontinuous Galerkin methods are capable of producing reliable approximations for a broad class of nonlinear variational problems. In particular, we demonstrate that these schemes provide essential flexibility by removing inter-element continuity while also guaranteeing convergent approximations in the quasiconvex case. Notably, quasiconvexity is the weakest form of convexity pertinent to elasticity. Furthermore, we show that in the non-convex case discrete minimisers converge to minimisers of the relaxed problem. In this case, the minimisation problem corresponds to the energy defined by the quasiconvex envelope of the original energy. Our approach covers all discontinuous Galerkin formulations known to converge for convex energies. This work addresses an open challenge in the vectorial calculus of variations: developing and rigorously justifying numerical schemes capable of reliably approximating nonlinear energy minimization problems with potentially singular solutions, which are frequently encountered in materials science.</description>

      <title>Efficient PINNs: Multi-Head Unimodular Regularization of the Solutions Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning framework to facilitate the solution of nonlinear multiscale differential equations and, especially, inverse problems using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This framework is based on what is called multihead (MH) training, which involves training the network to learn a general space of all solutions for a given set of equations with certain variability, rather than learning a specific solution of the system. This setup is used with a second novel technique that we call Unimodular Regularization (UR) of the latent space of solutions. We show that the multihead approach, combined with the regularization, significantly improves the efficiency of PINNs by facilitating the transfer learning process thereby enabling the finding of solutions for nonlinear, coupled, and multiscale differential equations.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the robustness of optimally controlled evolution equations with respect to spatially localized perturbations. We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. Finally, we extend our result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a smooth, bounded domain in $\mathbb R^3$ with connected boundary. It follows from work of Escobar that the Yamabe quotient of $\Omega$ is at most the Yamabe quotient of a ball, and equality holds if and only if $\Omega$ is a ball. We show that if equality almost holds then the following things are true:
  (i)$\Omega$ is diffeomorphic to a ball;
  (ii) There is a small number $\epsilon &gt; 0$ such that $B(x,r) \subset \Omega \subset B(x,r(1+\epsilon))$; (iii) After suitable scaling, $\Omega$ is Gromov-Hausdorff close to the unit ball when considered as a metric space with its induced length metric.
  We also give a qualitative comparison between $Q$ and the coefficient of quasi-conformality studied in the theory of quasi-conformal maps.</description>

Abstract: This paper establishes the $L^p$ boundedness of wave operators for linear Schr\"odinger equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with time-dependent potentials. The approach to the proof is based on new cancellation lemmas. As a typical application based on this method, combined with Strichartz estimates is the existence and scattering for nonlinear dispersive equations. For example, we prove global existence and uniform boundedness in $L^{\infty}$, for a class of Hartree nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^3),$ allowing the presence of solitons. We also prove the existence of free channel wave operators in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for $p&gt;p_c(n)$, with $p_c(3)=6$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.03650v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically study the large-time asymptotics of the solution of the defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation under a symmetric non-vanishing background, which supports the emergence of solitons. It is demonstrated that the asymptotic expansion of the solution at the large time could verify the renowned soliton resolution conjecture. Moreover, the asymptotic stability of $N$-soliton solution is also exhibited in the present work. We establish our results by performing a $\bar{\partial}$-nonlinear steepest descent analysis to the associated Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two systems of two conservation laws that are defined on complementary, one-dimensional spatial intervals and coupled by an interface as a single port-Hamiltonian system. In case of a fixed interface position, we characterize the boundary and interface conditions for which the associated port-Hamiltonian operator generates a contraction semigroup. Furthermore, we present sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of the generated $C_0$-semigroup. The results are illustrated by the example of two acoustic waveguides coupled by a membrane interface.</description>

      <title>Spreading properties in Kermack-McKendrick models with nonlocal spatial interactions -- A new look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the famous Kermack-McKendrick model with nonlocal spatial interactions by shedding new lights on associated spreading properties and we also prove the existence and uniqueness of traveling fronts. Unlike previous studies that have focused on integrated versions of the model for susceptible population, we analyze the long time dynamics of the underlying age-structured model for the cumulative density of infected individuals and derive  precise asymptotic behavior for the infected population. Our approach consists in studying the long time dynamics of an associated  transport equation with nonlocal spatial interactions whose spreading properties are close to those of classical Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion equations. Our study is self-contained and relies on comparison  arguments.</description>

      <title>Variational integrals on Hessian spaces: partial regularity for critical points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop regularity theory for critical points of variational integrals defined on Hessian spaces of functions on open, bounded subdomains of $\mathbb{R}^n$, under compactly supported variations. The critical point solves a fourth order nonlinear equation in double divergence form. We show that for smooth convex functionals, a $W^{2,\infty}$ critical point with bounded Hessian is smooth provided that its Hessian has a small bounded mean oscillation (BMO). We deduce that the interior singular set of a critical point has Hausdorff dimension at most $n-p_0$, for some $p_0 \in (2,3)$. We state some applications of our results to variational problems in Lagrangian geometry. Finally, we use the Hamiltonian stationary equation to demonstrate the importance of our assumption on the a priori regularity of the critical point.</description>

      <title>Quantitative multiscale operator-type approximations for asymptotically degenerating spectral problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an abstract family of asymptotically degenerating variational problems. Those are natural generalisations of families of problems emerging upon application of a rescaled Floquet-Bloch-Gelfand transform to resolvent problems for high-contrast elliptic PDEs with highly oscillatory periodic coefficients. An asymptotic analysis of these models leads us to a hierarchy of approximation results with uniform operator-type error estimates under various assumptions, satisfied by specific examples. We provide approximations for the resolvents in terms of a certain `bivariate' operator which appears an abstract generalisation of the two-scale limit operators for highly oscillatory high-contrast PDEs. The resulting approximating self-adjoint operator, providing tight operator error estimates, is the bivariate operator sandwiched by a connecting operator which for a broad class of periodic problems specialises to a new two-scale version of the classical Whittaker-Shannon interpolation. An explicit description of the limit spectrum in the abstract setting is provided, and new tight error estimates on the distance between the original and limit spectra are established. Our generic approach allows us to readily consider a wide class of asymptotically degenerating problems including but also going beyond high-contrast highly oscillatory PDEs. The obtained results are illustrated by various examples.</description>

Abstract: We develop a qualitative homogenisation and spectral theory for elliptic systems of partial differential equations in divergence form with highly contrasting (i.e., non uniformly elliptic) random coefficients. The focus of the paper is on the behaviour of the spectrum as the heterogeneity parameter tends to zero; in particular, we show that in general one doesn't have Hausdorff convergence of spectra. The theoretical analysis is complemented by several explicit examples, showcasing the wider range of applications and physical effects of systems with random coefficients, when compared with systems with periodic coefficients or with scalar operators (both random and periodic).</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Time-Frequency Representations and Generalized Spectrogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To overcome the impossibility of representing the energy of a signal simultaneously in time and frequency, many time-frequency representations have been introduced in the literature. Some of these are recalled in the Introduction. In this work we propose a unified approach of the previous theory by means of metaplectic Wigner distributions $W_{\mathcal{A}}$, with $\mathcal{A}$ symplectic matrix in $Sp(2d,\mathbb{R})$, which were introduced by Cordero, Rodino (2022) and then widely studied in subsequent papers. Namely, the short-time Fourier transform and the most popular members of the Cohen's class can be represented via metaplectic Wigner distributions. In particular, we introduce $\mathcal{A}$-metaplectic spectrograms which contain the classical ones and their variations arising from the $\tau$-Wigner distributions of Boggiatto, De Donno, and Oliaro (2010). We provide a complete characterization of those $\mathcal{A}$-Wigner distributions which give rise to generalized spectrograms. This characterization is related to the block decomposition of the symplectic matrix $\mathcal{A}$. Moreover, a characterization of the $L^p$-boundedness of both $\mathcal{A}$-Wigner distributions and related metaplectic pseudodifferential operators is provided.</description>

      <title>A rigorous integrator and global existence for higher-dimensional semilinear parabolic PDEs via semigroup theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a general constructive method to compute solutions of initial value problems of semilinear parabolic partial differential equations on hyper-rectangular domains via semigroup theory and computer-assisted proofs. Once a numerical candidate for the solution is obtained via a finite dimensional projection, Chebyshev series expansions are used to solve the linearized equations about the approximation from which a solution map operator is constructed. Using the solution operator (which exists from semigroup theory), we define an infinite dimensional contraction operator whose unique fixed point together with its rigorous bounds provide the local inclusion of the solution. Applying this technique for multiple time steps leads to constructive proofs of existence of solutions over long time intervals. As applications, we study the 3D/2D Swift-Hohenberg, where we combine our method with explicit constructions of trapping regions to prove global existence of solutions of initial value problems converging asymptotically to nontrivial equilibria. A second application consists of the 2D Ohta-Kawasaki equation, providing a framework for handling derivatives in nonlinear terms.</description>

Abstract: We study the measure-valued death state and local sensitivity analysis of the Winfree model and its mean-field counterpart with uncertain high-order couplings. The Winfree model is the first mathematical model for synchronization, and it can cast as the effective approximation of the pulse-coupled model for synchronization, and it exhibits diverse asymptotic patterns depending on system parameters and initial data. For the proposed models, we present several frameworks leading to oscillator death in terms of system parameters and initial data, and the propagation of regularity in random space. We also present several numerical tests and compare them with analytical results.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Finsler $N$-Laplacian Liouville equation in convex cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the anisotropic Finsler $N$-Laplacian Liouville equation \[-\Delta ^{H}_{N}u=e^u \qquad {\rm{in}}\,\, \mathcal{C},\] where $N\geq2$, $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is an open convex cone including $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, the half space $\mathbb{R}^{N}_{+}$ and $\frac{1}{2^{m}}$-space $\mathbb{R}^{N}_{2^{-m}}:=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{N}\mid x_{1},\cdots,x_{m}&gt;0\}$ ($m=1,\cdots,N$), and the anisotropic Finsler $N$-Laplacian $\Delta ^{H}_{N}$ is induced by a positively homogeneous function $H(x)$ of degree $1$. All solutions to the Finsler $N$-Laplacian Liouville equation with finite mass are completely classified. In particular, if $H(\xi)=|\xi|$, then the Finsler $N$-Laplacian $\Delta ^{H}_{N}$ reduces to the regular $N$-Laplacian $\Delta_N$. Our result is a counterpart in the limiting case $p=N$ of the classification results in \cite{CFR} for the critical anisotropic $p$-Laplacian equations with $1&lt;p&lt;N$ in convex cones, and also extends the classification results in \cite{CK,CL,CW,CL2,E} for Liouville equation in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ to general convex cones. In our proof, besides exploiting the anisotropic isoperimetric inequality inside convex cones, we have also proved and applied the radial Poincar\'{e} type inequality (Lemma \ref{A1}), which are key ingredients in the proof and of their own importance and interests.</description>

      <title>Front propagation in hybrid reaction-diffusion epidemic models with spatial heterogeneity. Part I: Spreading speed and asymptotic behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-species reaction-diffusion system in one space dimension that is derived from an epidemiological model in a spatially periodic environment with two types of pathogens: the wild type and the mutant. The system is of a hybrid nature, partly cooperative and partly competitive, but neither of these entirely. As a result, the comparison principle does not hold for the whole system. We study spreading properties of solution fronts when the infection is localized initially. We show that there is a well-defined spreading speed both in the right and left directions and that it can be computed from the linearized equation at the leading edge of the propagation front. Next we study the case where the coefficients are spatially homogeneous and show that, when spreading occurs, every solution to the Cauchy problem converges to the unique positive stationary solution as $t\to\infty$. Finally we consider the case of rapidly oscillating coefficients, that is, when the spatial period of the coefficients, denoted by $\varepsilon$, is very small. We show that there exists a unique positive stationary solution, and that every positive solution to the Cauchy problem converges to this stationary solution as $t\to\infty$. We then discuss the homogenization limit as $\varepsilon\to 0$.</description>

      <title>Analysis of linear elliptic equations with general drifts and $L^1$-zero-order terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a detailed analysis of the Dirichlet boundary value problem for linear elliptic equations in divergence form with $L^p$-general drifts, where $p \in (d, \infty)$, and non-negative $L^1$-zero-order terms. Specifically, by transforming the general drifts into weak divergence-free drifts, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a bounded weak solution, showing that the zero-order term does not influence the quantity of the unique weak solution. Additionally, by imposing the $ VMO$ condition and mild differentiability on the diffusion coefficients and assuming an $L^s$-zero-order terms with $s \in (1, \infty)$, we demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution for the corresponding non-divergence type equations. An important feature of this paper is that, due to the weak divergence-free property of the drifts in the transformed equations, the constants appearing in our estimates can be explicitly calculated, which is expected to offer significant applications in error analysis.</description>

Abstract: We consider nonstationary Stokes equations in nondivergence form with variable viscosity coefficients and generalized Navier slip boundary conditions with slip tensor $\mathcal{A}$ in a domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$. First, under the assumption that slip matrix $\mathcal{A}$ is sufficiently smooth, we establish a priori local regularity estimates for solutions near a curved portion of the domain boundary. Second, when $\mathcal{A}$ is the shape operator, we derive local boundary estimates for the Hessians of the solutions, where the right-hand side does not involve the pressure. Notably, our results are new even if the viscosity coefficients are constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the inverse shape problem of recovering an unknown clamped cavity embedded in a thin infinite plate. The model problem is assumed to be governed by the two-dimensional biharmonic wave equation in the frequency domain. Based on the far-field data, a resolution analysis is conducted for cavity recovery via the direct sampling method. The Funk--Hecke integral identity is employed to analyze the performance of two imaging functions. Our analysis demonstrates that the same imaging functions commonly used for acoustic inverse shape problems are applicable to the biharmonic wave context. This work presents the first extension of direct sampling methods to biharmonic waves using far-field data. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of these imaging functions in recovering a clamped cavity.</description>

      <title>Stability of a Riemann Shock in a Physical Class: From Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier to Euler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of an irreversible singularity, such as a Riemann shock solution to the full Euler system, in the absence of any technical conditions for perturbations, remains a major open problem even within a mono-dimensional framework. A natural approach to justify the stability of such a singularity involves considering a class of vanishing physical dissipation limits (or viscosity limits) of physical viscous flows with evanescent viscosities. We prove the existence of vanishing physical dissipation limits, on which a Riemann shock of small jump strength is stable (up to a time-dependent shift) and unique. Therefore, a Riemann weak shock is rigid (not turbulent) under physical disturbances. As a physical viscous model that generates vanishing dissipation limits, we adopt the Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, proposed by Brenner based on the bi-velocity theory. For this viscous system, we show the uniform stability of shock with respect to the strength of the viscosity. The uniformity is ensured by the contraction estimates of any large perturbations around the shock. Since we cannot impose any smallness on initial perturbations for the contraction estimates, the density could be arbitrarily small or large. Controlling such large perturbations is the most challenging part in our analysis. The contraction estimates ensure the existence of vanishing physical dissipation limits of solutions to the Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system. In addition, the distance of those limits from the Riemann shock, up to shifts, is controlled by the magnitude of the initial perturbations. The distance is measured by the relative entropy with a weight depending on the shock. This is the first result for the (unconditional) stability of Riemann shock solution to the full Euler system in a class of vanishing physical dissipation limits.</description>

      <title>Regularity results for a class of mixed local and nonlocal singular problems involving distance function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the following mixed local and nonlocal quasilinear equation with singularity given by \begin{eqnarray*} \begin{split} -\Delta_pu+(-\Delta)_q^s u&amp;=\frac{f(x)}{u^{\delta}}\text { in } \Omega, \\u&amp;&gt;0 \text{ in } \Omega,\\u&amp;=0 \text { in }\mathbb{R}^n \backslash \Omega; \end{split} \end{eqnarray*} where, \begin{equation*} (-\Delta )_q^s u(x):= c_{n,s}\operatorname{P.V.}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^{q-2}(u(x)-u(y))}{|x-y|^{n+sq}} d y, \end{equation*} with $\Omega$ being a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $C^2$ boundary, $1&lt;q\leq p&lt;\infty$, $s\in(0,1)$, $\delta&gt;0$ and $f\in L^\infty_{\mathrm{loc}}(\Omega)$ is a non-negative function which behaves like $\mathbf{dist(x,\partial \Omega)^{-\beta}}$, $\beta\geq 0$ near $\partial \Omega$. We start by proving several H\"older and gradient H\"older regularity results for a more general class of quasilinear operators when $\delta=0$. Using the regularity results we deduce existence, uniqueness and H\"older regularity of a weak solution of the singular problem in $W_{\mathrm{loc}}^{1,p}(\Omega)$ and its behavior near $\partial \Omega$ albeit with different exponents depending on $\beta+\delta$. Boundedness and H\"older regularity result to the singular equation with critical exponent were also discussed.</description>

Abstract: The $p$-Laplacian evolution equation and the $\alpha$-Gauss curvature flow with a flat side are degenerate parabolic equations with evolving free boundaries. We give proofs of smooth short-time existence, up to the free boundaries, using a result of the authors on linear degenerate equations on a fixed domain.</description>

      <title>Nonuniqueness analysis on the Navier-Stokes equation in $C_{t}L^{q}$ space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of any prescribed kinetic energy, we implement the intermittent convex integration scheme with $L^{q}$-normalized intermittent jets to give a direct proof for the existence of solution to the Navier-Stokes equation in $C_{t}L^{q}$ for some uniform $2&lt;q\ll3$ without the help of interpolation inequality. The result shows the sharp nonuniqueness that there evolve infinite nontrivial weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation starting from zero initial data. Furthermore, we improve the regularity of solution to be of $C_{t}W^{\alpha,q}$ in virtue of the fractional Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities with some $0&lt;\alpha\ll1$. More importantly, the proof framework provides a stepping stone for future progress on the method of intermittent convex integration due to the fact that $L^{q}$-normalized building blocks carry the threshold effect of the exponent $q$ arbitrarily close to the critical value $3$.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of the adaptive stochastic collocation finite element method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is focused on the convergence analysis of an adaptive stochastic collocation algorithm for the stationary diffusion equation with parametric coefficient. The algorithm employs sparse grid collocation in the parameter domain alongside finite element approximations in the spatial domain, and adaptivity is driven by recently proposed parametric and spatial a posteriori error indicators. We prove that for a general diffusion coefficient with finite-dimensional parametrization, the algorithm drives the underlying error estimates to zero. Thus, our analysis covers problems with affine and nonaffine parametric coefficient dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04948v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine methods from microlocal analysis and dimension theory to study resonances with largest real part for an Anosov flow with smooth real valued potential. We show that the resonant states are closely related to special systems of measures supported on the stable manifolds introduced by Climenhaga. As a result, we relate the presence of the resonances on the critical axis to mixing properties of the flow with respect to certain equilibrium measures and show that these equilibrium measures can be reconstructed from the spectral theory of the Anosov flow.</description>

      <title>Contraction properties and differentiability of $p$-energy forms with applications to nonlinear potential theory on self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new contraction property, which we call the generalized $p$-contraction property, for $p$-energy forms as generalizations of many well-known inequalities, such as $p$-Clarkson's inequality, the strong subadditivity and the Markov property in the theory of nonlinear Dirichlet forms, and show that any $p$-energy form satisfying $p$-Clarkson's inequality is Fr\'{e}chet differentiable. We also verify the generalized $p$-contraction property for $p$-energy forms on fractals constructed by Kigami [Mem. Eur. Math. Soc. 5 (2023)] and by Cao--Gu--Qiu [Adv. Math. 405 (2022), no. 108517]. As a general framework of $p$-energy forms taking the generalized $p$-contraction property into consideration, we introduce the notion of $p$-resistance form and investigate fundamental properties of $p$-harmonic functions with respect to $p$-resistance forms. In particular, some new estimates on scaling factors of self-similar $p$-energy forms on self-similar sets are obtained by establishing H\"{o}lder regularity estimates for $p$-harmonic functions, and the $p$-walk dimensions of any generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet and the $D$-dimensional level-$l$ Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket are shown to be strictly greater than $p$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence for mean field control with common noise and degenerate idiosyncratic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the convergence problem in the setting of mean field control with common noise and degenerate idiosyncratic noise. Our main results establish a rate of convergence of the finite-dimensional value functions $V^N$ towards the mean field value function $U$. In the case that the idiosyncratic noise is constant (but possibly degenerate), we obtain the rate $N^{-1/(d+7)}$, which is close to the conjectured optimal rate $N^{-1/d}$, and improves on the existing literature even in the non-degenerate setting. In the case that the idiosyncratic noise can be both non-constant and degenerate, the argument is more complicated, and we instead find the rate $N^{-1/(3d + 19)}$. Our proof strategy builds on the one initiated in [Daudin, Delarue, Jackson - JFA, 2024] in the case of non-degenerate idiosyncratic noise and zero common noise, which consists of approximating $U$ by more regular functions which are almost subsolutions of the infinite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equation solved by $U$. Because of the different noise structure, several new steps are necessary in order to produce an appropriate mollification scheme. In addition to our main convergence results, we investigate the case of zero idiosyncratic noise, and show that sharper results can be obtained there by purely control-theoretic arguments. We also provide examples to demonstrate that the value function is sensitive to the choice of admissible controls in the zero noise setting.</description>

      <title>Analytically weak and mild solutions to stochastic heat equation with irregular drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the stochastic heat equation \begin{equation*} \partial_t u_t(x)=\frac12 \partial^2_{xx}u_t(x) +b(u_t(x))+\dot{W}_{t}(x),\quad t\in(0,T],\, x\in D, \end{equation*} where $b$ is a generalized function, $D$ is either $[0,1]$ or $\mathbb{R}$, and $\dot W$ is space-time white noise on $\mathbb{R}_+\times D$. If the drift $b$ is a sufficiently regular function, then it is well-known that any analytically weak solution to this equation is also analytically mild, and vice versa. We extend this result to drifts that are generalized functions, with an appropriate adaptation of the notions of mild and weak solutions. As a corollary of our results, we show that for $b\in L_p(\mathbb{R})$, $p\ge1$, this equation has a unique analytically weak and mild solution, thus extending the classical results of Gy\"ongy and Pardoux (1993).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian and of other differential operators have been intensively studied in the past decades. The aim of this paper is to introduce differential forms and the de Rham complex in the study of such inequalities. We show how differential forms lie hidden at the heart of the work of Rohleder on inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues for the Laplacian on planar domains. Moreover, we extend the ideas of Rohleder to a new proof of Friedlander's inequality for any bounded Lipschitz domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove general criticality criteria for operators $\Delta + V$ on manifolds with more than one end, where $V$ bounds the Ricci curvature, and a related spectral splitting theorem extending Cheeger-Gromoll's one. Our results give new insight on Li-Wang's theory of manifolds with a weighted Poincar\'e inequality. We apply them to study stable and $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces in manifolds with non-negative bi-Ricci or sectional curvature, in ambient dimension up to $5$ and $6$, respectively. In the special case where the ambient space is $\mathbb{R}^4$, we prove that a $1/3$-stable minimal hypersurface must either have one end or be a catenoid, and that proper, $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces with $\delta &gt; 1/3$ must be hyperplanes.</description>
