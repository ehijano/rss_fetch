      <title>Fractional coloring of product signed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study the fractional chromatic number of signed circulant graphs' direct product is investigated. As previously shown \cite{hedetniemi1966homomorphism}, we prove that the direct product of two signed graphs has a fractional chromatic number that is limited to a value greater than the minimum of their individual fractional chromatic numbers. Hedetniemi (1966) demonstrated that the structure of signed circulant graphs' generating sets determines their fractional chromatic number, and this conclusion is further applied to these graphs. Furthermore, we apply our results to the direct product of two signed circulant graphs and obtain corollaries for situations when one of the graphs in the product has a smaller fractional chromatic number \cite{Zhu2002fractional}. This conclusion generalises earlier work on unsigned graphs and offers a thorough foundation for comprehending the fractional colouring of signed circulant graphs and their products \cite{shitov2019counterexample}.</description>

      <title>Edge-addition in hereditary classes of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class $\mathcal{G}$ of graphs is hereditary if it is closed under taking induced subgraphs. We denote by $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{add}$ the class of graphs that are at most one edge addition away from being in $\mathcal{G}$, and by $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{epex}$ the class of graphs that are at most one edge deletion away from being in $\mathcal{G}$. In previous work, we showed that if a hereditary class $\mathcal{G}$ has finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs, then so does the hereditary class $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{epex}$. In this paper, we prove the corresponding results for $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{add}$. We also note that if $\mathcal{G}$ is closed under complementation, then the forbidden induced subgraphs of $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{add}$ and $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{epex}$ are complements of each other. We provide the list of forbidden induced subgraphs for $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{add}$, and consequently for $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{epex}$ when $\mathcal{G}$ is the class of split graphs, cographs, or threshold graphs. Moreover, following Gyarfas's framework, we introduce the class of $(p,q)$-edge split graphs, analogous to his $(p,q)$-split graphs, and prove that they also have a finite number of forbidden induced subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Disperse Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $\ell$-uniform hypergraph is disperse if the number of edges induced by any set of $\ell+1$ vertices is 0, 1, $\ell$ or $\ell+1$. We show that every disperse $\ell$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices contains a clique or independent set of size $n^{\Omega_{\ell}(1)}$, answering a question of the first author and Tomon. To this end, we prove several structural properties of disperse hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>The Terwilliger algebra of digraphs I -- Hamming digraph $H^*(d,3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we define the Terwilliger algebra of digraphs. Then, we determine the irreducible modules of the Terwilliger algebra of a Hamming digraph $H^*(d,3)$. As is well known, the representation of the Terwilliger algebra of a binary Hamming graph $H(d,2)$ is closely related to that of the Lie algebra $\mathit{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$. We show that in the case of $H^*(d,3)$, it is related to that of the Lie algebra $\mathit{sl}_3(\mathbb{C})$. We also identify the Terwilliger algebra of $H^*(d,3)$ as the $d$ symmetric tensor algebra of ${\rm Mat}_3(\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>The number of irreducibles in the plethysm $s_\lambda[s_m]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a formula for the number of irreducibles (with multiplicity) in the decomposition of the plethysm $s_\lambda[s_m]$ of Schur functions in terms of the number of lattice points in certain rational polytopes. In the case where $\lambda = n$ consists of a single part, we will give a combinatorial interpretation of this number as the cardinality of a set of matrices modulo permutation equivalence. This is also the setting of Foulkes' conjecture, and our results allow us to state a weaker version that only involves comparing the cardinalities of such sets, rather than the multiplicities of irreducible representations.</description>

      <title>On the second-largest modulus among the eigenvalues of a power hypergraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue of a graph (or real symmetric matrix) is equal to the dimension of its corresponding linear eigen-subspace, also known as the geometric multiplicity. However, for hypergraphs, the relationship between these two multiplicities remains an open problem. For a graph $G=(V,E)$ and $k \geq 3$, the $k$-power hypergraph $G^{(k)}$ is a $k$-uniform hypergraph obtained by adding $k-2$ new vertices to each edge of $G$, who always has non-real eigenvalues. In this paper, we determine the second-largest modulus $\Lambda$ among the eigenvalues of $G^{(k)}$, which is indeed an eigenvalue of $G^{(k)}$. The projective eigenvariety $\mathbb{V}_{\Lambda}$ associated with $\Lambda$ is the set of the eigenvectors of $G^{(k)}$ corresponding to $\Lambda$ considered in the complex projective space. We show that the dimension of $\mathbb{V}_{\Lambda}$ is zero, i.e, there are finitely many eigenvectors corresponding to $\Lambda$ up to a scalar. We give both the algebraic multiplicity of $\Lambda$ and the total multiplicity of the eigenvector in $\mathbb{V}_{\Lambda}$ in terms of the number of the weakest edges of $G$. Our result show that these two multiplicities are equal.</description>

      <title>Matchgate signatures under variable permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for determining whether a matchgate signature retains its property under a certain variable permutation, which can be checked in polynomial time. We also define the concept of permutable matchgate signatures, and use it to erase the gap between Pl-\#CSP and \#CSP on planar graphs in the previous study. We provide a detailed characterization of permutable matchgate signatures as well, by presenting their relation to symmetric matchgate signatures. In addition, we prove a dichotomy for Pl-$\#R_D$-CSP where $D\ge 3$ is an integer.</description>

      <title>Cells of Gelfand $S_n$-Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kazhdan and Lusztig introduced the $W$-graphs, which represent the multiplication action of the standard basis on the canonical bais in the Iwahori-Hecke algebra. In the Hecke algebra module, Marberg defined two generalied $W$-graphs, called the Gelfand $W$-graphs. The classification of the molecules of the type $\A$ Gelfand $S_n$-graphs are determined by two RSK-like insertion algorithms. We finish the classification of cells by proving that every molecule in the $S_n$-graphs is indeed a cell.</description>

      <title>On the inverse problem of the $k$-th Davenport constants for groups of rank $2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite abelian group $G$ and a positive integer $k$, let $\mathsf{D}_k(G)$ denote the smallest integer $\ell$ such that each sequence over $G$ of length at least $\ell$ has $k$ disjoint nontrivial zero-sum subsequences. It is known that $\mathsf D_k(G)=n_1+kn_2-1$ if $G\cong C_{n_1}\oplus C_{n_2}$ is a rank $2$ group, where $1&lt;n_1\t n_2$. We investigate the associated inverse problem for rank $2$ groups, that is, characterizing the structure of zero-sum sequences of length $\mathsf D_k(G)$ that can not be partitioned into $k+1$ nontrivial zero-sum subsequences.</description>

      <title>On Supports for graphs of bounded genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,\mathcal{E})$ be a hypergraph. A support is a graph $Q$ on $X$ such that for each $E\in\mathcal{E}$, the subgraph of $Q$ induced on the elements in $E$ is connected. We consider the problem of constructing a support for hypergraphs defined by connected subgraphs of a host graph. For a graph $G=(V,E)$, let $\mathcal{H}$ be a set of connected subgraphs of $G$. Let the vertices of $G$ be partitioned into two sets the \emph{terminals} $\mathbf{b}(V)$ and the \emph{non-terminals} $\mathbf{r}(V)$. We define a hypergraph on $\mathbf{b}(V)$, where each $H\in\mathcal{H}$ defines a hyperedge consisting of the vertices of $\mathbf{b}(V)$ in $H$.
  We also consider the problem of constructing a support for the \emph{dual hypergraph} - a hypergraph on $\mathcal{H}$ where each $v\in \mathbf{b}(V)$ defines a hyperedge consisting of the subgraphs in $\mathcal{H}$ containing $v$. In fact, we construct supports for a common generalization of the primal and dual settings called the \emph{intersection hypergraph}.
  As our main result, we show that if the host graph $G$ has bounded genus and the subgraphs in $\mathcal{H}$ satisfy a condition of being \emph{cross-free}, then there exists a support that also has bounded genus. Our results are a generalization of the results of Raman and Ray (Rajiv Raman, Saurabh Ray: Constructing Planar Support for Non-Piercing Regions. Discret. Comput. Geom. 64(3): 1098-1122 (2020)).
  Our techniques imply a unified analysis for packing and covering problems for hypergraphs defined on surfaces of bounded genus. We also describe applications of our results for hypergraph colorings.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable induced subgraphs of large and infinite $2$-edge-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1930, Ramsey proved that every large graph contains either a large clique or a large edgeless graph as an induced subgraph. It is well known that every large connected graph contains a long path, a large clique, or a large star as an induced subgraph. Recently Allred, Ding, and Oporowski presented the unavoidable large induced subgraphs for large $2$-connected graphs and for infinite $2$-connected graphs. In this paper we establish the $2$-edge-connected analogues of these results. As consequences we also obtain results on unavoidable large subgraphs, topological minors, minors, induced topological minors, induced minors, and Eulerian subgraphs in large and infinite $2$-edge-connected graphs.</description>

      <title>The Avoider-Enforcer game on hypergraphs of rank 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Avoider-Enforcer convention of positional games, two players, Avoider and Enforcer, take turns selecting vertices from a hypergraph H. Enforcer wins if, by the time all vertices of H have been selected, Avoider has completely filled an edge of H with her vertices; otherwise, Avoider wins. In this paper, we first give some general results, in particular regarding the outcome of the game and disjoint unions of hypergraphs. We then determine which player has a winning strategy for all hypergraphs of rank 2, and for linear hypergraphs of rank 3 when Avoider plays the last move. The structural characterisations we obtain yield polynomial-time algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphic zonotopes and acyclohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a higher-uniformity analogue of graphic zonotopes and permutohedra. Specifically, given a $(d+1)$-uniform hypergraph $H$, we define its hypergraphic zonotope $\mathcal{Z}_H$, and when $H$ is the complete $(d+1)$-uniform hypergraph $K^{(d+1)}_n$, we call its hypergraphic zonotope the acyclohedron $\mathcal{A}_{n,d}$.
  We express the volume of $\mathcal{Z}_H$ as a homologically weighted count of the spanning $d$-dimensional hypertrees of $H$, which is closely related to Kalai's generalization of Cayley's theorem in the case when $H=K^{(d+1)}_n$ (but which, curiously, is not the same). We also relate the vertices of hypergraphic zonotopes to a notion of acyclic orientations previously studied by Linial and Morganstern for complete hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Kamke equations and geometric designs of degree five for classical orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we elucidate the advantage of examining the connections between Hilbert-Kamke equations and geometric designs, or Chebyshev-type quadrature, for classical orthogonal polynomials. We first establish a classification theorem for such equations of degree 5 in 6 variables. The proof is based on an elementary polynomial identity, which Kawada and Wooley (1999) employed in their work on the Waring problem, and some advanced techniques on the computation of the genus of a certain irreducible curve. We then prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of rational solutions of Hilbert-Kamke equations of degree 5, especially for the Chebyshev measure of the first kind. It is noteworthy that this result presents a completely explicit construction of rational solutions. Moreover, we create novel connections among Hilbert-Kamke equations, geometric designs and the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott (PTE) problem. For example, we establish that our solutions of Hilbert-Kamke equations of degree 5 in 6 variables appear in the famous parametric solution for the PTE problem found by Borwein (2002).</description>

      <title>On the Maiorana-McFarland Class Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The closure $\mathcal{M}_{m}^{\#}$ and the extension $\widehat{\mathcal{M}}_{m}$ of the Maiorana--McFarland class $\mathcal{M}_{m}$ in $m = 2n$ variables relative to the extended-affine equivalence and the bent function construction $f \oplus \mathrm{Ind}_{U}$ are considered, where $U$ is an affine subspace of $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{m}$ of dimension $m/2$. We obtain an explicit formula for $|\widehat{\mathcal{M}}_{m}|$ and an upper bound for $|\widehat{\mathcal{M}}_{m}^{\#}|$. Asymptotically tight bounds for $|\mathcal{M}_{m}^{\#}|$ are proved as well, for instance, $|\mathcal{M}_{8}^{\#}| \approx 2^{77.865}$. Metric properties of $\mathcal{M}_{m}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{m}^{\#}$ are also investigated. We find the number of all closest bent functions to the set $\mathcal{M}_{m}$ and provide an upper bound of the same number for $\mathcal{M}_{m}^{\#}$. The average number $E(\mathcal{M}_{m})$ of $m/2$-dimensional affine subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{m}$ such that a function from $\mathcal{M}_{m}$ is affine on each of them is calculated. We obtain that similarly defined $E(\mathcal{M}_{m}^{\#})$ satisfies $E(\mathcal{M}_{m}^{\#}) &lt; E(\mathcal{M}_{m})$ and $E(\mathcal{M}_{m}^{\#}) = E(\mathcal{M}_{m}) - o(1)$.</description>

      <title>Twisted moments of characteristic polynomials of random matrices in the unitary group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Keating and the second author of this paper devised a heuristic for predicting asymptotic formulas for moments of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta(s)$. Their approach indicates how lower twisted moments of $\zeta(s)$ may be used to evaluate higher moments. In this paper, we present a rigorous random matrix theory analogue of their heuristic. To do this, we develop a notion of "twisted moment" of characteristic polynomials of matrices in the unitary group $U(N)$, and we prove several identities involving Schur polynomials. Our results may be viewed as a proof of concept of the heuristic for $\zeta(s)$.</description>

      <title>The fractional chromatic number of the plane is at least 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10069v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the fractional chromatic number $\chi_f(\mathbb R^2)$ of the unit distance graph of the Euclidean plane is greater than or equal to $4$. Interestingly, however, we cannot present a finite subgraph $G$ of the plane such that $\chi_f(G)\ge 4$. Instead, we utilize the concept of the geometric fractional chromatic number $\chi_{gf}(G)$, which was introduced recently in connection with density bounds for 1-avoiding sets.
  First, as $G$ ranges over finite subgraphs of the plane, we establish that the supremum of $\chi_f(G)$ is the same as that of $\chi_{gf}(G)$. The proof exploits the amenability of the group of Euclidean transformations in dimension 2 and, as such, we do not know whether the analogous statement holds in higher dimensions. We then present a specific planar unit distance graph $G$ on 27 vertices such that $\chi_{gf}(G)=4$, and conclude $\chi_f(\mathbb R^2)\ge 4$ as a corollary.
  As another main result we show that the finitary fractional chromatic number and the Hall ratio of the plane are equal. As a consequence, we conclude that there exist finite unit distance graphs with independence ratio $\frac{1}{4}+\varepsilon$, while we conjecture that the value $\frac{1}{4}$ cannot be reached.</description>

      <title>Brooks-type colourings of digraphs in linear time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brooks' Theorem is a fundamental result on graph colouring, stating that the chromatic number of a graph is almost always upper bounded by its maximal degree. Lov\'asz showed that such a colouring may then be computed in linear time when it exists. Many analogues are known for variants of (di)graph colouring, notably for list-colouring and partitions into subgraphs with prescribed degeneracy. One of the most general results of this kind is due to Borodin, Kostochka, and Toft, when asking for classes of colours to satisfy "variable degeneracy" constraints. An extension of this result to digraphs has recently been proposed by Bang-Jensen, Schweser, and Stiebitz, by considering colourings as partitions into "variable weakly degenerate" subdigraphs. Unlike earlier variants, there exists no linear-time algorithm to produce colourings for these generalisations.
  We introduce the notion of (variable) bidegeneracy for digraphs, capturing multiple (di)graph degeneracy variants. We define the corresponding concept of $F$-dicolouring, where $F = (f_1,...,f_s)$ is a vector of functions, and an $F$-dicolouring requires vertices coloured $i$ to induce a "strictly-$f_i$-bidegenerate" subdigraph. We prove an analogue of Brooks' theorem for $F$-dicolouring, generalising the result of Bang-Jensen et al., and earlier analogues in turn.
  Our new approach provides a linear-time algorithm that, given a digraph $D$, either produces an $F$-dicolouring of $D$, or correctly certifies that none exist. This yields the first linear-time algorithms to compute (di)colourings corresponding to the aforementioned generalisations of Brooks' theorem. In turn, it gives an unified framework to compute such colourings for various intermediate generalisations of Brooks' theorem such as list-(di)colouring and partitioning into (variable) degenerate sub(di)graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of a graph is the minimum number of vertices that are moved by a non-trivial automorphism. Equivalently, it can be defined as the minimal degree of its automorphism group (as a permutation group on the vertices). In this paper we develop some results on permutation groups (primitive and imprimitive) with small minimal degree. As a consequence of such results we classify vertex-transitive graphs whose motion is $4$ or a prime number.</description>

Abstract: Vector spaces over finite fields and Anzahl formulas of subspaces were studied by Wan (Geometry of Classical Groups over Finite Fields, Science Press, 2002).

      <title>Quaternary Legendre pairs II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quaternary Legendre pairs are pertinent to the construction of quaternary Hadamard matrices and have many applications, for example in coding theory and communications. In contrast to binary Legendre pairs, quaternary ones can exist for even length $\ell$ as well. It is conjectured that there is a quaternary Legendre pair for any even $\ell$. The smallest open case until now had been $\ell=28$, and $\ell=38$ was the only length $\ell$ with $28\le \ell\le 60$ resolved before. Here we provide constructions for $\ell=28,30,32$, and $34$. In parallel and independently, Jedwab and Pender found a construction of quaternary Legendre pairs of length $\ell=(q-1)/2$ for any prime power $q\equiv 1\bmod 4$, which in particular covers $\ell=30$, $36$, and $40$, so that now $\ell=42$ is the smallest unresolved case. The main new idea of this paper is a way to separate the search for the subsequences along even and odd indices which substantially reduces the complexity of the search algorithm. In addition, we use Galois theory for cyclotomic fields to derive conditions which improve the PSD test.</description>

      <title>Linear dependencies, polynomial factors in the Duke--Erd\H os forbidden sunflower problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We call a family of $s$ sets $\{F_1, \ldots, F_s\}$ a \textit{sunflower with $s$ petals} if, for any distinct $i, j \in [s]$, one has $F_i \cap F_j = \cap_{u = 1}^s F_u$. The set $C = \cap_{u = 1}^s F_u$ is called the {\it core} of the sunflower. It is a classical result of Erd\H os and Rado that there is a function $\phi(s,k)$ such that any family of $k$-element sets contains a sunflower with $s$ petals. In 1977, Duke and Erd\H os asked for the size of the largest family $\mathcal{F}\subset{[n]\choose k}$ that contains no sunflower with $s$ petals and core of size $t-1$. In 1987, Frankl and F\" uredi asymptotically solved this problem for $k\ge 2t+1$ and $n&gt;n_0(s,k)$. This paper is one of the pinnacles of the so-called Delta-system method.
  In this paper, we extend the result of Frankl and F\"uredi to a much broader range of parameters: $n&gt;f_0(s,t) k$ with $f_0(s,t)$ polynomial in $s$ and $t$. We also extend this result to other domains, such as $[n]^k$ and ${n\choose k/w}^w$ and obtain even stronger and more general results for forbidden sunflowers with core at most $t-1$ (including results for families of permutations and subfamilies of the $k$-th layer in a simplicial complex).
  The methods of the paper, among other things, combine the spread approximation technique, introduced by Zakharov and the first author, with the Delta-system approach of Frankl and F\"uredi and the hypercontractivity approach for global functions, developed by Keller, Lifshitz and coauthors. Previous works in extremal set theory relied on at most one of these methods. Creating such a unified approach was one of the goals for the paper.</description>

      <title>Induced arithmetic removal for partition-regular patterns of complexity 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2019, Fox, Tidor and Zhao (arXiv:1911.03427) proved an induced arithmetic removal lemma for linear patterns of complexity 1 in vector spaces over a fixed finite field. With no further assumptions on the pattern, this induced removal lemma cannot guarantee a fully pattern-free recolouring of the space, as some `non-generic' instances must necessarily remain. On the other hand, Bhattacharyya et al. (arXiv:1212.3849) showed that in the case of translation-invariant patterns, it is possible to obtain recolourings that eliminate the given pattern completely, with no exceptions left behind. This paper demonstrates that such complete removal can be achieved for all partition-regular arithmetic patterns of complexity 1.</description>

Abstract: We prove that products of double Grothendieck polynomials have the same back- and forward-stability numbers as products of Schubert polynomials, characterize which simple reflections appear in such products, and also give a new proof of a finiteness conjecture of Lam-Lee-Shimozono on products of back-stable Grothendieck polynomials which was first proved by Anderson. To do this, we use the main theorems from our recent work, as well as expansion formulas of Lenart, Fomin-Kirillov, and Lam-Lee-Shimozono.</description>

      <title>On generic $\Delta$-modular integer matrices with two rows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The column number question asks for the maximal number of columns of an integer matrix with the property that all its rank size minors are bounded by a fixed parameter $\Delta$ in absolute value. Polynomial upper bounds have been proved in various settings in recent years, with consequences for algorithmic questions in integer linear programming and matroid theory. In this paper, we focus on the exact determination of the maximal column number of such matrices with two rows and no vanishing $2$-minors. We prove that for large enough $\Delta$, this number is a quasi-linear function, non-decreasing and always even. Such basic structural properties of column number functions are barely known, but expected to hold in other settings as well. Moreover, our results identify the unique excluded (co)rank two minors for the class of matroids that are representable as a $\Delta$-submodular matrix.</description>

Abstract: We consider products of sets of reals with a combinatorial structure based on scales parameterized by filters. This kind of sets were intensively investigated in products of spaces with combinatorial covering properties as Hurewicz, Scheepers, Menger and Rothberger. We will complete this picture with focusing on properties from the second row of the Scheepers diagram. In particular we show that in the Miller model a product space of two $\mathfrak{d}$-concentrated sets has a strong covering property $\mathsf{S}_1(\Gamma,\Omega)$. We provide also counterexamples in products to demonstrate limitations of used methods.</description>

We show that the structure coefficients of the Belkale-Kumar product $\odot_0$, on the cohomology $\mathrm{H}^{*}(X,\mathbf{Z})$, are all either $0$ or $1$. We also derive some consequences. The proof that is mainly geometric also uses new combinatorial results on root systems. Moreover, it is uniform and avoids case by case considerations.</description>

Abstract: Starting from the geometric construction of the framed braid group, we define and study the framization of several Brauer-type monoids and also the set partition monoid, all of which appear in knot theory. We introduce the concept of deframization, which is a procedure to obtain a tied monoid from a given framed monoid. Furthermore, we show in detail how this procedure works on the monoids mentioned above. We also discuss the framization and deframization of some algebras, which are deformations, respectively, of the framized and deframized monoids discussed here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta &gt; 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_{\rm op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau &gt; 0$. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau &lt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau &gt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions is exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau&gt;\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the semicircle law. Finally, under a technical assumption, we show that there exists values of $(\tau,\kappa)$ for which the number of solutions has large variance, implying the failure of the second moment method. Our proofs rely on establishing concentration and large deviation properties of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints.</description>

Abstract: We use folding techniques to define a new class of gentle-like algebras that generalise the iterated tilted algebras of type $C$ and $\widetilde{C}$, which we call folded gentle algebras. We then show that folded gentle algebras satisfy many of the same remarkable properties of gentle algebras, and that the proof of these properties follows directly from folding arguments. In particular, we classify the indecomposable modules of folded gentle algebras in terms symmetric and asymmetric string and band modules. We classify the Auslander-Reiten sequences over these algebras, showing that irreducible morphisms between string modules are given by adding/deleting hooks and cohooks to/from strings. Finally, we show that the class of folded gentle algebras are closed under derived equivalence.</description>
