      <title>Observation of unexpected band splitting and magnetically-induced band structure reconstruction in TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic Kagome materials are a promising platform to study the interplay between magnetism, topology, and correlated electronic phenomena. Among these materials, the RTi3Bi4 family received a great deal of attention recently because of its chemical versatility and wide range of magnetic properties. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations to investigate the electronic structure of TbTi3Bi4 in paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. Our experimental results show the presence of unidirectional band splitting of unknown nature in both phases. In addition, we observed a complex reconstruction of the band structure in the antiferromagnetic phase. Some aspects of this reconstruction are consistent with effects of additional periodicity introduced by the magnetic ordering vector, while the nature of several other features remains unknown.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the $S=1/2$ maple-leaf Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the maple-leaf lattice has recently gathered a great deal of attention. Competition between three non-equivalent bond interactions results in various ground-state quantum phases, the exact dimer-product singlet ground state being among them. The thermodynamic properties of this model are much less understood. We used high-temperature expansion up to the $18$th order to study the thermodynamics of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the uniform maple-leaf lattice with the ground state exhibiting a six-sublattice $120^{\circ}$ long-range magnetic order. Pad\'{e} approximants allow us to get reliable results up to the temperatures of about $T\approx 0.4$. To study thermodynamics for arbitrary temperatures, we made the interpolation using the entropy method. Based on the analysis of close Pad\'{e} approximants, we find ground-state energy $e_{0}=-0.53064\ldots -0.53023$ in good agreement with numerical results. The specific heat $c(T)$ has a typical maximum at rather low temperatures $T\approx0.379$ and the uniform susceptibility $\chi(T)$ at $T\approx0.49$. We also estimate the value of $\chi(T)$ at zero temperature $\chi_{0}\approx0.05\ldots0.06$. The ground-state order manifests itself in the divergence of the so-called generalized Wilson ratio.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the spin dynamics of quantum spin dimers with Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state configuration and spin dynamics of a quantum spin spiral dimer when a magnetic field is applied to one of its constituent spins. By adiabatic changing the magnetic field, it is possible to change the non-magnetic ground state to a classical spiral state, which oscillates periodically to its inverted classical spiral state configuration. This oscillation can be halted at any time, leading to the possibility of manipulating the quantum state and the magnetic configuration of the spin dimer. Notably, this idea is not limited to spin dimers and can also be extended to quantum spin chains with an even number of spins.</description>

      <title>Piezomagnetic effect in 5$d$ transition metal oxides Y$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ and Cd$_2$Os$_2$O$_7$ with all-in/all-out magnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the piezomagnetic effect in pyrochlore-type oxides Y$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ and Cd$_2$Os$_2$O$_7$, which show a non-coplanar magnetic structure called the all-in/all-out antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures. The all-in/all-out magnetic order can be viewed as a ferroic order of the $xyz$-type magnetic octupoles. We observed a linear development of magnetization with applying stress for both materials. We then estimated the powder-averaged piezomagnetic tensor at 50 K to be $Q = 5.74 \times 10^{-6}$ $\mu_{\text{B}}$/Ir$\cdot$MPa for Y$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, and $Q = 3.49 \times 10^{-7}$ $\mu_{\text{B}}$/Os$\cdot$MPa for Cd$_2$Os$_2$O$_7$. We discuss the microscopic mechanism of the piezomagnetic effect in terms of the stress-induced modification of the g-tensor anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (D-M) interactions. This work paves the way for the further development of piezomagnetic materials using a strategy based on magnetic multipoles.</description>

      <title>Charge redistribution among copper and oxygen orbitals in the normal state of the Emery model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unraveling the behavior of the electrons in the copper-oxygen planes of cuprate superconductors remains a challenge. Here we examine the electronic charge redistribution among planar copper and oxygen orbitals and the charge gap using the Emery model in the normal state, solved with cellular dynamical mean-field theory at finite temperature. We quantify the charge redistribution as a function of the onsite Coulomb repulsion on the copper orbitals, the bare copper-oxygen energy difference, and the hole or electron doping. We find that the position relative to the metal to insulator boundary of the Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen diagram determines the charge redistribution among copper and oxygen orbitals. For a fixed bare Cu-O energy difference, an increase in the Cu electron repulsion leads to a transfer of the electronic charge from Cu to O orbitals. For a fixed charge gap size of the undoped state, as the system evolves from a charge-transfer to a Mott-Hubbard regime, the electronic charge is transferred from Cu to O orbitals. Our findings posit the Coulomb repulsion and the bare charge-transfer energy as key drivers of the microscopic process of charge redistribution in the CuO$_2$ plane. They quantify the anticorrelation between the charge gap size and oxygen hole content. They show that for fixed band-structure parameters, the charge gap and the charge redistribution between Cu and O orbitals provide a way to understand observed trends in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Numerical Block-Diagonalization and Linked Cluster Expansion for Deriving Effective Hamiltonians: Applications to Spin Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative framework for deriving effective Hamiltonians that describe low-energy excitations in quantum many-body systems. The method combines block diagonalization based on the Cederbaum--Schirmer--Meyer transformation with the numerical linked-cluster (NLC) expansion. A key feature of the approach is a variational criterion that uniquely determines the unitary transformation by minimizing the transformation of the state basis within the low-energy subspace. This criterion also provides a robust guideline for selecting relevant eigenstates, even in the presence of avoided level crossing and mixing induced by particle-number-nonconserving interactions. We demonstrate the method in two quantum spin models: the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional Shastry--Sutherland model, relevant to SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$. In both cases, the derived effective Hamiltonians faithfully reproduce the structure and dynamics of magnon and triplon excitations, including the emergence of topological band structures. The block diagonalization enables quantum fluctuations to be incorporated non-perturbatively, while the NLC expansion systematically accounts for finite-size corrections from larger clusters. This approach naturally generates long-range effective interactions near criticality, even when the original Hamiltonian includes only short-range couplings. The proposed framework provides a general and computationally feasible tool for constructing physically meaningful effective models across a broad range of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic magnetic phase diagrams, tricriticality, and spin-reorientation in high-pressure grown SmCrO$_3$ single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SmCrO$_3$ single crystals were successfully grown utilizing the high-pressure optical floating-zone method and their crystal structure, magnetization behavior, and magnetic phase diagrams were thoroughly investigated. Magnetic studies were conducted for fields applied along all principal crystallographic directions, with measurements taken at temperatures as low as 0.4 K and magnetic fields up to 14 T. The single crystal growth parameters are reported and the orthorhombic structure with the centrosymmetric space group $Pbnm$ is confirmed. Long-range order of the Cr$^{3+}$ and Sm$^{3+}$ magnetic sublattices evolves at $T_{\rm N}$ = 192 K and $T_{\rm N2}$=3 K, respectively. In contrast to previous studies on polycrystals our single crystal data imply a discontinuous and one-step spin-reorientation (SR) of net magnetic moments $\tilde{M}$ from the $c$ axis into the $ab$ plane at zero magnetic field at $T_{\rm SR}$=33 K. Its discontinuous nature is maintained if $B$ is applied $||c$ axis but tricritical behavior and a triple point is found for $B||a$ axis. While our data are consistent with the magnetic representation $\Gamma_4$ for $T &gt; T_{\mathrm {SR}}$, the size and in-plane direction of the observed net magnetic moment disagree to previously proposed spin configurations, i.e., $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$, for the spin-reoriented phases. In general, our high-quality single crystals enable us to revisit the phase diagram and to clarify the complex magnetism in SmCrO3 arising from the interplay of anisotropic 3$d$ and 4$f$ magnetic sublattices.</description>

      <title>Lattice models with subsystem/weak non-invertible symmetry-protected topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of lattice models which possess subsystem non-invertible symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order and analyze their interface modes protected by the symmetry, whose codimension turns out to be more than one. We also propose 2+1d lattice models which belong to two different weak SPT phases distinguished by a combination of translational symmetry and non-invertible symmetry. We show that the interface between them exhibits an exotic Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly coming from the symmetry which cannot be written as a direct product of an internal symmetry and the lattice translational symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of current-induced phonon angular momentum, which we call phonon Edelstein effect. We investigate this effect in three-dimensional chiral metals with spin-orbit coupling and chiral phonons, and obtain an analytical expression of phonon angular momentum induced by the current. We also discuss the physical interpretation of this effect and give an estimation of its magnitude.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved electron dynamics in antiferromagnetic CoO(001) thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrathin antiferromagnetic CoO(001)-(1x1) films of 2 and 4 monolayers (ML) on Ag(001) are investigated by time- and angle-resolved two-photon photoelectron (2PPE) spectroscopy. Pump-probe spectra show unoccupied states between 3.6 and 4.0\,eV above the Fermi level ($E_{F}$), which are identified as image potential states with momentum-dependent lifetimes between 12 to 20\,fs. Electrons photoexcited across the band gap show lifetimes of 27\,fs at the bottom of the Co $3d$ $t_{2g}$-derived conduction band minimum. This lifetime is much shorter than in conventional semiconductors. Our observations point either to strong electron correlation effects as has been demonstrated for NiO or to an ultrafast relaxation pathway via metallic substrate states.</description>

      <title>Neutron Spin Resonance Near a Lifshitz Transition in Overdoped Ba$_{0.4}$K$_{0.6}$Fe$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elucidating the relationship between spin excitations and fermiology is essential for clarifying the pairing mechanism in iron-based superconductors (FeSCs). Here, we report inelastic neutron scattering results on the hole overdoped Ba$_{0.4}$K$_{0.6}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ near a Lifshitz transition, where the electron pocket at $M$ point is nearly replace by four hole pockets. In the normal state, the spin excitations are observed at incommensurate wave vectors with chimney-like dispersions. By cooling down to the superconducting state, a neutron spin resonance mode emerges with a peak energy of $E_r=$ 14-15 meV weakly modulated along $L$-direction. The incommensurability notably increases at low energies, giving rise to downward dispersions of the resonance mode. This behavior contrasts sharply with the upward dispersions of resonance observed in optimally doped Ba$_{0.67}$K$_{0.33}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ contributed by the hole to electron scattering, but resembles with the cases in KFe$_2$As$_2$ and KCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ where the fermiology are dominated by hole pockets. These results highlight the critical role of electronic structure modifications near the Fermi level, especially in governing interband scattering under imperfect nesting conditions, which fundamentally shape the spin dynamics of FeSCs.</description>

      <title>Second roton feature in the strongly coupled electron liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present extensive \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for the dynamic properties of the finite temperature uniform electron gas (UEG) over a broad range of densities, $2\leq r_s\leq300$. We demonstrate that the direct analysis of the imaginary-time density--density correlation function (ITCF) allows for a rigorous assessment of the density and temperature dependence of the previously reported roton-type feature [T.~Dornheim, \emph{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}~\textbf{121}, 255001 (2018)] at intermediate wavenumbers. We clearly resolve the emergence of a second roton at the second harmonic of the original feature for $r_s\gtrsim100$, which we identify as an incipient phonon dispersion. Finally, we use our highly accurate PIMC results for the ITCF as the basis for an analytic continuation to compute the dynamic structure factor, which additionally substantiates the existence of the second roton in the strongly coupled electron liquid. Our investigation further elucidates the complex interplay between quantum delocalization and Coulomb coupling in the UEG. All PIMC results are freely available online and provide valuable benchmarks for other theoretical methodologies and approximations.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous probes of pseudogap and disorder by hard x-ray photoemission applied for a candidate thermoelectric Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk electronic structure of Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal (QC) have been investigated by hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES). We have found an intrinsic pseudogap structure in which the spectral weight in the vicinity of the Fermi level (E_F) is remarkably suppressed at any photon energy. The valence-band HAXPES spectra and the asymmetry of the core-level peaks indicate a contribution of the Al sites to the electronic structure in the vicinity of E_F with less contributions from the Pd and Ru sites. The disorder effects are found in the core-level lineshapes of the Al-Pd-Ru QC, of which the widths are much broader than those of the other reference crystalline solids with less disorder.</description>

      <title>Born-limit scattering and pair-breaking crossover in d-wave superconductivity of (TMTSF)2ClO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quasi-one-dimensional organic unconventional superconductor (TMTSF)2ClO4, the randomness of the non-centrosymmetric ClO4 anions can be experimentally controlled by adjusting the cooling rate through the anion-ordering temperature. This feature provides a unique opportunity to study disorder effects on unconventional superconductivity in great detail. We here report on measurements of the electronic specific heat of this system, performed under various cooling rates. The evolution of the residual density of states indicates that the ClO4 randomness works as Born-limit pair breakers, which, to our knowledge, has never been clearly identified in any unconventional superconductors. Furthermore, detailed analyses suggest a peculiar crossover from strong unitarity scattering due to molecular defects toward the Born-limit weak scattering due to borders of ordered regions. This work supports the d-wave nature of pairing in (TMTSF)2ClO4 and intends to provide an experimental basis for further developments of pair-breaking theories of unconventional superconductors where multiple electron scattering mechanisms coexist.</description>

      <title>TensorMixedStates: a Julia library for simulating pure and mixed quantum states using matrix product states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TensorMixedStates, a Julia library built on top of ITensor which allows the simulation of quantum systems in presence of dissipation using matrix product states (MPS). It offers three key features: i) it implements the MPS representation for mixed states along with associated operations, in particular the time evolution according to a Lindblad equation or discrete time evolution using non-unitary gates (quantum channels), ii) it is based on ITensor, which has proven its effectiveness and which gives access to efficient low-level tensor manipulation as well state-of-the-art algorithms (like DMRG, TDVP, quantum numbers conservation and automated parallelization), finally iii) it presents a user-friendly interface allowing writing sophisticated simulations for pure and mixed quantum states in a few lines of code.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable dissipative dynamics and one-form strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking in interacting two-dimensional spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of a class of interacting "gamma-matrix" spin models coupled to a Markovian environment. For spins on an arbitrary graph, we construct a Lindbladian that maps to a non-Hermitian model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the graph with a background classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. We show, analytically and numerically, that the steady states and relaxation dynamics are qualitatively independent of the choice of the underlying graph, in stark contrast to the Hamiltonian case. We also show that the exponentially many steady states provide a concrete example of mixed-state topological order, in the sense of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of a one-form symmetry. While encoding only classical information, the steady states still exhibit long-range quantum correlations. Afterward, we examine the relaxation processes toward the steady state by numerically computing decay rates, which we generically find to be finite, even in the dissipationless limit. We however identify symmetry sectors where fermion-parity conservation is enhanced to fermion-number conservation, where we can analytically bound the decay rates and prove that they vanish in the limits of both infinitely weak and infinitely strong dissipation. Finally, we show that while the choice of coherent dynamics is very flexible, exact solvability strongly constrains the allowed form of dissipation. Our work establishes an analytically tractable framework to explore nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter and the relaxation mechanisms toward them.</description>

      <title>Charge-loop current order and Z3 nematicity mediated by bond-order fluctuations in kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A=Cs,Rb,K)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08068v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments on geometrically frustrated kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, Cs) have revealed the emergence of the charge loop current (cLC) order near the bond order (BO) phase. However, the origin of the cLC and its relation to other phases have been uncovered. Here, we discover a novel mechanism of the cLC state, by focusing on the BO phase common in kagome metals. The BO fluctuations in metals mediate the odd-parity particle-hole condensation, which drives the topological charge-current. This state is further stabilized by the finite electron-phonon coupling and the off-site Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the predicted cLC+BO phase gives rise to the Z3-nematic state in addition to the giant anomalous Hall effect. The present theory predicts the close relationship between the cLC, the BO, and the nematicity, which is significant to understand the cascade of quantum electron states in kagome metals.</description>

Abstract: We predict the magnetic and electronic properties of a novel metal-organic framework. By combining density functional theory and density matrix renormalization group approaches, we find the diatomic Kagome crystal structure of the metal-semiquinoid framework (H$_2$NMe$_2$)$_2$M$_2$(Cl$_2$dhbq)$_3$ (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) to host a rich variety of antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) Dirac semimetallic, spin-polarized and unpolarized Dirac fermions, along with metallic phases and flat band magnetic insulators. Concomitantly, the spin excitation spectrum of the various magnetic systems display multiple Dirac-like and nodal-ring crossings. This suggests that the metal-semiquinoid system is an ideal platform for examining the intertwining of Dirac fermions and magnons.</description>

      <title>Fermionized dual vortex theory for magnetized kagom\'{e} spin liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent quantum oscillation measurement on the kagom\'{e} lattice antiferromagnet in finite magnetic fields, we raise the question about the physical contents of the emergent fermions and the gauge fields if the U(1) spin liquid is relevant for the finite-field kagom\'{e} lattice antiferromagnet. Clearly, the magnetic field is non-perturbative in this regime, and the finite-field state has no direct relation with the U(1) Dirac spin liquid proposal at zero field. We here consider the fermionized dual vortex liquid state as one possible candidate theory to understand the magnetized kagom\'{e} spin liquid. Within the dual vortex theory, the $S^z$ magnetization is the emergent U(1) gauge flux, and the fermionized dual vortex is the emergent fermion. The magnetic field polarizes the spin component that modulates the U(1) gauge flux for the fermionized vortices and generates the quantum oscillation. Within the mean-field theory, we discuss the gauge field correlation, the vortex-antivortex continuum and the vortex thermal Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum colored strings in the hole-doped $t$-$J_z$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stripe phase, an intertwined order observed in high-temperature superconductors, is regarded as playing a key role in elucidating the underlying mechanism of superconductivity, especially in cuprates. Following Jan Zaanen's early scenario, the filled charge stripe, with one hole per unit cell of the charge order, can be taken as the interactive elastic quantum strings of holes, stabilized by $\pi$-phase shifts between neighboring magnetic domains. However, this scenario is challenging to explain, particularly in terms of electron pairing, which necessitates hole pairs. In this work, we propose a new effective model for describing the stripe phase in the hole-doped $t$-$J_z$ model. With respect to the antiferromagnetic background, the model comprises three types of color-labeled point-defects coupling to an effective spin field, so named as ``colored string". Comparing with numerical results from large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find semi-quantitative agreement in local hole density, magnetic moment, and the newly proposed spectrum features of the effective spin field. By systematically analyzing the hole-density distribution and the scaling of groundstate energy at different system sizes, we determine the effective core radius and the effective hopping amplitude of the quantum string. Furthermore, the local pinning field can be finely adjusted to drag the quantum string, offering a potential method for detecting it in optical lattices. At last, we further demonstrate the partially-filled stripe with less than one hole per unit cell of the charge order can also be well described by the effective theory.</description>

      <title>Classical spin liquid state in the emergent honeycomb-lattice material TbBO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical spin liquid state, owing to spin frustration between classical Ising spins on triangular motifs and interplay between competing degrees of freedom, is characterized by a macroscopically degenerate ground state and topological excitations linked to emergent gauge theories. Here, by using thermodynamic and local-probe measurements down to 16 mK, we demonstrate the exotic magnetism and spin dynamics in the nearly perfect honeycomb lattice material TbBO3. The latter embodies a frustrated lattice with a superimposed triangular lattice, constituted by additional Tb3+ ions at the center of each hexagon. Thermodynamic experiments reveal the presence of dominant antiferromagnetic exchange and significant dipolar interactions. Despite sizable antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the Tb3+ moments, muon-spin relaxation does not detect any signatures of long-range magnetic order or spin freezing down to 16 mK, corroborating the specific heat and ac susceptibility down to 45 mK. This suggests that the spin-orbit driven anisotropic exchange interaction engenders a strong frustration, crucial to induce a persistent spin dynamics. The scaling of muon relaxation rate as a function of the characteristic energy scale for several spin-liquid candidates, including TbBO3, demonstrates that a common underlying mechanism is at play. This is consistent with the NMR results on TbBO3 and reminiscent of a universal spin-liquid behavior, here attributed to dominant antiferromagnetic short-range spin correlations, confirmed by the presence of a broad magnetic diffuse scattering in the elastic and low-energy inelastic neutron scattering at Q=1.03 Ang^-1 at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that TbBO3 hosts a classical spin liquid induced by spin-orbit driven anisotropy on a frustrated honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Abnormal planar Hall effect and disentanglement of incoherent and coherent transport in a Kondo lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09908v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of localized-itinerant transition in Kondo lattice systems remains a mystery despite intensive investigations in past decades. While it is often identified from the coherent peak in magnetic resistivity, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy revealed a precursor incoherent region with band bending and hybridization fluctuations. This raises the question of how the coherent heavy-electron state is developed from an incoherent background of fluctuating localized moments and then established at sufficiently low temperatures. Here, on the example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we show that planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements provide an effective way to disentangle the incoherent Kondo scattering contribution and the coherent heavy-electron contribution, and a multi-stage process is directly visualized with lowering temperature by their distinct angle-dependent patterns in magneto-transport. Our idea may be extended to other measurements and thereby opens up a pathway for systematically investigating the fundamental physics of Kondo lattice coherence.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement takes a key role in quantum physics while how much information it can extract from many-body systems is still an open question, particularly for quantum criticalities and emergent symmetries. In this work, we systematically study the entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative (DEE) near quantum phase transitions in various quantum many-body systems. An exact one-parameter scaling relation between the DEE and system size at the critical point has been derived for the first time, which successfully obtains the critical exponent via data collapse. What's more, we find that the EE peaks at the (emergent) symmetry-enhanced first-order transition which reflects higher symmetry breaking. This work provides a new paradigm for quantum many-body research from the perspective of EE and DEE.</description>

Abstract: Quantum antiferromagnets based on the square-kagome lattice are proving to be a fertile platform for realizing nontrivial phenomena in frustrated magnetism. Recently, several decorated square-kagome compounds of the nabokoite family have been synthesized, allowing for experimental exploration of model Hamiltonians. Here, we carry out a theoretical analysis of KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl nabokoite using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian derived from density functional theory energy mapping. We employ classical Monte Carlo simulations to explain the two transitions experimentally observed in the low-temperature magnetization curve. Interestingly, the intermediate-field phase is also found in a purely two-dimensional model and is described by a spin liquid featuring subextensive degeneracy with a ferrimagnetic component. We show that this phase can be approximated by a checkerboard lattice in a magnetic field. Finally, we assess the effects of quantum fluctuations in zero fields using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group method.</description>

Abstract: We study quantum-fluctuation-driven fractionalized phases in the vicinity of altermagnetic order. First, the long-range magnetic orders in the vicinity of collinear altermagnetism are identified; these feature a non-coplanar "orbital altermagnet" which has altermagnetic symmetries in spin-rotation invariant observables. We then describe neighboring fractionalized phases with topological order reached when quantum fluctuations destroy long-range spin order, within Schwinger-boson theory and an SU(2) gauge theory of fluctuating magnetism. Discrete symmetries remain broken in some of the fractionalized phases, with the orbital altermagnet becoming an "altermagnetic spin liquid". We compute the electronic spectral function in the doped system, which is characterized by split Fermi surfaces with preserved spin-rotation symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a density-imbalanced bilayer Wigner crystal, where the ratio of electron densities in separate layers deviates slightly from unity, defects spontaneously form in one or both layers in the ground state of the system. Due to quantum tunneling, these defects become mobile and the system becomes a defect liquid. Motivated by this idea, we numerically study the semiclassical energetics of individual and paired point defects in the bilayer Wigner crystal system. We use these results in combination with a simple defect model to map the phase diagram of the defect liquid as a function of electron density and interlayer distance. Our results should be relevant for present experimental bilayer Wigner crystal systems.</description>

      <title>The large $|U|$ expansion for a half-filled asymmetric Hubbard model on a triangular ladder in the presence of spin-dependent magnetic flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a half-filled system of spin-1/2 fermions on a triangular ladder with spin-dependent hopping in the presence of spin-dependent flux. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we derive an effective spin Hamiltonian describing the infrared properties of the system in the limit of strong on-site repulsion. The expansion is performed up to the third order in the hopping amplitude over on-site interaction energy. It is shown that the low-energy spin excitations are described by an anisotropic $XXZ$ Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and an unconventional three-spin (correlated exchange) term in the presence of an extended magnetic field. The latter couples not only to $z$-projection of the total spin on a triangular plaquette but also to the product of $z$-components of three spins located on vertices of the triangle. In the case of strong attractive interaction, the corresponding effective model is derived from the repulsive one using the one-spin-component particle-hole transformation. The effective Hamiltonian is given by the same $XXZ$ Heisenberg model, as in the repulsive case, but in terms of pseudospin (charge) operators.</description>

      <title>Low-energy perspective of interacting electrons in the normal state of superconducting bilayer nickelate</title>

Abstract: Developing a low-energy model is essential for understanding unconventional superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Here, we analyze distinct low-energy scenarios of the normal state by downfolding the ab-initio determined band structure and applying the mean-field regime of rotational-invariant slave-boson theory. We compare models based on the single-site two-orbital, the two-site four-orbital and a proposed minimal cluster (MC) picture. The latter builds up on three adapted orbitals located on the sites of the basic Ni-O-Ni cluster across the bilayer. Intriguing interplay between the Hund coupling $J_{\rm H}$ and the interlayer exchange $J_{\perp}$ is encountered in the multiorbital multi-site problem. While the tendency for interlayer Ni-$d_{z^2}$ singlet formation is pronounced, a complete localization remains hindered by the coupling to the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. The correlation physics in the MC picture is peculiar with respect to the effective interorbital/site exchange.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of one-dimensional spin models via complex-time evolution of tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19269v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems poses significant challenges, which have recently become more manageable thanks to advances in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and tensor network methods. A notable development in this area is the introduction of a complex-time evolution scheme for tensor network states, originally suggested for solving Anderson impurity model and designed to suppress the growth of entanglement under time evolution. In this study, we employ the complex-time evolution scheme to investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional spin systems, specifically the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and the XXZ model. Our analysis revisits the dynamic critical exponent $z$ of the TFIM and explores the dynamical structure factor in both gapped and gapless states of the XXZ model. Importantly, the complex-time evolution reproduces the results of real-time evolution while mitigating the rapid growth of quantum entanglement typically associated with the latter. These results demonstrate that the combination of complex-time evolution and extrapolation provides a robust and efficient framework for studying the dynamics of complex quantum systems, enabling more comprehensive insights into their behavior.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Compression of Free Fermionic Quantum Circuits: Particle Creation, Arbitrary Lattices and Controlled Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently we developed a local and constructive algorithm based on Lie algebraic methods for compressing Trotterized evolution under Hamiltonians that can be mapped to free fermions. The compression algorithm yields a circuit which scales linearly in the number of qubits, has a depth independent of evolution time and compresses time-dependent Hamiltonians. The algorithm is limited to simple nearest-neighbor spin interactions and fermionic hopping. In this work, we extend our methods to compress evolution with long-range fermionic hopping, thereby enabling the embedding of arbitrary lattices onto a chain of qubits for fermion models. Moreover, we show that controlled time evolution, as well as fermion creation and annihilation operators can also be compressed. We demonstrate our results by adiabatically preparing the ground state for a half-filled fermionic chain, simulating a $4 \times 4$ tight binding model on ibmq washington, and calculating the topological Zak phase on a Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer. With these new developments, our results enable the simulation of a wider range of models of interest and the efficient compression of subcircuits.</description>

      <title>Unconventional early-time relaxation in the Rydberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that unconventional relaxation dynamics of special initial states in one-dimensional arrays of Rydberg atoms produce non-generic decay of the initial-state survival probability (SP) at very early times. Using the PXP hamiltonian as a minimal model of the Rydberg blockade, we prove that the early-time SP for states exhibiting quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) decays at a characteristic rate, whose finite-size scaling is determined solely by scars. We numerically investigate the effects of both revival-enhancing and ergodicity-restoring deformations of the PXP hamiltonian and find results consistent with the limiting cases of integrable and ergodic dynamics, respectively. We moreover argue that such unconventional early relaxation of scarred initial states is characteristic of a whole class of QMBS models. Since the SP can be easily measured experimentally, our findings enable us to probe the presence of scars at time scales much shorter than that of thermalization.</description>

      <title>Large anomalous Hall conductivity in Weyl ferrimagnet Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ predicted by density-functional calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification of topological Weyl semimetals has recently gained considerable attention. Here, we report the results of density-functional theory calculations regarding the magnetic properties, the electronic structure, and the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of the title compound, which was synthesized already 50 years ago but received little attention, hitherto. We found Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ to be a ferrimagnetic half-metal with a total spin magnetic moment of about 3 $\mu_B$ per formula unit. It shows energy band gap of 0.36 eV in the majority-spin channel and a pseudo-gap at the Fermi level in the minority-spin channel. We identified several sets of low-energy Weyl points and traced their dependence on the direction of magnetization. The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is predicted to reach a magnitude up to 500 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$, which is comparable to values obtained in other celebrated Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Tube Category, Tensor Renormalization and Topological Holography</title>

Abstract: Ocneanu's tube algebra provides a finite algorithm to compute the Drinfeld center of a fusion category. In this work we reveal the universal property underlying the tube algebra. Take a base category $\mathcal V$ which is strongly concrete, bicomplete, and closed symmetric monoidal. For physical applications one takes $\mathcal V=\mathbf{Vect}$ the category of vector spaces. Given a $\mathcal V$-enriched rigid monoidal category $\mathcal C$ (not necessarily finite or semisimple) we define the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ using coends valued in $\mathcal V$. Our main theorem established the relation between (the category of representations of) the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ and the Drinfeld center $Z(\mathcal C)$: $Z(\mathcal C)\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Fun}(\mathbb X \mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V)\cong Z(\mathcal C\hookrightarrow\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))\hookrightarrow Z(\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))$. Physically, besides viewing the tube category as a version of TFT with domain being the tube, we emphasize the "Wick-rotated" perspective, that the morphisms in $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ are the local tensors of fixed-point matrix product operators which preserves the symmetry $\mathcal C$ in one spatial dimension. We provide a first-principle flavored construction, from microscopic quantum degrees of freedom and operators preserving the symmetry, to the macroscopic universal properties of the symmetry which form the Drinfeld center. Our work is thus a proof to the 1+1D topological holography in a very general setting.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant electromagnetic responses in superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge invariance is essential for making physically meaningful predictions. In superconductors, mean-field Hamiltonians that explicitly break $U(1)$ symmetry often yield gauge-dependent results. While this issue has been resolved for linear responses in conventional superconductors, a unified framework that also covers unconventional superconductors and nonlinear responses has yet to be established. In this study, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework that enables gauge-invariant calculations of electromagnetic responses at arbitrary orders in external fields, applicable to both conventional and unconventional superconductors. Our construction generalizes the consistent-fluctuation-of-the-order-parameter (CFOP) approach to full photon vertices and admits a diagrammatic representation of the response kernel in terms of Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer-Accelerated Quantum Many-Body Ground-State Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the stabilizer formalism, in particular highly-entangled stabilizer states, can be used to describe the emergence of many-body shape collectivity from individual constituents, in a symmetry-preserving and classically efficient way. The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. While further investigations are required, the present work suggests that collective features may be associated with high but simple large-scale entanglement which can be captured by stabilizer states, while the interplay with single-particle motion may be responsible for inducing non-stabilizerness. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.</description>

      <title>Dominant orbital magnetization in the prototypical altermagnet MnTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is an unconventional form of antiferromagnetism characterized by momentum-dependent spin polarization of electronic states and zero net magnetization, arising from specific crystalline symmetries. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken time-reversal symmetry, altermagnets can exhibit finite net magnetization and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), phenomena typically associated with ferromagnets. Due to the dependence of AHE on magnetization, understanding the interplay between spin and orbital contributions to magnetization is essential for interpreting experiments and designing altermagnetic devices. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the intrinsic spin and orbital magnetization of the magnetic ground state of the prototypical altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe. We find that SOC induces weak ferromagnetism through spin canting, accompanied by a slight in-plane rotation of the N\'eel vector. Notably, we identify a significant net orbital magnetization of 0.176 {\mu}B per unit cell oriented along the z-axis, while the spin magnetization in the same direction is much smaller at 0.002 {\mu}B. By varying the chemical potential, we show that the spin magnetization is tunable through hole doping, whereas the orbital magnetization remains robust against carrier density changes. These results highlight the important role of orbital magnetization and establish its relevance for orbital-based phenomena in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity of an altermagnetic metal: Polarized BCS and inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10196</link>

Abstract: We investigate the superconductivity of two-dimensional spin-1/2 Fermi systems with $d$-wave altermagnetism under external magnetic field near zero temperature. At large altermagnetic coupling without magnetic field, we show that altermagnetism drives a second-order phase transition from the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to an inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. The inclusion of magnetic field turns the BCS state into a long-sought polarized BCS superconductor with spin-population imbalance. It also shrinks the parameter window of the FFLO state and eventually leads to a nontrivial quantum tri-critical Lifshitz point, where two second-order phase transition lines between the polarized BCS, FFLO and normal states intersect. At small altermagnetic coupling, we find the usual route to the FFLO state driven by magnetic field. The presence of the altermagnetic coupling narrows the phase window of the FFLO state and creates another quantum Lifshitz point, where a first-order transition curve meets a second-order transition line. Between the two Lifshitz points, the transition from the polarized BCS state to the normal state is smooth. Our predicted rich phase diagram is relevant to some recently discovered unconventional magnets, including RuO$_{2}$ that exhibits a relatively high superconducting temperature in the thin film limit under applied strain. Our results of unconventional superfluidity are also testable in ultracold atom laboratories, where a spin-1/2 altermagnetic Fermi gas might be realizable upon loading into two-dimensional Hubbard lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lifshitz points in an altermagnetic metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict the existence of two tri-critical quantum Lifshitz points in recently discovered $d$-wave altermagnetic metals subjected to an external magnetic field. These points connect a spatially modulated Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, a uniform polarized Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting phase, and the normal metallic phase in a nontrivial manner. Depending on whether the FFLO state is primarily induced by the magnetic field or by $d$-wave altermagnetism, we classify the corresponding Lifshitz points as field-driven or altermagnetism-driven, respectively. Notably, the two types exhibit distinct behaviors: the transition from the FFLO phase to the polarized BCS phase is first-order near the field-driven Lifshitz point, as might be expected, whereas it becomes continuous near the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point. We further explore the effects of finite temperature and find that the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point is significantly more sensitive to thermal fluctuations.</description>
