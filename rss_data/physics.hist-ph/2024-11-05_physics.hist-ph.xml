      <title>A cognitive basis for physical time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The treatment of time in relativity does not conform to that in quantum theory. In the context of quantum gravity this is called "the problem of time". A crucial difference is that time $t$ may be seen as an observable in relativity theory, just like position $x$, whereas in quantum theory $t$ is a parameter, in contrast to the observable $x$. Aiming to resolve the discrepancy, a formalization of time in the spirit of Kant's Copernican revolution is suggested, where it is required that the treatment of time in physics agree with our cognition. This leads to reconsideration of the notions of identity and change of objects, as well as the nature of physical states and their evolution. The formalization has two components: sequential time $n$ and relational time $t$. The evolution of physical states is described in terms of $n$, which is updated each time an event occurs. The role of $t$ is to quantify distances between events in space-time. There is a space-time associated with each $n$, in which $t$ represents the knowledge at time $n$ about temporal distances between present and past events. A universal ordering of events in terms of $n$ can be postulated even though distances $t$ are relativistic. In short, it is argued that time as a sequential flow of events should be separated from time as a measure of distance between events. In physical models, these aspects of time can be expressed as one evolution parameter and one observable, respectively.</description>

      <title>Why Gauges? Gauge symmetries for the classification of the physical states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note focuses the problem of motivating the use of gauge symmetries (being the identity on the observables) from general principles, beyond their practical success, starting from global gauge symmetries and then by emphasizing the substantially different role of local gauge symmetries. In the latter case, a deterministic time evolution of the local field algebra, necessary for field quantization, requires a reduction of the full local gauge group $\cal{G}$ to a residual local subgroup $\cal{G}_r$ satisfying suitable conditions. A non-trivial residual local gauge group allows for a description/construction of the physical states by using the vacuum representation of a local field algebra, otherwise precluded if $\cal{G}$ is reduced to the identity. Moreover, in the non-abelian case the non-trivial topology of the a residual $\cal{G}_r$ defines the (gauge invariant) topological invariants which classify the vacuum structure with important physical effects; furthermore, it provides a general mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking without Goldstone bosons.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum Theory of Molecules: Rigour, Idealization, and Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Philosophers have claimed that: (a) the Born-Oppenheimer approximation methods for solving molecular Schr\"odinger equations violate the Heisenberg uncertainty relations; therefore (b) so-called `quantum chemistry' is not fully quantum; and so (c) chemistry does not reduce to physics. This paper analyses the reasoning behind Born-Oppenheimer methods and shows that they are internally consistent and fully quantum mechanical, contrary to (a)-(c). Our analysis addresses important issues of mathematical rigour, physical idealisation, reduction, and classicality in the quantum theory of molecules, and we propose an agenda for the philosophy of quantum chemistry more solidly grounded in scientific practice.</description>

      <title>Born's rule from epistemic assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Born's rule is the recipe for calculating probabilities from quantum mechanical amplitudes. There is no generally accepted derivation of Born's rule from first principles. In this paper, it is motivated from assumptions that link the ontological content of a proper physical model to the epistemic conditions of the experimental context. More precisely, it is assumed that all knowable distinctions should correspond to distinctions in a proper model. This principle of "ontological completeness" means, for example, that the probabilistic treatment of the double slit experiment with and without path information should differ. Further, it is assumed that the model should rely only on knowable ontological elements, and that failure to fulfill this principle of "ontological minimalism" gives rise to wrong predictions. Consequently, probabilities should be assigned only to observable experimental outcomes. Also, the method to calculate such probabilities should not rely on the existence of a precise path of the observed object if this path is not knowable. A similar principle was promoted by Born, even though he did not apply it to probability. Another crucial assumption is that the proper rule to calculate probabilities should be generally valid. It should be applicable in all experimental contexts, regardless the setup that determines which attributes of the studied object are observed, together with the probability to observe each of the associated attribute values. There is no need to refer to the Hilbert space structure of quantum mechanics in the present treatment. Rather, some elements of this structure emerge from the analysis.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Realism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realism about quantum theory naturally leads to realism about the quantum state of the universe. It leaves open whether it is a pure state represented by a wave function, or an impure (mixed) one represented by a density matrix. I characterize and elaborate on Density Matrix Realism, the thesis that the universal quantum state is objective but can be impure. To clarify the thesis, I compare it with Wave Function Realism, explain the conditions under which they are empirically equivalent, consider two generalizations of Density Matrix Realism, and answer some frequently asked questions. I end by highlighting an implication for scientific realism.</description>

Abstract: Information is a structural pattern that represents another structural pattern. This perspective hypothesizes that modelling of structure creation through causal sets can elucidate the natural origin, evolution and ontology of information.</description>

      <title>The Separability Problem in Quantum Mechanics: Insights from Research on Axiomatics and Human Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein's article on the EPR paradox is the most cited of his works, but not many know that it was not fully representative of the way he thought about the incompleteness of the quantum formalism. Indeed, his main worry was not Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which he accepted, but the experimental non-separability of spatially separate systems. The same problem was also recognized, years later, by one of us, as part of an axiomatic analysis of the quantum formalism, which revealed an unexpected structural limitation of the quantum formalism in Hilbert space, preventing the description of separate systems. As we will explain, this limitation does not manifest at the level of the states, but of the projectors describing the properties, in the sense that there are not enough properties in the formalism to describe separate systems. The question remains whether separability is a possibility at the fundamental level and if a formalism should integrate it into its mathematical structure, as a possibility. To aid our intuition, we offer a reflection based on a powerful analogy between physical systems and human conceptual entities, as the question of separability also arises for the latter.</description>
