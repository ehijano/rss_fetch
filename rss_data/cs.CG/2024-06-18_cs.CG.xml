      <title>Approximation Algorithms for Smallest Intersecting Balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a general smallest intersecting ball problem and its soft-margin variant in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces, which only require the input objects to be compact and convex. These two problems link and unify a series of fundamental problems in computational geometry and machine learning, including smallest enclosing ball, polytope distance, intersection radius, $\ell_1$-loss support vector machine, $\ell_1$-loss support vector data description, and so on. Two general approximation algorithms are presented respectively, and implementation details are given for specific inputs of convex polytopes, reduced polytopes, axis-aligned bounding boxes, balls, and ellipsoids. For most of these inputs, our algorithms are the first results in high-dimensional spaces, and also the first approximation methods. To achieve this, we develop a novel framework for approximating zero-sum games in Euclidean Jordan algebra systems, which may be useful in its own right.</description>

      <title>Automated Mathematical Discovery and Verification: Minimizing Pentagons in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive demonstration of how automated reasoning can assist mathematical research, both in the discovery of conjectures and in their verification. Our focus is a discrete geometry problem: What is $\mu_{5}(n)$, the minimum number of convex pentagons induced by $n$ points in the plane? In the first stage toward tackling this problem, automated reasoning tools guide discovery and conjectures: we use SAT-based tools to find abstract configurations of points that would induce few pentagons. Afterward, we use Operations Research tools to find and visualize realizations of these configurations in the plane, if they exist. Mathematical thought and intuition are still vital parts of the process for turning the obtained visualizations into general constructions. A surprisingly simple upper bound follows from our constructions: $\mu_{5}(n) \leq \binom{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}{5} + \binom{\lceil n/2 \rceil}{5}$, and we conjecture it is optimal. In the second stage, we turn our focus to verifying this conjecture. Using MaxSAT, we confirm that $\mu_5(n)$ matches the conjectured values for $n \leq 16$, thereby improving both the existing lower and upper bounds for $n \in [12, 16]$. Our MaxSAT results rely on two mathematical theorems with pen-and-paper proofs, highlighting once again the rich interplay between automated and traditional mathematics.</description>

      <title>The dual of Philo's shortest line segment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dual of Philo's shortest line segment problem which asks to find the optimal line segments passing through two given points, with a common endpoint, and with the other endpoints on a given line. The provided solution uses multivariable calculus and geometry methods. Interesting connections with the angle bisector of the triangle are explored. A similar property of a symedian of a triangle is conjectured.</description>

      <title>A New and Faster Representation for Counting Integer Points in Parametric Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13788v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the counting function $E_P(y) = |P_{y} \cap Z^{n_x}|$ for a parametric polyhedron $P_{y} = \{x \in R^{n_x} \colon A x \leq b + B y\}$, where $y \in R^{n_y}$. We give a new representation of $E_P(y)$, called a \emph{piece-wise step-polynomial with periodic coefficients}, which is a generalization of piece-wise step-polynomials and integer/rational Ehrhart's quasi-polynomials. It gives the fastest way to calculate $E_P(y)$ in certain scenarios. The most important cases are the following:
  1) We show that, for the parametric polyhedron $P_y$ defined by a standard-form system $A x = y,\, x \geq 0$ with a fixed number of equalities, the function $E_P(y)$ can be represented by a polynomial-time computable function. In turn, such a representation of $E_P(y)$ can be constructed by an $poly\bigl(n, \|A\|_{\infty}\bigr)$-time algorithm;
  2) Assuming again that the number of equalities is fixed, we show that integer/rational Ehrhart's quasi-polynomials of a polytope can be computed by FPT-algorithms, parameterized by sub-determinants of $A$ or its elements;
  3) Our representation of $E_P$ is more efficient than other known approaches, if $A$ has bounded elements, especially if it is sparse in addition.
  Additionally, we provide a discussion about possible applications in the area of compiler optimization. In some "natural" assumptions on a program code, our approach has the fastest complexity bounds.</description>
