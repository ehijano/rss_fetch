      <title>Educational experiments with Particle Image Velocimetry in a small Prandtl water tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A small water tunnel was designed as a table top experiment to visualize and measure basic fluid dynamic phenomena. The visualization of the flow by a laser light sheet and the measurement with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) proves to be very instructive for teaching high school and university students. Three basic fluid dynamic experiments are reported: the determination of the vortex shedding frequency of a cylinder (von-Karman vortex street), the measurement of circulation around a flat plate and the lift coefficient of a NACA profile. All three experiments show good agreement with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>From Novice to Expert in Cloud Physics: a Graph-Based Analysis of Learner Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how learners conceptualize complex scientific systems remains a key challenge in geoscience education. We investigate the evolution of conceptual understanding of cloud physics among 153 learners, ranging from bachelor's students to disciplinary experts and representing diverse academic backgrounds across STEM. To do so, we trace how knowledge structures evolve over time using metrics from a quasi-longitudinal network analysis. The analysis characterizes the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of the epistemological shift that learners experience as they mature in their understanding of the discipline. We show that in their description of the life-cycle of a cloud, they progressively transition from the general physics of the water cycle to detailed descriptions of cloud microphysical processes. A triangulation of data sources with a panel of experts complements and confirms the analysis. The results can assist lecturers in structuring their teaching towards higher levels of understanding, and enable students to anticipate the key complexities and conceptual challenges in the field during their learning process. Furthermore, the generic nature of the analysis can be transferred to a wide range of disciplines.</description>

      <title>Exploring utilization of generative AI for research and education in data-driven materials science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI has recently had a profound impact on various fields, including daily life, research, and education. To explore its efficient utilization in data-driven materials science, we organized a hackathon -- AIMHack2024 -- in July 2024. In this hackathon, researchers from fields such as materials science, information science, bioinformatics, and condensed matter physics worked together to explore how generative AI can facilitate research and education. Based on the results of the hackathon, this paper presents topics related to (1) conducting AI-assisted software trials, (2) building AI tutors for software, and (3) developing GUI applications for software. While generative AI continues to evolve rapidly, this paper provides an early record of its application in data-driven materials science and highlights strategies for integrating AI into research and education.</description>
