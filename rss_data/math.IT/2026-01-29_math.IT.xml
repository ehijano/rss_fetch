      <title>Quick Change Detection in Discrete-Time in Presence of a Covert Adversary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of covert quickest change detection in a discrete-time setting, where a sequence of observations undergoes a distributional change at an unknown time. Unlike classical formulations, we consider a covert adversary who has knowledge of the detector's false alarm constraint parameter $\gamma$ and selects a stationary post-change distribution that depends on it, seeking to remain undetected for as long as possible. Building on the theoretical foundations of the CuSum procedure, we rigorously characterize the asymptotic behavior of the average detection delay (ADD) and the average time to false alarm (AT2FA) when the post-change distribution converges to the pre-change distribution as $\gamma \to \infty$. Our analysis establishes exact asymptotic expressions for these quantities, extending and refining classical results that no longer hold in this regime. We identify the critical scaling laws governing covert behavior and derive explicit conditions under which an adversary can maintain covertness, defined by ADD = $\Theta(\gamma)$, whereas in the classical setting, ADD grows only as $\mathcal{O}(\log \gamma)$. In particular, for Gaussian and Exponential models under adversarial perturbations of their respective parameters, we asymptotically characterize ADD as a function of the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the pre- and post-change distributions and $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>On Efficient Polyphase Network Implementation Using Successive Vector Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore an energy-efficient implementation of the polyphase network for a filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) system. The network is approximated using a greedy algorithm based on matching pursuits (MP) that converts the numerical representation directly from floating point to sum of signed powers of two (SOPOT), which is key for a multiplierless implementation. We compare this technique with other state-of-the-art methods for designing multiplierless hardware, and show that our technique achieves superior performance with similar computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Downlink mMIMO Using Dynamic Antenna and Power Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) technology and its future evolutions are expected to address the high data rate demands of sixth generation (6G) communication systems. At the same time, network energy savings (NES) is essential in reducing the operational costs and meeting the sustainability goals of network operators. In this regard, we propose a dynamic scheme for joint antenna and power adaptation to improve NES from a user scheduling and resource allocation perspective. Antenna adaptation is performed using the multiple channel state information resource signal (CSI-RS) framework. Furthermore, the recently introduced transmit power-aware link adaptation scheme, referred to as POLITE for short, is used as the power adaptation technique. The proposed scheme adapts to variations in users' instantaneous traffic and channel conditions to opportunistically maximize NES while also inherently accounting for the user throughput. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed scheme consistently achieves a balance between NES and user perceived throughput (UPT) for different network load conditions. Especially in low and light load conditions, the proposed scheme significantly improves the intra-cell interference and boosts the overall NES, while ensuring that UPT is unaffected.</description>

      <title>Shortest LCD embeddings of binary, ternary and quaternary linear codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent years, there has been active research on self-orthogonal embeddings of linear codes since they yielded some optimal self-orthogonal codes. LCD codes have a trivial hull so they are counterparts of self-orthogonal codes. So it is a natural question whether one can embed linear codes into optimal LCD codes. To answer it, we first determine the number of columns to be added to a generator matrix of a linear code in order to embed the given code into an LCD code. Then we characterize all possible forms of shortest LCD embeddings of a linear code. As examples, we start from binary and ternary Hamming codes of small lengths and obtain optimal LCD codes with minimum distance 4. Furthermore, we find new ternary LCD codes with parameters including $[23, 4, 14]$, $[23, 5, 12]$, $[24, 6, 12]$, and $[25, 5, 14]$ and a new quaternary LCD $[21, 10, 8]$ code, each of which has minimum distance one greater than those of known codes. This shows that our shortest LCD embedding method is useful in finding optimal LCD codes over various fields.</description>

      <title>Helper-Assisted Coding for Gaussian Wiretap Channels: Deep Learning Meets PhySec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the Gaussian wiretap channel, where a transmitter wishes to send a confidential message to a legitimate receiver in the presence of an eavesdropper. It is well known that if the eavesdropper experiences less channel noise than the legitimate receiver, then it is impossible for the transmitter to achieve positive secrecy rates. A known solution to this issue consists in involving a second transmitter, referred to as a helper, to help the first transmitter to achieve security. While such a solution has been studied for the asymptotic blocklength regime and via non-constructive coding schemes, in this paper, for the first time, we design explicit and short blocklength codes using deep learning and cryptographic tools to demonstrate the benefit and practicality of cooperation between two transmitters over the wiretap channel. Specifically, our proposed codes show strict improvement in terms of information leakage compared to existing codes that do not consider a helper. Our code design approach relies on a reliability layer, implemented with an autoencoder architecture based on the successive interference cancellation method, and a security layer implemented with universal hash functions. We also propose an alternative autoencoder architecture that significantly reduces training time by allowing the decoders to independently estimate messages without successively canceling interference by the receiver during training. Additionally, we show that our code design is also applicable to the multiple access wiretap channel with helpers, where two transmitters send confidential messages to the legitimate receiver.</description>

      <title>Reflected wireless signals under random spatial sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a propagation model showing that a transmitter randomly positioned in space generates unbounded peaks in the histogram of the resulting power, provided the signal strength is an oscillating or non-monotonic function of distance. Specifically, these peaks are singularities in the empirical probability density that occur at turning point values of the deterministic propagation model. We explain the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon through a concise mathematical argument. This observation has direct implications for estimating random propagation effects such as fading, particularly when reflections off walls are involved.
  Motivated by understanding intelligent surfaces, we apply this fundamental result to a physical model consisting of a single transmitter between two parallel passive walls. We analyze signal fading due to reflections and observe power oscillations resulting from wall reflections -- a phenomenon long studied in waveguides but relatively unexplored in wireless networks. For the special case where the transmitter is placed halfway between the walls, we present a compact closed-form expression for the received signal involving the Lerch transcendent function. The insights from this work can inform design decisions for intelligent surfaces deployed in cities.</description>

      <title>Anytime-Valid Quantum Tomography via Confidence Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we address the problem of developing quantum state tomography (QST) methods that remain valid at any time during a sequence of measurements. Specifically, the aim is to provide a rigorous quantification of the uncertainty associated with the current state estimate as data are acquired incrementally. To this end, the proposed framework augments existing QST techniques by associating current point estimates of the state with confidence sets that are guaranteed to contain the true quantum state with a user-defined probability. The methodology is grounded in recent statistical advances in anytime-valid confidence sequences. Numerical results confirm the theoretical coverage properties of the proposed anytime-valid QST.</description>

      <title>Repeater-Assisted Massive MIMO Full-Duplex Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a wireless network comprising multiple singleantenna repeaters that amplify and instantaneously re-transmit received signals in a full-duplex (FD) communication setting. Specifically, we study a massive multiple-input multiple output base station that simultaneously serves multiple uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) user equipment (UE) over the same frequency band. The focus is on the problem of repeater weight optimization at each active repeater to maximize the sum of the weighted minimum spectral efficiencies (SEs) for both UL and DL UEs. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is tackled using a successive convex approximation technique. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we evaluate its performance against benchmark systems with and without repeater assistance. The optimized FD design achieves SE improvements of up to 4-fold and 2.5-fold compared to its half-duplex counterpart.</description>

      <title>Construction and Decoding of Convolutional Codes with optimal Column Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of Maximum Distance Profile (MDP) convolutional codes in general requires the use of very large finite fields. In contrast convolutional codes with optimal column distances maximize the column distances for a given arbitrary finite field. In this paper, we present a construction of such convolutional codes. In addition, we prove that for the considered parameters the codes that we constructed are the only ones achieving optimal column distances. The structure of the presented convolutional codes with optimal column distances is strongly related to first order Reed-Muller block codes and we leverage this fact to develop a reduced complexity version of the Viterbi algorithm for these codes.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Pilot-Aided Doppler Ambiguity Estimation for OTFS Parametric Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation offers robust performance in high-mobility scenarios by transforming time-varying channels into the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. However, in high-mobility environment such as emerging 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), the extreme orbital velocities of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites frequently cause the physical Doppler shifts to exceed the fundamental grid range. This Doppler ambiguity induces severe model mismatch and renders traditional MLE channel estimators ineffective. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel low-complexity pilot-aided Doppler ambiguity detection and compensation framework. We first mathematically derive the OTFS input-output relationship in the presence of aliasing, revealing that Doppler ambiguity manifests itself as a distinct phase rotation along the delay dimension. Leveraging this insight, we developed a two-stage estimator that utilizes pairwise phase differences between pilot symbols to identify the integer ambiguity, followed by a refined Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for channel recovery. We investigate two pilot arrangements, Embedded Pilot with Guard Zone (EP-GZ) and Data-Surrounded Pilot (DSP), to analyze the trade-off between interference suppression and spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively eliminates the error floor caused by ambiguity, achieving Bit Error Rate (BER) and Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) performance comparable to the exhaustive search benchmark while maintaining a computational complexity similar to standard MLE.</description>

      <title>Order-Optimal Sample Complexity of Rectified Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, flow-based generative models have shown superior efficiency compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we study rectified flow models, which constrain transport trajectories to be linear from the base distribution to the data distribution. This structural restriction greatly accelerates sampling, often enabling high-quality generation with a single Euler step. Under standard assumptions on the neural network classes used to parameterize the velocity field and data distribution, we prove that rectified flows achieve sample complexity $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$. This improves on the best known $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$ bounds for flow matching model and matches the optimal rate for mean estimation. Our analysis exploits the particular structure of rectified flows: because the model is trained with a squared loss along linear paths, the associated hypothesis class admits a sharply controlled localized Rademacher complexity. This yields the improved, order-optimal sample complexity and provides a theoretical explanation for the strong empirical performance of rectified flow models.</description>

Abstract: We study the supervised training dynamics of neural classifiers through the lens of binary hypothesis testing. We model classification as a set of binary tests between class-conditional distributions of representations and empirically show that, along training trajectories, well-generalizing networks increasingly align with Neyman-Pearson optimal decision rules via monotonic improvements in KL divergence that relate to error rate exponents. We finally discuss how this yields an explanation and possible training or regularization strategies for different classes of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Dependable Connectivity for Industrial Wireless Communication Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dependability - a system's ability to consistently provide reliable services by ensuring safety and maintainability in the face of internal or external disruptions - is a fundamental requirement for industrial wireless communication networks (IWCNs). While 5G ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) addresses some aspects of this challenge, its evolution toward holistic dependability in 6G must encompass reliability, availability, safety, and security. This paper provides a comprehensive framework for dependable IWCNs, bridging theory and practice. We first establish the theoretical foundations of dependability, including outlining its key attributes and presenting analytical tools to study it. Next, we explore practical enablers, such as adaptive multiple access schemes leveraging real-time monitoring and time-sensitive networking to ensure end-to-end determinism. A case study demonstrates how intelligent wake-up protocols improve event detection probability by orders of magnitude compared to conventional duty cycling. Finally, we outline open challenges and future directions for a 6G-driven dependable IWCN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15955v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inter-symbol interference (ISI) limits reliability in diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) channels. We propose RLIM, a family of run-length-limited (RLL) codes that form fixed-size codebooks by minimizing the total number of 1-bits, increasing the per-symbol molecule budget under standard power normalizations and thus improving reliability. We develop a provably optimal linear-time greedy decoder that is equivalent to Viterbi decoding under a deterministic last-wins tie-break and has lower computational complexity; empirically, it outperforms first-wins and random Viterbi variants on RLL baselines. Extensive binomial and particle-tracking simulations show that RLIM achieves lower bit error rate (BER) than classical RLL and other prominent coding schemes across a broad range of scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We undertake a Shannon theoretic study of the problem of communicating bit streams over a 3-user quantum interference channel (QIC) and focus on characterizing inner bounds. Adopting the powerful technique of tilting, smoothing, and augmentation discovered by Sen recently, and combining with our coset code strategy, we derive a new inner bound to the classical-quantum capacity region of a 3-user QIC. The derived inner bound subsumes all currently known bounds and is proven to be strictly larger for identified examples.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic Backscatter Communication: A Design Perspective on the Modulation Scheme of Backscatter Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbiotic Backscatter Communication (SBC) has emerged as a spectrum-efficient and low-power communication technology, where backscatter devices (BDs) modulate and reflect incident radio frequency (RF) signals from primary transmitters (PTs). While previous studies have assumed a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) distribution for the BD's signal, this assumption may not be practical because the high complexity of generating CSCG signals is not supported by the low-cost BD. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating SBC for two low-complexity modulation schemes, i.e., $M$-ary amplitude-shift keying (MASK) and $M$-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK), where BD's signals inherently deviate from CSCG distribution. Our goal is to derive the achievable rate of the PT and BD under the MASK/MPSK and to design MASK/MPSK modulation scheme for maximizing the PT's rate. Towards this end, we first derive the expressions of both the PT's rate and BD's rate. Theoretical results reveal that whether or not the BD improves the PT's rate depends on the phase of MASK/MPSK modulation, while the BD's rate is independent of this phase. We then formulate two optimization problems to maximize the PT's rate by adjusting the phase under the MASK and MPSK modulation schemes, respectively, and derive the optimal phases for each modulation scheme in closed forms. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal phase of MASK/MPSK can ensure an improvement in the PT's rate, and reveal that a low-order ASK modulation is better than a low-order PSK for the BD in terms of improving PT's rate, especially when the direct link is not significantly weaker than the backscatter link in SBC.</description>

      <title>Data Fusion and Aggregation Methods to Develop Composite Indexes for a Sustainable Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09204</link>

Abstract: Research on environmental risk modeling relies on numerous indicators to quantify the magnitude and frequency of extreme climate events, their ecological, economic, and social impacts, and the coping mechanisms that can reduce or mitigate their adverse effects. Index-based approaches significantly simplify the process of quantifying, comparing, and monitoring risks associated with other natural hazards, as a large set of indicators can be condensed into a few key performance indicators. Data fusion techniques are often used in conjunction with expert opinions to develop key performance indicators. This paper discusses alternative methods to combine data from multiple indicators, with an emphasis on their use-case scenarios, underlying assumptions, data requirements, advantages, and limitations. The paper demonstrates the application of these data fusion methods through examples from current risk and resilience models and simplified datasets. Simulations are conducted to identify their strengths and weaknesses under various scenarios. Finally, a real-life example illustrates how these data fusion techniques can be applied to inform policy recommendations in the context of drought resilience and sustainability.</description>

      <title>On the Error Rate of Binary BCH Codes under Error-and-erasure Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the exact decoding error probability of linear block codes is an interesting problem. For binary BCH codes, McEliece derived methods to estimate the error probability of a simple bounded distance decoding (BDD) for BCH codes. However, BDD falls short in many applications. In this work, we consider error-and-erasure decoding and its improved variants. We derive closed-form expressions for their error probabilities and validate them through simulations. Then, we illustrate their use in assessing concatenated coding schemes.</description>

      <title>A Parallelization Strategy for GRAND with Optimality Guarantee by Exploiting Error Pattern Tree Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parallelism has become a central concern in modern decoding frameworks aiming to meet stringent throughput and latency requirements. Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) is a recently proposed decoding paradigm that tests candidate Error Patterns (EPs) until a valid codeword is found. Among its variants, Soft GRAND (SGRAND) achieves maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding but relies on real-time generation and likelihood ordering of EPs, making parallel execution nontrivial under the ML optimality constraint. In this work, we introduce a unified binary tree representation of EPs, termed the EP tree, which formalizes the hierarchical structure underlying SGRAND and Ordered Reliability Bits (ORB) GRAND algorithms, enabling structured organization of EPs and algorithmic-level parallel exploration. Building upon this unified framework, we propose a parallel design of SGRAND that preserves ML optimality while significantly reducing decoding complexity through pruning strategies and tree-based computation. Furthermore, we develop an enhanced ORBGRAND algorithm based on the same EP tree representation, improving decoding performance toward ML while retaining parallel efficiency. Numerical experiments show that the proposed parallel SGRAND achieves a $3.96\times$ reduction in decoding latency compared with its serial counterpart, while the enhanced ORBGRAND achieves a $4.21\times$ speedup, demonstrating the effectiveness of the unified tree-based framework and its strong potential for future algorithmic and hardware optimizations.</description>

      <title>Adversary-Aware Private Inference over Wireless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-based sensing at wireless edge devices has the potential to significantly enhance Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, particularly for vision and perception tasks such as in autonomous driving and environmental monitoring. AI systems rely both on efficient model learning and inference. In the inference phase, features extracted from sensing data are utilized for prediction tasks (e.g., classification or regression). In edge networks, sensors and model servers are often not co-located, which requires communication of features. As sensitive personal data can be reconstructed by an adversary, transformation of the features are required to reduce the risk of privacy violations. While differential privacy mechanisms provide a means of protecting finite datasets, protection of individual features has not been addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving AI-based sensing, where devices apply transformations of extracted features before transmission to a model server.</description>

      <title>Multi-hop Parallel Image Semantic Communication for Distortion Accumulation Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing semantic communication schemes primarily focus on single-hop scenarios, overlooking the challenges of multi-hop wireless image transmission. As semantic communication is inherently lossy, distortion accumulates over multiple hops, leading to significant performance degradation. To address this, we propose the multi-hop parallel image semantic communication (MHPSC) framework, which introduces a parallel residual compensation link at each hop against distortion accumulation. To minimize the associated transmission bandwidth overhead, a coarse-to-fine residual compression scheme is designed. A deep learning-based residual compressor first condenses the residuals, followed by the adaptive arithmetic coding (AAC) for further compression. A residual distribution estimation module predicts the prior distribution for the AAC to achieve fine compression performances. This approach ensures robust multi-hop image transmission with only a minor increase in transmission bandwidth. Experimental results confirm that MHPSC outperforms both existing semantic communication and traditional separated coding schemes.</description>

      <title>Bounds in the Projective Unitary Group with Respect to Global Phase Invariant Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a global phase-invariant metric in the projective unitary group PUn, relevant for universal quantum computing. We obtain the volume and measure of small metric ball in PUn and derive the Gilbert-Varshamov and Hamming bounds in PUn. In addition, we provide upper and lower bounds for the kissing radius of the codebooks in PUn as a function of the minimum distance. Using the lower bound of the kissing radius, we find a tight Hamming bound. Also, we establish bounds on the distortion-rate function for quantizing a source uniformly distributed over PUn. As example codebooks in PUn, we consider the projective Pauli and Clifford groups, as well as the projective group of diagonal gates in the Clifford hierarchy, and find their minimum distances. For any code in PUn with given cardinality we provide a lower bound of covering radius. Also, we provide expected value of the covering radius of randomly distributed points on PUn, when cardinality of code is sufficiently large. We discuss codebooks at various stages of the projective Clifford + T and projective Clifford + S constructions in PU2, and obtain their minimum distance, distortion, and covering radius. Finally, we verify the analytical results by simulation.</description>
