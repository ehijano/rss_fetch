      <title>The radiative decay of scalar glueball from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first lattice QCD study on the radiative decay of the scalar glueball to the vector meson $\phi$ in the quenched approximation. The calculations are carried out on three gauge ensembles with different lattice spaicings, which enable us to do the continuum extrapolation. We first revisit the radiative $J/\psi$ decay into the scalar glueball $G$ and obtain the partial decay width $\Gamma(J/\psi \to \gamma G)=0.449(44)~\text{keV}$ and the branching fraction $\text{Br}(J/\psi \to \gamma G) = 4.8(5)\times 10^{-3}$, which are in agreement with the previous lattice results. We then extend the similar calculation to the process $G\to \gamma \phi$ and get the partial decay width $\Gamma(G \to \gamma \phi)= 0.074(47)~\text{keV}$, which implies that the combined branching fraction of $J/\psi\to\gamma G\to \gamma\gamma\phi$ is as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-9})$ such that this process is hardly detected by the BESIII experiment even with the large $J/\psi$ sample of $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$. With the vector meson dominance model, the two-photon decay width of the scalar glueball is estimated to be $\Gamma(G\to\gamma\gamma)=0.53(46)~\text{eV}$, which results in a large stickiness $S(G)\sim \mathcal{O}(10^4)$ of the scalar glueball by assuming the stickiness of $f_2(1270)$ to be one.</description>

      <title>A nonperturbative test of nucleation calculations for strong phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleation rate computations are of broad importance in particle physics and cosmology. Perturbative calculations are often used to compute the nucleation rate $\Gamma$, but these are incomplete. We perform nonperturbative lattice simulations of nucleation in a scalar field theory with a tree-level barrier, computing a final result extrapolated to the thermodynamic and continuum limits. Although the system in question should be well-described by a complete one-loop perturbative calculation, we find only qualitative agreement with the full perturbative result, with a 20% discrepancy in $|\log \Gamma|$. Our result motivates further testing of the current nucleation paradigm.</description>

      <title>Duality transformations and the entanglement entropy of gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of entanglement in gauge theories is expected to provide insights into many fundamental phenomena, including confinement. However, calculations of quantities related to entanglement in gauge theories are limited by ambiguities that stem from the non-factorizability of the Hilbert space. In this work we study lattice gauge theories that admit a dual description in terms of spin models, for which the replica trick and R\'enyi entropies are well defined. In the first part of this work, we explicitly perform the duality transformation in a replica geometry, deriving the structure of a replica space for a gauge theory. Then, in the second part, we calculate, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, the entropic c-function of the $\Z_2$ gauge theory in three spacetime dimension, exploiting its dual description in terms of the three-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <title>Lattice Regularization of Reduced K\"{a}hler-Dirac Fermions and Connections to Chiral Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how a path integral for reduced K\"{a}hler-Dirac fermions suffers from a phase ambiguity associated with the fermion measure that is an analog of the measure problem seen for chiral fermions. However, unlike the case of chiral symmetry, a doubler free lattice action exists which is invariant under the corresponding onsite symmetry. This allows for a clear diagnosis and solution to the problem using mirror fermions resulting in a unique gauge invariant measure. By introducing an appropriate set of Yukawa interactions which are consistent with 't Hooft anomaly cancellation we conjecture the mirrors can be decoupled from low energy physics. Moreover, the minimal such K\"{a}hler-Dirac mirror model yields a light sector which corresponds, in the flat space continuum limit, to the Pati-Salam GUT model.</description>

      <title>Action of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry on the 't~Hooft line operator: A lattice gauge theory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how the symmetry operator of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry acts on the 't~Hooft line operator in the $U(1)$ gauge theory by employing the modified Villain-type lattice formulation. We model the axial anomaly by a compact scalar boson, the ``QED axion''. For the gauge invariance, the simple 't~Hooft line operator, which is defined by a line integral of the dual $U(1)$ gauge potential, must be ``dressed'' by the scalar and $U(1)$ gauge fields. A careful consideration on the basis of the anomalous Ward--Takahashi identity containing the 't~Hooft operator with the dressing factor and a precise definition of the symmetry operator on the lattice shows that the symmetry operator leaves no effect when it sweeps out a 't~Hooft loop operator. This result appears inequivalent with the phenomenon concluded in the continuum theory. The same result is obtained for the axion string operator.</description>

      <title>On the Proof of Chiral Symmetry Breaking from Anomaly Matching in QCD-like Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We critically reconsider the argument based on 't Hooft anomaly matching that aims at proving chiral symmetry breaking in 4d QCD-like theories with $N_c&gt;2$ colors and $N_f$ flavors. The main line of reasoning relies on a property of the solutions of the anomaly matching and persistent mass equations called $N_f$-independence. In previous works, the validity of $N_f$-independence was assumed based on qualitative arguments, but it was never proven rigorously. We provide a detailed proof and clarify under which (dynamical) conditions it holds. Our results are valid for a generic spectrum of massless composite fermions including baryons and exotics.</description>

      <title>Estimating truncation effects of quantum bosonic systems using sampling algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To simulate bosons on a qubit- or qudit-based quantum computer, one has to regularize the theory by truncating infinite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces to finite dimensions. In the search for practical quantum applications, it is important to know how big the truncation errors can be. In general, it is not easy to estimate errors unless we have a good quantum computer. In this paper, we show that traditional sampling methods on classical devices, specifically Markov Chain Monte Carlo, can address this issue for a rather generic class of bosonic systems with a reasonable amount of computational resources available today. As a demonstration, we apply this idea to the scalar field theory on a two-dimensional lattice, with a size that goes beyond what is achievable using exact diagonalization methods. This method can be used to estimate the resources needed for realistic quantum simulations of bosonic theories, and also, to check the validity of the results of the corresponding quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquark states in the constituent quark model using diffusion Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the diffusion Monte Carlo method to calculate the doubly heavy tetraquark $T_{cc}$ system in two kinds of constituent quark models, the pure constituent quark model AL1/AP1 and the chiral constituent quark model. When the discrete configurations are complete and no spatial clustering is preseted, the AL1/AP1 model gives an energy of $T_{cc}$ close to the $DD^*$ threshold, and the chiral constituent quark model yields a deeply bound state. We further calculate all doubly heavy tetraquark systems with $J^P=0^+,1^+,2^+$, and provide the binding energies of systems with bound states. The $I(J^P)=0(0^+)$ $bc\bar{n}\bar{n}$, $0(1^+)$ $bb\bar{n}\bar{n}$, $0(1^+)$ $bc\bar{n}\bar{n}$, $\frac{1}{2}(1^+)$ $bb\bar{s}\bar{n}$ systems have bound states in all three models. Since the DMC method has almost no restriction on the spatial part, the resulting bound states have greater binding energies than those obtained in previous works.</description>
