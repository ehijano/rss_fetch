      <title>Total cross section of the process $e^+ + e^- \to \Sigma^+ + \bar{\Sigma}^-$ including the $D$-meson loop and three-gluon contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we investigate the production of a baryon pair in $e^+e^-$ annihilation to study the structure of baryons. To study the basic structure of the Standard Model, it is also necessary to consider the baryon-antibaryon pair production at the electron-positron linear collider. The production of a baryon pair in electron-positron annihilation provides a powerful tool at higher center-of-mass energies. In this work, we present phenomenological results for $\Sigma^+ \bar {\Sigma}^-$ production in $e^+e^-$ collision at the BESIII Collider. We investigate a hyperon pair produced in the reaction $e^+e^- \to \Sigma^+ \bar{\Sigma}^-$. Two different contributions are considered: the $D$ meson loop and the three-gluon charmonium annihilation loop. Taking into account the contributions of the $D$-meson loop and three-gluon loops and the interference of all diagrams, we calculate the total cross section of the process $e^+e^- \to \Sigma^+ \bar{\Sigma}^-$. With respect to a purely electromagnetic mechanism, large relative phases are generated for these contributions. We obtain as a byproduct a fit of the electromagnetic form factor of the $\Sigma$ hyperon for a large momentum transferred region. In this process, in addition to $\psi(3770)$ charmonium, we also take into account the contributions of other charmonium (-like) states, $\psi(4040)$, \,\,$\psi(4160)$, \,\,$Y(4230)$,\,\,$Y(4360)$,\,\,$\psi(4415)$, and $Y(4660)$. The obtained results are in good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>A Universal Bound on QCD Axions from Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a new production channel for QCD axions in supernova environments that contributes to axion emissivity for all models solving the strong CP problem. This channel arises at tree-level from a shift-symmetry-breaking operator constructed at next-to-leading order in Chiral Perturbation Theory. In scenarios where model-dependent derivative couplings to nucleons are absent, this sets the strongest model-independent constraint on the axion mass, improving on existing bounds by two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons Induced Thermal Friction on Axion Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and interactions of the solitonic domain walls that occur in realistic axion electrodynamics models including the Chern-Simons interaction, $a\epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}F^{\mu\nu} F^{\lambda\sigma}$, between an axion $a(x)$ of mass $m_a$, and a massless U(1) gauge field, e.g. EM, interacting with strength $\alpha=e^2/4\pi$ with charged matter, e.g. electron-positron pairs. In particular, in the presence of a U(1) gauge-and-matter relativistic thermal plasma we study the friction experienced by the walls due to the Chern-Simons term. Utilizing the linear response method we include the collective effects of the plasma, as opposed to purely particle scattering across the wall (as is done in previous treatments) which is valid only in the thin wall regime that is rarely applicable in realistic cases. We show that the friction depends on the Lorentz-$\gamma$-factor-dependent inverse thickness of the wall in the plasma frame, $\ell^{-1} \sim \gamma m_a$, compared to the three different plasma scales, the temperature $T$, the Debye mass $m_D\sim\sqrt{\alpha} T$, and the damping rate $\Gamma \sim \alpha^2 T$, and elucidate the underlying physical intuition for this behavior. (For friction in the thin-wall-limit we correct previous expressions in the literature.) We further consider the effects of long-range coherent magnetic fields that are possibly present in the early universe and compare their effect with that of thermal magnetic fields. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible early universe consequences of our results for domain wall motion and network decay, stochastic gravitational wave production from domain wall networks, and possible primordial black hole production from domain wall collapse, though a more complete discussion of these topics is reserved for a companion paper.</description>

      <title>$\pi$-$\pi$ scattering lengths: electric corrections in the linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the frame of the linear sigma model and working in the weak field approximation, we discuss the role played by an external electric field on the behavior of $\pi$-$\pi$ scattering lengths. For this purpose, we have considered all relevant one-loop diagrams in the $s$, $t$, and $u$ channels where we have Schwinger propagators for charged pions. An important novelty of our analysis, compared with previous existing discussions in the literature, is the explicit calculation of box diagrams which were previously not considered in discussions regarding magnetic corrections to $\pi$-$\pi$ scattering lengths. Our analysis shows that electric field corrections have an opposite effect with respect to the previously calculated magnetic corrections.</description>

      <title>Dalitz-plot decomposition for the $e^+ e^- \to J/\psi \, \pi \, \pi \, (K \bar{K})$ and $e^+ e^- \to h_c \, \pi \, \pi$ processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the $e^+ e^- \to \gamma^* \to J/\psi \, \pi \, \pi \, (K \bar{K})$ and $e^+ e^- \to \gamma^* \to h_c \, \pi \, \pi$ processes employing the recently proposed Dalitz-plot decomposition approach, which is based on the helicity formalism for three-body decays. For the above reactions, we validate the factorization of the overall rotation for all decay chains and spin alignments, along with the crossing symmetry between final states, using a Lagrangian-based toy model. For $e^+ e^-$ production processes, which basically only involve production by transverse photons, the incorporation of the spin-density matrix along with the additional matching rotation is performed. For the model-dependent factors that describe the subchannel dynamics, we employ the dispersive treatment of the $\pi \, \pi \, (K \bar{K})$ final state interaction, which accurately reproduces pole positions and couplings of the $f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ resonances. The constructed amplitudes serve as an essential framework to further constrain the properties of the charged exotic states $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_c(4020)$, produced in these reactions.</description>

      <title>Discerning EFTs through multi-Higgs production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these proceedings we present the main results of [arXiv:2311.04280 [hep-ph]], where we explore the phenomenological implications of multi-Higgs boson production through longitudinal vector boson scattering within the framework of Effective Field Theories (EFTs). We derive compact expressions for effective tree-level amplitudes involving up to four final-state Higgs bosons. Subsequently, we compute total cross sections for scenarios relevant to the LHC, where we observe that the general Higgs Effective Theory (HEFT) prediction avoids the strong suppression found in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), typically expected to be several orders of magnitude smaller.</description>

      <title>Effect of Asymmetric Nuclear Medium on the Valence Quark Structure of the Kaons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of asymmetric nuclear medium on the properties of kaon is investigated at zero and finite temperature employing a hybrid approach integrating the light cone quark model (LCQM) and the chiral SU(3) quark mean field (CQMF) model. The in-medium quark masses are calculated within the CQMF model and are used as inputs to study the medium modifications in the kaon properties. In particular, we have analysed the impact of baryonic density, isospin asymmetry and temperature on the weak decay constant, distribution amplitudes (DAs) and parton quark distributions (PDFs) of valence quark structure of kaons. The effects of isospin asymmetry on the kaon doublet $K =\left(\begin{array}{c} K^{+} \\ K^{0} \end{array} \right)$ and antikaon doublet $\bar{K}$= ($K^-, \bar{K}^0$) are also studied. In order to compare with future experiments, we have also evolved the in-medium DAs and PDFs of kaons to $Q^2=16$ GeV$^2$. As compared to the temperature and isospin asymmetry, change in baryonic density of the nuclear medium makes more significant changes to the DAs and PDFs of kaons.</description>

      <title>New MiniBooNE excess interpretation using Pseudo-Hermitian neutrino oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excess observed in the MiniBooNE experiment data has been confirmed by several data-releases and analysis. And several attempts to explain such excess are proposed in the litterature using approaches ranging from experimental error to new neutrino theories. None of the attempts seem to fully account for the observed excess. In this paper, we present a new approach this case using a non standard two flavor oscillation theory. In recent years, there is a raising interest in the pseudo-hermitian hamiltonian theories and their impact on several quantum phenomena. The neutrino oscillation is modified using the approach of PT-pseudo hermitian oscillation by having zero-distance effect and asymmetry of the probability of appearance of specific flavors. Such effects can account according to this study for the excess and has a better fit to the data than the best found fit in the standard oscillation framework. We present in this paper the study of the fit of MiniBooNE data the this new oscillation model and its premise.</description>

      <title>Probing a light Higgs in $ H \to hh \to b\bar{b}\tau\tau$ in Type-I 2HDM at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the potential to probe the process $gg \to H_{\text{SM-like}} \to hh \to b\bar{b}\tau\tau$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), within the framework of the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-I. After performing a detailed Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, we focus on isolating the signal from the Standard Model (SM) backgrounds. Our analysis employs a dedicated trigger choice and optimised kinematic selection to improve the signal sensitivity. We demonstrate some sensitivity to this decay channel at Run 3, while the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) can provide discovery evidence.</description>

      <title>SIGMA: Single Interpolated Generative Model for Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key step in any resonant anomaly detection search is accurate modeling of the background distribution in each signal region. Data-driven methods like CATHODE accomplish this by training separate generative models on the complement of each signal region, and interpolating them into their corresponding signal regions. Having to re-train the generative model on essentially the entire dataset for each signal region is a major computational cost in a typical sliding window search with many signal regions. Here, we present SIGMA, a new, fully data-driven, computationally-efficient method for estimating background distributions. The idea is to train a single generative model on all of the data and interpolate its parameters in sideband regions in order to obtain a model for the background in the signal region. The SIGMA method significantly reduces the computational cost compared to previous approaches, while retaining a similar high quality of background modeling and sensitivity to anomalous signals.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $KN$ elastic and charge exchange reactions in search of the pentaquark $\Theta^+$ baryon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the search for the pentaquark $\Theta^+$ baryon, the world data on $K^+n\to K^+n$ and $K^+n\to K^0\,p$ reactions on the deuteron target and $K^0\,p\to K^+n$ and $K^0_L\,p\to K^0_S\,p$ reactions on the hydrogen target are revisited to study the isoscalar component of the scattering amplitudes. The determination of the $s$- and $p$-wave phase shifts for the two former channels on the deuteron target is presented in the low momentum region with the uncertainty due to the deuteron form factors at forward angles discussed. For the reactions on hydrogen targets, a similarity expected from time reversal between the charge exchange processes $K^+n\to K^0\,p$ and $K^0\,p\to K^+n$ is exploited, while we present the analysis of the $K_L^0\,p\to K_S^0\,p$ scattering based on the $s$-wave phase shift for low momenta combined with the $t$-channel $\rho^0(775)+\omega(782)+\phi(1020)$ vector meson exchange at high momenta. With the mass 1535 MeV and decay width 5 MeV the possibility of the $\Theta^+$ in the Breit-Wigner (BW) form is tested in the differential cross section measured by C. J. S. Damerell {\it et\ al.} at ${\rm P_{Lab}}=434$ MeV/$c$ and polarization. Our analysis suggests measuring the polarization observable rather than the differential cross section, which has sufficient sensitivity to distinguish the $\Theta^+$ baryon among all spin and parity states $J^P = 1/2^\pm$ and $3/2^\pm$.</description>

      <title>Angular observables of the four-fold $B \to K_{1}(1270,1400)(\to V P) \ell^{+}\ell^{-}$ decays in and beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the lepton flavor universality ratios $R^{\mu e}_{K}$ and $R^{\mu e}_{K^*}$ in $B\to \left(K, K^*\right)\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\left(e^+e^-\right)$ at LHCb align with the Standard Model predictions, necessitating search for the complementary decay modes. In this context, we derive the angular decay distributions of the four-fold $B \to K_{1}(1270,1400)(\to V P) \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decays, where $K_1 $ is an axial-vector meson, $V=\rho, K^{\ast}$, and $P=K, \pi$. Considering the weak effective Hamiltonian with vector and axial-vector new physics operators, and employing the helicity formalism, we obtain the four-dimensional differential decay distributions and extract various physical observables. These include differential branching ratios, lepton forward-backward asymmetry, forward-backward asymmetry for transversely polarized $K_1$ meson, longitudinal and transverse polarization fractions of the $K_1$ meson, and the normalized angular coefficients with longitudinally and transversely polarized final state vector meson $V$, in the cascade decay $K_1\to VP$. Based on the latest global fit analysis data for all $b\to s$ transitions, we predict the results of these observables in various bins of the square of the momentum transfer, $q^2$. Our findings indicate that these physical observables are not only sensitive to new physics but can also differentiate between various new physics scenarios in certain kinematical regions. The precise measurements of these observables in $B \to K_{1}(1270,1400)(\to V P) \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decays at current and future experiments will provide opportunities for the complementary searches for physics beyond the Standard Model in $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ decays.</description>

      <title>Direct detection of Higgs portal for light self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can address the small-scale anomalies and previous researches focused on such a SIDM heavier than GeV, for which the self-scattering cross-section is in the quantum resonance region and has a non-trivial velocity dependence. For a SIDM lighter than GeV, the self-scattering cross-section falls within the Born region. In this work, considering the constraints from CMB, BBN and the DM relic density, we investigate the direct detection of the Higgs portal for a sub-GeV SIDM with a scalar mediator. For this end, we consider two approaches : one is the cosmic-ray accelerated dark matter (CRDM) scattering off the nucleon, the other is the electron recoil caused by the halo dark matter. We present direct detection limits for the parameter space of light SIDM and scalar mediator. We find that the detectability in either approach needs a sizable mediator-Higgs mixing angle ($\sin\theta$) which is larger than one for the CRDM approach and larger than $10^{-3}$ for the electron recoil approach. While the former case cannot be realized in the Higgs-portal light SIDM model with a scalar mediator, the latter case may also be constrained by some astrophysical observations or beam dump experiment. Anyway, even if other constraints are quite stringent, the direct detection may provide independent limits for such a sub-GeV SIDM.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of spin and orbital angular momenta of $\gamma$ photon in nonlinear Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy vortex $\gamma$ photons have significant applications in many fields, however, their generation and angular momentum manipulation are still great challenges. Here, we first investigated the generation of vortex $\gamma$ photons with controllable spin and orbital angular momenta via nonlinear Compton scattering of two-color counter-rotating circularly polarized (CP) laser fields. The radiation probability of vortex photons are calculated using the semiclassical approach that resolves angular momenta of emitted photons. We find that the angular momenta transferred to emitted photons are determined by the dominating photon absorption channel, leading to a structured spectrum with alternations in chirality and twisted direction. By tuning the relative intensity ratio of the two-color CP laser fields, the polarization and vortex charge of the emitted $\gamma$ photons can be controlled, enabling the generation of circularly polarized vortex $\gamma$ photons with a user-defined polarization and topological charge, which may have a plenty of applications in nuclear physics, astrophysics, particle physics, etc.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and correlations of quark spin in hot and dense QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the impact of phase transitions on quark spin fluctuation and correlation. We propose a novel observable for quark-antiquark correlation that relates to vector meson spin alignment and $\Lambda-\bar\Lambda$ correlation. Using the Nambu-Jona-Lanisio model, we qualitatively study the properties of quark-antiquark spin correlation. Our findings reveal a peak structure near the critical end point (CED) of chiral phase transition, which may serve as an experimental signature of the CEP and help explain the non-monotonic behavior of $\phi$ meson alignment at low collision energies.</description>

      <title>Twist-3 chiral even generalized parton distributions of sea quark in the proton at $`\xi = 0$' in the light front spectator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a light-front model for proton to investigate the twist-3 chiral even generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of sea quark $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{d}$. In this model, the sea quarks are treated as spin-1/2 active partons, while the remaining proton constituents are modeled as spin-1 spectators. The momentum wave function, based on the soft-wall AdS/QCD predictions, is fitted to the light sea quarks unpolarized parton distribution functions (PDFs) to the CT18NNLO global analysis to determine the model parameters. We calculate the twist-3 GPDs and analyze their dependence on the transverse momentum transfer $\Delta_{T}^2$ and longitudinal momentum fraction x. In addition, we explore the Mellin moments and the twist-3 chiral-even PDF, $g_T(x)$, within this theoretical framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin correlation of back-to-back dihadron emerges in unpolarized high-energy collision, empowering unpolarized experiments to shed light on the spin-dependent fragmentation functions. This work investigates the transverse spin correlation of back-to-back dihadron in unpolarized $e^+e^-$, $pp$, and $\gamma p$ collisions, which serves as a novel probe of the chiral-odd fragmentation function $H_{1T}(z)$. We compute the transverse spin correlation at the partonic level and establish a connection with helicity amplitudes. Measuring this observable in future experiments can reveal valuable information on the hadronization of transversely polarized quarks.</description>

      <title>Effects of dark boson mediated feeble interaction between dark matter (DM) and quark matter on $f$-mode oscillation of DM admixed quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of the prominent non-radial fundamental $f$-mode oscillations of dark matter (DM) admixed strange quark stars (DMSQSs), by adopting an equation of state (EoS) developed in Ref.~\cite{Sen:2022pfr}, which considers the possible presence of feebly interacting DM in strange quark stars (SQSs) for the first time. Within the model, feeble interaction between fermionic DM $\chi$ and strange quark matter (SQM) is invoked via a vector new physics mediator $\xi$ with coupling strength $y_{\xi}$. The pure SQM is described by the vector MIT Bag model. By varying different EoS parameters, the structural properties viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) of the DMSQSs are studied with respect to various astrophysical constraints. We study in detail the $f$-mode spectra within the Cowling approximation by obtaining the frequencies as a function of mass, compactness and $\Lambda$ of the star. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of non-radial $f$-mode oscillations of DMSQSs. Our investigation indicates that the presence of DM and its interaction with SQM has great impact on the $f$-modes. We show that the $f$-mode frequencies are larger for DMSQSs, which are largely populated with massive DM fermions, compared to the SQSs. Further, we obtain a linear empirical relation between the $f$-modes and the average density of the star. We also find that the mass-scaled angular frequency varies universally with compactness for DMSQSs.</description>

      <title>On Extracting Thermal Parameters and Scenario in High-Energy Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this minireview article, we examine the inconsistent results of thermal parameters derived from various models in high-energy collisions. Through a comprehensive literature review and based on the average transverse momentum or the root-mean-square transverse momentum, we propose model-independent parameters to address these inconsistencies. The relevant parameters include: the initial temperature, the effective temperature, the kinetic freeze-out temperature, and the average transverse velocity. Our findings indicate that these four parameters are larger in central collisions, within central rapidity regions, at higher energies, and in larger collision systems. As collision energy increases, excitation functions for all four parameters rise rapidly (slowly) within ranges below (above) approximately 7.7 GeV. At higher energies (&gt;39) GeV, fluctuations occur in trends for these excitation functions, with only slight changes observed in their growth rates. Additionally, this work reveals a mass-dependent multi-temperature scenario pertaining to both initial states and kinetic freeze-out processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce multi-jet merging for deep inelastic scattering in the Vincia parton shower in the Monte Carlo event generator Pythia 8. Merging combines event samples of different parton multiplicities with logarithmically enhanced parton-shower radiation. We consider up to five outgoing partons using two different merging algorithms. We vary the relevant scale choices and compare to experimental data by H1 collaboration at the HERA collider. Results show that multi-jet merging improves description to data, especially for low virtuality events, and that jet cross-sections converge when the partonic multiplicity exceeds the number of reconstructed jets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have calculated the femtoscopic correlation functions of meson-baryon pairs in the strangeness $S=-1$ sector, employing a unitarized chiral interaction model up to next-to-leading order. We will show preliminary results for the $\pi^-\Lambda$ correlation function, which is presently under analysis by the ALICE@LHC collaboration. We will also demonstrate that, within $2\sigma$, the employed interaction is perfectly capable of reproducing the $K^-p$ correlation function data measured by the same collaboration, without the need of changing the coupled-channel interactions, as has been suggested recently.</description>

      <title>New constraints on singlet scalar dark matter model with LZ, invisible Higgs decay and gamma-ray line observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The singlet scalar dark matter (DM) model is a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM). This model features only two free parameters: the singlet scalar mass $m_S$ and the quartic coupling $a_2$ between the singlet scalar and the SM Higgs doublet. Previous studies have suggested that only the resonant region remains viable under combined constraints. In this work, we revisit and refine the constraints using data from the direct detection experiment LZ, invisible Higgs decay measurements, and gamma-ray line observations conducted by Fermi-LAT and DAMPE. Our findings indicate that the latest results from LZ have significantly strengthened the constraints on the model parameters. We demonstrate that only a narrow parameter region remains viable, specifically $60.5\,\text{GeV}&lt; m_S &lt; 62.5\,\text{GeV}$ and $1.7\times10^{-4}&lt;a_2&lt; 4.7\times10^{-4}$. This suggests that a three-fold improvement in the current LZ results would thoroughly examine the parameter space below $1\,\rm{TeV}$ for the singlet scalar DM model.</description>

Abstract: We show that the loop corrections to the renormalized scalar mass are suppressed if the field in the loop is heavy. Here, treating the renormalized mass is important, as it is the only observable. This means that the physics of a low-energy scalar field is insensitive to that of ultraviolet.</description>

      <title>Back to the phase space: thermal axion dark radiation via couplings to standard model fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological consequences of axion interactions with standard model fermions accurately and precisely. Our analysis is entirely based on a phase space framework that allows us to keep track of the axion distribution in momentum space across the entire expansion history. First, we consider flavor-diagonal couplings to charged leptons and quantify the expected amount of dark radiation as a function of the coupling strength. Leptophilic axions are immune from complications due to strong interactions and our predictions do not suffer from theoretical uncertainties. We then focus on flavor-diagonal interactions with the three heavier quarks whose masses are all above the scale where strong interactions become non-perturbative. The top quark case is rather safe because its mass is orders of magnitude above the confinement scale, and the consequent predictions are solid. The bottom and charm masses are in more dangerous territory because they are very close to the QCD crossover. We present a comprehensive discussion of theoretical uncertainties due to both the choice of the scale where we stop the Boltzmann evolution and the running of QCD parameters. Finally, we compute the predicted amount of dark radiation expressed as an effective number of additional neutrino species. We compare our predictions with the ones obtained via standard approximate procedures, and we find that adopting a rigorous phase space framework alters the prediction by an amount larger than the sensitivity of future CMB observatories.</description>

      <title>Elastic Dijet Production in Electron Scattering on a Longitudinally Polarized Proton at Small $x$: A Portal to Orbital Angular Momentum Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the elastic production of dijets from electron collisions with a longitudinally polarized proton target at small values of the Bjorken $x$ variable. Building on the pioneering proposals of \cite{Hatta:2016aoc,Bhattacharya:2022vvo, Bhattacharya:2023hbq, Bhattacharya:2024sck} for measuring the quark and gluon orbital angular momentum (OAM) distributions, our focus is on both the longitudinal double spin asymmetry (DSA) and longitudinal single spin asymmetry (SSA). We compute the numerators of these asymmetries in the small-$x$ formalism of the light-cone operator treatment (LCOT). Utilizing the small-$x$ expressions for the OAM distributions derived in our earlier paper, we demonstrate that the DSA provides a robust probe for both the quark and gluon OAM distributions within the proton. In contrast, we find that while the SSA is also sensitive to the OAM distributions, extraction of the latter from the SSA would require new developments in small-$x$ theory and phenomenology, and is probably not feasible at this point in time. These findings highlight the potential of DSA measurements in elastic dijet production at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) to provide the first-ever direct access to the quark and gluon OAM distributions at small $x$, paving the way for new insights into the proton spin puzzle.</description>

      <title>Search for exotic gravitational wave signals beyond general relativity using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct detection of gravitational waves by LIGO has confirmed general relativity (GR) and sparked rapid growth in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy. However, subtle post-Newtonian (PN) deviations observed during the analysis of high signal-to-noise ratio events from the observational runs suggest that standard waveform templates, which assume strict adherence to GR, might overlook signals from alternative theories of gravity. Incorporating these exotic signals into traditional search algorithms is computationally infeasible due to the vast template space required. This paper introduces a deep learning framework for detecting exotic GW signals, leveraging neural networks trained on GR-based templates. Through their generalization ability, neural networks learn intricate features from the data, enabling the detection of signals that deviate from GR. We present the first study evaluating the capability of deep learning to detect beyond-GR signals, including a variety of PN orders. Our model achieves rapid and accurate identification of exotic GW signals across different luminosity distances, with performance comparable to GR-based detections. Applying the model to the GW150914 event demonstrates excellent performance, highlighting the potential of AI-driven methods for detecting previously overlooked signals beyond GR. This work paves the way for new discoveries in gravitational wave astronomy, enabling the detection of signals that might escape traditional search pipelines.</description>

      <title>Composite running vacuum in the Universe: implications on the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility that the vacuum energy density (VED) could be time dependent in the expanding Universe is intuitively more reasonable than just a rigid cosmological constant for the entire cosmic history. The framework of the running vacuum model (RVM) is a salient example derived from QFT in curved spacetime, wherein the VED appears as a power series of the Hubble rate, $H(t)$, and its derivatives. The RVM contributes to alleviate the cosmological tensions and at a more fundamental level it also helps to smooth out certain hardcore aspects of the cosmological constant problem. Composite dark energy (DE) extensions of the RVM are possible, in which the DE is a mixed fluid made out of running vacuum and an entity X called ``phantom matter'' which, I should stress, is radically different from phantom DE, since the former produces positive pressure like ordinary matter (therein its name). The prototype is the old $\Lambda$XCDM model from 2006. Recently a simplified version of the latter, called the $w$XCDM, has proven capable to yield a truly outstanding fit to the cosmological data with dramatic implications for mitigating the cosmological tensions. The analysis is sensitive to the kind of BAO data used, transversal (2D) or anisotropic (3D). For both BAO types the overall fit quality is substantially better than for the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, and the growth tension becomes alleviated. Nevertheless, only for 2D BAO the $H_0$-tension can be completely cut down. Most notably, this scenario favours (at $3.3\sigma$ c.l.) quintessence-like behavior around our time, as recently reported by the DESI Collaboration. In what follows I will summarize in very simple phenomenological terms the essentials of the RVM idea and its composite extensions, as well as the remarkable practical implications ensuing from such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exploring Intruder Levels of Nuclei (96Zr, 98Zr, 98MO) Within the Framework of IBM-2 Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current work includes a study of the very rare case called intruder nuclear levels, where there are only seven nuclei in nature. Such cases occur when the first excited state is . The current study included only three nuclei: . The nuclear model used to explore and investigate nuclei in this work is the second interacting boson. The experimental data and theoretical values obtained were in good agreement, indicating this model's success in calculating such anomalies. The main reason for the presence of these levels in other than their natural locations expected according to the IBM model is that they have a double subshell closure. The values of the electric quadrupole transitions, magnetic dipole transitions and zero transitions estimated were in acceptable agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>The long-distance window of the hadronic vacuum polarization for the muon g-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first ab-initio calculation of the Euclidean long-distance window of the isospin symmetric light-quark connected contribution to the hadronic vacuum polarization for the muon $g-2$ and find $a_\mu^{\rm LD,iso,conn,ud} = 411.4(4.3)(2.4) \times 10^{-10}$. We also provide the currently most precise calculation of the total isospin symmetric light-quark connected contribution, $a_\mu^{\rm iso,conn,ud} = 666.2(4.3)(2.5) \times 10^{-10}$, which is more than 4$\sigma$ larger compared to the data-driven estimates of Boito et al. 2022 and 1.7$\sigma$ larger compared to the lattice QCD result of BMW20.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review explores the current understanding of collective excitations and the dynamics of heavy quark propagation in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We focus on three core aspects: the theoretical modelling of the QGP, including momentum anisotropy, medium-induced collisions, finite chemical potential, and non-ideal interactions; the collective behaviours within the plasma; and the interaction dynamics of heavy quarks as they traverse the medium. Along with the polarization energy loss mechanisms, we also review the possibility of energy gain due to thermal field fluctuations. Lastly, we discuss how these theoretical insights can be tested through experiments and outline possible directions for future research.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This doctoral thesis focuses on the application of lattice techniques to study two separate topics: hadron interactions within quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and the emission of particles and gravitational waves (GWs) from cosmic string loops. The first part of the dissertation deals with the study of two- an three-particle interactions using lattice QCD simulations, complemented by the limit of large number of colors and chiral perturbation theory. In particular, this part presents results on the study of meson interactions as a function of the number of colors, three-pion interactions in chiral perturbation theory, and two- and three-particle scattering in the (1+1)-dimensional O(3) non-linear sigma model. The second part of the thesis is devoted to the study of the dynamics and decay into particles and GWs of cosmic string loops, using classical-field-theory lattice computations. Results are presented for both global and local string loops.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning the Forecast of Galactic Cosmic-Rays Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel deep learning framework using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the spectra of galactic cosmic rays by leveraging historical solar activity data, addressing the limitations of traditional transport models. By incorporating multiple solar parameters, such as the heliospheric magnetic field, solar wind speed, and sunspot numbers, our model achieves accurate short-term and long-term predictions of cosmic-ray flux. The inclusion of historical cosmic-ray data enhances prediction accuracy, making the model highly effective for space weather forecasting. Moreover, it provides reliable one-day-ahead predictions of full spectra of cosmic rays for different species. Our approach surpasses traditional physics-based methods, providing a scalable, data-driven solution for reliable daily and long-term forecasts. This work paves the way for advanced models that can integrate broader observational data, with significant implications for space weather monitoring and mission planning.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.03040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastic $K^+ n\to K^+ n$ and charge exchange $K^+n\to K^0p$ reactions at low momenta are investigated using the partial wave analysis. Isospin relation gives constrains for the partial $s$- and $p$-waves among elastic $K^+p$, $K^+n$ and charge exchange $K^+n\to K^0p$ amplitudes. Two sets of the phase shift for these partial waves in the isoscalar channel are obtained from the fit of experimental data on total and differential cross sections. Polarization observable leads to a good criterion to decide which set is valid. Differential cross section data near $P_{\rm Lab}=434$ MeV/$c$ suggests a possibility of a resonance, e.g., the exotic $\Theta^+(1540)$ baryon around $\sqrt{s}\simeq$ 1.54GeV.</description>

Abstract: At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), ATLAS and CMS collaborations observed various decay modes of the light charged Higgs bosons produced by top (anti)quark decays. In this paper, we are interested in the subsequent decay of the light charged Higgs boson into a charm and a strange quark-antiquark pair and into a tau and a tau-neutrino pair, separately, in the context of the Georgi-Machacek model, which offers a large triplet vacuum expectation value (vev) preserving custodial symmetry. We show that these experimental observations constrain the triplet vev from above. We explore the model parameter space consistent with the theoretical constraints, the latest Higgs data and the experimental data for light charged Higgs decaying to $cs$ and $\tau\nu_{\tau}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics has always proven emphatically as one of the main cornerstones in all of science since its inception. Initially, it has also faced many skeptics from many scientific proponents of its complete description of reality. However, John Bell once devised a theorem on quantitative grounds to show how local realism is expressed in quantum mechanics. As Bell's inequality claims the non-existence of local hidden variable theories, on the same footing, we have Leggett-Garg's Inequality (LGI), which sets a quantum-classical limit for temporally correlated quantum systems. In the context of particle physics, specially in the field of neutrino and meson oscillations, one can conveniently implement LGI to test the quantum foundations at the probability level. Here, we discuss the significant LGI violation characteristics in B- and K- meson oscillations, taking into account their decoherence, CP violation, and decay parameters. We have emphasized the fact that \textit{Tsirelson} bounds can be achieved under certain conditions. Our focal point is to show the signature of these bounds that appears only to specific alterations of decay and decoherence effects. Also, we discuss and comment on the behavior or effect of decoherence and decay widths playing out from the perspective of LGI by taking their available values from various experiments. This may help us to understand the underlying principles and techniques of neutral meson open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of head-to-head high energy Compton scattering in the $\theta$-exact noncommutative (NC) quantum electrodynamics (QED) on the Moyal space (NCQED) in the amid its unresolved forward scattering singularity. We model the effect of the currently unknown resolution to this unavoidable collinear singularity by cut-offs which are functions of the control variable $s/\Lambda_{\rm NC}^2$, and find that such cut-off functions can suppress NC corrections to the inverse Compton scattering to negligible. Discussed cut-offs leave the unpolarised integral cross section of the forward region larger than the backward region all the time, making the former potentially easier to observe. Our estimations indicate that such an effect may be visible in the future collider experiments when the NC scale $\Lambda_{\rm NC}\gtrsim1$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Fermion masses and mixings and $g-2$ muon anomaly in a $Q_6$ flavored 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extended 2HDM with $Q_6\times Z_4\times Z_2$ symmetry that can successfully accommodate the SM fermion mass and mixing hierarchy. The tiny masses of the active neutrinos are generated from a type-I seesaw mechanism mediated by very heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos. The model gives a natural explanation of the charged lepton mass hierarchy. Besides that, the experimental values of the physical observables of the neutrino sector: the neutrino mass squared splittings, the leptonic mixing angles and the leptonic Dirac CP violating phase, are also successfully reproduced for both normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies. We find a feasible range of values for the leptonic Dirac CP phase to be in the ranges $\delta_{CP}\in (305.90, 348.70)^\circ$ for normal ordering and $\delta_{CP}\in (308.00, 348.00)^\circ$ for inverted ordering, which is consistent with the 3$\sigma$ experimentally allowed limits. The sum of neutrino masses is obtained as $\sum m_i \in (58.03, 60.51)$ meV for normal ordering and $\sum m_i\in (98.07, 101.40)$ meV for inverted ordering which are well consistent with all the recent limits. In addition, the obtained ranges for the effective neutrino masses are $\langle m_{ee}\rangle \in (3.80, 4.38)$\, meV, $m_{\beta} \in (8.53, 9.34)\, \mbox{meV}$ for normal ordering and $\langle m_{ee}\rangle \in (47.85, 49.58) $ meV, $m_{\beta} \in (48.39, 50.09)\, \mbox{meV}$ for inverted ordering which are in agreement with the recent experimental bounds. For the quark sector, the derived results are also in agreement with the recent data on the quark masses and mixing angles. The model under consideration can also accommodate the muon anomalous magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Scalar NSI: A unique tool for constraining absolute neutrino masses via $\nu$-oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the standard interaction scenario, a direct measurement of absolute neutrino masses via neutrino oscillations is not feasible, as the oscillations depend only on the mass-squared differences. However, scalar non-standard interactions (SNSI) can introduce sub-dominant terms in the neutrino oscillation Hamiltonian that can directly affect the neutrino mass matrix, thereby making SNSI a unique tool for neutrino mass measurements. In this work, for the first time, we constrain the absolute masses of neutrinos by probing SNSI. We have explored the constraints on the lightest neutrino mass with different choices of $\delta_{CP}$ and $\theta_{23}$ for both neutrino mass hierarchies. We show that a bound on the neutrino mass can be induced in the presence of SNSI at DUNE. We find that the lightest neutrino mass can be constrained with $\eta_{\tau\tau}$ for normal mass hierarchy irrespective of the octant of $\theta_{23}$ and the value of the CP phase $\delta_{CP}$. This study suggests that SNSI can serve as an interesting avenue to constrain the absolute neutrino masses in long-baseline neutrino experiments via neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03677v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the medium modifications of the masses of pseudoscalar open charm ($D$ and $\bar D$) mesons and the charmonium state ($\psi(3770)$) in hot isospin asymmetric strange hadronic medium in the presence of an external magnetic field within a chiral effective model. The in-medium partial decay widths of $\psi(3770)$ to $D\bar D$ mesons are computed from the in-medium masses of the initial and final state mesons. These are computed using two light quark pair creation models - (I) the $^3P_0$ model and (II) a field theoretical (FT) model of composite hadrons with quark (and antiquark) constituents. The production cross-sections of $\psi(3770)$, arising from scattering of the $D$ and $\bar D$ mesons, are computed from the relativistic Breit-Wigner spectral function expressed in terms of the in-medium masses and the decay widths of the charmonium state. The effects of the magnetic field are considered due to the Dirac sea (DS) of the baryons, the mixing of the pseudoscalar and vector meson (PV mixing) and the Landau level contributions for the charged hadrons. The production cross-sections of $\psi(3770)$ arising due to scattering of $D^+D^-(D^0\bar{D}^0)$ mesons in the hot magnetized strange hadronic matter are observed to have distinct peak positions, when the magnetic field is large, due to the mass difference of the transverse and longitudinal components of $\psi(3770)$, arising from PV mixing. These can have observable consequences on the dilepton spectra and the production of the charm mesons in ultra-relativistic peripheral heavy ion collision experiments, where the produced magnetic field is huge.</description>

Abstract: In a dimensionless multi-scalar extension of the Standard Model, Gildener and Weinberg assumed that along a flat direction, there is only one classically massless scalar, known as the {\it scalon}, which acquires mass through radiative corrections \`a la Coleman-Weinberg, while all other scalars remain heavy. In this paper, by introducing a toy model with four scalar degrees of freedom we demonstrate the existence of {\it two} scalons along a specific flat direction that we construct. We present the effective potential for the model and provide the masses of the heavy scalars and two radiatively light pseudo-Goldstone bosons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the radio frequency (RF) cavity experiment for probing dark photons, which is a modification of the light-shining-through-thin-wall (LSthinW) setup with a relatively thin conducting barrier between cylindrical emitter and hollow receiver. The regarding experimental facility allows to probe dark photons effectively even in the off-shell regime, i.~e.~when dark photons mass exceeds the driven frequency of the emitter cavity, that is pumped by electromagnetic mode. We compare the sensitivity of two particular setup configurations: two adjacent cylindrical cavities placed to each other by an end-caps, and the nested geometry of the cavities in which the cylindrical receiver is encapsulated into the emitter. We show that for a certain range of dark photon mass, the nested configuration with $\mbox{TM}_{010}$ pump mode can provide an enhanced sensitivity if one compares that with an adjacent emitter setup. Remarkably, that for $\mbox{TE}_{011}$ pump mode, both nested and adjacent configurations of the cavities can yield comparable expected reaches for the specific geometry type.</description>

      <title>Neutrino phenomenology and keV dark matter in 2HDM with $A_4$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal extended seesaw scheme based on the discrete symmetry $A_4\times Z_4\times Z_2\times Z_8$ which can successfully address neutrino phenomenology and keV sterile neutrino dark matter. The lepton mass hierarchy is naturally achieved. Active neutrino mixing angles can reached the best-fit points with the predictive Dirac CP violation phase. The active-sterile mixing matrix elements are small enough to access the observed cosmological dark matter abundance constraint with keV sterile neutrino dark matter. The effective neutrino masses are predicted to be in the ranges of the recent experimental limits.</description>

      <title>Nuclear medium meson structures from the Schwinger proper-time Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we report the results of our study on the nuclear medium modifications of the meson electromagnetic form factors in the framework of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with the help of the Schwinger proper-time regularization scheme to tame the loop divergence and simulate the effect of QCD confinement. In our current approach, the meson structure and nuclear medium are constructed in the same NJL model at the quark level. We examine the free-space and in-medium charge radii of kaon and pion, the spacelike elastic electromagnetic form factors of kaon and pion, and their quark-sector form factors, which reflect their internal structures. By comparing our result to experimental data, we found that the free-space elastic electromagnetic form factors of the mesons are consistent with the data, while the in-medium elastic electromagnetic form factors of the mesons are found to decrease as the nuclear matter density increases, leading to a rise of meson charge radius, which is consistent with the prediction of other theoretical calculations. We also predict the axial nucleon coupling constant $g_A$ in nuclear medium computed via the Goldberger-Treiman relation (GTR), which is crucial for searching the neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu \beta \beta$).</description>

      <title>Limits on scalar dark matter interactions with particles other than the photon via loop corrections to the scalar-photon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is limited information about the interaction strength of a scalar dark matter candidate with hadrons and leptons for a scalar particle mass exceeding $10^{-3}$ eV while its interaction with photon is well studied. The scalar-photon coupling constant receives quantum corrections from one-loop Feynman diagrams which involve the scalar-lepton, scalar-quark, and scalar-W boson vertices. We calculate these one-loop quantum corrections and find new limits on the scalar particle interactions with electron, muon, tau, quarks, nucleons, gluons, Higgs, and W bosons by re-purposing the results of experiments measuring the scalar-photon interaction. Limits on interactions of heavy leptons and quarks have been obtained for the first time, and limits on other interactions in certain mass intervals are 2 to 15 orders of magnitude stronger than those presented in previous publications and exclude the resolution of the muon $g-2$ anomaly with scalar particle.</description>

      <title>ALP contribution to the Strong CP problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop contribution to the $\bar{\theta}$-parameter of an axion-like particle (ALP) with CP-odd derivative couplings. Its contribution to the neutron electric dipole moment is shown to be orders of magnitude larger than that stemming from the one-loop ALP contributions to the up- and down-quark electric and chromoelectric dipole moments. This strongly improves existing bounds on ALP-fermion CP-odd interactions, and also sets limits on previously unconstrained couplings. The case of a general singlet scalar is analyzed as well. In addition, we explore how the bounds are modified in the presence of a Peccei-Quinn symmetry.</description>

      <title>The Flavor Composition of Supernova Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that standard matter effects in the outer layers of core-collapse supernovae significantly constrain the flavor composition of the neutrino flux, even with the enormous uncertainties originating from self-induced flavor conversions in the supernova core. Assuming an arbitrary initial flavor composition emerging from the supernova core, we find that, for the normal mass ordering, the fraction of neutrinos with electron flavor reaching the Earth, denoted as $f_{\nu_e}$, is constrained to be less than $0.5$ for all energies throughout the emission phase, whereas, for inverted mass ordering, we anticipate neutrinos arriving in near flavor equipartition ($f_{\nu_e}\approx 1/3$). In case adiabaticity is violated in the region of standard matter effects (e. g. due to shock waves), the result is flavor equipartition for both mass orderings. These results could be tested by future observations and may provide valuable insights into the properties of neutrino fluxes emerging from the supernova core.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard interactions of neutrinos with dense matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonstandard interaction is expected to be a crucial hint in explaining the experimental data on neutrino scattering off electrons. In this context, the nonstandard interaction vector and axial-vector couplings are needed to be extracted from recent experiments and a few of them are now available in the literature. With these coupling bounds, in this paper, I explore their impacts on the neutrinos interacting with the free electron gas in dense matter. To this end, I compute and predict the neutrino differential cross section and mean free path in dense matter for those existing experimental bounds. Interesting behavior in the neutrino cross sections and mean free path is found for the different nonstandard interaction couplings from different experiment constraints. I also found that the neutrino cross-section and mean free path in the dense matter are very sensitive to values and signs of the nonstandard interaction couplings, leading to different prediction results to the Standard Model cross-section and mean free path as well as their totals, which is given by a sum of the Standard Model and nonstandard interaction.</description>

      <title>Exploring Constraints on Simplified Dark Matter Model Through Flavour and Electroweak Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on a combined analysis of various available inputs to constrain the parameter spaces of a simplified dark matter (SDM) model featuring a spin-0 mediator and fermionic dark matter (DM). The spin-0 mediator interacts with standard model (SM) fermions, SM gauge bosons, and DM. We constrain the parameter spaces of different relevant couplings, DM mass, and the mediator mass, using the data from flavour-changing charged and neutral current processes, CKM matrices, $W$ and $Z$-pole observables, DM relic density, direct and indirect detection bounds. We have calculated bounds on the couplings from both separate and simultaneous analyses of the mentioned processes. We identify correlated parameter spaces for all the relevant parameters which include the couplings and the masses. For the DM and mediator masses, we have scanned the region between 100 GeV and 1000 GeV. Using our results, we have obtained bounds on the couplings of possible higher dimensional operators from which we can formulate our SDM.</description>

      <title>Neutral-current background induced by atmospheric neutrinos at large liquid-scintillator detectors: III. Comprehensive prediction for low energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric neutrinos play a vital role in generating irreducible backgrounds in liquid-scintillator (LS) detectors via their neutral-current (NC) interactions with $^{12}$C nuclei. These interactions may affect a wide range of research areas from the MeV to GeV energy range, such as the reactor and geo neutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB), dark matter, and nucleon decay searches. In this work, we extend our preceding paper, by conducting a first-time systematic exploration of NC backgrounds as low as the MeV region of reactor and geo neutrinos. We utilize up-to-date neutrino generator models from GENIE and NuWro, a TALYS-based nuclear deexcitation package and a GEANT4-based detector simulation toolkit for our complete calculation. Our primary focus is to predict the NC background for experimental searches of inverse-beta-decay signals below the 100 MeV visible energy. In order to have deeper understanding of the characteristics of atmospheric neutrino NC interactions in LS, we investigate the model dependence of NC background predictions by using various data-driven models, including the initial neutrino-nucleon interactions, nuclear ground-state structure, final-state interactions, nuclear deexcitation processes, and secondary interactions of final-state particles.</description>

      <title>Mapping the SMEFT at High-Energy Colliders: from LEP and the (HL-)LHC to the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SMEFiT3.0, an updated global SMEFT analysis of Higgs, top quark, and diboson production data from the LHC complemented by electroweak precision observables (EWPOs) from LEP and SLD. We consider recent inclusive and differential measurements from the LHC Run II, alongside with a novel implementation of the EWPOs based on independent calculations of the relevant EFT contributions. We estimate the impact of HL-LHC measurements on the SMEFT parameter space when added on top of SMEFiT3.0, through dedicated projections extrapolating from Run II data. We quantify the significant constraints that measurements from two proposed high-energy circular $e^+e^-$ colliders, the FCC-ee and the CEPC, would impose on both the SMEFT parameter space and on representative UV-complete models. Our analysis considers projections for the FCC-ee and the CEPC based on the latest running scenarios and includes $Z$-pole EWPOs, fermion-pair, Higgs, diboson, and top quark production, using optimal observables for both the $W^+W^-$ and the $t\bar{t}$ channels. The framework presented in this work may be extended to other future colliders and running scenarios, providing timely input to ongoing studies towards future high-energy particle physics facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the discontinuities of banana integrals using the dispersion relation iteratively. We find a series of identities between the parameterized discontinuities of banana integrals (p-DOBIs). Similar to elliptic integrals, these identities enable the reduction of various p-DOBIs to be a linear combination of some fundamental ones. We present a practical application of p-DOBIs for deriving Picard-Fuchs operator. Then we establish the expression of generalized dispersion relation, which enables us to obtain the dispersion relation representation of arbitrary banana integrals. Moreover, we propose a hypothesis for generalized dispersion relation and p-DOBIs, which provides a simple way to calculate the discontinuities and transform dispersion relation representation to p-DOBIs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the precision measurement of the CKM matrix element $|V_{cb}|$ through semileptonic $WW$ events at future Higgs factories, $i.e.$, FCC-ee, ILC, C$^3$, and CEPC. We use full detector simulation to generate the $WW \to \ell \nu cb$ signal events and various backgrounds at $\sqrt{s} = 240$ GeV with unpolarized beams. The relative statistical uncertainties are projected to be 0.91\% for the muon channel and 1.2\% for the electron channel, assuming a baseline integrated luminosity of 5 ab$^{-1}$. The sensitivities at other Higgs factory scenarios are also projected. Possible contributors to systematic uncertainties are discussed, with the most prominent one being the systematics of flavor-tagging and mistagging rates. Combining with $WW$ threshold runs, the relative systematic uncertainty can be further reduced.</description>

      <title>Constraining gravitational-wave backgrounds from conversions into photons in the Galactic magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-frequency gravitational waves ($f \gtrsim 1$ MHz) may provide a unique signature for the existence of exotic physics. The lack of current and future gravitational-wave experiments sensitive at those frequencies leads to the need of employing different indirect techniques. Notably, one of the most promising one is constituted by graviton-photon conversions in magnetic fields. In this work, we focus on conversions of a gravitational-wave background into photons inside the Milky-Way magnetic field, taking into account the state-of-the-art models for both regular and turbulent components. We discuss how graviton-to-photon conversions may lead to imprints in the cosmic photon background spectrum in the range of frequencies $f\sim10^{9}-10^{26}\,$Hz, where the observed photon flux is widely explained by astrophysics emission models. Hence, the absence of any significant evidence for a diffuse photon flux induced by graviton-photon conversions allows us to set stringent constraints on the gravitational-wave strain $h_c$, strengthening current astrophysical bounds by $\sim1-2$ orders of magnitude in the whole range of frequencies considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dilepton production rates from annihilation processes of charged pion pairs with modified pion dispersion relations in the inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase. We assume a dual chiral density wave as an inhomogeneous chiral condensate, and obtain the dispersion relations of the Nambu-Goldstone modes in the inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase. We use a low energy effective Lagrangian based on the O(4) symmetry which is expanded by the order parameter up to the sixth order. The obtained dispersion relations are anisotropic and quadratic for the momentum. We evaluate the electron-positron production rates by charged pion-pair annihilations as functions of an invariant mass using the obtained dispersion relations. Basically, the production rate in the inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase has a steeper overall slope with respect to an invariant mass than that in the homogeneous chiral condensed phase. Therefore, the production rate may be enhanced when the invariant mass is around twice the pion mass.</description>

Abstract: We present semi-analytic solutions for atomic transition rates in hydrogenic atoms induced by scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector, and tensor interactions. Our results agree with quantum electrodynamics predictions to $\sim 0.005\,\%$ precision, and further allow us to calculate absorption and emission rates for axions, hidden photons, light scalars or other dark matter candidates for hydrogen and hydrogenic ions. These results can be used to inform searches for light new physics as well as in calculations relevant to searches for fifth forces or varying fundamental constants, with applications from astrophysics to laboratory spectroscopy experiments. We also provide a dedicated tool for the construction of hydrogenic transition amplitudes: "Computation of hydrogen radial INtegrals and COefficients" ($\texttt{CINCO}$).</description>

Abstract: We present detailed analysis of the $T$-even lepton angular distribution in the Drell-Yan process including $\gamma/Z^0$ gauge boson exchange and using perturbative QCD based on the collinear factorization scheme at leading order in the $\alpha_s$ expansion. We focus on the study of the transverse momentum $Q_T$ dependence of the corresponding hadronic structure functions and angular coefficients up to next-next-to-leading order in the $Q_T^2/Q^2$ expansion. We analyze $Q_T$ dependence numerically and compare $T$-even angular coefficients integrated over rapidity with available data of the ATLAS Collaboration at LHC. Additionally, we present our results for the forward-backward asymmetry and compare it with data.</description>

      <title>On Precision of the Leptonic Mixing Angle $\theta_{23}$ and its Implications for the Flavor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among three leptonic mixing angles, $\theta_{23}$ angle, which characterizes the fractional contribution of two flavor eigenstates $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_{\tau}$ to the third mass eigenstate $\nu_3$, is known to be the largest but the least precisely measured. The work investigates possible reach of $\theta_{23}$ precision with two upcoming gigantic accelerator-based long-baseline neutrino experiments, namely Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE experiments as well as a possible joint analyses of future neutrino facilities. Our simulation yields that each experiment will definitely establish the octant of $\theta_{23}$ angle for all values within 1$\sigma$ parameter interval, while considering the current limitation. However, if the actual value is $0.48\leq \sin^2\theta_{23}\leq 0.54$, it becomes challenging for these two experiments to reject the maximal ($\theta_{23}=\pi/4$) hypothesis and conclude its octant. This octant-blind region can be further explored with the proposed facilities ESSnuSB and a neutrino factory. Accurate determination of the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$, as well as the accuracy of $\delta_{CP}$, is crucial for examining a certain category of discrete non-Abelian leptonic flavor models. Specifically if CP is conserved in leptonic sector, the combined analysis of Hyper-K and DUNE will rule out the majority of these models. However, if the CP is maximally violated, higher precision of $\delta_{CP}$ is necessary for testing these flavor models.</description>

      <title>Tripartite entanglement from experimental data: $B^0\to K^{*0}\mu^+\mu^-$ as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an angular analysis based on the reconstruction of the helicity amplitudes from dedicated experimental data corresponding to the tripartite state composed by one qutrit and two qubits, which arises in the three-body decays of a spin zero particle into one vector and a fermion pair. Starting from the associated spin density matrix of the final state, entanglement quantifiers were investigated and the corresponding significances were determined up to second order in the error propagation of the uncertainties of the angular measurements. As an application of our analysis, we performed a full quantum tomography of the final state in the $B^0\to K^{*0}\mu^+\mu^-$ decays using data recorded by LHCb collaboration. We found the presence of genuine quantum entanglement of the final state and also in both kaon-muon and di-muon subsystems. In recent years, $B$ meson decays received significant attention from both experimental and theoretical sides, and the proposed observables provide novel perspectives for studying them. Furthermore, this analysis could be also applied to other several processes if the complete experimental data were available for the helicity amplitudes reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Quark Stars as Hideouts For Color-spin-locked Quark Matter: Implications for Powering High-energy Electromagnetic Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ground state of moderately dense cold quark matter is investigated within the framework of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. It is found that in the regime of weak and intermediate diquark coupling strength, the color-spin-locked (CSL) phase could be most favored, and the density range where CSL phase survives is determined by two quark chemical potentials: one corresponding to the chiral phase transition and the other for the emergence of the gapless color-flavor-locked (CFL) condensate. Based on the theoretical hypothesis that the quark star could be the hideout for CSL quark matter, an interesting scenario is proposed that the phase transition to the CSL phase could occur in the cooling process of a proper quark star. The CSL quark matter is an electromagnetic superconductor of Type-I, and a complete Meissner effect is expected. However, the analysis for this sizable superconductor indicates that most of the magnetic field is frozen inside the star with a critical strength, while in some special cases, a small fraction could be expelled from a thin layer near the surface in a short time. An analysis on energetics and time scale is performed to investigate if this expulsion of magnetic flux could power or induce high-energy electromagnetic emissions.</description>

      <title>Small-$x$ gluon GPD constrained from deeply virtual $J/\psi$ production and gluon PDF through universal-moment parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We phenomenologically constrain the small-$x$ and small-$\xi$ gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) with the deeply virtual $J/\psi$ production (DV$J/\psi$P) in the framework of GPDs through universal moment parameterization (GUMP). We use a hybrid cross-section formula combining collinear factorization to the next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy of the strong coupling $\alpha_s$, with corrections from non-relativistic QCD to account for the power corrections due to the heavy $J/\psi$ mass. We reach reasonable fit to the measured differential cross-sections of DV$J/\psi$P by H1 at Hadron-Electron Ring Accelerator (HERA) as well as forward gluon PDFs from JAM22 global analysis. We find that both NLO and non-relativistic corrections are significant for heavy vector meson productions. Of course, the gluon GPD we obtain still contain considerable freedom in need of inputs from other constraints, particularly in the distribution-amplitude-like region.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space methods for neutrino oscillations: extension to multi-beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Phase-Space approach (PSA), which was originally introduced in [Lacroix et al., Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino flavor oscillations for interacting neutrinos emitted from stellar objects is extended to describe arbitrary numbers of neutrino beams. The PSA is based on mapping the quantum fluctuations into a statistical treatment by sampling initial conditions followed by independent mean-field evolution. A new method is proposed to perform this sampling that allows treating an arbitrary number of neutrinos in each neutrino beam. We validate the technique successfully and confirm its predictive power on several examples where a reference exact calculation is possible. We show that it can describe many-body effects, such as entanglement and dissipation induced by the interaction between neutrinos. Due to the complexity of the problem, exact solutions can only be calculated for rather limited cases, with a limited number of beams and/or neutrinos in each beam. The PSA approach considerably reduces the numerical cost and provides an efficient technique to accurately simulate arbitrary numbers of beams. Examples of PSA results are given here, including up to 200 beams with time-independent or time-dependent Hamiltonian. We anticipate that this approach will be useful to bridge exact microscopic techniques with more traditional transport theories used in neutrino oscillations. It will also provide important reference calculations for future quantum computer applications where other techniques are not applicable to classical computers.</description>

      <title>Describing Hadronization via Histories and Observables for Monte-Carlo Event Reweighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for extracting a fragmentation model directly from experimental data without requiring an explicit parametric form, called Histories and Observables for Monte-Carlo Event Reweighting (HOMER), consisting of three steps: the training of a classifier between simulation and data, the inference of single fragmentation weights, and the calculation of the weight for the full hadronization chain. We illustrate the use of HOMER on a simplified hadronization problem, a $q\bar{q}$ string fragmenting into pions, and extract a modified Lund string fragmentation function $f(z)$. We then demonstrate the use of HOMER on three types of experimental data: (i) binned distributions of high level observables, (ii) unbinned event-by-event distributions of these observables, and (iii) full particle cloud information. After demonstrating that $f(z)$ can be extracted from data (the inverse of hadronization), we also show that, at least in this limited setup, the fidelity of the extracted $f(z)$ suffers only limited loss when moving from (i) to (ii) to (iii).

      <title>$D^0\overline{D^0}$ mixing from nonlocal condensate contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant discrepancy, spanning multiple orders of magnitude, exists between the leading order contribution to the $D^0\overline{D^0}$ mixing parameters and experimental values. This is largely due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism, which results in substantial suppression of the theoretical predictions. To bridge this gap, various efforts have been made to account for higher-order terms and nonperturbative effects, which, although suppressed in the operator product expansion (OPE), could potentially lead to a larger contribution by weakening the GIM cancellation through flavour SU(3) symmetry breaking. In this work, we compute the long-distance contributions of nonlocal QCD condensates within different models and, for the first time, determine the impact of the mixed condensate. Although our results still fall short of the experimental value, they represent an improvement over current theoretical estimates by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Probing the onset of hydrodynamization in peripheral p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An attempt has been made to estimate the minimum size of the de-confined matter of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in small system that could be satisfactorily modeled with low-order hydrodynamics. The elliptic flow coefficient has been studied for the variation of second order transport coefficient called the shear relaxation time, which acts as a regulator of the non-hydrodynamic mode of theory. The small system of p-Pb collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV is simulated on the state-of-art framework of JETSCAPE. We modeled the soft sector dynamics using an initial condition, a pre-equilibrium stage, hydrodynamics and a hadron afterburner. We generated results of transverse momentum spectra and rapidity spectra of light particles to match the simulated system with the experimental data. We looked at elliptic flow variation for extreme values of shear relaxation time for peripheral collision centralities. The increase in elliptic flow fluctuations indicate breakdown of fluid behavior at around $dN/dy \approx 8$ for p-Pb collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV.</description>

      <title>Universality in the Near-Side Energy-Energy Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the energy-energy correlator (EEC) of hadrons produced on the same side in $e^+e^-$ annihilation or in leading jets in $pp$ collisions. We observe a remarkable universality of the correlator. Using a non-perturbative transverse momentum dependent (TMD) fragmentation function to model the transition from the ``free-hadron" region to the perturbative collinear region, we are able to describe the near-side shapes and peaks over a wide range of energy for both the $e^+e^-$ annihilation and the $pp$ jet substructure measurements in terms of just two parameters. We present further predictions for the ratio of the projected three-point energy correlator to the EEC. The excellent agreement between our calculations and the experimental data may provide new insights into the role of non-perturbative physics for EECs, and suggests the possibility of exploring non-perturbative TMDs using theoretical tools developed for the energy correlators.</description>

      <title>Study on Theoretical Derivations in CP Violation of Bottom Hadrons' Weak Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of CP violation in the weak decay of bottom hadrons (B mesons) through comprehensive theoretical analysis and mathematical derivations. We analyze the fundamental mechanisms of B meson decay, emphasizing the interplay between CP symmetry breaking and the contributions from the quark level. By examining the role of the weak Hamiltonian, we reveal the significance of both short-range and long-range interactions in the decay process. Our theoretical framework highlights the close relationship between differential decay distributions and CP violation, providing a robust foundation for understanding CP violation phenomena in B meson decays. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research, particularly the necessity of improving the precision of CP violation measurements to validate existing theoretical models and explore potential new physics. Through a combination of mathematical derivations and theoretical insights, this study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the matter-antimatter asymmetry problem in particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are three scalar nonets in the Particle Data Group (PDG), one of which includes [$a_0(980), K_0^*(700)$], another includes [$a_0(1450), K_0^*(1430)$], and the third includes [$a_0(1710), K_0^*(1950)$]. Motivated by Ref.[1], we examine an alternative mixing mechanism that could potentially explain the small mass difference between the $a_0 (1450)$ and $K_0^* (1430)$. According to the tetraquark mixing model, two types, distinguished by their color-spin structures, are necessary to describe the tetraquark structure of the two nonets containing [$a_0(980), K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1450), K_0^*(1430)$]. Considering the color-spin structures, we argue that the mixing mechanism generating $a_0(1450)$ and $K_0^* (1430)$ on the one hand, and $a_0(1710)$ and $K_0^* (1950)$ on the other hand might be relevant for resolving the small mass difference. We also discuss the limitations of other mixing mechanisms that generate the two nonets involving [$a_0(980),K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1450)$, $K_0^* (1430)$] or [$a_0(980),K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1710)$, $K_0^* (1950)$]</description>

      <title>Implications of ALP-photon conversion for the diffuse gamma-ray background associated with high-energy neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some fraction of the diffuse photon background is supposed to be linked to high-energy neutrinos by astrophysical mechanisms of production and electromagnetic cascades. This article presents a simulation study of axion-like particles (ALPs) implications for that component, exploiting transport equations. Alternations of that spectrum due to ALP-photon conversion in the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) in the cases of various ALP parameters and mixing regimes at sources are studied. The results indicate considerable influence of IGMF-conversion on the ALP-photon flux even in the case of inverse ALP-photon coupling constant $M$ equal to $10^{11.5}$ GeV and some residual effects in the case of $M=10^{12}$ GeV. Furthermore, the scenario shows another aspect of a complex multimessenger interplay between IceCube and Fermi data, to a certain extent relieving the tension between them.</description>

      <title>Antineutrino Opacity in Neutron Stars in the Models Constrained by Recent Terrestrial Experiments and Astrophysical Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we investigate neutral current (NC) antineutrino scattering with the constituents of neutron star (NS) matter at zero temperature. The modeling of standard matter in NS is constructed within the framework of both extended relativistic mean-field (E-RMF) and nonrelativistic Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU energy density functional (KIDS-EDF) models. In the E-RMF model, we use a new parameter, G3(M), which was constrained by the recent PREX II experiment measurement of neutron distribution in $^{208}\rm{Pb}$, while the KIDS-EDF models are constrained by terrestrial experiments, gravitational-wave signals, and astrophysical observations. Using both realistic and well-constrained matter models, we then calculate the antineutrino differential cross-section (ADCS) and antineutrino mean free path (AMFP) for the interaction between antineutrinos and neutron star (NS) matter constituents using linear response theory. It is found that the AMFP for the KIDS0 and KIDSA models are smaller compared to the SLy4 model and the E-RMF model with the G3(M) parameter. The AMFP result of the Skyrme model with the SLy4 parameter set is found to have a prediction almost similar to that of the E-RMF model with the G3(M) parameter. Contributions of each nucleon to the total AMFP are also presented for the G3(M) model.</description>

      <title>Towards Systematic Evaluation of de Sitter Correlators via Generalized Integration-By-Parts Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00129v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Integration-By-Parts (IBP) and differential equations methods to de Sitter correlators related to inflation. While massive correlators in de Sitter spacetime are usually regarded as highly intricate, we find they have remarkably hidden concise structures from the perspective of IBP. We find the factorization of the IBP relations of each vertex integral family corresponding to $\mathrm{d} \tau_i$ integration. Furthermore, with a smart construction of master integrals, the universal formulas for iterative reduction and $\mathrm{d} \log$-form differential equations of arbitrary vertex integral family are presented and proved. These formulas dominate all tree-level de Sitter correlators and play a kernel role at the loop-level as well.</description>

      <title>Propagation speeds of relativistic conformal fluids from a generalized relaxation time approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the propagation speeds for a conformal real relativistic fluid. We begin from a kinetic equation in the relaxation time approximation, where the relaxation time is an arbitrary function of the particle energy in the Landau frame. We propose a parameterization of the one particle distribution function designed to contain a second order Chapman-Enskog solution as a particular case. We derive the hydrodynamic equations applying the moments method to this parameterized one particle distribution function, and solve for the propagation speeds of linearized scalar, vector and tensor perturbations. For relaxation times of the form $\tau=\tau_0(-\beta_{\mu}p^{\mu})^{-a}$, with $-\infty&lt; a&lt;2$, where $\beta_{\mu}=u_{\mu}/T$ is the temperature vector in the Landau frame, we show that the Anderson-Witting prescription $a=1$ yields the fastest speeds.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mean free path in neutron stars in the presence of hyperons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the neutrino elastic differential cross-section (NDCS) and corresponding mean free path for neutral current scattering in the dense matter of a neutron star. A wide range of observed neutron star (NS) masses is considered, including the presence of $\Lambda$, $\Xi^{-}$, and $\Xi^{0}$ hyperons in the heaviest stars. Their presence significantly decreases the total neutrino mean free path in the heavier stars.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transitions in the cores of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05637v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I explore various scenarios for the phase transition within neutron-star matter. I do so by generating large model-agnostic ensemble using Gaussian processes, both with and without explicit inclusion of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). The ensemble is conditioned with state-of-the-art astrophysical and theoretical inputs in a fully Bayesian approach. I study how the current data affect the posterior probability of the location and the strength of FOPT. I find that the previously observed peak structure of the sound speed remains stable against inclusion of FOPTs. While the current data cannot differentiate between a smooth crossover and a first-order phase transition, 95% of the total evidence consists of equations of state with some form of phase changes, such as FOPT occurring within or terminating the stable branch of neutron stars, or an indication of a crossover to quark matter.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes-shadow correspondence for rotating regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eikonal quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes (BHs) and parameters of null geodesics, ultimately tied to the appearance of BHs to external observers, are known to be related, and the eikonal QNM-BH shadow radii correspondence has been extensively studied for spherically symmetric BHs. The extension to rotating BHs is non-trivial, and has been worked out only for equatorial ($m=\pm\ell$) QNMs, or for general modes but limited to the Kerr metric. We extend the QNM-shadow radius correspondence to more general rotating space-times, and argue that the requirements for it to hold amount to conditions on the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for null geodesics and the Klein-Gordon equation. Metrics obtained by the Newman-Janis algorithm enjoy these conditions, provided certain mathematical requirements are imposed on the line element. We explicitly verify the correspondence for the rotating Bardeen and Hayward regular BHs, both of which satisfy the separability requirements. Our findings show that the QNM-shadow radius correspondence holds for a wide range of axisymmetric space-times beyond Kerr. This paves the way to potential strong-field multi-messenger tests of fundamental physics by hearing (via gravitational wave spectroscopy) and seeing (via VLBI imaging) BHs, although substantial improvements relative to the current observational sensitivity are required to make this possible.</description>

      <title>Solitonic ground state in supersymmetric theory in background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A solitonic ground state called a chiral soliton lattice (CSL) is realized in a supersymmetric theory with background magnetic field and finite chemical potential. To this end, we construct, in the superfield formalism, a supersymmetric chiral sine-Gordon model as a neutral pion sector of a supersymmetric two-flavor chiral Lagrangian with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. The CSL ground state appears in the presence of either a strong magnetic field and/or large chemical potential, or a background fermionic condensate in the form of a fermion bilinear consisting of the gaugino and a superpartner of a baryon gauge field.</description>

      <title>Study of charged Lepton Flavor Violation in electron muon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09417v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the improvement of muon acceleration technology, it has received great interest to exploit high-energy muon beams for collision or target experiments. We investigate possible charged Lepton Flavor Violation (cLFV) processes mediated by an extra massive neutral gauge boson Zprime in electron muon interactions, either at a proposed electron muon collider or in a fixed target experiment with high-energy muon beam hitting electrons in the target. Based on Monte Carlo calculations and fast detector simulations, we study in detail our signal and possible backgrounds, giving the sensitivity results of cLFV signals at the 90% confidence level. Compared with current and prospective limits set by other experiments, electron muon interactions demonstrate significant advantages in the cLFV coupling strength sensitivity with tau in the final states. In addition, a special cLFV coupling combination, lambda_emu * lambda_mumu, can also be probed in our proposal.</description>

      <title>Living at the Edge: A Critical Look at the Cosmological Neutrino Mass Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological neutrino mass bounds are becoming increasingly stringent. The latest limit within $\Lambda$CDM from Planck 2018+ACT lensing+DESI is $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.072\,{\rm eV}$ at 95\% CL, very close to the minimum possible sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu &gt; 0.06\,{\rm eV}$), hinting at vanishing or even ``negative'' cosmological neutrino masses. In this context, it is urgent to carefully evaluate the origin of these cosmological constraints. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of these results in three ways: i) we check the role of potential anomalies in Planck CMB and DESI BAO data; ii) we compare the results for frequentist and Bayesian techniques, as very close to physical boundaries subtleties in the derivation and interpretation of constraints can arise; iii) we investigate how deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, potentially alleviating these anomalies, can alter the constraints. From a profile likelihood analysis, we derive constraints in agreement at the $\sim 10\%$ level with Bayesian posteriors. We find that the weak preference for negative neutrino masses is mostly present for Planck 18 data, affected by the well-known `lensing anomaly'. It disappears when the new Planck 2020 HiLLiPoP is used, leading to significantly weaker constraints. Additionally, the pull towards negative masses in DESI data stems from the $z=0.7$ bin, which contains a BAO measurement in $\sim 3\sigma$ tension with Planck expectations. Without this bin, and in combination with HiLLiPoP, the bound relaxes to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.11\,{\rm eV}$ at 95\% CL. The recent preference for dynamical dark energy alleviates this tension and further weakens the bound. As we are at the dawn of a neutrino mass discovery from cosmology, it will be very exciting to see if this trend is confirmed by future data.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Five-Point Two-Mass Planar Integrals and Double Lagrangian Insertions in a Wilson Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the complete set of planar two-loop five-point Feynman integrals with two off-shell external legs. These integrals are relevant, for instance, for the calculation of the second-order QCD corrections to the production of two heavy vector bosons in association with a jet or a photon at a hadron collider. We construct pure bases for these integrals and reconstruct their analytic differential equations in canonical form through numerical sampling over finite fields. The newly identified symbol alphabet, one of the most complex to date, provides valuable data for bootstrap methods. We then apply our results to initiate the study of double Lagrangian insertions in a four-cusp Wilson loop in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, computing it through two loops. We observe that it is finite, conformally invariant in four dimensions, and of uniform transcendentality. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence for its positivity within the amplituhedron region through two loops.</description>
