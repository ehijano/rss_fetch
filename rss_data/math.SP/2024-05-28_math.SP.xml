      <title>Universal lower bounds for Dirichlet eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a bounded domain and let $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots$ denote the sequence of eigenvalues of the Laplacian subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. We consider inequalities for $\lambda_n$ that are independent of the domain $\Omega$. A well-known such inequality follows from the Berezin-Li-Yau approach $$\lambda_n \geq \frac{d}{d+2} \frac{4 \pi^2 n^{2/d}}{ (|\Omega| \omega_d)^{2/d}}.$$ The purpose of this paper is to point out a certain degree of flexibility in the Li-Yau approach. We use it to show that, for all $1 \leq k \leq n$, $$ \lambda_n \geq \frac{d}{d+2} \frac{4 \pi^2 n^{2/d}}{ (|\Omega| \omega_d)^{2/d}} + \frac{k}{n}(\lambda_n - \lambda_k).$$ This correction term is, at least asymptotically, not of lower order but comparable to the leading term. Moreover, the Berezin-Li-Yau inequality cannot be close to sharp on average. A family of universal inequalities follows as a byproduct: one example is, when $d=2$, the inequality $2 \lambda_n + \lambda_{2n} \geq 10 \pi n /|\Omega|$.</description>

      <title>Decorrelation in Local Statistics for random operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the local spectral statistics in the localised region of various random operator models, including the $d$-dimensional the Anderson model and random Schr\"odinger operators. It is already established, in the above models, that at an energy $E$, in the localised energy region of the spectrum, where the density of states $n(E) &gt; 0$, the local eigenvalue statistics $X_E$ is a Poisson processes with intensity $n(E) \mathcal{L}$, $\mathcal{L}$ being the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$. The question of independence of $X_E, X_{E^\prime}$ for distinct energies was partially solved in the literature. We solve it completely for all the models for which the Minami technique works.</description>

      <title>Fractional Laplacian in V-shaped waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral properties of the restricted fractional Dirichlet Laplacian in ${\sf V}$-shaped waveguides are studied. The continuous spectrum for such domains with cylindrical outlets is known to occupy the ray $[\Lambda_\dagger, +\infty)$ with the threshold corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of the cross-sectional problems. In this work the presence of a discrete spectrum at any junction angle is established along with the monotonic dependence of the discrete spectrum on the angle.</description>

      <title>Eventually positive semigroups: spectral and asymptotic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral theory of semigroup generators is a crucial tool for analysing the asymptotic properties of operator semigroups. Typically, Tauberian theorems, such as the ABLV theorem, demand extensive information about the spectrum to derive convergence results. However, the scenario is significantly simplified for positive semigroups on Banach lattices. This observation extends to the broader class of eventually positive semigroups -- a phenomenon observed in various concrete differential equations. In this paper, we investigate the spectral and asymptotic properties of eventually positive semigroups, focusing particularly on the persistently irreducible case. Our findings expand upon the existing theory of eventual positivity, offering new insights into the cyclicity of the peripheral spectrum and asymptotic trends. Notably, several arguments for positive operators and semigroups do not apply in our context, necessitating the use of ultrapower arguments to circumvent these challenges.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Theory of Integer Quantum Hall Effectin Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates interface modes in a square lattice of photonic crystal composed of gyromagnetic particles with $C_{4v}$ point group symmetry. The study shows that Dirac or linear degenerate points cannot occur at the three high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone where two Bloch bands touch. Instead, a touch point at the M-point has a quadratic degeneracy in the generic case. It is further proved that when a magnetic field is applied to the two sides of an interface in opposite directions, two interface modes that are supported along that interface can be bifurcated from the quadratic degenerate point. The results provide a mathematical foundation for the first experiment realization of the integer quantum Hall effect in the context of photonics.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Controlled Schemes for the Eigenvalue Problem of the Radiative Transfer Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The criticality problem in nuclear engineering asks for the principal eigen-pair of a Boltzmann operator describing neutron transport in a reactor core. Being able to reliably design, and control such reactors requires assessing these quantities within quantifiable accuracy tolerances. In this paper we propose a paradigm that deviates from the common practice of approximately solving the corresponding spectral problem with a fixed, presumably sufficiently fine discretization. Instead, the present approach is based on first contriving iterative schemes, formulated in function space, that are shown to converge at a quantitative rate without assuming any a priori excess regularity properties, and that exploit only properties of the optical parameters in the underlying radiative transfer model. We develop the analytical and numerical tools for approximately realizing each iteration step withing judiciously chosen accuracy tolerances, verified by a posteriori estimates, so as to still warrant quantifiable convergence to the exact eigen-pair. This is carried out in full first for a Newton scheme. Since this is only locally convergent we analyze in addition the convergence of a power iteration in function space to produce sufficiently accurate initial guesses. Here we have to deal with intrinsic difficulties posed by compact but unsymmetric operators preventing standard arguments used in the finite dimensional case. Our main point is that we can avoid any condition on an initial guess to be already in a small neighborhood of the exact solution. We close with a discussion of remaining intrinsic obstructions to a certifiable numerical implementation, mainly related to not knowing the gap between the principal eigenvalue and the next smaller one in modulus.</description>

      <title>Layers of planar hexagonal heterostructure modeled by quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The work presents a study on the quantum theory of periodic graphs applied to mono- and bilayer hexagonal materials. Different parameters associated with the atoms present at the vertices of these materials were analyzed, verifying the existence of gaps in the spectral bands and expressing the width of these openings according to the parameters. The study was extended to heterostructures with mixed layers and "sandwiches" of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. The dispersion relationships obtained in these models were analyzed and it was concluded that the inclusion of hBN layers on graphene layers can induce a gap in the graphene. Furthermore, it was observed that the inclusion of a single layer of graphene between two layers of hBN reduces the width of the spectral gap. The interaction between carbon atoms and nitrogen and boron atoms was pointed out as responsible for these results. Finally, the inclusion of a magnetic field in the hBN layer was considered, demonstrating that specific values of magnetic flux can eliminate conical touches in the dispersion relation of the operator and ensure the existence of gaps.</description>
