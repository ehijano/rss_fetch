      <title>Permutation Entropy for the Characterization of the Attractive Hamiltonian Mean-Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian Mean-Field (HMF) model is a long-range interaction model that exhibits quasi-stationary states associated with a phase transition. Its quasi-stationary states with a lifetime diverging with the number of particles in the system. These states are characterized by homogeneous or non-homogeneous structures in phase-space. There exists a phase-transition between these states that have been traditionally characterized by the their mean magnetization. However, the magnetization also exhibits fluctuations in time around its mean value, that can be an indicator of the kind of quasi-stationary state. Thus, we want to characterize the quasi-stationary states of the HMF model through the time-series of the magnetization and its fluctuations through a measure of information, i.e. the permutation entropy and the complexity-entropy plane. Permutation entropy is a measure for characterizing chaotic time series, especially in the presence of dynamic and observational noise, as it is computationally and conceptually simple. For non-homogeneous states, the permutation entropy shows that the HMF model tends towards order, while the magnetizacion fluctuations reveal reduced structures in time. On the contrary, homogeneous states tend to disorder and the structures of the magnetization fluctuations increase as the initial magnetization is larger. In all the study cases of this thesis, the HMF model is characterized by low entropy values but the highest possible complexity value. Thus, the HMF model can be described as a chaotic, deterministic and intermitent system. This aligns with previous studies of the model in the phase space. The results demonstrate that the HMF model can be understood and interpreted from the fluctuations of magnetization using permutation entropy and the complexity-entropy plane.</description>

      <title>A Note on Mathai's Entropy Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a paper [8] the authors classify entropy into three categories, as a thermodynamics quantity, as a measure of information production, and as a means of statistical inference. An entropy measure introduced by Mathai falls into the second and third categories. It is shown that this entropy measure is the same whether the variables involved are real or complex scalar, vector, or matrix variables. If the entropy measure is optimized under some moment-like conditions then one can obtain various types of densities which are applicable in different areas. Unlike Tsallis' entropy [9], it does not need an intermediary escort distribution to yield the desired results. Calculus of variation can be directly applied to obtain the desired results under Mathai's entropy. Tsallis' entropy, which is the basis of the area of non-extensive statistical mechanics, is a modified version of the ?-generalized entropy of Havrda-Charvat considered in [7]. Various types of distributions that can be obtained through optimization of Mathai's entropy, are illustrated in this paper.</description>

      <title>Random Walk on a Random Surface: Implications of Non-perturbative Concepts and Dynamical Emergence of Galilean Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model of random walk on a fluctuating rough surface using the field-theoretic renormalization group (RG). The surface is modelled by the well-known Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) stochastic equation while the random walk is described by the standard diffusion equation for a particle in a uniform gravitational field. In the RG approach, possible types of infrared (IR) asymptotic (long-time, large-distance) behaviour are determined by IR attractive fixed points. Within the one-loop RG calculation (the leading order in $\varepsilon=2-d$, $d$ being the spatial dimension), we found six possible fixed points or curves of points. Two of them can be IR attractive: the Gaussian point (free theory) and the nontrivial point where the KPZ surface is rough but its interaction with the random walk is irrelevant. For those perturbative fixed points, the spreading law for a particles' cloud coincides with that for ordinary random walk, $R(t)\sim t^{1/2}$. We also explored consequences of the presumed existence in the KPZ model of a non-perturbative strong-coupling fixed point. We found that it gives rise to an IR attractive fixed point in the full-scale model with the nontrivial spreading law $R(t)\sim t^{1/z}$, where the exponent $z&lt;2$ can be inferred from the non-perturbative analysis of the KPZ model. Thus, the spreading becomes faster on a rough fluctuating surface in comparison to a smooth one. What is more, the Galilean-type symmetry inherent for the pure KPZ model extends dynamically to the IR asymptotic behaviour of the Green's functions of the full model.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Classical One-dimensional Klein-Gordon Lattice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the thermodynamical properties of the classical one-dimensional Klein-Gordan lattice model ($n \ge 2$) by using the cluster variation method with linear response theory. The results of this method are exact in the thermodynamical limit. We present the single site reduced density matrix $\rho^{(1)}(z)$, averages such as $\langle z^2 \rangle$, $\langle |z^n|\rangle$, and $\langle (z_1-z_2)^2\rangle$, the specific heat $C_v$, and the static correlation functions. We analyzed the scaling behavior and obtained the exact scaling powers of these quantities in the low and high temperaures. Using these results, we gauge the accuracy of the projective truncation approximation for $\phi^{4}$ lattice model.</description>

      <title>A potpourri of results on molecular communication with active transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is a model of information transmission where the signal is transmitted by information-carrying molecules through their physical transport from a transmitter to a receiver through a communication channel. Prior efforts have identified suitable "information molecules" whose efficacy for signal transmission has been studied extensively in diffusive channels (DC). Although easy to implement, DCs are inefficient for distances longer than tens of nanometers. In contrast, molecular motor-driven nonequilibrium or active transport can drastically increase the range of communication and may permit efficient communication up to tens of micrometers. In this paper, we investigate how active transport influences the efficacy of molecular communication, quantified by the mutual information between transmitted and received signals. We consider two specific scenarios: (a) active transport through relays and (b) active transport through a mixture of active and diffusing particles. In each case, we discuss the efficacy of the communication channel and discuss their potential pitfalls.</description>

      <title>Temporal reversibility of reactive systems out of equilibrium: A strange paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics stipulates that entropy production is non-negative in macroscopic systems, reaching zero at thermodynamic equilibrium. As a corollary, this implies that the state trajectory of macroscopic systems is inherently time-irreversible under out-of-equilibrium conditions. However, over the past half-century, various studies have demonstrated that this principle does not hold for the composition sample path of some isothermal reactive systems. Theoretical frameworks leading to this unexpected observation primarily focus on zero-dimensional (perfectly homogeneous) systems, which exclude the effect of local fluctuations. This oversimplification might account for the paradoxical theoretical prediction. In the absence of pertinent experimental data, this paper aims to investigate this phenomenon through microscopic simulations.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of non-Markovian dissipative phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative phase transitions in quantum systems have been largely studied under the so-called Markovian approximation, where the environments to which the systems are coupled are memoryless. Here, we present a generalization of the spectral theory of dissipative phase transitions to non-Markovian systems, encompassing a much broader class of quantum materials and experiments and opening many possibilities for non-Markovian engineering of matter phases such as, as explored in the companion Letter [Debecker et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 140403 (2024)], reshaping of phase boundaries and triggering of phase transitions. We first prove several statements about the connections between the spectrum of the generator of the non-Markovian dynamics of general systems and dissipative phase transitions. Then, as a benchmark, we show that our framework can capture all the expected signatures of the superradiant phase transition appearing in a challenging $U(1)$-symmetric two-mode Dicke model from a reduced description of the dynamics of the atoms only, a task for which all other methods have failed so far.</description>

      <title>Singularity of Levy walks in the lifted Pomeau-Manneville map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since groundbreaking works in the 1980s it is well-known that simple deterministic dynamical systems can display intermittent dynamics and weak chaos leading to anomalous diffusion. A paradigmatic example is the Pomeau-Manneville (PM) map which, suitably lifted onto the whole real line, was shown to generate superdiffusion that can be reproduced by stochastic Levy walks (LWs). Here we report that this matching only holds for parameter values of the PM map that are of Lebesgue measure zero in its two-dimensional parameter space. This is due to a bifurcation scenario that the map exhibits under variation of one parameter. Constraining this parameter to specific singular values at which the map generates superdiffusion by varying the second one, as has been done in previous literature, we find quantitative deviations between deterministic diffusion and diffusion generated by stochastic LWs in a particular range of parameter values, which cannot be cured by simple LW modifcations. We also explore the effect of aging on superdiffusion in the PM map and show that this yields a profound change of the diffusive properties under variation of the aging time, which should be important for experiments. Our findings demonstrate that even in this simplest well-studied setting, a matching of deterministic and stochastic diffusive properties is non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Boundary Criticality in the 2d Random Quantum Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The edge of a quantum critical system can exhibit multiple distinct types of boundary criticality. We use a numerical real-space renormalization group (RSRG) to study the boundary criticality of a 2d quantum Ising model with random exchange couplings and transverse fields, whose bulk exhibits an infinite randomness critical point. This approach enables an asymptotically numerically exact extraction of universal scaling data from very large systems with many thousands of spins that cannot be efficiently simulated directly. We identify three distinct classes of boundary criticality, and extract key scaling exponents governing boundary-boundary and boundary-bulk correlations and dynamics. We anticipate that this approach can be generalized to studying a broad class of (disordered) boundary criticality, including symmetry-enriched criticality and edge modes of gapless symmetry-protected topological states, in contexts were other numerical methods are restricted to one-dimensional chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a Mittag-Leffler density has interesting properties. The Mittag-Leffler random variable has a structural representation in terms of a positive Levy variable and the power of a gamma variable where these two variables are independently distributed. It is shown that several central limit-type properties hold but the limiting forms are positive Levy variable rather than a Gaussian variable. A path is constructed from a Mittag-Leffler function to the Mathai pathway model which also provides paths to nonextensive statistics and superstatistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to numerically determine the location of a critical point in general systems using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros. This method makes use of the fact that the ratios of Lee-Yang zeros on various spatial volumes intersect at the critical point. While the method is similar to the Binder-cumulant analysis, it is advantageous in suppressing the finite-volume effects arising from the mixing of variables in general systems. We show that the method works successfully for numerically locating the CP in the three-dimensional three-state Potts model with a nonzero external field.</description>

      <title>How high dimensional neural dynamics are confined in phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High dimensional dynamics play a vital role in brain function, ecological systems, and neuro-inspired machine learning. Where and how these dynamics are confined in the phase space remains challenging to solve. Here, we provide an analytic argument that the confinement region is an M-shape when the neural dynamics show a diversity, with two sharp boundaries and a flat low-density region in between. Despite increasing synaptic strengths in a neural circuit, the shape remains qualitatively the same, while the left boundary is continuously pushed away. However, in deep chaotic regions, an arch-shaped confinement gradually emerges. Our theory is supported by numerical simulations on finite-sized networks. This analytic theory opens up a geometric route towards addressing fundamental questions about high dimensional non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Prewetting in Supracritical Fluid Mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this communication we demonstrate the existence of a first-order prewetting transition of a supracritical model polymer solution adjacent to an attractive surface. The model fluid we use mimics (qualitatively) an aqueous polyethylene oxide solution and, like the actual solution, displays a closed loop 2-phase region with an upper and lower critical solution temperature. The model fluid is shown to undergo a prewetting transition at an adjacent attractive surface even at temperatures below the lower critical solution temperature (supracriticality). This phenomenon follows from non-local thermodynamics when the lengthscale of the relevant fluid structures of surface films are commensurate or smaller than the range of intermolecular interactions.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Superlattice Phase Diagram of Transition Metal Intercalation in Bilayer 2H-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals hosts intercalated with transition metal (TM) ions exhibit a range of magnetic properties strongly influenced by the structural order of the intercalants. However, predictive computational models for the intercalant ordering phase diagram are lacking, complicating experimental pursuits to target key structural phases. Here we use Density Functional Theory (DFT) to construct a pairwise lattice model and Monte Carlo to determine its associated thermodynamic phase diagram. To circumvent the complexities of modeling magnetic effects, we use the diamagnetic ions Zn$^{2+}$ and Sc$^{3+}$ as computationally accessible proxies for divalent and trivalent species of interest (Fe$^{2+}$ and Cr$^{3+}$), which provide insights into the high-temperature thermodynamic phase diagram well above the paramagnetic transition temperature. We find that electrostatic coupling between intercalants is almost entirely screened, so the pairwise lattice model represents a coarse-grained charge density reorganization about the intercalated sites. The resulting phase diagram reveals that the entropically-favored $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ ordering and coexisting locally ordered $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ and $2 \times 2$ domains persist across a range of temperatures and intercalation densities. This occurs even at quarter filling of interstitial sites (corresponding to bulk stoichiometries of M$_{0.25}$TaS$_2$; M = intercalant ion) where a preference for long-range $2 \times 2$ order is typically assumed.</description>

      <title>Vicsek Model Meets DBSCAN: Cluster Phases in the Vicsek Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vicsek model, which was originally proposed to explain the dynamics of bird flocking, exhibits a phase transition with respect to the absolute value of the mean velocity. Although clusters of agents can be easily observed via numerical simulations of the Vicsek model, qualitative studies are lacking. We study the clustering structure of the Vicsek model by applying DBSCAN, a recently-introduced clustering algorithm, and report that the Vicsek model shows a phase transition with respect to the number of clusters: from O(N) to O(1), with N being the number of agents, when increasing the magnitude of noise for a fixed radius that specifies the interaction of the Vicsek model. We also report that the combination of the order parameter proposed by Vicsek et al. and the number of clusters defines at least four phases of the Vicsek model.</description>

      <title>Local temperature measurement in molecular dynamics simulations with rigid constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraining molecules in simulations (such as with constant bond lengths and/or angles) reduces their degrees of freedom (DoF), which in turn affects temperature calculations in those simulations. When local temperatures are measured, e.g. from a set of atoms in a subvolume or from velocities in one Cartesian direction, the result can appear to unphysically violate equipartition of the kinetic energy if the local DoF are not correctly calculated. Here we determine how to correctly calculate local temperatures from arbitrary Cartesian component kinetic energies, accounting for general geometric constraints, by self-consistently evaluating the DoF of atoms subjected to those constraints. The method is validated on a variety of test systems, including systems subject to a temperature gradient and those confined between walls. It is also shown to provide a sensitive test for the breakdown of kinetic energy equipartition caused by the approximate nature of numerical integration or insufficient equilibration times. As a practical demonstration, we show that kinetic energy equipartition between C and H atoms connected by rigid bonds can be violated even at the commonly-used time step of 2 fs, and that this equipartition violation appears to usefully indicate configurational overheating.</description>

      <title>Decomposing force fields as flows on graphs reconstructed from stochastic trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disentangling irreversible and reversible forces from random fluctuations is a challenging problem in the analysis of stochastic trajectories measured from real-world dynamical systems. We present an approach to approximate the dynamics of a stationary Langevin process as a discrete-state Markov process evolving over a graph-representation of phase-space, reconstructed from stochastic trajectories. Next, we utilise the analogy of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of an edge-flow on a contractible simplicial complex with the associated decomposition of a stochastic process into its irreversible and reversible parts. This allows us to decompose our reconstructed flow and to differentiate between the irreversible currents and reversible gradient flows underlying the stochastic trajectories. We validate our approach on a range of solvable and nonlinear systems and apply it to derive insight into the dynamics of flickering red-blood cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. In particular, we capture the difference in irreversible circulating currents between healthy and passive cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. Our method breaks new ground at the interface of data-driven approaches to stochastic dynamics and graph signal processing, with the potential for further applications in the analysis of biological experiments and physiological recordings. Finally, it prompts future analysis of the convergence of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition in discrete and continuous spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.02867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics is based on probabilities as fundamental entities of a mathematical description. Expectation values of observables are computed according to the classical statistical rule. The overall probability distribution for one world covers all times. The quantum formalism arises once one focuses on the evolution of the time-local probabilistic information. Wave functions or the density matrix allow the formulation of a general linear evolution law for classical statistics. The quantum formalism for classical statistics is a powerful tool which allows us to implement for generalized Ising models the momentum observable with the associated Fourier representation. The association of operators to observables permits the computation of expectation values in terms of the density matrix by the usual quantum rule. We show that probabilistic cellular automata are quantum systems in a formulation with discrete time steps and real wave functions. With a complex structure the evolution operator for automata can be expressed in terms of a Hamiltonian involving fermionic creation and annihilation operators. The time-local probabilistic information amounts to a subsystem of the overall probabilistic system which is correlated with its environment consisting of the past and future. Such subsystems typically involve probabilistic observables for which only a probability distribution for their possible measurement values is available. Incomplete statistics does not permit to compute classical correlation functions for arbitrary subsystem-observables. Bell's inequalities are not generally applicable.</description>

      <title>Bayan Algorithm: Detecting Communities in Networks Through Exact and Approximate Optimization of Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04562v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection is a classic network problem with extensive applications in various fields. Its most common method is using modularity maximization heuristics which rarely return an optimal partition or anything similar. Partitions with globally optimal modularity are difficult to compute, and therefore have been underexplored. Using structurally diverse networks, we compare 30 community detection methods including our proposed algorithm that offers optimality and approximation guarantees: the Bayan algorithm. Unlike existing methods, Bayan globally maximizes modularity or approximates it within a factor. Our results show the distinctive accuracy and stability of maximum-modularity partitions in retrieving planted partitions at rates higher than most alternatives for a wide range of parameter settings in two standard benchmarks. Compared to the partitions from 29 other algorithms, maximum-modularity partitions have the best medians for description length, coverage, performance, average conductance, and well clusteredness. These advantages come at the cost of additional computations which Bayan makes possible for small networks (networks that have up to 3000 edges in their largest connected component). Bayan is several times faster than using open-source and commercial solvers for modularity maximization, making it capable of finding optimal partitions for instances that cannot be optimized by any other existing method. Our results point to a few well performing algorithms, among which Bayan stands out as the most reliable method for small networks. A Python implementation of the Bayan algorithm (bayanpy) is publicly available through the package installer for Python.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Geometry of Entanglement in Many-Body Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new framework is formulated to study entanglement dynamics in many-body quantum systems along with an associated geometric description. In this formulation, called the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF), the system's wave function or density matrix is transformed into a new space of complex functions with isolated singularities. Accordingly, entanglement dynamics is encoded in specific residues of the QCTF, and importantly, the explicit evaluation of the system's time dependence is avoided. Notably, the QCTF formulation allows for various algebraic simplifications and approximations to address the normally encountered complications due to the exponential growth of the many-body Hilbert space with the number of bodies. These simplifications are facilitated through considering the patterns, in lieu of the elements, lying within the system's state. Consequently, a main finding of this paper is the exterior (Grassmannian) algebraic expression of many-body entanglement as the collective areas of regions in the Hilbert space spanned by pairs of projections of the wave function onto an arbitrary basis. This latter geometric measure is shown to be equivalent to the second-order R\'enyi entropy. Additionally, the geometric description of the QCTF shows that characterizing features of the reduced density matrix can be related to experimentally observable quantities. The QCTF-based geometric description offers the prospect of theoretically revealing aspects of many-body entanglement, by drawing on the vast scope of methods from geometry.</description>

      <title>Topological fingerprints in Liouvillian gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology in many-body physics usually emerges as a feature of equilibrium quantum states. We show that topological fingerprints can also appear in the relaxation rates of open quantum systems. To demonstrate this we consider one of the simplest models that has two topologically distinct phases in its ground state: the Kitaev chain model for the $p$-wave superconductor. After introducing dissipation to this model we estimate the Liouvillian gap in both strong and weak dissipative limits. Our results show that a non-zero superconducting pairing opens a Liouvillian gap that remains open in the limit of infinite system size. At strong dissipation this gap is essentially unaffected by the topology of the underlying Hamiltonian ground state. In contrast, when dissipation is weak, the topological phase of the Hamiltonian ground state plays a crucial role in determining the character of the Liouvillian gap. We find, for example, that in the topological phase this gap is completely immune to changes in the chemical potential. On the other hand, in the non-topological phase the Liouvillian gap is suppressed by a large chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Robust teleportation of a surface code and cascade of topological quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teleportation is a facet where quantum measurements can act as a powerful resource in quantum physics, as local measurements allow to steer quantum information in a non-local way. While this has long been established for a single Bell pair, the teleportation of a many-qubit entangled state using non-maximally entangled resources presents a fundamentally different challenge. Here we investigate a tangible protocol for teleporting a long-range entangled surface code state using elementary Bell measurements and its stability in the presence of coherent errors that weaken the Bell entanglement. We relate the underlying threshold problem to the physics of anyon condensation under weak measurements and map it to a variant of the Ashkin-Teller model of statistical mechanics with Nishimori type disorder, which gives rise to a cascade of phase transitions. Tuning the angle of the local Bell measurements, we find a continuously varying threshold. Notably, the threshold moves to infinity for the $X+Z$ angle along the self-dual line -- indicating that infinitesimally weak entanglement is sufficient in teleporting a self-dual topological surface code. Our teleportation protocol, which can be readily implemented in dynamically configurable Rydberg atom arrays, thereby gives guidance for a practical demonstration of the power of quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Reducing segregation in vibrated binary-sized granular mixtures by excessive small particle introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically examine binary-sized granular mixtures confined between two parallel walls subjected to vertical vibration using the discrete element method. For a size ratio of $3$ between large and small particles, we study the structure of large particles in moderately dense regimes where the combined two-dimensional packing fractions of both particle sizes exceed $1$. When the fraction of small particles is small, segregation of the large particles occurs. In contrast, as the fraction of small particles increases, an effective repulsion between the large particles emerges over distances greater than the large particle diameter, suppressing their segregation. The emergence of reduction in segregation is confirmed for another size ratio, vibrational acceleration, system size, and for a case of bidisperse size distribution. Additionally, at the size ratio of $3$, the effective repulsion induces a hexagonal phase of the large particles at packing fractions lower than in mono-component systems. This work will provide a fresh insight into granular physics, prompting further experimental and theoretical study.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics of Random Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theories with central charge $c\le1$ on random surfaces have been extensively studied in the past. Here, this discussion is extended from their equilibrium distribution to their critical dynamics. This is motivated by the conjecture that these models describe the time evolution of certain social networks that are self-driven to a critical point. The time evolution of the surface area is shown to follow a Cox Ingersol Ross process. Planar surfaces shrink, while higher genus surfaces grow until the cosmological constant stops their growth. Two different equilibrium states are distinguished, dominated by (i) planar surfaces, and (ii) ``foamy'' surfaces, whose genus diverges. Time variations of the order parameter are analyzed and are found to have generalized hyperbolic distributions. In state (i), those have power law tails with a tail index close to 4. Analogies between the time evolution of the order parameter and a multifractal random walk are also pointed out.</description>

      <title>Everything everywhere all at once, a probability-based enhanced sampling approach to rare events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17029v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of studying rare events is central to many areas of computer simulations. In a recent paper [Kang, P., et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460, 2024], we have shown that a powerful way of solving this problem passes through the computation of the committor function, and we have demonstrated how the committor can be iteratively computed in a variational way and the transition state ensemble efficiently sampled. Here, we greatly ameliorate this procedure by combining it with a metadynamics-like enhanced sampling approach in which a logarithmic function of the committor is used as a collective variable. This integrated procedure leads to an accurate and balanced sampling of the free energy surface in which transition states and metastable basins are studied with the same thoroughness. We also show that our approach can be used in cases in which competing reactive paths are possible and intermediate metastable are encountered. In addition, we demonstrate how physical insights can be obtained from the optimized committor model and the sampled data, thus providing a full characterization of the rare event under study. We ascribe the success of this approach to the use of a probability-based description of rare events.</description>
