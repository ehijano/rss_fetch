      <title>Probabilistic Definition of the Schwarzian Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the Schwarzian Field Theory as a finite measure on $\mathrm{Diff}^1(\mathbb{T})/\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and compute its generalised partition functions exactly using methods of stochastic analysis. The Schwarzian Field Theory has attracted recent attention due to its role in the analysis of the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev model and as the proposed holographic dual to Jackiw--Teitelboim gravity. In two companion papers by Losev, the predicted exact cross-ratio correlation functions for non-crossing Wilson lines and the large deviations are derived from the probability measure.}</description>

      <title>Large Deviations of the Schwarzian Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a large deviations principle for the probabilistic Schwarzian Field Theory at low temperatures. We demonstrate that the good rate function is equal to the action of the Schwarzian Field Theory, and we find its minimisers. In addition, we define an analogue of the H\"{o}lder condition on the functional space $\mathrm{Diff}^1(\mathbb{T})/\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ in terms of cross-ratio observables, characterise them in terms of the usual H\"{o}lder property on the space of continuous functions, and deduce the corresponding compact embedding theorem. We also show that the Schwarzian measure concentrates on functions satisfying the defined condition.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Correlation Functions of the Schwarzian Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study correlation functions of the probabilistic Schwarzian Field Theory. We compute cross-ratio correlation functions exactly in the case when the corresponding Wilson lines do not intersect, confirming predictions made in the physics literature via limit of the conformal bootstrap and the DOZZ formula. Moreover, we prove that these correlation functions characterise the measure uniquely. We use them to define and compute the stress-energy tensor correlation functions, and demonstrate, in particular, that these agree with the results obtained earlier by formal differentiation of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Tame sparse exponential random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a precise estimate of the probability that the sparse binomial random graph contains a large number of vertices in a triangle. The estimate of log of this probability is correct up to second order, and enables us to propose an exponential random graph model based on the number of vertices in a triangle. Specifically, by tuning a single parameter, we can with high probability induce any given fraction of vertices in a triangle. Moreover, in the proposed exponential random graph model we derive the large deviation principle for the number of edges. As a byproduct, we propose a consistent estimator of the tuning parameter.</description>

      <title>Small-ball estimates for random walks on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new inequality bounding the probability that the random walk on a group has small total displacement in terms of the spectral and isoperimetric profiles of the group. This inequality implies that if the random walk on the group is diffusive then Cheeger's inequality is sharp in the sense that the isoperimetric profile $\Phi$ and spectral profile $\Lambda$ of the group are related by $\Lambda \simeq \Phi^2$. Our inequality also yields substantial progress on a conjecture of Lyons, Peres, Sun, and Zheng (2017) stating that for any transient random walk on an infinite, finitely generated group, the expected occupation time of the ball of radius $r$ is $O(r^2)$: We prove that this conjecture holds for every group of superpolynomial growth whose spectral profile is slowly varying, which we conjecture is always the case. For groups of exponential or stretched-exponential growth satisfying a further mild regularity assumption on their spectral profile, our method yields the strong quantitative small-ball estimate \[-\log \mathbb{P}\bigl(d(X_0,X_n) \leq \varepsilon n^{1/2}\bigr) \succeq \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \wedge (-\log \mathbb{P}(X_n=X_0)),\] which is sharp for the lamplighter group. Finally, we prove that the regularity assumptions needed to apply the strongest versions our results are satisfied for several classical examples where the spectral profile is not known explicitly, including the first Grigorchuk group and Thompson's group $F$.</description>

      <title>Recurrence and transience of the critical random walk snake in random conductances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the recurrence and transience of the $\mathbb{Z}^d$-valued branching random walk in random environment indexed by a critical Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson tree, conditioned to survive. The environment is made either of random conductances or of random traps on each vertex. We show that when the offspring distribution is non degenerate with a finite third moment and the environment satisfies some suitable technical assumptions, then the process is recurrent up to dimension four, and transient otherwise. The proof is based on a truncated second moment method, which only requires to have good estimates on the quenched Green's function. Notably, this provides an alternate proof to the previous argument of Benjamini and Curien in the case of a deterministic, homogeneous environment.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Properties of Random Homology Induced by Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior, in the long time limit, of the random homology associated to realizations of stochastic diffusion processes on a compact Riemannian manifold. In particular a rigidity result is established: if the rate is quadratic, then the manifold is a locally trivial fiber bundle over a flat torus, with fibers being minimal in a weighted sense (that is, regarding the manifold as a metric measured space, with the invariant probability being the weight measure). Surprisingly, this entails that at least for some classes of manifolds, the homology of non-reversible processes relaxes to equilibrium slower than its reversible counterpart (as opposed to the respective empirical measure, which relaxes faster).</description>

      <title>Infinitely divisible modified Bessel distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on continuous univariate probability distributions, like McKay distributions, $K$-distribution, generalized inverse Gaussian distribution and generalised McKay distributions, with support $[0,\infty),$ which are related to modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds and in most cases we show that they belong to the class infinitely divisible distributions, self-decomposable distributions, generalized gamma convolutions and hyperbolically completely monotone densities. Some of the results are known, however the proofs are new and we use special functions technique. Integral representations of quotients of Tricomi hypergeometric functions as well as of quotients of Gaussian hypergeometric functions, or modified Bessel functions of the second kind play an important role in our study. In addition, by using a different approach we rediscover a Stieltjes transform representation due to Hermann Hankel for the product of modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds and we also deduce a series of new Stieltjes transform representations for products, quotients and their reciprocals concerning modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds. By using these results we obtain new infinitely divisible modified Bessel distributions with Laplace transforms related to modified Bessel functions of the first and second kind. Moreover, we show that the new Stieltjes transform representations have some interesting applications and we list some open problems which may be of interest for further research. In addition, we present a new proof via the Pick function characterization theorem for the infinite divisibility of the ratio of two gamma random variables and we present some new Stieltjes transform representations of quotients of Tricomi hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <title>Extensions of Panjer's recursion for mixed compound distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In actuarial practice, the usual independence assumptions for the collective risk model are often violated, implying a growing need for considering more general models that incorporate dependence. To this purpose, the present paper studies the mixed counterpart of the classical Panjer family of claim number distributions and their compound version, by allowing the parameters of the distributions to be viewed as random variables. Under the assumptions that the claim size process is conditionally i.i.d. and (conditionally) mutually independent of the claim counts, we provide a recursive algorithm for the computation of the probability mass function of the aggregate claim sizes. The case of a compound Panjer distribution with exchangeable claim sizes is also studied. For the sake of completeness, our results are illustrated by various numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time optimal control for trajectory planning under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a continuous-time optimal control framework for the generation of reference trajectories in driving scenarios with uncertainty. A previous work presented a discrete-time stochastic generator for autonomous vehicles; those results are extended to continuous time to ensure the robustness of the generator in a real-time setting. We show that the stochastic model in continuous time can capture the uncertainty of information by producing better results, limiting the risk of violating the problem's constraints compared to a discrete approach. Dynamic solvers provide faster computation and the continuous-time model is more robust to a wider variety of driving scenarios than the discrete-time model, as it can handle further time horizons, which allows trajectory planning outside the framework of urban driving scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of recurrence and transience for graphs over non-Archimedean ordered field. To do so we relate these graphs to random walks of directed graphs over the reals. In particular, we give a characterization of the real directed graphs which can arise is such a way. As a main result, we give characterization for recurrence and transience in terms of a quantity related to the capacity.</description>

Abstract: In an attempt to understand the origin and robustness of the Boltzmann/Gibbs/Shannon entropic functional, we adopt a geometric approach and discuss the implications of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and of Dvoretzky's theorem on convex bodies for the choice of this functional form. We contrast these results with a more recent result on flowers of balls, which may be interpreted as suggesting the use of power-law entropies for some systems.</description>

      <title>Universal behaviour of majority bootstrap percolation on high-dimensional geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majority bootstrap percolation is a monotone cellular automata that can be thought of as a model of infection spreading in networks. Starting with an initially infected set, new vertices become infected once more than half of their neighbours are infected. The average case behaviour of this process was studied on the $n$-dimensional hypercube by Balogh, Bollob\'{a}s and Morris, who showed that there is a phase transition as the typical density of the initially infected set increases: For small enough densities the spread of infection is typically local, whereas for large enough densities typically the whole graph eventually becomes infected. Perhaps surprisingly, they showed that the critical window in which this phase transition occurs is bounded away from $1/2$, and they gave bounds on its width on a finer scale. In this paper we consider the majority bootstrap percolation process on a class of high-dimensional geometric graphs which includes many of the graph families on which percolation processes are typically considered, such as grids, tori and Hamming graphs, as well as other well-studied families of graphs such as (bipartite) Kneser graphs, including the odd graph and the middle layer graph. We show similar quantitative behaviour in terms of the location and width of the critical window for the majority bootstrap percolation process on this class of graphs.</description>

      <title>On the chaotic behavior of the Lagrangian flow of the 2D Navier-Stokes system with bounded degenerate noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a fluid governed by the randomly forced 2D Navier-Stokes system. It is assumed that the force is bounded, acts directly only on a small number of Fourier modes, and satisfies some natural decomposability and observability properties. Under these assumptions, we show that the Lagrangian flow associated with the random fluid exhibits chaotic behavior characterized by the strict positivity of the top Lyapunov exponent. To achieve this, we introduce a new abstract result that allows to derive positivity of the top Lyapunov exponent from controllability properties of the underlying deterministic system.</description>

      <title>The Topological Behavior of Preferential Attachment Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the higher-order connectivity of scale-free networks using algebraic topology. We model scale-free networks as preferential attachment graphs, and we study the algebraic-topological properties of their clique complexes. We focus on the Betti numbers and the homotopy-connectedness of these complexes. We determine the asymptotic almost sure orders of magnitude of the Betti numbers. We also establish the occurence of homotopical phase transitions for the infinite complexes, and we determine the critical thresholds at which the homotopy-connectivity changes. This partially verifies Weinberger's conjecture on the homotopy type of the infinite complexes. We conjecture that the mean-normalized Betti numbers converge to power-law distributions, and we present numerical evidence. Our results also highlight the subtlety of the scaling limit of topology, which arises from the tension between topological operations and analytical limiting process. We discuss such tension at the end of the Introduction.</description>

      <title>On the capacity functional of the infinite cluster of a Boolean model</title>

      <description>arXiv:1601.04945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The original 2017 version of this paper, published in Ann. Appl. Probab., 27, 1678--1801, contains a major gap in the proofs. In the subsequent publication in Ann. Appl. Probab., 34, 3370--3374, 2024, we indicated how to fix this. For convenience of the reader, we here update the original paper to incorporate the suggested fix.
  Consider a Boolean model in $R^d$ with balls of random, bounded radii with distribution $F_0$, centered at the points of a Poisson process of intensity $t&gt;0$. The capacity functional of the infinite cluster $Z_\infty$ is given by $\theta_L(t) = P(Z_\infty\cap L \neq \emptyset)$, defined for each compact $L\subset R^d$. We prove for any fixed $L$ and $F_0$ that $\theta_L(t)$ is infinitely differentiable in $t$, except at the critical value $t_c$; we give a Margulis-Russo type formula for the derivatives.
  More generally, allowing the distribution $F_0$ to vary and viewing $\theta_L$ as a function of the measure $F:=tF_0$, we show that it is infinitely differentiable in all directions with respect to the measure $F$ in the supercritical region of the cone of positive measures on a bounded interval.
  We also prove that $\theta_L(\cdot)$ grows at least linearly at the critical value. This implies that the critical exponent known as $\beta$ is at most 1 (if it exists) for this model. Along the way, we extend a result of H.Tanemura (1993), on regularity of the supercritical Boolean model in $d \geq 3$ with fixed-radius balls, to the case with bounded random radii.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1604.00056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concentration inequalities, which prove to be very useful in a variety of fields, provide fairly tight bounds for large deviation probability while central limit theorem (CLT) describes the asymptotic distribution around the mean (within scope of $\sqrt{n}$ order). Harris (1963) conjectured that for a supercritical branching random walk (BRW) of i.i.d offspring and iid displacement, population's positions in $nth$ generation approach to Gaussian distribution -- central limit theorem. This conjecture was latter proved by Stam (1966) and Kaplan and Asmussen (1976). Refinements and extensions followed. Yet little effort is known on large deviation probability for BRW. In this note, we suggest and verify a more general and probably more formal setting of BRW. Benefiting from this framework, a Chernoff bound for BRW is immediately obtained. The relation between RW (random walk) and BRW is addressed.</description>

      <title>Equality of critical parameters for percolation of Gaussian free field level-sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.07735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider upper level-sets of the Gaussian free field on $\mathbb Z^d$, for $d\geq 3$, above a given real-valued height parameter $h$. As $h$ varies, this defines a canonical percolation model with strong, algebraically decaying correlations. We prove that three natural critical parameters associated to this model, respectively describing a well-ordered subcritical phase, the emergence of an infinite cluster, and the onset of a local uniqueness regime in the supercritical phase, actually coincide. At the core of our proof lies a new interpolation scheme aimed at integrating out the long-range dependence of the Gaussian free field. Due to the strength of correlations, its successful implementation requires that we work in an effectively critical regime. Our analysis relies extensively on certain novel renormalization techniques that bring into play all relevant scales simultaneously. The approach in this article paves the way to a complete understanding of the off-critical phases for strongly correlated disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Universality and sharp matrix concentration inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, under mild assumptions, the spectrum of a sum of independent random matrices is close to that of the Gaussian random matrix whose entries have the same mean and covariance. This nonasymptotic universality principle yields sharp matrix concentration inequalities for general sums of independent random matrices when combined with the Gaussian theory of Bandeira, Boedihardjo, and Van Handel. A key feature of the resulting theory is that it is applicable to a broad class of random matrix models that may have highly nonhomogeneous and dependent entries, which can be far outside the mean-field situation considered in classical random matrix theory. We illustrate the theory in applications to random graphs, matrix concentration inequalities for smallest singular values, sample covariance matrices, strong asymptotic freeness, and phase transitions in spiked models.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorem in Disordered Monomer-Dimer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the disordered monomer-dimer model on general finite graphs with bounded degrees. Under the finite fourth moment assumption on the weight distributions, we prove a Gaussian central limit theorem for the free energy of the associated Gibbs measure with a rate of convergence. The central limit theorem continues to hold under a nearly optimal finite $(2+\epsilon)$-moment assumption on the weight distributions if the underlying graphs are further assumed to have a uniformly subexponential volume growth. This generalizes a recent result by Dey and Krishnan (arXiv:2109.12716) who showed a Gaussian central limit theorem in the disordered monomer-dimer model on cylinder graphs. Our proof relies on the idea that the disordered monomer-dimer model exhibits a decay of correlation with high probability. We also establish a central limit theorem for the Gibbs average of the number of dimers where the underlying graph has subexponential volume growth and the edge weights are Gaussians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We quantify superdiffusive transience for a two-dimensional random walk in which the vertical coordinate is a martingale and the horizontal coordinate has a positive drift that is a polynomial function of the individual coordinates and of the present time. We describe how the model was motivated through an heuristic connection to a self-interacting, planar random walk which interacts with its own centre of mass via an excluded-volume mechanism, and is conjectured to be superdiffusive with a scale exponent $3/4$. The self-interacting process originated in discussions with Francis Comets.</description>

      <title>Absence of shift-invariant Gibbs states (delocalisation) for one-dimensional $\mathbb Z$-valued fields with Long-Range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a modification of the proof of our paper [CvELNR18], in the spirit of [FP81], shows delocalisation in the long-range Discrete Gaussian Chain, and generalisations thereof, for any decay power $\alpha&gt;2$ and at all temperatures. The argument proceeds by contradiction: any shift-invariant and localised measure (in the $L^1$ sense), is a convex combination of ergodic localised measures. But the latter cannot exist: on one hand, by the ergodic theorem, the average of the field over growing boxes would be almost surely bounded ; on the other hand the measure would be absolutely continuous with respect to its height-shifted translates, as a simple relative entropy computation shows. This leads to a contradiction and answers, in a non-quantitative way, an open question stated in a recent paper [G23] of C.Garban.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Selection Problem Associated with the Poisson Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cowan and Zabczyk (1978) introduced a continuous-time generalisation of the secretary problem, where offers arrive at epochs of a homogeneous Poisson process. We expand their work to encompass the last-success problem under the Karamata-Stirling record profile. In this setting, the $k$th trial is a success with probability $p_k=\theta/(\theta+k-1)$ and parameter $\theta &gt; 0$. In the best-choice setting ($\theta=1$), the myopic strategy is optimal, and the proof hinges on verifying the monotonicity of certain critical roots. We establish this crucial result in the last-success case by exploiting a connection to the sign of the derivative in the first parameter of a quotient of Kummer's hypergeometric functions. Furthermore, we address the case of inhomogeneous arrivals by employing a point process of success events. We illustrate this approach using an example that combines an inhomogeneous intensity function with a continuous-time success profile. Finally, we derive bounds and asymptotics of the critical roots, strengthening and improving the findings of Ciesielski and Zabczyk (1979).</description>

Abstract: In this PhD thesis, we apply a combination of Malliavin calculus and Stein's method in the framework of probability approximations. The specific problems we tackle with these methods are motivated by probabilistic models in cosmology (Part I: Quantitative CLTs for non linear functionals of random hyperspherical harmonics) and finance (Part II: The fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in rough volatility modelling). In this second part we also apply techniques from Large Deviations theory (Section: Short-time asymptotics for non self-similar stochastic volatility models).</description>

      <title>On absolute continuity and maximal Garsia entropy for self-similar measures with algebraic contraction ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the self-similar measure $\nu_\lambda=\mathrm{law}\left(\sum_{j \geq 0} \xi_j \lambda^j\right)$ on $\mathbb{R}$, where $|\lambda|&lt;1$ and the $\xi_j \sim \nu$ are independent, identically distributed with respect to a measure $\nu$ finitely supported on $\mathbb{Z}$. One example of this is the classical Bernoulli convolution. It is known that for certain combinations of algebraic $\lambda$ and $\nu$ uniform on an interval, $\nu_\lambda$ is absolutely continuous and its Fourier transform has power decay (\cite{garsia1}, \cite{feng}); in the proof, it is exploited that for these combinations, a quantity called the Garsia entropy $h_{\lambda}(\nu)$ is maximal.
  We show that absolute continuity and power Fourier decay occur when $\lambda$ and $\nu$ are such that $h_{\lambda}(\nu)$ is maximal and classify all combinations for which this is the case. We find that if an algebraic $\lambda$ without a Galois conjugate of modulus exactly one has a $\nu$ such that $h_{\lambda}(\nu)$ is maximal, then all Galois conjugates of $\lambda$ must be smaller in modulus than one and $\nu$ must satisfy a certain finite set of linear equations in terms of $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>A Diffusion-Based Approach for Simulating Forward-in-Time State-Dependent Speciation and Extinction Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a general framework using a diffusion approximation to simulate forward-in-time state counts or frequencies for cladogenetic state-dependent speciation-extinction (ClaSSE) models. We apply the framework to various two- and three-region geographic-state speciation-extinction (GeoSSE) models. We show that the species range state dynamics simulated under tree-based and diffusion-based processes are comparable. We derive a method to infer rate parameters that are compatible with given observed stationary state frequencies and obtain an analytical result to compute stationary state frequencies for a given set of rate parameters. We also describe a procedure to find the time to reach the stationary frequencies of a ClaSSE model using our diffusion-based approach, which we demonstrate using a worked example for a two-region GeoSSE model. Finally, we discuss how the diffusion framework can be applied to formalize relationships between evolutionary patterns and processes under state-dependent diversification scenarios.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Look-ahead in Bayesian Optimization: Multilevel Monte Carlo is All you Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We leverage multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) to improve the performance of multi-step look-ahead Bayesian optimization (BO) methods that involve nested expectations and maximizations. Often these expectations must be computed by Monte Carlo (MC). The complexity rate of naive MC degrades for nested operations, whereas MLMC is capable of achieving the canonical MC convergence rate for this type of problem, independently of dimension and without any smoothness assumptions. Our theoretical study focuses on the approximation improvements for twoand three-step look-ahead acquisition functions, but, as we discuss, the approach is generalizable in various ways, including beyond the context of BO. Our findings are verified numerically and the benefits of MLMC for BO are illustrated on several benchmark examples. Code is available at https://github.com/Shangda-Yang/MLMCBO .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider strictly positive solutions to a class of fourth-order conservative quasilinear SPDEs on the $d$-dimensional torus modeled after the stochastic thin-film equation. We prove local Lipschitz estimates in Bessel potential spaces under minimal assumptions on the parameters and corresponding stochastic maximal $L^p$-regularity estimates for thin-film type operators with measurable in-time coefficients. As a result, we deduce local well-posedness of the stochastic thin-film equation as well as blow-up criteria and instantaneous regularization for the solution. In dimension one, we additionally close $\alpha$-entropy estimates and subsequently an energy estimate for the stochastic thin-film equation with an interface potential so that global well-posedness follows. We allow for a wide range of mobility functions including the power laws $u^n$ for $n\in [0,6)$ as long as the interface potential is sufficiently repulsive.</description>

Abstract: Quantum walks are referred to as quantum analogs to random walks in mathematics. They have been studied as quantum algorithms in quantum information for quantum computers. There are two types of quantum walks. One is the discrete-time quantum walk and the other is the continuous-time quantum walk. We study a continuous-time quantum walk on the half line and challenge to find a limit theorem for it in this paper. As a result, approximate behavior of the quantum walker is revealed after the system of quantum walk gets updated in long time.</description>

      <title>The Choquet-Deny Property for Groupoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A countable discrete group is called Choquet-Deny if for any non-degenerate probability measure on the group, the corresponding space of bounded harmonic functions is trivial. Building on the previous work of Jaworski, a complete characterization of Choquet-Deny groups was recently achieved by Frisch, Hartman, Tamuz, and Ferdowski. In this article, we extend the study of the Choquet-Deny property to the framework of discrete measured groupoids. Our primary result offers a complete characterization of this property in terms of the isotropy groups and the equivalence relation associated with the given groupoid. Additionally, we use the implications derived from our main theorem to classify the Choquet-Deny property of transformation groupoids.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations of a self-interacting diffusion on a ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate fluctuations in the average speed or current of a self-interacting diffusion (SID) on a ring, mimicking the non-Markovian behaviour of an agent influenced by its own path. We derive the SID's phase diagram, showing a delocalisation-localisation phase transition from self-repelling to self-attracting. Current fluctuations are analysed using: (i) an adiabatic approximation, where the system reaches its stationary distribution before developing current fluctuations, and (ii) an original extension of level 2.5 large deviations for Markov processes. The latter, combined with perturbation theory, provides an upper bound to current fluctuations, which is tight in the self-repelling region, while the former approximates current fluctuations well in all regimes. Both methods accurately estimate the asymptotic variance and suggests a phase transition at the onset of the localised regime.</description>
