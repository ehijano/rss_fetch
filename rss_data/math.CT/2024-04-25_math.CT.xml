      <title>Organizing Physics with Open Energy-Driven Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organizing physics has been a long-standing preoccupation of applied category theory, going back at least to Lawvere. We contribute to this research thread by noticing that Hamiltonian mechanics and gradient descent depend crucially on a consistent choice of transformation -- which we call a reaction structure -- from the cotangent bundle to the tangent bundle. We then construct a compositional theory of reaction structures. Reaction-based systems offer a different perspective on composition in physics than port-Hamiltonian systems or open classical mechanics, in that reaction-based composition does not create any new constraints that must be solved for algebraically.
  The technical contributions of this paper are the development of symmetric monoidal categories of open energy-driven systems and open differential equations, and a functor between them, functioning as a "functorial semantics" for reaction structures. This approach echoes what has previously been done for open games and open gradient-based learners, and in fact subsumes the latter. We then illustrate our theory by constructing an $n$-fold pendulum as a composite of $n$-many pendula.</description>

      <title>Pattern runs on matter: The free monad monad as a module over the cofree comonad comonad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interviews run on people, programs run on operating systems, voting schemes run on voters, games run on players. Each of these is an example of the abstraction pattern runs on matter. Pattern determines the decision tree that governs how a situation can unfold, while matter responds with decisions at each juncture.
  In this article, we will give a straightforward and concrete construction of the free monad monad for $(\mathbf{Poly}, \mathbin{\triangleleft}, \mathcal{y})$, the category of polynomial functors with the substitution monoidal product. Although the free monad has been well-studied in other contexts, the construction we give is streamlined and explicitly illustrates how the free monad represents terminating decision trees. We will also explore the naturally arising interaction between the free monad and cofree comonad. Again, while the interaction itself is known, the perspective we take is the free monad as a module over the cofree comonad. Lastly, we will give four applications of the module action to interviews, computer programs, voting, and games. In each example, we will see how the free monad represents pattern, the cofree comonad represents matter, and the module action represents runs on.</description>

      <title>Classification of connected \'etale algebras in multiplicity-free modular fusion categories up to rank nine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify connected \'etale algebras $A$'s in multiplicity-free modular fusion categories $\mathcal B$'s with $\text{rank}(\mathcal B)\le9$. We also identify categories $\mathcal B_A$'s of right $A$-modules. The results have physical applications in constraining renormalization group flows. As demonstration, we study massive renormalization group flows from non-unitary minimal models to predict ground state degeneracies and prove spontaneous $\mathcal B$-symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>The first step towards symplectic homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two categories related to symplectic manifolds:
  1. Objects are symplectic manifolds and morphisms are symplectic embeddings.
  2. Objects are symplectic manifolds endowed with compatible almost complex structure and morphisms are pseudoholomorphic maps.
  We define new homotopy theories for these categories. In particular, we give definitions of homotopy equivalent symplectic manifolds and define new cohomology theories. Theses cohomology theories are functorial, homotopy invariant and have other interesting properties.
  We also construct triangulated persistence category of symplectic manifolds. This allows to apply machinery developed Biran, Cornea, and Zhang and define distances between symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Effectful Semantics in Bicategories: Strong, Commutative, and Concurrent Pseudomonads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of strong and commutative monads in the 2-dimensional setting of bicategories. This provides a framework for the analysis of effects in many recent models which form bicategories and not categories, such as those based on profunctors, spans, or strategies over games.
  We then show how the 2-dimensional setting provides new insights into the semantics of concurrent functional programs. We introduce concurrent pseudomonads, which capture the fundamental weak interchange law connecting parallel composition and sequential composition. This notion brings to light an intermediate level, strictly between strength and commutativity, which is invisible in traditional categorical models. We illustrate the concept with the continuation pseudomonad in concurrent game semantics.
  In developing this theory, we take care to understand the coherence laws governing the structural 2-cells. We give many examples and prove a number of practical and foundational results.</description>

      <title>A generalization of operads based on subgraph contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the notion of operad that we call a contractad, whose set of operations is indexed by connected graphs and whose composition rules are numbered by contractions of connected subgraphs. We show that many classical operads, such as the operad of commutative algebras, Lie algebras, associative algebras, pre-Lie algebras, the little disks operad, and the operad of moduli spaces of stable curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}$ admit generalizations to contractads. We explain that standard tools like Koszul duality and the machinery of Gr\"obner bases can be easily generalized to contractads. We verify the Koszul property of the commutative, Lie, associative, and Gerstenhaber contractads.</description>
