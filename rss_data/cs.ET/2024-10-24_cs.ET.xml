      <title>Holon Programming Model -- A Software-Defined Approach for System of Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Systems of Systems evolve into increasingly complex networks, harnessing their collective potential becomes paramount. Traditional SoS engineering approaches lack the necessary programmability to develop third party SoS level behaviors. To address this challenge, we propose a software defined approach to enable flexible and adaptive programming of SoS. We introduce the Holon Programming Model, a software-defined framework designed to meet these needs. The Holon Programming Model empowers developers to design and orchestrate complex system behaviors effectively, as illustrated in our disaster management scenario. This research outlines the Holon Programming Model theoretical underpinnings and practical applications, with the aim of driving further exploration and advancement in the field of software defined SoS</description>

      <title>Fast classical simulation of qubit-qudit hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating quantum circuits is a computationally intensive task that relies heavily on tensor products and matrix multiplications, which can be inefficient. Recent advancements, eliminate the need for tensor products and matrix multiplications, offering significant improvements in efficiency and parallelization. Extending these optimizations, we adopt a block-simulation methodology applicable to qubit-qudit hybrid systems. This method interprets the statevector as a collection of blocks and applies gates without computing the entire circuit unitary. Our method, a spiritual successor of the simulator QuDiet \cite{Chatterjee_2023}, utilizes this block-simulation method, thereby gaining major improvements over the simulation methods used by its predecessor. We exhibit that the proposed method is approximately 10$\times$ to 1000$\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art simulator for simulating multi-level quantum systems with various benchmark circuits.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Assessment of Technology Acceptance and Learning Outcomes in Computer-based versus VR-based Pedagogical Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As educational technology evolves, the potential of Pedagogical Agents (PAs) in supporting education is extensively explored. Typically, research on PAs has primarily focused on computer-based learning environments, but their use in VR-based environments and integration into education is still in its infancy. To address this gap, this paper presents a mixed method comparative study that has been conducted to evaluate and examine how these computer-based PAs and VR-based PAs compare, towards their learning efficacy and technology acceptance. 92 Computing and Engineering undergraduate students were recruited and participated in an educational experience focusing on computing machinery education. The findings of this study revealed that both approaches can effectively facilitate learning acquisition, and both technologies have been positively perceived by participants toward acceptance, without any significant differences. The findings of this study shed light on the potential of utilizing intelligent PAs to support education, contributing towards the advancement of our understanding of how to integrate such technologies to develop learning interventions, and establishing the foundation for future investigations that aim to successfully integrate and use PAs in education.</description>

      <title>Comparing Quantum Encoding Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum computers continue to become more capable, the possibilities of their applications increase. For example, quantum techniques are being integrated with classical neural networks to perform machine learning. In order to be used in this way, or for any other widespread use like quantum chemistry simulations or cryptographic applications, classical data must be converted into quantum states through quantum encoding. There are three fundamental encoding methods: basis, amplitude, and rotation, as well as several proposed combinations. This study explores the encoding methods, specifically in the context of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning. Using the QuClassi quantum neural network architecture to perform binary classification of the `3' and `6' digits from the MNIST datasets, this study obtains several metrics such as accuracy, entropy, loss, and resistance to noise, while considering resource usage and computational complexity to compare the three main encoding methods.</description>
