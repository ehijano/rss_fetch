      <title>LQR based $\omega-$stabilization of a heat equation with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a heat equation with memory which is defined on a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and is driven by $m$ control inputs acting on the interior of the domain. Our objective is to numerically construct a state feedback controller for this equation such that, for each initial state, the solution of the closed-loop system decays exponentially to zero with a decay rate larger than a given rate $\omega&gt;0$, i.e. we want to solve the $\omega$-stabilization problem for the heat equation with memory. We first show that the spectrum of the state operator $A$ associated with this equation has an accumulation point at $-\omega_0&lt;0$. Given a $\omega\in(0,\omega_0)$, we show that the $\omega$-stabilization problem for the heat equation with memory is solvable provided certain verifiable conditions on the control operator $B$ associated with this equation hold. We then consider an appropriate LQR problem for the heat equation with memory. For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, we construct finite-dimensional approximations $A_n$ and $B_n$ of $A$ and $B$, respectively, and then show that by solving a corresponding approximation of the LQR problem a feedback operator $K_n$ can be computed such that all the eigenvalues of $A_n + B_n K_n$ have real part less than $-\omega$. We prove that $K_n$ for $n$ sufficiently large solves the $\omega$-stabilization problem for the heat equation with memory. A crucial and nontrivial step in our proof is establishing the uniform (in $n$) stabilizability of the pair $(A_n+\omega I, B_n)$. We have validated our theoretical results numerically using two examples: an 1D example on a unit interval and a 2D example on a square domain.</description>

      <title>Incompressible Optimal Transport and Applications in Fluid Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of incompressible fluid mixing arises in numerous engineering applications and has been well-studied over the years, yet many open questions remain. This paper aims to address the question "what do efficient flow fields for mixing look like, and how do they behave?" We approach this question by developing a framework which is inspired by the dynamic and geometric approach to optimal mass transport. Specifically, we formulate the fluid mixing problem as an optimal control problem where the dynamics are given by the continuity equation together with an incompressibility constraint. We show that within this framework, the set of reachable fluid configurations can formally be endowed with the structure of an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, with a metric which is induced by the control effort, and that flow fields which are maximally efficient at mixing correspond to geodesics in this Riemannian space.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Rendezvous and Docking Maneuver Control of Satellite using Cross-Feedback Sliding Mode Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite rendezvous and docking (RvD) maneuvers are essential for satellite servicing and in-orbit assembly. Traditional approaches often treat translational and rotational motions independently, simplifying control design but potentially leading to inefficiencies in maneuver time and fuel consumption. To address these challenges, a novel cross-feedback sliding mode controller has been proposed, developing an interdependent regulation system for translational and rotational motion. This method decouples the relative translational and rotational motion of chaser satellite with respect to target satellite while incorporating cross-feedback mechanisms to account for their inherent coupling. By incorporating rotational state information into translational control laws and vice versa, the approach ensures coordinated adjustments, enhancing maneuver efficiency. The chaser satellite manages both translational and rotational adjustments to rendezvous and dock with the target satellite. The stability of the cross-feedback sliding mode controller is established within the Lyapunov framework, and simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of this strategy.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Control Approach to Treatment Selection for Substance Use Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the massive costs and widespread harms of substance use, most individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) receive no treatment at all. Digital therapeutics platforms are an emerging low-cost and low-barrier means of extending treatment to those who need it. While there is a growing body of research focused on how treatment providers can identify which patients need SUD support (or when they need it), there is very little work that addresses how providers should select treatments that are most appropriate for a given patient. Because SUD treatment involves months or years of voluntary compliance from the patient, treatment adherence is a critical consideration for the treatment provider. In this paper we focus on algorithms that a treatment provider can use to match the burden-level of proposed treatments to the time-varying engagement state of the patient to promote adherence. We propose structured models for a patient's engagement over time and their treatment adherence decisions. Using these models we pose a stochastic control formulation of the treatment-provider's burden selection problem. We propose an adaptive control approach that estimates unknown patient parameters as new data are observed. We show that these estimates are consistent and propose algorithms that use these estimates to make appropriate treatment recommendations.</description>

      <title>Model-Predictive Planning and Airspeed Regulation to Minimize Flight Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although battery technology has advanced tremendously over the past decade, it continues to be a bottleneck for the mass adoption of electric aircraft in long-haul cargo and passenger delivery. The onboard energy is expected to be utilized in an efficient manner. Energy concumption modeling research offers increasingly accurate mathematical models, but there is scant research pertaining to real-time energy optimization at an operational level. Additionally, few publications include landing and take-off energy demands in their governing models. This work presents fundamental energy equations and proposes a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The proposed method demonstrates a unique approach to an energy consumption model that tracks real-time energy optimization along a predetermined path. The proposed PID controller was tested in simulation, and the results show its effectiveness and accuracy in driving the actual airspeed to converge to the optimal velocity without knowing the system dynamics. We also propose a model-predictive method to minimize the energy usage in landing and take-off by optimizing the flight trajectory.</description>

      <title>IRS Assisted Decentralized Learning for Wideband Spectrum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for reliable connectivity in industrial environments necessitates effective spectrum utilization strategies, especially in the context of shared spectrum bands.
  However, the dynamic spectrum-sharing mechanisms often lead to significant interference and critical failures, creating a trade-off between spectrum scarcity and under-utilization.
  This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS)-assisted spectrum sensing framework integrated with decentralized deep learning.
  The proposed model overcomes partial observation constraints and minimizes communication overhead while leveraging IRS technology to enhance spectrum sensing accuracy.
  Through comprehensive simulations, the framework demonstrates its ability to monitor wideband spectrum occupancy effectively, even under challenging signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.
  This approach offers a scalable and robust solution for spectrum management in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Uncharted Waters: A Gradual Approach to the Certification and Integration of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) in Global Maritime Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) into global maritime operations represents a transformative shift in the shipping industry, promising enhanced safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. However, the widespread adoption of autonomous ships necessitates a robust regulatory framework and rigorous certification processes to address the unique challenges posed by these advanced technologies. This paper proposes a gradual, multi-stage approach to the certification and integration of MASS, beginning with small-scale trials in controlled environments and progressing to large-scale international operations. Key considerations include the development of reliable control systems, cybersecurity measures, sensor technologies, and redundancy mechanisms to ensure safe and efficient navigation. Additionally, the paper explores the economic and environmental implications of autonomous shipping, as well as the evolving legal frameworks for liability and compensation in the event of collisions. By adopting a cautious and methodical approach, the maritime industry can mitigate risks and pave the way for the safe and sustainable integration of autonomous ships into global trade.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Incentive Strategies for Smart EV Charging Stations: An LLM-Driven User Digital Twin Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced electric vehicle demand response system based on large language models, aimed at optimizing the application of vehicle-to-grid technology. By leveraging an large language models-driven multi-agent framework to construct user digital twins integrated with multidimensional user profile features, it enables deep simulation and precise prediction of users' charging and discharging decision-making patterns. Additionally, a data- and knowledge-driven dynamic incentive mechanism is proposed, combining a distributed optimization model under network constraints to optimize the grid-user interaction while ensuring both economic viability and security. Simulation results demonstrate that the approach significantly improves load peak-valley regulation and charging/discharging strategies. Experimental validation highlights the system's substantial advantages in load balancing, user satisfaction and grid stability, providing decision-makers with a scalable V2G management tool that promotes the sustainable, synergistic development of vehicle-grid integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce behavioral inequalities as a way to model dynamical systems defined by inequalities among their variables of interest. We claim that such a formulation enables the representation of safety-aware dynamical systems, systems with bounds on disturbances, practical design limits and operational boundaries, etc. We develop a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of solutions to such behavioral inequalities and provide a parametrization of solutions when they exist. Finally, we show the efficacy of the proposed method in two practical examples.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Bandwidth and Bode Diagrams based on Scaled Relative Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems. In this paper, we use the restriction of the SRG to particular input spaces to compute frequency-dependent gain bounds for incrementally stable nonlinear systems. This leads to a nonlinear (NL) generalization of the Bode diagram, where the sinusoidal, harmonic, and subharmonic inputs are considered separately. When applied to the analysis of the NL loop transfer and sensitivity, we define a notion of bandwidth for both the open-loop and closed-loop, compatible with the LTI definitions. We illustrate the power of our method on the analysis of a DC motor with a parasitic nonlinearity, verifying our results in simulations.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Domain Bounds for the Multiconductor Telegrapher's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish mathematical bounds on the chain, ABCD and immittance matrices of a multiconductor transmission line, based on the Telegrapher's equation. Closed-form expressions for those matrices are also presented. Existing results that hold on the imaginary axis are extended to the complex plane, without reliance on a simultaneous diagonalizability assumption that is ubiquitous in the literature. Therefore, the results remain valid even when line symmetry breaks down, as in the case of electrical faults. The system-theoretic properties established here are of general relevance to control, power systems, and signal processing involving multiconductor transmission lines.</description>

      <title>Convex Computations for Controlled Safety Invariant Sets of Black-box Discrete-time Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying controlled safety invariant sets (CSISs) is essential in safety-critical applications. This paper tackles the problem of identifying CSISs for black-box discrete-time systems, where the model is unknown and only limited simulation data is accessible. Traditionally, a CSIS is defined as a subset of a safe set, encompassing initial states for which a control input exists that keeps the system within the set at the next time step-this is referred to as the one-step invariance property. However, the requirement for one-step invariance can be equivalently translated into a stricter condition of ``always-invariance'', meaning that there exist control inputs capable of keeping the system within this set indefinitely. Such a condition may prove overly stringent or impractical for black-box systems, where predictions can become unreliable beyond a single time step or a limited number of finite time steps. To overcome the challenges posed by black-box systems, we reformulate the one-step invariance property in a ``Probably Approximately Correct'' (PAC) sense. This approach allows us to assess the probability that a control input exists to keep the system within the CSIS at the next time step, with a predefined level of confidence. If the system successfully remains within the set at the next time step, we can then reapply the invariance evaluation to the new state, thereby facilitating a recursive assurance of invariance. Our method employs barrier functions and scenario optimization, resulting in a linear programming method to estimate PAC CSISs. Finally, the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on several examples.</description>

      <title>Market-Oriented Flow Allocation for Thermal Solar Plants: An Auction-Based Methodology with Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to optimize thermal balance in parabolic trough collector (PTC) plants. It uses a market-based system to distribute flow among loops combined with an artificial neural network (ANN) to reduce computation and data requirements. This auction-based approach balances loop temperatures, accommodating varying thermal losses and collector efficiencies. Validation across different thermal losses, optical efficiencies, and irradiance conditions-sunny, partially cloudy, and cloudy-show improved thermal power output and intercept factors compared to a no-allocation system. It demonstrates scalability and practicality for large solar thermal plants, enhancing overall performance. The method was first validated through simulations on a realistic solar plant model, then adapted and successfully tested in a 50 MW solar trough plant, demonstrating its advantages. Furthermore, the algorithms have been implemented, commissioned, and are currently operating in 13 commercial solar trough plants.</description>

      <title>System Level Synthesis for Affine Control Policies: Model Based and Data-Driven Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an increasing need for effective control of systems with complex dynamics, particularly through data-driven approaches. System Level Synthesis (SLS) has emerged as a powerful framework that facilitates the control of large-scale systems while accounting for model uncertainties. SLS approaches are currently limited to linear systems and time-varying linear control policies, thus limiting the class of achievable control strategies. We introduce a novel closed-loop parameterization for time-varying affine control policies, extending the SLS framework to a broader class of systems and policies. We show that the closed-loop behavior under affine policies can be equivalently characterized using past system trajectories, enabling a fully data-driven formulation. This parameterization seamlessly integrates affine policies into optimal control problems, allowing for a closed-loop formulation of general Model Predictive Control (MPC) problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to extend SLS to affine policies in both model-based and data-driven settings, enabling an equivalent formulation of MPC problems using closed-loop maps. We validate our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating that our model-based and data-driven affine SLS formulations achieve performance on par with traditional model-based MPC.</description>

      <title>Hidden Markov Model Filtering with Equal Exit Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) provide a rigorous framework for inference in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the alpha-HMM algorithm motivated by the optimal online filtering formulation in settings where the true state evolves as a Markov chain with equal exit probabilities. We quantify the dynamics of the algorithm in stationary environments, revealing a trade-off between inference and adaptation, showing how key parameters and the quality of observations affect performance. Comprehensive theoretical analysis on the nonlinear dynamical system that governs the evolution of the log-belief ratio over time and numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively balances adaptation and inference performance.</description>

      <title>Learning with Imperfect Models: When Multi-step Prediction Mitigates Compounding Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compounding error, where small prediction mistakes accumulate over time, presents a major challenge in learning-based control. For example, this issue often limits the performance of model-based reinforcement learning and imitation learning. One common approach to mitigate compounding error is to train multi-step predictors directly, rather than relying on autoregressive rollout of a single-step model. However, it is not well understood when the benefits of multi-step prediction outweigh the added complexity of learning a more complicated model. In this work, we provide a rigorous analysis of this trade-off in the context of linear dynamical systems. We show that when the model class is well-specified and accurately captures the system dynamics, single-step models achieve lower asymptotic prediction error. On the other hand, when the model class is misspecified due to partial observability, direct multi-step predictors can significantly reduce bias and thus outperform single-step approaches. These theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, wherein we also (a) empirically evaluate an intermediate strategy which trains a single-step model using a multi-step loss and (b) evaluate performance of single step and multi-step predictors in a closed loop control setting.</description>

      <title>Quattro: Transformer-Accelerated Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator Framework for Fast Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time optimal control remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, especially for nonlinear systems with stringent performance requirements. As one of the representative trajectory optimization algorithms, the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) faces limitations due to their inherently sequential computational nature, which restricts the efficiency and applicability of real-time control for robotic systems. While existing parallel implementations aim to overcome the above limitations, they typically demand additional computational iterations and high-performance hardware, leading to only modest practical improvements. In this paper, we introduce Quattro, a transformer-accelerated iLQR framework employing an algorithm-hardware co-design strategy to predict intermediate feedback and feedforward matrices. It facilitates effective parallel computations on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on cart-pole and quadrotor systems show an algorithm-level acceleration of up to 5.3$\times$ and 27$\times$ per iteration, respectively. When integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, Quattro achieves overall speedups of 2.8$\times$ for the cart-pole and 17.8$\times$ for the quadrotor compared to the one that applies traditional iLQR. Transformer inference is deployed on FPGA to maximize performance, achieving up to 27.3$\times$ speedup over commonly used computing devices, with around 2 to 4$\times$ power reduction and acceptable hardware overhead.</description>

      <title>Barrier Certificates for Unknown Systems with Latent States and Polynomial Dynamics using Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying safety in dynamical systems is crucial, but barrier certificates - widely used to verify that system trajectories remain within a safe region - typically require explicit system models. When dynamics are unknown, data-driven methods can be used instead, yet obtaining a valid certificate requires rigorous uncertainty quantification. For this purpose, existing methods usually rely on full-state measurements, limiting their applicability. This paper proposes a novel approach for synthesizing barrier certificates for unknown systems with latent states and polynomial dynamics. A Bayesian framework is employed, where a prior in state-space representation is updated using input-output data via a targeted marginal Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The resulting samples are used to construct a candidate barrier certificate through a sum-of-squares program. It is shown that if the candidate satisfies the required conditions on a test set of additional samples, it is also valid for the true, unknown system with high probability. The approach and its probabilistic guarantees are illustrated through a numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Non-collocated vibration absorption using delayed resonator for spectral and spacial tuning -- analysis and experimental validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-collocated vibration absorption (NCVA) concept using delayed resonator for in-situ tuning is analyzed and experimentally validated. There are two critical contributions of this work. One is on the scalable analytical pathway for verifying the concept of resonant substructure as the basis of the ideal vibration absorption. The second is to experimentally validate the spatial and spectral tunability of NCVA structures for the first time. For both novelties arbitrarily large dimensions of interconnected mass-spring-damper chains are considered. Following the state of the art on NCVA, control synthesis is performed over the resonant substructure comprising the delayed resonator and a part of the primary structure involved in the vibration absorption. The experimental validation of the proposed NCVA concept is performed on a mechatronic setup with three interconnected cart-bodies. Based on the spectral analysis, an excitation frequency is selected for which a stable vibration suppression can be achieved sequentially for all the three bodies, one collocated and two non-collocated. The experimental results closely match the simulations for complete vibration suppression at the targeted bodies, and thus validating the crucial spatial tunability characteristic as well as the traditional spectral tuning.</description>

      <title>Tunable Thresholds and Frequency Encoding in a Spiking NOD Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (S-NOD) is an excitable decision-making model inspired by the spiking dynamics of neurons. S-NOD enables the design of agile decision-making that can rapidly switch between decision options in response to a changing environment. In S-NOD, decisions are represented by continuous time, yet discrete, opinion spikes. Here, we extend previous analysis of S-NOD and explore its potential as a nonlinear controller with a tunable balance between robustness and responsiveness. We identify and provide necessary conditions for the bifurcation that determines the onset of periodic opinion spiking. We leverage this analysis to characterize the tunability of the input-output threshold for opinion spiking as a function of the model basal sensitivity and the modulation of opinion spiking frequency as a function of input magnitude past threshold. We conclude with a discussion on S-NOD as a new neuromorphic control block and its extension to distributed spiking controllers.</description>

      <title>MPCritic: A plug-and-play MPC architecture for reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) communities have developed vast ecosystems of theoretical approaches and computational tools for solving optimal control problems. Given their conceptual similarities but differing strengths, there has been increasing interest in synergizing RL and MPC. However, existing approaches tend to be limited for various reasons, including computational cost of MPC in an RL algorithm and software hurdles towards seamless integration of MPC and RL tools. These challenges often result in the use of "simple" MPC schemes or RL algorithms, neglecting the state-of-the-art in both areas. This paper presents MPCritic, a machine learning-friendly architecture that interfaces seamlessly with MPC tools. MPCritic utilizes the loss landscape defined by a parameterized MPC problem, focusing on "soft" optimization over batched training steps; thereby updating the MPC parameters while avoiding costly minimization and parametric sensitivities. Since the MPC structure is preserved during training, an MPC agent can be readily used for online deployment, where robust constraint satisfaction is paramount. We demonstrate the versatility of MPCritic, in terms of MPC architectures and RL algorithms that it can accommodate, on classic control benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Extended Hybrid Zero Dynamics for Bipedal Walking of the Knee-less Robot SLIDER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knee-less bipedal robots like SLIDER have the advantage of ultra-lightweight legs and improved walking energy efficiency compared to traditional humanoid robots. In this paper, we firstly introduce an improved hardware design of the bipedal robot SLIDER with new line-feet and more optimized mass distribution which enables higher locomotion speeds. Secondly, we propose an extended Hybrid Zero Dynamics (eHZD) method, which can be applied to prismatic joint robots like SLIDER. The eHZD method is then used to generate a library of gaits with varying reference velocities in an offline way. Thirdly, a Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed to use the pre-generated library to create walking control policies in real-time. This approach allows us to combine the advantages of both HZD (for generating stable gaits with a full-dynamics model) and DRL (for real-time adaptive gait generation). The experimental results show that this approach achieves 150% higher walking velocity than the previous MPC-based approach.</description>

      <title>Value Iteration for Learning Concurrently Executable Robotic Control Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many modern robotic systems such as multi-robot systems and manipulators exhibit redundancy, a property owing to which they are capable of executing multiple tasks. This work proposes a novel method, based on the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm, to train redundant robots to be able to execute multiple tasks concurrently. Our approach differs from typical multi-objective RL methods insofar as the learned tasks can be combined and executed in possibly time-varying prioritized stacks. We do so by first defining a notion of task independence between learned value functions. We then use our definition of task independence to propose a cost functional that encourages a policy, based on an approximated value function, to accomplish its control objective while minimally interfering with the execution of higher priority tasks. This allows us to train a set of control policies that can be executed simultaneously. We also introduce a version of fitted value iteration to learn to approximate our proposed cost functional efficiently. We demonstrate our approach on several scenarios and robotic systems.</description>

      <title>How to Maximize Efficiency in Systems with Exhausted Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of assigning tasks efficiently to a set of workers that can exhaust themselves as a result of processing tasks. If a worker is exhausted, it will take a longer time to recover. To model efficiency of workers with exhaustion, we use a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). By taking samples from the internal states of the workers, the source assigns tasks to the workers when they are found to be in their efficient states. We consider two different settings where (i) the source can assign tasks to the workers only when they are in their most efficient state, and (ii) it can assign tasks to workers when they are also moderately efficient in spite of a potentially reduced success probability. In the former case, we find the optimal policy to be a threshold-based sampling policy where the thresholds depend on the workers' recovery and exhaustion rates. In the latter case, we solve a non-convex sum-of-ratios problem using a branch-and-bound approach which performs well compared with the globally optimal solution.</description>

      <title>R2DN: Scalable Parameterization of Contracting and Lipschitz Recurrent Deep Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Robust Recurrent Deep Network (R2DN), a scalable parameterization of robust recurrent neural networks for machine learning and data-driven control. We construct R2DNs as a feedback interconnection of a linear time-invariant system and a 1-Lipschitz deep feedforward network, and directly parameterize the weights so that our models are stable (contracting) and robust to small input perturbations (Lipschitz) by design. Our parameterization uses a structure similar to the previously-proposed recurrent equilibrium networks (RENs), but without the requirement to iteratively solve an equilibrium layer at each time-step. This speeds up model evaluation and backpropagation on GPUs, and makes it computationally feasible to scale up the network size, batch size, and input sequence length in comparison to RENs. We compare R2DNs to RENs on three representative problems in nonlinear system identification, observer design, and learning-based feedback control and find that training and inference are both up to an order of magnitude faster with similar test set performance, and that training/inference times scale more favorably with respect to model expressivity.</description>

      <title>The Social Life of Industrial Arms: How Arousal and Attention Shape Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores how human perceptions of a non-anthropomorphic robotic manipulator are shaped by two key dimensions of behaviour: arousal, defined as the robot's movement energy and expressiveness, and attention, defined as the robot's capacity to selectively orient toward and engage with a user. We introduce a novel control architecture that integrates a gaze-like attention engine with an arousal-modulated motion system to generate socially meaningful behaviours. In a user study, we find that robots exhibiting high attention -- actively directing their focus toward users -- are perceived as warmer and more competent, intentional, and lifelike. In contrast, high arousal -- characterized by fast, expansive, and energetic motions -- increases perceptions of discomfort and disturbance. Importantly, a combination of focused attention and moderate arousal yields the highest ratings of trust and sociability, while excessive arousal diminishes social engagement. These findings offer design insights for endowing non-humanoid robots with expressive, intuitive behaviours that support more natural human-robot interaction.</description>

      <title>A Retina-Inspired Pathway to Real-Time Motion Prediction inside Image Sensors for Extreme-Edge Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to predict motion in real time is fundamental to many maneuvering activities in animals, particularly those critical for survival, such as attack and escape responses. Given its significance, it is no surprise that motion prediction in animals begins in the retina. Similarly, autonomous systems utilizing computer vision could greatly benefit from the capability to predict motion in real time. Therefore, for computer vision applications, motion prediction should be integrated directly at the camera pixel level. Towards that end, we present a retina-inspired neuromorphic framework capable of performing real-time, energy-efficient MP directly within camera pixels. Our hardware-algorithm framework, implemented using GlobalFoundries 22nm FDSOI technology, integrates key retinal MP compute blocks, including a biphasic filter, spike adder, nonlinear circuit, and a 2D array for multi-directional motion prediction. Additionally, integrating the sensor and MP compute die using a 3D Cu-Cu hybrid bonding approach improves design compactness by minimizing area usage and simplifying routing complexity. Validated on real-world object stimuli, the model delivers efficient, low-latency MP for decision-making scenarios reliant on predictive visual computation, while consuming only 18.56 pJ/MP in our mixed-signal hardware implementation.</description>

      <title>Dual first-order methods for efficient computation of convex hull prices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convex Hull (CH) pricing, used in US electricity markets and raising interest in Europe, is a pricing rule designed to handle markets with non-convexities such as startup costs and minimum up and down times. In such markets, the market operator makes side payments to generators to cover lost opportunity costs, and CH prices minimize the total "lost opportunity costs", which include both actual losses and missed profit opportunities. These prices can also be obtained by solving a (partial) Lagrangian dual of the original mixed-integer program, where power balance constraints are dualized. Computing CH prices then amounts to minimizing a sum of nonsmooth convex objective functions, where each term depends only on a single generator. The subgradient of each of those terms can be obtained independently by solving smaller mixed-integer programs. In this work, we benchmark a large panel of first-order methods to solve the above dual CH pricing problem. We test several dual methods, most of which not previously considered for CH pricing, namely a proximal variant of the bundle level method, subgradient methods with three different stepsize strategies, two recent parameter-free methods and an accelerated gradient method combined with smoothing. We compare those methods on two representative sets of real-world large-scale instances and complement the comparison with a (Dantzig-Wolfe) primal column generation method shown to be efficient at computing CH prices, for reference. Our numerical experiments show that the bundle proximal level method and two variants of the subgradient method perform the best among all dual methods and compare favorably with the Dantzig-Wolfe primal method.</description>

      <title>Virtual Target Trajectory Prediction for Stochastic Targets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction of other vehicles is crucial for autonomous vehicles, with applications from missile guidance to UAV collision avoidance. Typically, target trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles exhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in thermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised Machine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of targets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts the distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and parameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using a time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed virtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only training data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in replacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path planning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for aerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic predictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</description>

Abstract: We develop a novel source coding strategy for sampling and monitoring of a Wiener process. For the encoding process, we employ a four level ``quantization'' scheme, which employs monotone function thresholds as opposed to fixed constant thresholds. Leveraging the hitting times of the Wiener process with these thresholds, we devise a sampling and encoding strategy which does not incur any quantization errors. We give analytical expressions for the mean squared error (MSE) and find the optimal source code lengths to minimize the MSE under this monotone function threshold scheme, subject to a sampling rate constraint.</description>

      <title>Fast-Converged Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Dispatch of Large-Scale Power Systems under Transient Security Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08320v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power system optimal dispatch with transient security constraints is commonly represented as Transient Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (TSC-OPF). Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based TSC-OPF trains efficient decision-making agents that are adaptable to various scenarios and provide solution results quickly. However, due to the high dimensionality of the state space and action spaces, as well as the non-smoothness of dynamic constraints, existing DRL-based TSC-OPF solution methods face a significant challenge of the sparse reward problem. To address this issue, a fast-converged DRL method for TSC-OPF is proposed in this paper. The Markov Decision Process (MDP) modeling of TSC-OPF is improved by reducing the observation space and smoothing the reward design, thus facilitating agent training. An improved Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm with Curriculum learning, Parallel exploration, and Ensemble decision-making (DDPG-CPEn) is introduced to drastically enhance the efficiency of agent training and the accuracy of decision-making. The effectiveness, efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated through experiments in the IEEE 39-bus system and a practical 710-bus regional power grid. The source code of the proposed method is made public on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Distribution System Reconfiguration to Mitigate Load Altering Attacks via Stackelberg Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07065v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of IoT-controllable devices in power systems (such as smart electric vehicle charging stations, heat pumps, etc.), despite their benefits, raises novel cybersecurity concerns. Vulnerabilities in these devices can be leveraged to launch load-altering attacks (LAAs) that can potentially compromise the safety of power systems. In this paper, we analyze the impact of LAAs on the voltage profile of distribution networks (DNs). We first derive closed-form expressions to quantify the attacks' impact. Using the insights derived from this analysis, we then propose a reactive defense method to mitigate LAAs based on reconfiguring the DNs. We also study optimal defense strategies that are robust to LAAs by exploiting non-cooperative sequential game theory. The proposed solution takes into account the potential uncertainties in the attack localization. Furthermore, we propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach to compute the equilibrium of the game, which reduces the computational burden. Our results show that attacks launched on the deepest nodes in the DN have the most detrimental effect on the grid voltage profile. Furthermore, the proposed game-theoretic strategy successfully mitigates the effect of the attack while ensuring minimum system reconfiguration.</description>

      <title>Incremental Composition of Learned Control Barrier Functions in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of safely exploring a static and unknown environment while learning valid control barrier functions (CBFs) from sensor data. Existing works either assume known environments, target specific dynamics models, or use a-priori valid CBFs, and are thus limited in their safety guarantees for general systems during exploration. We present a method for safely exploring the unknown environment by incrementally composing a global CBF from locally-learned CBFs. The challenge here is that local CBFs may not have well-defined end behavior outside their training domain, i.e. local CBFs may be positive (indicating safety) in regions where no training data is available. We show that well-defined end behavior can be obtained when local CBFs are parameterized by compactly-supported radial basis functions. For learning local CBFs, we collect sensor data, e.g. LiDAR capturing obstacles in the environment, and augment it with simulated data from a safe oracle controller. Our work complements recent efforts to learn CBFs from safe demonstrations -- where learned safe sets are limited to their training domains -- by demonstrating how to grow the safe set over time as more data becomes available. We evaluate our approach on two simulated systems, where our method successfully explores an unknown environment while maintaining safety throughout the entire execution.</description>

      <title>Universal Global State Estimation for Inertial Navigation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of accurate pose estimation (position, velocity, and orientation) for a rigid body. By utilizing generic exteroceptive measurements in combination with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), we reformulate the vehicle's dynamics and outputs to fit within a linear time-varying (LTV) framework. This transformation enables the application of a linear continuous-time Kalman filter, thereby avoiding the complexities of nonlinear estimators and local Kalman-type filtering methods (e.g., EKF). We perform a complete uniform observability analysis for key benchmark problems (e.g., GPS-INS and Landmark-INS) and derive sufficient conditions for ensuring global uniform exponential stability. Simulations are conducted for two practical applications: stereo-aided inertial navigation systems (INS) with both constant and time-varying gains, as well as GPS-aided INS. The proposed approach notably simplifies observer design for INS.</description>

      <title>A New Type of Nonlinear Disturbance Rejection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymptotic disturbance rejection (equivalently tracking) for nonlinear systems has been studied only in qualitative terms (the state is asymptotically stable under bounded disturbances). We show how to prove quantitative performance guarantees for the nonlinear servomechanism problem. Our technique originates by applying a gain inequalities point of view to an ad fontes reexamination of the linear problem: what is the nonlinear equivalent of a sensitivity transfer function with a zero at the origin? We answer: a nonlinear input-output system is high-pass if its output is stable with respect to the \emph{derivative} of the input. We first show that definition generalizes high-pass resistor-capacitor circuit analysis to accommodate nonlinear resistors. We then show that this definition generalizes the steady-state disturbance rejection property of integral feedback controllers for linear systems. The theoretical payoff is that low-frequency disturbance rejection is captured by a quantitative, non-asymptotic output cost bound. Finally, we raise theoretical questions about compositionality of nonlinear operators.</description>

      <title>Learning Koopman-based Stability Certificates for Unknown Nonlinear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory has gained significant attention in recent years for identifying discrete-time nonlinear systems by embedding them into an infinite-dimensional linear vector space. However, providing stability guarantees while learning the continuous-time dynamics, especially under conditions of relatively low observation frequency, remains a challenge within the existing Koopman-based learning frameworks. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithmic framework to simultaneously learn the vector field and Lyapunov functions for unknown nonlinear systems, using a limited amount of data sampled across the state space and along the trajectories at a relatively low sampling frequency. The proposed framework builds upon recently developed high-accuracy Koopman generator learning for capturing transient system transitions and physics-informed neural networks for training Lyapunov functions. We show that the learned Lyapunov functions can be formally verified using a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver and provide less conservative estimates of the region of attraction compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Volumetric Approach to Privacy of Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information-theoretic metrics, such as mutual information, have been widely used to evaluate privacy leakage in dynamic systems. However, these approaches are typically limited to stochastic systems and face computational challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel volumetric framework for analyzing privacy in systems affected by unknown but bounded noise. Our model considers a dynamic system comprising public and private states, where an observation set of the public state is released. An adversary utilizes the observed public state to infer an uncertainty set of the private state, referred to as the inference attack. We define the evolution dynamics of these inference attacks and quantify the privacy level of the private state using the volume of its uncertainty sets. We then develop an approximate computation method leveraging interval analysis to compute the private state set. We investigate the properties of the proposed volumetric privacy measure and demonstrate that it is bounded by the information gain derived from the observation set. Furthermore, we propose an optimization approach to designing privacy filter using randomization and linear programming based on the proposed privacy measure. The effectiveness of the optimal privacy filter design is evaluated through a production-inventory case study, illustrating its robustness against inference attacks and its superiority compared to a truncated Gaussian mechanism.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Safe and Smooth Control in Safety-Critical Systems via Filtered Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In safety-critical control systems, ensuring both system safety and smooth control input is essential for theoretical guarantees and practical deployment. Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) frameworks, especially High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), effectively enforce safety constraints but often lead to nonsmooth or discontinuous control inputs that can degrade system performance or violate actuator limitations. This paper introduces Filtered Control Barrier Functions (FCBFs), which extend HOCBFs by incorporating an auxiliary dynamic system - referred to as input regularization filter - to produce Lipschitz continuous control inputs. The proposed framework ensures safety, control bounds, and smoothness simultaneously by integrating FCBFs and HOCBFs within a unified quadratic program (QP). Theoretical guarantees are provided and simulations on a unicycle model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to standard and smoothness-penalized HOCBF approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formal safety guarantees on the synthesis of controllers for stochastic systems can be obtained using correct-by-design approaches. These approaches often use abstractions as finite-state Markov Decision Processes. As the state space of these MDPs grows, the curse of dimensionality makes the computational and memory cost of the probabilistic guarantees, quantified with dynamic programming, scale exponentially. In this work, we leverage decoupled dynamics and unravel, via dynamic programming operations, a tree structure in the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) of the value functions.
  For discrete-time stochastic systems with syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic (scLTL) specifications, we provide provable probabilistic safety guarantees and significantly alleviate the computational burden. We provide an initial validation of the theoretical results on several typical case studies and showcase that the uncovered tree structure enables efficient reductions in the computational burden.</description>

Abstract: Grid-Forming (GFM) technology is considered a promising solution to build power electronics-dominated power systems. However, the impact of GFM converters on the system stability is still unquantified, creating a gap between the system- and device-level perspectives. To fill this gap, at the device-level, we propose a Forming Index to quantify a converter's response to grid voltage variations, providing a characterization of its GFM behavior. At the system-level, a quantitative notion of System Strength is introduced to capture the fundamental requirements for power system formation. Finally, we establish the alignment between device- and system-level metrics by demonstrating that GFM converters provably enhance system strength.</description>

      <title>Equitably allocating wildfire resilience investments for power grids: The curse of aggregation and vulnerability indices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11520v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social vulnerability indices have increased traction for guiding infrastructure investment decisions to prioritize communities that need these investments most. One such plan is the Biden-Harris Justice40 initiative, which aims to guide equitable infrastructure investments by ensuring that disadvantaged communities defined by the Climate &amp; Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) receive 40% of the total benefit realized by the investment. However, there is limited research on the practicality of applying vulnerability indices like the CEJST to real-world decision-making for policy outcomes. In this paper, we study this gap by examining the effectiveness of vulnerability indices in a case study focused on power shutoff and undergrounding decisions in wildfire-prone regions. Using a mixed-integer program and a high-fidelity synthetic transmission network in Texas, we model resource allocation policies inspired by Justice40 and evaluate their impact on reducing power outages and mitigating wildfire risk for vulnerable groups. Our analysis reveals that the Justice40 framework may fail to protect certain communities facing high wildfire risk. In our case study, we show that indigenous groups are particularly impacted. We posit that this outcome is likely due to information losses from data aggregation and the use of generalized vulnerability indices. Through the use of explicit group-level protections, we are able to bound the best possible outcome for population groups that are proportionally most affected.</description>

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a form of machine learning that utilizes nonlinear dynamical systems to perform complex tasks in a cost-effective manner when compared to typical neural networks. Many recent advancements in reservoir computing, in particular quantum reservoir computing, make use of reservoirs that are inherently stochastic. However, the theoretical justification for using these systems has not yet been well established. In this paper, we investigate the universality of stochastic reservoir computers, in which we use a stochastic system for reservoir computing using the probabilities of each reservoir state as the readout instead of the states themselves. In stochastic reservoir computing, the number of distinct states of the entire reservoir computer can potentially scale exponentially with the size of the reservoir hardware, offering the advantage of compact device size. We prove that classes of stochastic echo state networks, and therefore the class of all stochastic reservoir computers, are universal approximating classes. We also investigate the performance of two practical examples of stochastic reservoir computers in classification and chaotic time series prediction. While shot noise is a limiting factor in the performance of stochastic reservoir computing, we show significantly improved performance compared to a deterministic reservoir computer with similar hardware in cases where the effects of noise are small.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Enabled 6G Communication: A Task-oriented and Privacy-preserving Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication (ToSC) emerges as an innovative approach in the 6G landscape, characterized by the transmission of only vital information that is directly pertinent to a specific task. While ToSC offers an efficient mode of communication, it concurrently raises concerns regarding privacy, as sophisticated adversaries might possess the capability to reconstruct the original data from the transmitted features. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of privacy-preserving strategies specifically designed for ToSC relying on deep neural network-based joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC). Our study encompasses a detailed comparative assessment of trustworthy feature perturbation methods such as differential privacy (DP) and encryption, alongside intrinsic security incorporation approaches like adversarial learning to train the JSCC and learning-based vector quantization (LBVQ). Our comparative analysis underscores the integration of advanced explainable learning algorithms into communication systems, positing a new benchmark for privacy standards in the forthcoming 6G era.</description>

Abstract: Decentralized Metaverses, built on Web 3.0 and Web 4.0 technologies, have attracted significant attention across various fields. This innovation leverages blockchain, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Extended Reality (XR) and advanced technologies to create immersive and interconnected digital environments that mirror the real world. This article delves into the Metaverse of Everything (MoE), a platform that fuses the Metaverse concept with the Internet of Everything (IoE), an advanced version of the Internet of Things (IoT) that connects not only physical devices but also people, data and processes within a networked environment. Thus, the MoE integrates generated data and virtual entities, creating an extensive network of interconnected components. This article seeks to advance current MoE, examining decentralization and the application of Opportunistic Edge Computing (OEC) for interactions with surrounding IoT devices and IoE entities. Moreover, it outlines the main challenges to guide researchers and businesses towards building a future cyber-resilient opportunistic MoE.</description>

      <title>TeraSim: Uncovering Unknown Unsafe Events for Autonomous Vehicles through Generative Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03629v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traffic simulation is essential for autonomous vehicle (AV) development, enabling comprehensive safety evaluation across diverse driving conditions. However, traditional rule-based simulators struggle to capture complex human interactions, while data-driven approaches often fail to maintain long-term behavioral realism or generate diverse safety-critical events. To address these challenges, we propose TeraSim, an open-source, high-fidelity traffic simulation platform designed to uncover unknown unsafe events and efficiently estimate AV statistical performance metrics, such as crash rates. TeraSim is designed for seamless integration with third-party physics simulators and standalone AV stacks, to construct a complete AV simulation system. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating diverse safety-critical events involving both static and dynamic agents, identifying hidden deficiencies in AV systems, and enabling statistical performance evaluation. These findings highlight TeraSim's potential as a practical tool for AV safety assessment, benefiting researchers, developers, and policymakers. The code is available at https://github.com/mcity/TeraSim.</description>

      <title>Bridging conformal prediction and scenario optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction and scenario optimization constitute two important classes of statistical learning frameworks to certify decisions made using data. They have found numerous applications in control theory, machine learning and robotics. Despite intense research in both areas, and apparently similar results, a clear connection between these two frameworks has not been established. By focusing on the so-called vanilla conformal prediction, we show rigorously how to choose appropriate score functions and set predictor map to recover well-known bounds on the probability of constraint violation associated with scenario programs. We also show how to treat ranking of nonconformity scores as a one-dimensional scenario program with discarded constraints, and use such connection to recover vanilla conformal prediction guarantees on the validity of the set predictor. We also capitalize on the main developments of the scenario approach, and show how we could analyze calibration conditional conformal prediction under this lens. Our results establish a theoretical bridge between conformal prediction and scenario optimization.</description>
