      <title>How does the national new area impact the local economy? -- An empirical analysis from Zhoushan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To empirically study the policy impact of a National New Area on the local economy, this paper evaluates the effect of the Zhoushan Archipelago New Area on local GDP growth rate and economic efficiency. By collecting input and output data from 20 prefectural-level cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces from 1995 to 2015, we estimate the economic efficiency of these cities using data envelopment analysis. Subsequently, we construct counterfactuals for Zhoushan by selecting comparable cities from the dataset, excluding Zhoushan, and applying a panel data approach. The difference between the actual and counterfactual values for GDP growth rate and economic efficiency in Zhoushan is analyzed to determine the treatment effect of the National New Area policy. The research reveals that in the initial four years, the New Area policy enhanced Zhoushan's economic efficiency but negatively affected its GDP growth rate. This influence gradually disappeared after four years. Further analysis suggests that the policy's effect on GDP growth rate varies with the level of economic development in different regions, having a more substantial impact in less developed areas. Therefore, we conclude that establishing a New Area in relatively undeveloped zones is more advantageous.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trade and Industrial Policies in the Global Economy: A Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a deep learning framework, DL-opt, designed to efficiently solve for optimal policies in quantifiable general equilibrium trade models. DL-opt integrates (i) a nested fixed point (NFXP) formulation of the optimization problem, (ii) automatic implicit differentiation to enhance gradient descent for solving unilateral optimal policies, and (iii) a best-response dynamics approach for finding Nash equilibria. Utilizing DL-opt, we solve for non-cooperative tariffs and industrial subsidies across 7 economies and 44 sectors, incorporating sectoral external economies of scale. Our quantitative analysis reveals significant sectoral heterogeneity in Nash policies: Nash industrial subsidies increase with scale elasticities, whereas Nash tariffs decrease with trade elasticities. Moreover, we show that global dual competition, involving both tariffs and industrial subsidies, results in lower tariffs and higher welfare outcomes compared to a global tariff war. These findings highlight the importance of considering sectoral heterogeneity and policy combinations in understanding global economic competition.</description>

      <title>Collective Attention in Human-AI Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How does the presence of an AI assistant affect the collective attention of a team? We study 20 human teams of 3-4 individuals paired with one voice-only AI assistant during a challenging puzzle task. Teams are randomly assigned to an AI assistant with a human- or robotic-sounding voice that provides either helpful or misleading information about the task. Treating each individual AI interjection as a treatment intervention, we identify the causal effects of the AI on dynamic group processes involving language use. Our findings demonstrate that the AI significantly affects what teams discuss, how they discuss it, and the alignment of their mental models. Teams adopt AI-introduced language for both terms directly related to the task and for peripheral terms, even when they (a) recognize the unhelpful nature of the AI, (b) do not consider the AI a genuine team member, and (c) do not trust the AI. The process of language adaptation appears to be automatic, despite doubts about the AI's competence. The presence of an AI assistant significantly impacts team collective attention by modulating various aspects of shared cognition. This study contributes to human-AI teaming research by highlighting collective attention as a central mechanism through which AI systems in team settings influence team performance. Understanding this mechanism will help CSCW researchers design AI systems that enhance team collective intelligence by optimizing collective attention.</description>

      <title>Child Care, Time Allocation, and the Life Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of gender differences in preferences and productivity in home production on the time allocation in married couples, particularly in relation to childcare responsibilities. Using aggregated data from Japan, we estimate a life-cycle model that tracks the development of a child from infancy to adulthood by extending the work of Blundell et al. (2018). Our findings reveal a decrease in maternal earnings following childbirth, aligning with the empirical evidence of the child penalty. However, the model's projections and the actual data diverge significantly during the phase of maternal earnings recovery, showing a discrepancy of approximately 50%, the size of which implies an involuntary reduction in the wife's market work earnings.</description>

      <title>The Use of Symmetry for Models with Variable-size Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08650v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows the universal representations of symmetric functions with multidimensional variable-size variables, which help assessing the justification of approximation methods aggregating the information of each variable by moments. It then discusses how the results give insights into economic applications, including two-step policy function estimation, moment-based Markov equilibrium, and aggregative games.</description>

      <title>Simulation in discrete choice models evaluation: SDCM, a simulation tool for performance evaluation of DCMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) have been widely utilized in various scientific fields, especially economics, for many years. These models consider a stochastic environment influencing each decision maker's choices. Extensive research has shown that the agents' socioeconomic characteristics, the chosen options' properties, and the conditions characterizing the decision-making environment all impact these models. However, the complex interactions between these factors, confidentiality concerns, time constraints, and costs, have made real experimentation impractical and undesirable. To address this, simulations have gained significant popularity among academics, allowing the study of these models in a controlled setting using simulated data. This paper presents multidisciplinary research to bridge the gap between DCMs, experimental design, and simulation. By reviewing related literature, the authors explore these interconnected areas. We then introduce a simulation method integrated with experimental design to generate synthetic data based on behavioral models of agents. A utility function is used to describe the developed simulation tool. The paper investigates the discrepancy between simulated data and real-world data.</description>
