      <title>SoK: Stablecoins in Retail Payments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stablecoins have emerged as a rapidly growing digital payment instrument, raising the question of whether blockchain-based settlement can function as a substitute for incumbent card networks in retail payments. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) provides a systematic comparison between stablecoin payment arrangements and card networks by situating both within a unified analytical framework. We first map their respective payment infrastructures, participant roles, and transaction lifecycles, highlighting fundamental differences in how authorization, settlement, and recourse are organized. Building on this mapping, we introduce the CLEAR framework, which evaluates retail payment systems across five dimensions: cost, legality, experience, architecture, and reach. Our analysis shows that stablecoins deliver efficient, continuous, and programmable settlement, often compressing rail-level merchant fees and enabling 24/7 value transfer. However, these advantages are accompanied by an inversion of the traditional pricing and risk-allocation structure. Card networks internalize consumer-side frictions through subsidies, standardized liability rules, and post-transaction recourse, thereby supporting mass-market adoption. Stablecoin arrangements, by contrast, externalize transaction fees, error prevention, and dispute resolution to users, intermediaries, and courts, resulting in weaker consumer protection, higher cognitive burden at the point of interaction, and fragmented acceptance. Accordingly, stablecoins exhibit a conditional comparative advantage in closed-loop environments, cross-border corridors, and high-friction payment contexts, but remain structurally disadvantaged as open-loop retail payment instruments.</description>

      <title>General Equilibrium Amplification and Crisis Vulnerability: Cross-Crisis Evidence from Global Banks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a continuous framework for analyzing financial contagion that incorporates both geographic proximity and interbank network linkages. The framework characterizes stress propagation through a master equation whose solution admits a Feynman-Kac representation as expected cumulative stress along stochastic paths through spatial-network space. From this representation, I derive the General Equilibrium Amplification Factor -- a structural measure of systemic importance that captures the ratio of total system-wide effects to direct effects following a localized shock. The amplification factor decomposes naturally into spatial, network, and interaction components, revealing which transmission channels contribute most to each institution's systemic importance. The framework nests discrete cascade models as a limiting case when jump intensity becomes infinite above default thresholds, clarifying that continuous and discrete approaches describe different regimes of the same phenomenon. Empirical validation using 38 global banks across the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that the amplification factor correctly identifies systemically important institutions (Pearson correlation $\rho = -0.450$, $p = 0.080$ between amplification factor and crisis drawdowns) and predicts crisis outcomes out-of-sample ($\rho = -0.352$ for COVID-19). Robustness analysis using cumulative abnormal returns -- a measure more directly connected to the Feynman-Kac integral -- strengthens these findings ($\rho = -0.512$, $p = 0.042$). Time-series analysis confirms that average pairwise bank correlations track macroeconomic stress indicators ($\rho = 0.265$ with VIX, $p &lt; 0.001$). Comparing the two crises reveals that COVID-19 produced a sharper correlation spike (+93%) despite smaller equity losses, reflecting different contagion dynamics for exogenous versus endogenous shocks.</description>
