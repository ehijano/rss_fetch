      <title>On possibility of $\pi^0$ condensation and magnetization in freely interpenetrating nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditions are found, at which in the nuclear matter there may appear a spatially nonuniform $p$ wave $\pi^0$ condensate supplemented by a spatially varying spontaneous magnetization. The pion-nucleon interaction and the anomaly contributions to the magnetization are taken into account. Response of the system on the external magnetic field is also considered. Then the model of nonoverlapped nucleon Fermi spheres is employed. Arguments are given in favor of the possibility of the occurrence of the $\pi^0$-condensation and a spatially varying magnetization as well as effects of pronounced anisotropic pion fluctuations at finite pion momentum in peripheral heavy-ion collisions. Relevant effects such as response on the rotation, charged pion condensation and other are discussed.</description>

      <title>Interacting mesons as degrees of freedom in a chiral model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equation of state of hot and dense hadronic matter using an extended Chiral Mean Field (CMF) model framework where the addition is the inclusion of interactions of thermally excited mesons. This is implemented by calculating the in-medium masses of pseudoscalar and vector mesons, obtained through the explicit chiral symmetry-breaking and vector interaction terms in the Lagrangian, respectively, prior to applying the mean-field approximation. As a result, the in-medium meson contributions generate a feedback term to the CMF's equations of motion, which then modifies the equation of state. With this improvement, we quantify the effect on the equation of state of strongly interacting matter through comparisons with state-of-the-art lattice QCD results and other hadronic models like the Hadron Resonance Gas model. We find that the results of the updated hadronic CMF model with an improved meson description (mCMF) provide a better agreement with lattice-QCD data for thermodynamic state variables across a wide range of temperatures and baryon chemical potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploration of the QCD phase diagram is pivotal in particle and nuclear physics. We construct a full four-dimensional equation of state of QCD with net baryon, electric charge, and strangeness by extending the NEOS model beyond the conventional two-dimensional approximation. Lattice QCD calculations based on the Taylor expansion method and the hadron resonance gas model are considered for the construction. We also develop an efficient numerical method for applying the four-dimensional equation of state to relativistic hydrodynamic simulations, which can be used for the analysis of nuclear collisions at beam energy scan energies and for different nuclear species at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Dissipative currents and transport coefficients in relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the form of dissipative currents at the first order in relativistic spin hydrodynamics with finite chemical potential including gradients of the spin potential. Taking advantage of isotropy in the hydrodynamic local rest frame, using a suitable matching condition for the flow velocity and enforcing the semi-positivity of entropy production, we find 23 dissipative transport coefficients relating dissipative currents to gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields: 4 for the symmetric part of the energy-momentum tensor, 5 for the antisymmetric part, 3 for the conserved vector current, and 11 for the spin tensor. We compare our finding with previous results in literature.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Navier-Stokes description of the quark-gluon plasma radial flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relativistic viscous hydrodynamic description of the quark-gluon plasma by M\"uller-Israel-Stewart formulations has been very successful, but despite this success, these theories present limitations regarding well-posedness and causality. In recent years, a well-behaved version of the relativistic Navier-Stokes equations has been formulated, appearing as a promising alternative in which those limitations are absent. Using this novel theory, we perform numerical simulations of a quark-gluon plasma fluid that we use to describe experimental data on the transverse momentum distribution of hadrons from central Pb-Pb collisions measured at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magic in Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum computing, non-stabilizerness -- the magic -- refers to the computational advantage of certain quantum states over classical computers and is an essential ingredient for universal quantum computation. Employing the second order stabilizer R\'enyi entropy to quantify magic, we study the production of magic states in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) via 2-to-2 scattering processes involving electrons and muons. Considering all 60 stabilizer initial states, which have zero magic, the angular dependence of magic produced in the final states is governed by only a few patterns, both in the non-relativistic and the ultra-relativistic limits. Some processes, such as the low-energy $e^-\mu^-\to e^-\mu^-$ and Bhabha scattering $e^-e^+\to e^-e^+$, do not generate magic at all. In most cases the largest magic generated is significantly less than the maximal possible value of $\log (16/7) \approx 0.827$. The only instance where QED is able to generate maximal magic is the low-energy $\mu^-\mu^+\to e^-e^+$, in the limit $m_e/m_\mu \to 0$, which is well approximated in nature. Our results suggest QED, although capable of producing maximally entangled states easily, may not be an efficient mechanism for generating quantum advantages.</description>

      <title>Holographic derivation of effective action for a dissipative neutral fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a holographic prescription for the Schwinger-Keldysh closed time path, we derive the effective action for a dissipative neutral fluid holographically described by the Einstein gravity in an asymptotic AdS spacetime. In the saddle point approximation for the dual gravity, the goal is achieved by solving the double Dirichlet problem for the linearized gravitational field living in a complexified static AdS black brane background. We adopt a partially on-shell scheme for solving the bulk dynamics, which is equivalent to ``integrating out'' the gapped modes in the boundary field theory. The boundary effective action in the fluid spacetime, identified as the partially on-shell bulk action, is computed to first order in boundary derivative and to cubic order in AdS boundary data. The boundary effective action, rewritten in the physical spacetime, successfully reproduces various results known in the framework of classical hydrodynamics, confirming our holographic derivation.</description>

Abstract: Within the recently developed five-dimensional Langevin approach for the description of fission of heavy nuclei, we have calculated the fission fragments mass and kinetic energy distributions for the fission of $^{180}$Hg and $^{190}$Hg formed in the reactions $^{36}$Ar +$^{144}$Sm $\Rightarrow$ $^{180}$Hg and $^{36}$Ar +$^{154}$Sm $\Rightarrow$ $^{190}$Hg at few excitation energies and found very good agreement between the calculated and experimental results. Special attention was paid to the accurate description of the dependence of shell effects on the excitation energy. It was shown that the effect of multi-chance fission on the mass distribution is noticeable only at small excitation energies. The kinetic energy distributions are more sensitive to pre-scission neutron emission.</description>

      <title>Observing short-range correlations in nuclei through $\rho^0$ photo-production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-range correlations (SRCs) are a universal feature of nuclear structure. A wide range of measurements, primarily using electron scattering, have revealed SRC properties, such as their abundance in different nuclei, as well as the strong preference for proton-neutron pairing over proton-proton or neutron-neutron pairing. Despite the inherent complexity of many-body systems, a number of the salient features of electron scattering measurements are described by a simple, factorized theory called Generalized Contact Formalism. A key element of this theory, the factorization of the interaction with a hard probe, has yet to be tested. An experiment conducted at Jefferson Lab in 2021 collected data from scattering a tagged photon beam, with an energy up to 10 GeV, from several nuclear targets, measuring final state particles in the large-acceptance GlueX spectrometer. In this paper, we propose a test of probe factorization by measuring cross section ratios sensitive to proton-proton pair prevalence and relative SRC abundances in $^4$He and $^{12}$C. We present GCF predictions of the observables and make projections of the expected precision the experiment can achieve.</description>

      <title>Hybrid stars with large quark cores within the parity doublet model and modified NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the parity doublet model (PDM) for hadronic matter and a modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model for quark matter, we investigate the potential existence of two- and three-flavor quark matter in neutron star cores. Both models respect chiral symmetry, and a sharp first-order phase transition is implemented via Maxwell construction. We find stable neutron stars with quark cores within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. Typical neutron stars with masses around $1.4 \ M_\odot$ may possess deconfined quark matter in their centers. The hybrid star scenario with a two-flavor quark core offers enough parameter space to allow the neutron stars with large quark cores exceeding $\sim 1\ M_\odot$, and allow the early deconfinement position before $2\ \rho_0$, where $\rho_0$ is the nuclear saturation density. The observations of gravitational wave event GW170817 suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600\ \rm MeV$ in the PDM for scenarios involving three-flavor quark matter cores. The maximum mass of the hybrid star with a quark core is found to be approximately $2.2\ M_\odot$ for both two- or three-flavor quark matter in their centers.</description>

      <title>Impact of bulk viscosity on the post-merger gravitational-wave signal from merging neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the violent post-merger of binary neutron-star mergers strong oscillations are present that impact the emitted gravitational-wave (GW) signal. The frequencies, temperatures and densities involved in these oscillations allow for violations of the chemical equilibrium promoted by weak-interactions, thus leading to a nonzero bulk viscosity that can impact dynamics and GW signals. We present the first simulations of binary neutron-star mergers employing the self-consistent and second-order formulation of the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics for dissipative fluids proposed by M\"uller, Israel and Stewart. With the spirit of obtaining a first assessment of the impact of bulk viscosity on the structure and radiative efficiency of the merger remnant we adopt a simplified but realistic approach for the viscosity, which we assume to be determined by direct and modified Urca reactions and hence to vary within the stars. At the same time, to compensate for the lack of a precise knowledge about the strength of bulk viscosity, we explore the possible behaviours by considering three different scenarios of low, medium, and high bulk viscosity. In this way, we find that large values of the bulk viscosities damp the collision-and-bounce oscillations that characterize the dynamics of the stellar cores right after the merger. At the same time, large viscosities tend to preserve the $m=2$ deformations in the remnant, thus leading to a comparatively more efficient GW emission and to changes in the post-merger spectrum that can be up to $100\,{\rm Hz}$ in the case of the most extreme configurations. Overall, our self-consistent results indicate that bulk viscosity increases the energy radiated in GWs soon after the merger by $\lesssim 2\%$ in the (realistic) scenario of small viscosity, and by $\lesssim 30\%$ in the (unrealistic) scenario of large viscosity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early post-merger phase of a binary neutron-star coalescence is shaped by characteristic rotational velocities as well as violent density oscillations and offers the possibility to constrain the properties of neutron star matter by observing the gravitational wave emission. One possibility to do so is the investigation of gravitational wave damping through the bulk viscosity which originates from violations of weak chemical equilibrium. Motivated by these prospects, we present a comprehensive report about the implementation of the self-consistent and second-order formulation of the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics for dissipative fluids proposed by M\"uller, Israel and Stewart. Furthermore, we report on the results of two test problems, namely the viscous damping of linear density oscillations of isolated nonrotating neutron stars and the viscous migration test, both of which confirm our implementation and can be used for future code tests. Finally, we present fully general-relativistic simulations of viscous binary neutron-star mergers. We explore the structural and thermal properties of binary neutron-star mergers with a constant bulk-viscosity prescription and investigate the impact of bulk viscosity on dynamical mass ejection. We find that inverse Reynolds numbers $\sim 1\%$ can be achieved for the highest employed viscosity thereby suppressing the dynamically ejected mass by a factor of $\sim 5$ compared to the inviscid case.</description>

      <title>Phase transition on superfluid vortices in Higgs-Confinement crossover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to distinguish states of matter by identifying spontaneous symmetry breaking on extended objects, such as vortices, even in the absence of a bulk phase transition. As a specific example, we investigate the phase transition on superfluid vortices in the Higgs-confinement crossover using a $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{gauge} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ model. This model exhibits superfluidity of $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ symmetry and allows for a crossover between the Higgs and confinement regimes by varying the gauge coupling constant from weak to strong. We demonstrate that, on vortices, spontaneous breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flavor symmetry occurs in the weak coupling (Higgs) regime, while it does not in the strong coupling (confinement) regime. We also confirm that those regimes are separated by a second-order phase transition through Monte Carlo simulations, whose universality class corresponds to the two-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the chiral phase transition relevant for QCD matter at finite temperature but with vanishing baryon density. Presumably, the chiral phase transition is of second order for two-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. Near the transition temperature, we apply the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and construct a low-energy effective field theory for the system, in which fluctuations and dissipations are systematically captured. The dynamical variables involve the chiral charge densities and order parameter (chiral condensate). Via the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh technique, the effective action is further confirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model. With higher-order terms suitably neglected, the stochastic equations derived from the effective field theory resemble those of model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Within the effective field theory, we briefly discuss the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and Goldstone modes.</description>

Abstract: We investigate nuclear modification and the universality of short-range correlation (SRC) in pion-induced Drell-Yan process. Employing nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) and pion PDFs, the ratio of differential cross sections of different nuclei relative to the free nucleon is presented. A kind of universal modification function was proposed which would provide nontrivial tests of SRC universality on the platform of pion-induced Drell-Yan. This work improves our understanding of nuclear structure and strong interactions.</description>

Abstract: Within a lattice inspired interaction between quark and antiquark, we obtain a hierarchy of solutions to the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for vector quarkonia excited states in the constituent quark mass approximation. As a toy model, we apply the similar to calculate ground and excited states of $\phi$ and $\omega/\rho$ meson. Through detailed numerical searches, our study provides evidence that the single-valued constant mass quark propagator does not yield known meson spectra without the simultaneous presence of abnormal (unphysical) solutions. We classify normal and abnormal solutions and discuss necessary changes in the calculation scheme to avoid the spectrum of inconsistent solutions. While all experimental narrow vector mesons are identified with a normal state of the BSE, the occurrence of mutually cancelled normal-abnormal states are reported. The results are slightly different for the heavy and light mesons, but in both cases they seem to result from the inconsistent use of the hmogeneous BSE to describe broad resonances.</description>
