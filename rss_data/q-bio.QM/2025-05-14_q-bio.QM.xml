      <title>CellVerse: Do Large Language Models Really Understand Cell Biology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of modeling single-cell data as natural languages and the potential of leveraging powerful large language models (LLMs) for understanding cell biology. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' performance on language-driven single-cell analysis tasks still remains unexplored. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce CellVerse, a unified language-centric question-answering benchmark that integrates four types of single-cell multi-omics data and encompasses three hierarchical levels of single-cell analysis tasks: cell type annotation (cell-level), drug response prediction (drug-level), and perturbation analysis (gene-level). Going beyond this, we systematically evaluate the performance across 14 open-source and closed-source LLMs ranging from 160M to 671B on CellVerse. Remarkably, the experimental results reveal: (1) Existing specialist models (C2S-Pythia) fail to make reasonable decisions across all sub-tasks within CellVerse, while generalist models such as Qwen, Llama, GPT, and DeepSeek family models exhibit preliminary understanding capabilities within the realm of cell biology. (2) The performance of current LLMs falls short of expectations and has substantial room for improvement. Notably, in the widely studied drug response prediction task, none of the evaluated LLMs demonstrate significant performance improvement over random guessing. CellVerse offers the first large-scale empirical demonstration that significant challenges still remain in applying LLMs to cell biology. By introducing CellVerse, we lay the foundation for advancing cell biology through natural languages and hope this paradigm could facilitate next-generation single-cell analysis.</description>

      <title>CGM Data Analysis 2.0: Functional Data Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New methods of CGM data analysis are emerging that are valuable for interpreting CGM patterns and underlying metabolic physiology. These new methods use functional data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML). Compared to traditional metrics for evaluating CGM tracing results (CGM Data Analysis 1.0), these new methods, which we refer to as CGM Data Analysis 2.0, can provide a more detailed understanding of glucose fluctuations and trends and enable more personalized and effective diabetes management strategies once translated into practical clinical solutions.</description>

      <title>Preventing SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events with antiviral intranasal sprays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superspreading events are known to disproportionally contribute to onwards transmission of epidemic and pandemic viruses. Preventing infections at a small number of high-transmission settings is therefore an attractive public health goal. Here, we use deterministic and stochastic mathematical modelling to quantify the impact of intranasal sprays in containing outbreaks at a known superspreading event (the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at the Diamond Princess cruise ship) and a conference event that led to extensive transmission.
  We find that in the Diamond Princess cruise ship case study, there exists a 7-14-day window of opportunity for widespread prophylactic spray usage to significantly impact the number of infections averted. Given an immediate response to a known SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, alongside testing and social distancing measures, prophylactic efficacy and coverage greater than 65% could reduce the average number of infections by over 90%. In the conference case study, in the absence of additional public health interventions, analyses suggest much higher prophylactic efficacies and coverages are required to achieve a similar outcome. However, prophylactic use can half an individual's probability of being infected, and significantly reduce the probability of developing a severe infection. These results suggest that at a known potential superspreading event, early use of intranasal sprays can complement quarantining measures and significantly suppress a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, even at suboptimal coverage. At a potential superspreading event of short duration, intranasal sprays can reduce individuals' risk of infection, but cannot prevent all infections or onwards community transmission.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Information Capacity of Canonical Signaling Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a unified framework for computing the information capacity of biological signaling systems using Fisher Information. By deriving closed-form or easily computable information capacity formulas, we quantify how well different signaling models, including binomial, multinomial, Poisson, Gaussian, and Gamma distributions, can discriminate among input signals. These expressions clarify how key features such as signal range, noise scaling, pathway length, and receivers' diversity shape the theoretical limits of sensing. In particular, we show how signal-to-noise ratio and fold-change sensitivity arise naturally within the Fisher formalism, and how signal degradation in cascades imposes linear information loss. Our results provide intuitive, analytically grounded tools to benchmark and guide the analysis of real signaling systems, without requiring computationally expensive mutual information estimation. While motivated by cellular communication, the framework generalizes to any system where noisy input-output relationships constrain transmission fidelity, including synthetic biology, sensor networks, and engineered communication channels.</description>

      <title>Automated Model-Free Sorting of Single-Molecule Fluorescence Events Using a Deep Learning Based Hidden-State Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-molecule fluorescence assays enable high-resolution analysis of biomolecular dynamics, but traditional analysis pipelines are labor-intensive and rely on users' experience, limiting scalability and reproducibility. Recent deep learning models have automated aspects of data processing, yet many still require manual thresholds, complex architectures, or extensive labeled data. Therefore, we present DASH, a fully streamlined architecture for trace classification, state assignment, and automatic sorting that requires no user input. DASH demonstrates robust performance across users and experimental conditions both in equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems such as Cas12a-mediated DNA cleavage. This paper proposes a novel strategy for the automatic and detailed sorting of single-molecule fluorescence events. The dynamic cleavage process of Cas12a is used as an example to provide a comprehensive analysis. This approach is crucial for studying biokinetic structural changes at the single-molecule level.</description>

      <title>TrialMatchAI: An End-to-End AI-powered Clinical Trial Recommendation System to Streamline Patient-to-Trial Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patient recruitment remains a major bottleneck in clinical trials, calling for scalable and automated solutions. We present TrialMatchAI, an AI-powered recommendation system that automates patient-to-trial matching by processing heterogeneous clinical data, including structured records and unstructured physician notes. Built on fine-tuned, open-source large language models (LLMs) within a retrieval-augmented generation framework, TrialMatchAI ensures transparency and reproducibility and maintains a lightweight deployment footprint suitable for clinical environments. The system normalizes biomedical entities, retrieves relevant trials using a hybrid search strategy combining lexical and semantic similarity, re-ranks results, and performs criterion-level eligibility assessments using medical Chain-of-Thought reasoning. This pipeline delivers explainable outputs with traceable decision rationales. In real-world validation, 92 percent of oncology patients had at least one relevant trial retrieved within the top 20 recommendations. Evaluation across synthetic and real clinical datasets confirmed state-of-the-art performance, with expert assessment validating over 90 percent accuracy in criterion-level eligibility classification, particularly excelling in biomarker-driven matches. Designed for modularity and privacy, TrialMatchAI supports Phenopackets-standardized data, enables secure local deployment, and allows seamless replacement of LLM components as more advanced models emerge. By enhancing efficiency and interpretability and offering lightweight, open-source deployment, TrialMatchAI provides a scalable solution for AI-driven clinical trial matching in precision medicine.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Thyroid Cytology Diagnosis with RAG-Optimized LLMs and Pa-thology Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming pathology by integrat-ing large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and domain-specific foundation models. This study explores the application of RAG-enhanced LLMs coupled with pathology foundation models for thyroid cytology diagnosis, addressing challenges in cytological interpretation, standardization, and diagnostic accuracy. By leveraging a curated knowledge base, RAG facilitates dy-namic retrieval of relevant case studies, diagnostic criteria, and expert interpreta-tion, improving the contextual understanding of LLMs. Meanwhile, pathology foun-dation models, trained on high-resolution pathology images, refine feature extrac-tion and classification capabilities. The fusion of these AI-driven approaches en-hances diagnostic consistency, reduces variability, and supports pathologists in dis-tinguishing benign from malignant thyroid lesions. Our results demonstrate that integrating RAG with pathology-specific LLMs significantly improves diagnostic efficiency and interpretability, paving the way for AI-assisted thyroid cytopathology, with foundation model UNI achieving AUC 0.73-0.93 for correct prediction of surgi-cal pathology diagnosis from thyroid cytology samples.</description>

      <title>FLOWR: Flow Matching for Structure-Aware De Novo, Interaction- and Fragment-Based Ligand Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce FLOWR, a novel structure-based framework for the generation and optimization of three-dimensional ligands. FLOWR integrates continuous and categorical flow matching with equivariant optimal transport, enhanced by an efficient protein pocket conditioning. Alongside FLOWR, we present SPINDR, a thoroughly curated dataset comprising ligand-pocket co-crystal complexes specifically designed to address existing data quality issues. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FLOWR surpasses current state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based methods in terms of PoseBusters-validity, pose accuracy, and interaction recovery, while offering a significant inference speedup, achieving up to 70-fold faster performance. In addition, we introduce FLOWR:multi, a highly accurate multi-purpose model allowing for the targeted sampling of novel ligands that adhere to predefined interaction profiles and chemical substructures for fragment-based design without the need of re-training or any re-sampling strategies</description>

      <title>A Classification Benchmark for Artificial Intelligence Detection of Laryngeal Cancer from Patient Voice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cases of laryngeal cancer are predicted to rise significantly in the coming years. Current diagnostic pathways are inefficient, putting undue stress on both patients and the medical system. Artificial intelligence offers a promising solution by enabling non-invasive detection of laryngeal cancer from patient voice, which could help prioritise referrals more effectively. A major barrier in this field is the lack of reproducible methods. Our work addresses this challenge by introducing a benchmark suite comprising 36 models trained and evaluated on open-source datasets. These models classify patients with benign and malignant voice pathologies. All models are accessible in a public repository, providing a foundation for future research. We evaluate three algorithms and three audio feature sets, including both audio-only inputs and multimodal inputs incorporating demographic and symptom data. Our best model achieves a balanced accuracy of 83.7%, sensitivity of 84.0%, specificity of 83.3%, and AUROC of 91.8%.</description>

      <title>Transforming Hyperspectral Images Into Chemical Maps: An End-to-End Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current approaches to chemical map generation from hyperspectral images are based on models such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, generating pixel-wise predictions that do not consider spatial context and suffer from a high degree of noise. This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach using a modified version of U-Net and a custom loss function to directly obtain chemical maps from hyperspectral images, skipping all intermediate steps required for traditional pixel-wise analysis. We compare the U-Net with the traditional PLS regression on a real dataset of pork belly samples with associated mean fat reference values. The U-Net obtains a test set root mean squared error of between 9% and 13% lower than that of PLS regression on the task of mean fat prediction. At the same time, U-Net generates fine detail chemical maps where 99.91% of the variance is spatially correlated. Conversely, only 2.53% of the variance in the PLS-generated chemical maps is spatially correlated, indicating that each pixel-wise prediction is largely independent of neighboring pixels. Additionally, while the PLS-generated chemical maps contain predictions far beyond the physically possible range of 0-100%, U-Net learns to stay inside this range. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that U-Net is superior to PLS for chemical map generation.</description>

      <title>Integrating Single-Cell Foundation Models with Graph Neural Networks for Drug Response Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-driven drug response prediction holds great promise for advancing personalized cancer treatment. However, the inherent heterogenity of cancer and high cost of data generation make accurate prediction challenging. In this study, we investigate whether incorporating the pretrained foundation model scGPT can enhance the performance of existing drug response prediction frameworks. Our approach builds on the DeepCDR framework, which encodes drug representations from graph structures and cell representations from multi-omics profiles. We adapt this framework by leveraging scGPT to generate enriched cell representations using its pretrained knowledge to compensate for limited amount of data. We evaluate our modified framework using IC$_{50}$ values on Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and a leave-one-drug out validation strategy, comparing it against the original DeepCDR framework and a prior scFoundation-based approach. scGPT not only outperforms previous approaches but also exhibits greater training stability, highlighting the value of leveraging scGPT-derived knowledge in this domain.</description>
