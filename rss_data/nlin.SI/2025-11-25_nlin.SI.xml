      <title>Elliptic solutions of the lattice CKP equation and its elliptic direct linearisation scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A direct linearisation scheme, based on an elliptic Cauchy kernel, is set up for the lattice CKP equation. This leads to an elliptic parametrisation of the lattice CKP equation, together with its Lax triplet, which allows us to perform appropriate continuum limits and construct elliptic solutions. By selecting appropriate integration measures and domains for the singular linear integral equation in the scheme, elliptic multi-soliton solutions of the lattice CKP equation are found.</description>

      <title>Higher order Hirota bilinear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study Hirota bilinear forms of the type $P(D) \{f\cdot f\}=0$. We prove that for $P(D)=D_x^mD_y^rD_t^n$ the equations have three-soliton solutions if only if two of nonzero $m,n,p$ are odd and the other one even. We explicitly derive the nonlinear partial differential equations corresponding to this form for $m+n+p=4$ and $m+n+p=6$. We show that the equations for $P(D)=D_x(D_x^3+\alpha_1 D_t+\alpha_2 D_y)^{2k+1}$ possess three-soliton solutions for any constants $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)\neq (0,0)$ and $k\in \mathbb{N}$. We conjecture that these equations have four-soliton solution only for $k=0$. Finally, we consider the equations for $P(D)=D_x^{m_1}D_y^{m_2}D_t^{m_3}D_z^{m_4}$. We prove that these equations have three-soliton solutions if only if one of $m_i=1$, and all the other $m_i$'s are odd for $i=1,2,3,4$. We observe that the monomials $D_x^mD_y^rD_t^n$ and $D_x^{m_1}D_y^{m_2}D_t^{m_3}D_z^{m_4}$ do not result genuine four-soliton solutions. In addition, we obtain three-soliton, lump, and hybrid solutions of these three type of equations for particular powers of the Hirota $D$-operators.</description>

      <title>Spectral enclosure estimates for non-self-adjoint Dirac operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02236v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of a periodic non-self-adjoint Dirac operator, and its dependence on a semiclassical parameter is also considered. Several bounds on the spectrum are obtained which provide sharp spectral enclosure estimates. Importantly, a sufficient condition is obtained which ensures semiclassical spectral confinement to the real axis and a bounded subset of the imaginary axis of the spectral plane.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of a Family of Painlev\'e Functions with Applications to CUE Derivative Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert method is employed to carry out an asymptotic analysis of a family of $\sigma$-Painlev\'e V functions associated with Hankel determinants involving the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind. In the large-matrix limit, this family degenerates to a family of $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III$'$ functions, whose precise asymptotic behavior is also obtained. Both families of Painlev\'e functions arise in the study of the joint moments of the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of a CUE random matrix and the polynomial itself, whose asymptotics are closely related to the moments of the Riemann zeta function and the Hardy $\mathsf{Z}$-function on the critical line. One of our main results establishes a representation of the leading coefficients of these joint moments in terms of $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III$'$ functions for general real exponents. The other main result resolves a question of Assiotis et al. in [Probab. Math. Physics. 2(2021), 613-642, Remark 2.5] concerning the existence of a probability density for a random variable arising in the ergodic decomposition of Hua-Pickrell measures.</description>

      <title>Twisted local G-wild mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the isomonodromic deformations of irregular-singular connections defined on principal bundles over complex curves: for any complex reductive structure group G, and any polar divisor; allowing for a twisted/ramified formal normal form at each pole, and for twists in the interior of the curve. (This covers the general case in 2-dimensional meromorphic gauge theory.) We focus on the irregular moduli of the connections, studying the fundamental groups of the spaces of admissible deformations of their irregular types/classes, i.e., the local wild mapping class groups in the title. To describe them, we first take the viewpoint of (nonsplit) reflections cosets in Springer/Lehrer--Springer theory, which yields in particular new modular interpretations of complex reflection groups -- and their braid groups. Then we introduce new `fission' trees to treat structure groups of any (simple) classical type, leading to a complete classification of the corresponding hyperplane arrangements, and singling out an infinite family of noncrystallographic examples in type D. Moreover, we reinterpret Bessis' lift of Springer theory as the study of `quasi-generic' deformations, corresponding to irregular singularities whose leading coefficient is regular semisimple upon pullback along a local cyclic covering of the base curve. Finally, we rephrase much of this material in terms of generalized root-valuation stratifications.</description>

      <title>Absence of local conserved charges of the Fredkin spin chain and its truncated versions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conservation laws serve as the hallmark of integrability. The absence of conserved charges typically implies that the model is nonintegrable. The recently proposed Fredkin spin chain exhibits rich structures, and its ground state is analytically known. However, whether the Fredkin spin chain is integrable remains an open question. In this work, through rigorous analytical calculations, we demonstrate that the Fredkin spin chain, under both periodic and open boundary conditions, lacks local conserved charges, thereby confirming its nonintegrable nature. Furthermore, we find that when one or a portion of the Hamiltonian terms are removed (referred to as the truncated Fredkin spin chain), local conserved charges are still absent. Our findings suggest that in models involving three-site interactions, integrable models are generally rare.</description>
