      <title>Microscopic magnetic field imaging with hot atoms via single-pixel imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, sensors based on hot atomic vapor cells have emerged as a compact and highly sensitive means of measuring magnetic fields. Such sensors have been deployed in the field for the measurement of, e.g. biological systems, representing a promising practical application of quantum technologies. However, it remains challenging to obtain high-resolution magnetic field images from these sensors, and in most cases the spatial resolution of the system is limited by the sensor size. Here, we demonstrate the combination of single-pixel imaging (SPI) techniques with an atom vapor. Faraday magnetometer to achieve microscopic magnetic field imaging. We demonstrate magnetic field imaging with a spatial resolution of $\approx~62.5\mu m$, limited only by the resolution of our DMD projection system and the absence of magnetic shielding in our experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Fast hydrogen atom diffraction through monocrystalline graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report fast atom diffraction through single-layer graphene using hydrogen atoms at kinetic energies from 150 to 1200 eV. High-resolution images reveal overlapping hexagonal patterns from coexisting monocrystalline domains. Time-of-flight tagging confirms negligible energy loss, making the method suitable for matter-wave interferometry. The diffraction is well described by the eikonal approximation, with accurate modeling requiring the full 3D interaction potential from DFT. Simpler models fail to reproduce the data, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of diffraction patterns to atom-surface interactions and their potential for spectroscopic applications.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of nano-diamonds with a single NV center: Towards matter-wave interferometry with massive objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in previously unexplored regimes. It also opens the possibility of probing the interface between QM and GR, such as testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several approaches are being explored, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds with embedded spins as test particles which, in combination with Stern-Gerlach forces, enable the realization of a closed-loop matter-wave interferometer in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. Here we discuss the design considerations for a high-precision enhanced-coherence nanodiamond source, review the fabrication processes used to produce nanodiamond pillars measuring 40 x 65 x 80 nm, summarize the characterization work completed to date, and conclude with an outlook on the remaining steps needed to finalize the source fabrication. We would be happy to make available more details upon request.</description>

      <title>SI-Traceable Temperature Calibration Based on Optical Lattice Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a SI-traceable temperature calibration apparatus utilizing optical lattice clocks for precision metrology. The system employs a dual-blackbody radiation shield chamber with independent temperature control, enabling synchronous differential measurements of blackbody radiation (BBR)-induced frequency shifts in atomic ensembles. By correlating these shifts with chamber temperature, we propose absolute temperature determination traceable to the SI second through the optical clock frequency. Comprehensive uncertainty analysis demonstrates an absolute temperature uncertainty below 17 mK across the $200 \sim 350$ K range based on $^{87}$Sr optical lattice clock, representing an improvement of two orders of magnitude over current temperature measurements based on BBR-induced Rydberg state transitions. This advancement in primary thermometry offers significant improvements in precision, reproducibility, and versatility, with potential applications in metrology, fundamental physics, and industrial processes.</description>

      <title>Portable Laser-Pumped Rb Atomic Clock with Digital Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing the size and complexity of high-performance timekeeping devices is an ever-growing need for various applications, such as 6G wireless technology, positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), Internet of Things (IoT), and ultrafast spectroscopy. This work presents a distributed feedback (DFB) laser-pumped Rb atomic clock, which features extraordinary frequency stability, small size and low power consumption. The DFB laser head employs a built-in isolator with a linewidth of approximately 1 MHz. For complete optical pumping of the atoms in the absorption cell, the laser beam is expanded to a diameter of 10 mm by using an optical diffuser-based beam expander. The physics package is based on a magnetron microwave cavity and surrounded by two layers of magnetic shielding. The overall volume of the optical system combined with the physics package is 250 cm$^3$. The proposed atomic clock is also designed to operate at a low temperature, whose absorption cell is maintained at 323 K. Benefiting from the lower Rb atom density, the excited atoms present a long population relaxation time of 5.8 ms. The frequency synthesizer and frequency-locked loop are implemented by digital circuits. The short-term stability of the atomic clock is measured to be $1.8\times10^{-12}\tau ^{-1/2}$ (1-100s). Our achievement paves the way for practical application of the laser-pumped Rb atomic clocks.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of the QCD Interaction Scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>
