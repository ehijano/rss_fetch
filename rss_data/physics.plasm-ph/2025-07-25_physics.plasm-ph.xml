      <title>Bright polarised x-ray flashes from dense plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating a plasma dominated by strong-field QED (SFQED) effects is a major goal of new multi-PW laser facilities. This is motivated by the fact that the fundamental dynamics of such plasmas is poorly understood and plays an important role in the electrodynamics of extreme astrophysical environments such as pulsar magnetospheres. The most obvious observable for which such a regime has been reached is the production of a bright flash of x-rays, but distinguishing this from other sources of hard x-rays (e.g., bremsstrahlung) is a major challenge. Here we show that the photons from the X-ray flash are highly polarised, as compared to the unpolarised background, i.e., polarisation is an indicator that the SFQED plasma has really produced. For a laser of intensity $10^{21}$ Wcm$^{-2}$ impinging on a solid Al target, the photons of the flash with energy $&gt;10$\thinspace keV are $&gt;65\%$ polarised.</description>

      <title>Electron acoustic shock and solitary waves in spin polarized dense rotating quantum plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of electrostatic waves in a three-component electron positron ion astrophysical quantum plasma under the influence of uniform rotation is analysed, incorporating the effects of particle spin, Fermi pressure, and the quantum Bohm potential. Spin polarisation arising due to the alignment of particle spins under the influence of a strong external magnetic field leads to an imbalance in the population of spin-up and spin-down states. Additionally, key astrophysical factors such as rotation and gravitational influence have been considered. The coupled dispersion relations for electron, positron, and ion modes have been derived. Further, the electron acoustic shock wave is studied using the Korteweg de Vries Burgers method, and the shock wave solution has been obtained. Quantum effects are found to contribute to enhanced wave dispersion and modify the shock profile by broadening and stabilising the shock structure.</description>

      <title>Plasma Position Constrained Free-Boundary MHD Equilibrium in Tokamaks using pyIPREQ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A free-boundary, axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium code, pyIPREQ, has been developed for Tokamak plasmas using finite difference and Green's function approach. The code builds upon the foundational frameworks of the PEST and IPREQ codes, introducing several enhancements and new capabilities. Notably, pyIPREQ supports the specification of limiter boundaries and enables the computation of key physical quantities. The code has also been extended to compute equilibria constrained by a prescribed magnetic axis position, which is particularly useful when such information is available from diagnostics like Sine-Cosine coils. In addition, pyIPREQ includes functionality to address vertical instabilities, a requirement for accurately modeling elongated plasma configurations. Benchmarking has been carried out against published results and the original IPREQ code. Applications are demonstrated for ADITYA-U Tokamak experiments, where magnetic axis measurements are available, and predictions are also made for SST-1 and ADITYA-U Tokamaks under various operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal current-driven heat flow in ideal plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron heat flux is an important and often dominant mechanism of energy transport in a variety of collisional plasmas in a confined fusion or astrophysical context. While nonlocal conductive heat transport, driven by strong temperature gradients, has been investigated extensively in previous literature, nonlocal regimes of the current-driven heat flow and friction have not received the same attention. In this work, a first-principles reduced kinetic method (RKM) is applied to study nonlocal effects on current-driven transport. In addition to nonlocality due to sharp gradients, sufficiently large currents are found to significantly enhance current-driven heat flux due to a novel nonlocal mechanism, with this enhancement being increasingly prevalent for higher effective ionizations $Z^*$. Introducing the dimensionless number $N_u \equiv \vert \boldsymbol{u}_e - \boldsymbol{u}_i \vert / v_{\text{th},e}$, these enhancements occur for even relatively weak flows $N_u \gtrsim 1/100$, analogously to standard nonlocal effects becoming significant for Knudsen numbers $N_K \gtrsim 1/100$.</description>

      <title>A Supervised Machine Learning Framework for Multipactor Breakdown Prediction in High-Power Radio Frequency Devices and Accelerator Components: A Case Study in Planar Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipactor is a nonlinear electron avalanche phenomenon that can severely impair the performance of high-power radio frequency (RF) devices and accelerator systems. Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across different materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet computationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF engineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine learning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar geometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary electron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models - including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the time-averaged electron growth rate, ${\delta}_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Pearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs in generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a scalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those trained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis reveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint feature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset coverage. This study demonstrates both the promise and limitations of ML-based multipactor prediction and lays the groundwork for accelerated, data-driven modeling in advanced RF and accelerator system design.</description>

      <title>Advanced Ceramic Plasma Discharge Capillaries for high repetition rate operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In view of future applications of plasma-based particle accelerators, within the fields of high-energy physics and new light sources, the capability of plasma sources to operate at high repetition rates is crucial. In particular for gas-filled plasma discharge capillaries, which allow direct control over plasma properties, a key aspect is the longevity of the material, subject to erosion due to the heat flux delivered by high voltage plasma discharges. In this regard, we present an innovative design of discharge capillaries based on the use of different ceramic materials, which can sustain high voltage plasma discharges at high repetition rate and, moreover, be easily machined for the complex geometries required for plasma-based accelerators. Experimental campaigns are carried out at 10-150 Hz, assessing the longevity of ceramic capillaries by means of different diagnostic techniques. In addition, numerical simulations are performed to analyze the heat transfer within the whole plasma source. Results from experimental and numerical analysis highlight the capability of ceramic capillaries to preserve plasma properties and the integrity of the source during long-term plasma discharge operation at high repetition rate. In particular, we demonstrated the suitability of the proposed solution for the operative range of 100-400 Hz, foreseen for EuPRAXIA@SPARC_LAB project.</description>

      <title>Multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary Grad-Shafranov problem on MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05674v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation is a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation that governs the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium of a tokamak plasma. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple solutions to the GS equation when solved in idealistic geometries with simplified plasma current density profiles and boundary conditions. Until now, the question of whether multiple equilibria might exist in real-world tokamak geometries with more complex current density profiles and integral free-boundary conditions (commonly used in production-level equilibrium codes) has remained unanswered. In this work, we discover multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary GS problem in the MAST-U tokamak geometry using the validated evolutive equilibrium solver FreeGSNKE and the deflated continuation algorithm. By varying the plasma current, current density profile coefficients, or coil currents in the GS equation, we identify and characterise distinct equilibrium solutions, including both deeply and more shallowly confined plasma states. We suggest that the existence of even more equilibria is likely prohibited by the restrictive nature of the integral free-boundary condition, which globally couples poloidal fluxes on the computational boundary with those on the interior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for wider equilibrium modelling and emphasise the need to explore whether multiple solutions are present in other equilibrium codes and tokamaks, as well as their potential impact on downstream simulations that rely on GS equilibria.</description>

      <title>Modeling helium compression and enrichment in DIII-D edge plasmas using the SOLPS-ITER code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient removal of helium ash is a critical requirement for the operation of fusion power plants, as its accumulation can dilute the core fuel and degrade plasma performance. While past studies suggested that helium exhaust in burning plasmas could be managed effectively through divertor optimization and conventional cryopumping, a detailed understanding of helium behavior in the edge and divertor plasma remains limited, as helium transport through the edge plasma is complex and fundamentally different from other impurity species. With the emergence of more sophisticated numerical modeling tools and renewed focus on D-T burning plasmas, revisiting helium transport in current magnetic confinement devices is necessary for planning and designing fusion pilot plants. This study uses SOLPS-ITER to model a helium-seeded discharge from the DIII-D tokamak, analyzing the transport, recycling, and enrichment of helium in the divertor. In addition to characterizing helium dynamics, the results are interpreted in terms of the Tritium Burn Efficiency (TBE), a recently proposed metric linking helium exhaust fraction to tritium fuel utilization in steady-state burning plasmas. By assessing the compatibility of TBE assumptions with detailed edge plasma simulations, this work provides insight into the practical viability of TBE as a reactor design and performance metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a protocol to study via Molecular Dynamics simulation the degradation of Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in water by hydroxyl radical. To achieve this, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out, using ReaxFF reactive interaction potential. Simulations are carried out under a temperature ramp for determining all possible products. Using this methodology, reaction pathways of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) are identified.</description>
