      <title>Superconductivity of Bulk Abnormal Magic-stoichiometric Na3Cl Salt Crystals at Normal Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of new materials with superconducting properties is the pursuit in the realm of superconductivity research. Here, excitedly, we show that the simplest salt daily used can be made a superconductor at normal pressure only by adjusting its stoichiometry of Na and Cl as Na3Cl at normal pressure based on first-principles calculations. This bulk stable abnormal Na-Cl stoichiometric crystal of 3:1, the first 'magic' ratio, includes metallic (Na) atoms in the core as well as hybridization of ionic and metallic bonding, facilitating the electron-phonon-coupling for superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc of 0.13 K. The flat bands and van Hove singularities near the Fermi level produce large densities of states, similar to H3S and LaH10, which is beneficial for the emergence of superconductivity. The crystal composed of with abnormal Na-Cl magic stoichiometry is a precisely tunable, purely sodium and chloride-based, three-dimensional bulk superconductor, which is therefore an ideal material for designing and understanding abnormal stoichiometric crystals. The methodology of constructing this bulk abnormal crystal may be general to almost all elements, which could lead to insights into the physics of other conventional superconductors and even high-critical-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Theoretical studies on off-axis phase diagrams and Knight shifts in UTe$_2$ -- Tetra-critical point, d-vector rotation, and multiple phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent remarkable sets of experiments on UTe$_2$: discoveries of the fourth horizontal internal transition line running toward a tetra-critical point (TCP) at $H$=15T, the off-axis high field phases, and abnormally large Knight shift (KS) drop below $T_{\rm c}$ for $H$$\parallel$$a$-magnetic easy axis, we advance further our theoretical work on the field ($H$)-temperature ($T$) phase diagram for $H$$\parallel$$b$-magnetic hard axis which contains a positive sloped $H_{\rm c2}$ departing from TCP. A nonunitary spin-triplet pairing with three components explains these experimental facts simultaneously and consistently by assuming that the underlying normal electron system with a narrow bandwidth characteristic to the Kondo temperature $\sim$60K unsurprisingly breaks the particle-hole symmetry. This causes a special invariant term in Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy functional which couples directly with the 5f magnetic system, giving rise to the $T_{\rm c}$ splitting and ultimately to the positive sloped $H_{\rm c2}$ and the horizontal internal transition line connected to TCP. The large KS drop can be understood in terms of this GL invariance whose coefficient is negative and leads to a diamagnetic response where the Cooper pair spin is antiparallel to the applied field direction. The present scenario also accounts for the observed d-vector rotation phenomena and off-axis phase diagrams with extremely high $H_{\rm c2}$$\gtrsim$70T found at angles in between the $b$ and $c$-axes and between the $bc$ plane and $a$-axis, making UTe$_2$ a fertile playground for a topological superconductor.</description>

      <title>Origin of low specific heat and possible self-heating in field-cooled Sn-Pb solders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic flux trapping in field-cooled (FC) Sn-Pb solders has been recently studied because of the observation of nonvolatile magneto-thermal switching [H. Arima et al., Commun. Mater. 5, 34 (2024)] and anomalous magnetic field-temperature (H-T) phase diagrams [T. Murakami et al., AIP Adv. 13, 125008 (2023)]. In this paper, we investigate the origin of the anomalously low specific heat (C) in Sn10-Pb90 and Sn45-Pb55 solders after FC at H = 1500 Oe. We show that the FC solders exhibit self-heating possibly caused by the flux flow during the reduction of trapped fluxes when heating the sample during the C measurements. The T dependence of T rise clearly exhibits unexpectedly large values when the low-C states are observed. In addition, the cause of the transition-like behavior in C-T of FC solders are explained by local heating during H control and flux-jump phenomena.</description>

      <title>Multiple Topological Phase Transitions Unveiling Gapless Topological Superconductivity in Magnet/Unconventional Superconductor Hybrid Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for generating gapless topological superconductivity (GTSC) hosting Majorana flat edge modes (MFEMs) in the presence of a two-dimensional (2D) array of magnetic adatoms with noncollinear spin texture deposited on top of a unconventional superconductor. Our observations reveal two distinct topological phase transitions within the emergent Shiba band depending on the exchange coupling strength ($J$) between magnetic adatom spins and superconducting electrons: the first one designates transition from gapless non-topological to gapless topological phase at lower $J$, while the second one denotes transition from gapless topological to a trivial gapped superconducting phase at higher $J$. The gapless topological superconducting phase survives at intermediate values of $J$, hosting MFEMs. Further, we investigate the nature of the bulk effective pairings which indicate that GTSC appears due to the interplay between pseudo "$s$-wave" and pseudo "$p_{x}+p_y$" types of pairing. Consequently, our study opens a promising avenue for the experimental realization of GTSC in 2D Shiba lattice based on $d$-wave superconductors as a high-temperature platform.</description>

      <title>Unraveling p-type and n-type interfaces in Superconducting Infinite-Layer Nickelate thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After decades of research, superconductivity was finally found in nickel-based analogs of superconducting cuprates, with infinite-layer (IL) structure. These results are so far restricted to thin films in the case of IL-nickelates. Therefore, the nature of the interface with the substrate, and how it couples with the thin film properties is still an open question. Here, using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)- electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and four-dimensional (4D)-STEM, a novel chemically sharp p-type interface is observed in a series of superconducting IL-praseodymium nickelate samples, and a comparative study is carried out with the previously reported n-type interface obtained in other samples. Both interfaces have strong differences, with the p-type interface being highly polar. In combination with ab-initio calculations, we find that the influence of the interface on the electronic structure is local, and does not extend beyond 2-3 unit cells into the thin film. This decouples the direct influence of the interface in driving the superconductivity, and indicates that the IL-nickelate thin films do not have a universal interface model. Insights into the spatial hole-distribution in SC samples, provided by monochromated EELS and total reflection-hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, suggest that this particular distribution might be directly influencing superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Local insulator-to-superconductor transition in amorphous InO$_x$ films modulated by e-beam irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method enabling precise post-fabrication modulation of the electrical resistance in micrometer-scale regions of amorphous indium oxide (a-InO$_x$) films. By subjecting initially insulating films to an electron beam at room temperature, we demonstrate that the exposed region of the films becomes superconducting. The resultant superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) is adjustable up to 2.8 K by changing the electron dose and accelerating voltage. This technique offers a compelling alternative to traditional a-InO$_x$ annealing methods for both fundamental investigations and practical applications. Moreover, it empowers independent adjustment of electrical properties across initially identical a-InO$_x$ samples on the same substrate, facilitating the creation of superconducting microstructures with precise $T_c$ control at the micrometer scale. The observed resistance modifications likely stem from photoreduction induced by X-ray and/or UV radiation emitted during electron beam interactions with the film and substrate.</description>

      <title>A proximitized quantum dot in germanium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar germanium quantum wells have recently been shown to host a hard-gapped superconductor-semiconductor interface. Additionally, quantum dot spin qubits in germanium are well-suited for quantum information processing, with isotopic purification to a nuclear spin-free material expected to yield long coherence times. Therefore, as one of the few group IV materials with the potential to host superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, proximitized quantum dots in germanium are a crucial ingredient towards topological superconductivity and novel qubit modalities. Here we demonstrate a quantum dot (QD) in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure proximitized by a platinum germanosilicide (PtGeSi) superconducting lead (SC), forming a SC-QD-SC junction. We show tunability of the QD-SC coupling strength, as well as gate control of the ratio of charging energy and the induced gap. We further exploit this tunability by exhibiting control of the ground state of the system between even and odd parity. Furthermore, we characterize the critical magnetic field strengths, finding a robust critical out-of-plane field of 0.91(5) T. Finally we explore sub-gap spin splitting in the device, observing rich physics in the resulting spectra, that we model using a zero-bandwidth model in the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov limit. The demonstration of controllable proximitization at the nanoscale of a germanium quantum dot opens up the physics of novel spin and superconducting qubits, and Josephson junction arrays in a group IV material.</description>

      <title>Boosting fluxons for ballistic-logic power using an Aharonov-Casher ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting logic is fast and energy-efficient relative to CMOS, but also fundamental studies are needed to scale up circuits for greater utility. Recently, ballistic shift registers for single-flux quanta (SFQ) bits were shown in simulation to allow high-efficiency superconducting gates. However, these gates are unpowered such that the bits slow after each gate operation and only a short sequence of gates is possible without added power. Here we show that a circuit based on an Aharonov-Casher ring can power these shift registers by boosting the bit velocity to a constant value, despite their unusual bit states constituted by two polarities of SFQ. As a step in its operation, each bit state is forced into a different ring arm and then accelerated. The circuit dynamics depend on various circuit parameters and choices of how to merge the bit-state paths. One design from each merge design choice is proposed to enable scaling up to an array of gates by adding serial biasing in a relatively simple way. We find adequate performance for ballistic logic in terms of boosted velocity, energy efficiency, and parameter margins. We also discuss the circuit's classical barriers; in a different regime this relates to the Aharonov-Casher effect.</description>

      <title>Resonant switching current detector based on underdamped Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current-biased Josephson junctions can act as detectors of electromagnetic radiation. At optimal conditions, their sensitivity is limited by fluctuations causing stochastic switching from the superconducting to the resistive state. This work provides a quantitative description of a stochastic switching current detector, based on an underdamped Josephson junction. It is shown that activation of a Josephson plasma resonance can greatly enhance the detector responsivity in proportion to the quality factor of the junction. The ways of tuning the detector for achieving optimal operation are discussed. For realistic parameters of Nb/AlOx/Nb tunnel junctions, the sensitivity and noise-equivalent power can reach values of $S\simeq 2\times10^{13}$ (V/W) and $NEP\simeq 5\times10^{-24}$ (WHz$^{-1/2}$), respectively. These outstanding characteristics facilitate both bolometric and single-photon detection in microwave and terahertz ranges.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform and anisotropic electric polarizability resulting in pronounced local repulsion minima in high-temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the dramatic effect of non-uniform, discrete electric polarizability in high-T$_{C}$ superconductors on the spatial fluctuations of the short to medium range Coulomb interactions through a real-space semiclassical model. Although this is a general property, we concentrate on the cuprates as parent compounds, in which the charge carriers are primarily concentrated on the O sublattice. The anisotropic effective Cu-O bond polarization caused by charge transfer energy modulation and the O$^{2-}$ atomic polarizability together generate a non-monotonic screened hole-hole Coulomb interaction at short distances that displays a local minimum at the in-plane second nearest neighbor O-O distance solely along the Cu-O bond direction. This is in accordance with the pseudogap phase anisotropy and the short coherence length observed in many high-T$_C$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>Field-Effect Josephson Diode via Asymmetric Spin-Momentum-Locking States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01980v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Josephson diodes dangle the possibility of extending conventional non-reciprocal electronics into the realm of superconductivity. While a strong magnetic field is recognized for enhancing diode efficiency, it concurrently poses a risk of undermining the essential superconductivity required for non-dissipative devices. To circumvent the need for magnetic-based tuning, we propose a field-effect Josephson diode based on the electrostatic gate control of finite momentum Cooper pairs in asymmetric spin-momentum-locking states. We propose two possible implementations of our gate-controlled mechanism: (i) a topological field-effect Josephson diode in time-reversal-broken quantum spin Hall insulators; and (ii) semiconductor-based field-effect Josephson diodes attainable in current experimental setups involving a Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling. Notably, the diode efficiency is highly enhanced in the topological field-effect Josephson diode because the current carried by the asymmetric helical edge states is topologically protected and can be tuned by local gates. In the proposed Josephson diode, the combination of gates and asymmetric spin-momentum-locking nature is equivalent to that of a magnetic field, thus providing an alternative electrical operation in designing nonreciprocal superconducting devices.</description>
