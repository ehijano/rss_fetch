      <title>Course Deficit Model and the CLASP curriculum: Examining equity and graduation rates at two institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have previously described the reformed introductory physics course, Collaborative Learning through Active Sense-Making in Physics (CLASP), for bioscience students at a large public research one university (Original University) and presented evidence that the course was more successful and more equitable than the course it replaced by several measures. Now we compare the original success of CLASP with an implementation at a second institution. We find that the original results hold at another institution despite some changes to the original curriculum and a somewhat different student population. We find that students who take CLASP are 1) less likely to drop, 2) less likely to fail, and 3) do as well in later coursework when compared to students who took the courses that CLASP replaced, even if that coursework is not similarly reformed. We find the above items to be independently true for historically marginalized students and remarkably, also find that 4) marginalized students who take CLASP are more likely to graduate from a STEM field. We use a course deficit model perspective to examine these results, and discuss some of the factors that may have contributed to this success. We argue that higher education has the tools they need to significantly increase equity, and improve student success and retention.</description>

      <title>Dominant misconceptions and alluvial flows between Engineering and Physical Science students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we assess the comprehension of physics concepts by Physical Science and Engineering students enrolled in their first semester at the University of Johannesburg (UJ), South Africa ($2022$). We employ different graphical measures to explore similarities and differences using the results of both pre- and post-test data from the Force Concept Inventory assessment tool, from which we calculate dominant misconceptions (DMs) and gains. We also use alluvial diagrams to track the choices made by these two groups of students from pre- to post-test stages. In our analysis, we find that DMs results indicate that participating Engineering students outperformed Physical Science students on average. However, the same types of normalised DMs persist at the post-test level. This is very useful when tracking persistent misconceptions, where when using repeated measures and alluvial diagrams with smaller groups of students, we find that Physical Science students tend to make more chaotic choices.</description>
