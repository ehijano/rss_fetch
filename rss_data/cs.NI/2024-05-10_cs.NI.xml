      <title>Tomur: Traffic-Aware Performance Prediction of On-NIC Network Functions with Multi-Resource Contention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network function (NF) offloading on SmartNICs has been widely used in modern data centers, offering benefits in host resource saving and programmability. Co-running NFs on the same SmartNICs can cause performance interference due to onboard resource contention. Therefore, to meet performance SLAs while ensuring efficient resource management, operators need mechanisms to predict NF performance under such contention. However, existing solutions lack SmartNIC-specific knowledge and exhibit limited traffic awareness, leading to poor accuracy for on-NIC NFs. This paper proposes Tomur, a novel performance predictive system for on-NIC NFs. Tomur builds upon the key observation that co-located NFs contend for multiple resources, including onboard accelerators and the memory subsystem. It also facilitates traffic awareness according to the behaviors of individual resources to maintain accuracy as the external traffic attributes vary. Evaluation using BlueField-2 SmartNIC shows that Tomur improves the prediction accuracy by 78.8% and reduces SLA violations by 92.2% compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and enables new practical usecases.</description>

      <title>Generative Model for Joint Resource Management in Multi-Cell Multi-Carrier NOMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we design a generative artificial intelligence (GAI) -based framework for joint resource allocation, beamforming, and power allocation in multi-cell multi-carrier non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. We formulate the proposed problem as sum rate maximization problem. Next, we design a novel multi-task transformer (MTT) framework to handle the problem in real-time. To provide the necessary training set, we consider simplified but powerful mathematical techniques from the literature. Then, we train and test the proposed MTT. We perform simulation to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed MTT and compare its performance with the mathematical baseline.</description>

      <title>Shape-Optimized Electrooptic Beam Scanners: Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new horn-shaped electrooptic scanner is described with significantly improved scanning sensitivity over rectangular- shaped devices. In the new device, the shape of the scanner is chosen to follow the trajectory of the beam. An example design is described that exhibits a factor of two larger scanning sensitivity than a rectangular device with comparable maximum scanning angle. Beam propagation simulations and measurements on an experimental device verify the scanner performance.</description>

      <title>Age of Information and Energy Consumption in IoT: an Experimental Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Age of Information (AoI) is an end-to-end metric frequently used to understand how "fresh" the information about a remote system is. In this paper, we present an experimental study of the relationship between AoI and the energy spent by the device that produces information, e.g. an IoT device or a monitoring sensor. Such a relationship has been almost neglected so far, but it is particularly important whenever the sensing side is battery-operated. The study is carried out in a scenario where access is achieved via the cellular network and information is transferred using MQTT, a popular messaging protocol in the IoT domain. Numerous parameters of operation are considered, and the most efficient solutions in all configurations are provided.</description>

      <title>LayerPlexRank: Exploring Node Centrality and Layer Influence through Algebraic Connectivity in Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the calculation of centrality in complex networks becomes increasingly vital across technological, biological, and social systems, precise and scalable ranking methods are essential for understanding these networks. This paper introduces LayerPlexRank, an algorithm that simultaneously assesses node centrality and layer influence in multiplex networks using algebraic connectivity metrics. This method enhances the robustness of the ranking algorithm by effectively assessing structural changes across layers using random walk, considering the overall connectivity of the graph. We substantiate the utility of LayerPlexRank with theoretical analyses and empirical validations on varied real-world datasets, contrasting it with established centrality measures.</description>

      <title>Depth Awakens: A Depth-perceptual Attention Fusion Network for RGB-D Camouflaged Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) presents a persistent challenge in accurately identifying objects that seamlessly blend into their surroundings. However, most existing COD models overlook the fact that visual systems operate within a genuine 3D environment. The scene depth inherent in a single 2D image provides rich spatial clues that can assist in the detection of camouflaged objects. Therefore, we propose a novel depth-perception attention fusion network that leverages the depth map as an auxiliary input to enhance the network's ability to perceive 3D information, which is typically challenging for the human eye to discern from 2D images. The network uses a trident-branch encoder to extract chromatic and depth information and their communications. Recognizing that certain regions of a depth map may not effectively highlight the camouflaged object, we introduce a depth-weighted cross-attention fusion module to dynamically adjust the fusion weights on depth and RGB feature maps. To keep the model simple without compromising effectiveness, we design a straightforward feature aggregation decoder that adaptively fuses the enhanced aggregated features. Experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed method over other states of the arts, which further validates the contribution of depth information in camouflaged object detection. The code will be available at https://github.com/xinran-liu00/DAF-Net.</description>

      <title>Small-Scale Testbed for Evaluating C-V2X Applications on 5G Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a small-scale testbed for evaluating the real-life performance of cellular V2X (C-V2X) applications on 5G cellular networks. Despite the growing interest and rapid technology development for V2X applications, researchers still struggle to prototype V2X applications with real wireless networks, hardware, and software in the loop in a controlled environment. To help alleviate this challenge, we present a testbed designed to accelerate development and evaluation of C-V2X applications on 5G cellular networks. By including a small-scale vehicle platform into the testbed design, we significantly reduce the time and effort required to test new C-V2X applications on 5G cellular networks. With a focus around the integration of small-scale vehicle platforms, we detail the design decisions behind the full software and hardware setup of commonly needed intelligent transport system agents (e.g. sensors, servers, vehicles). Moreover, to showcase the testbed's capability to produce industrially-relevant, real world performance evaluations, we present an evaluation of a simple test case inspired from shared situational awareness. Finally, we discuss the upcoming use of the testbed for evaluating 5G cellular network-based shared situational awareness and other C-V2X applications.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy AI-Generative Content in Intelligent 6G Network: Adversarial, Privacy, and Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) models, represented by large language models (LLM), have brought revolutionary changes to the content generation fields. The high-speed and extensive 6G technology is an ideal platform for providing powerful AIGC mobile service applications, while future 6G mobile networks also need to support intelligent and personalized mobile generation services. However, the significant ethical and security issues of current AIGC models, such as adversarial attacks, privacy, and fairness, greatly affect the credibility of 6G intelligent networks, especially in ensuring secure, private, and fair AIGC applications. In this paper, we propose TrustGAIN, a novel paradigm for trustworthy AIGC in 6G networks, to ensure trustworthy large-scale AIGC services in future 6G networks. We first discuss the adversarial attacks and privacy threats faced by AIGC systems in 6G networks, as well as the corresponding protection issues. Subsequently, we emphasize the importance of ensuring the unbiasedness and fairness of the mobile generative service in future intelligent networks. In particular, we conduct a use case to demonstrate that TrustGAIN can effectively guide the resistance against malicious or generated false information. We believe that TrustGAIN is a necessary paradigm for intelligent and trustworthy 6G networks to support AIGC services, ensuring the security, privacy, and fairness of AIGC network services.</description>

      <title>Power-Domain Interference Graph Estimation for Full-Duplex Millimeter-Wave Backhauling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional wisdom for network resource management allocates separate frequency-time resources for measurement and data transmission tasks. As a result, the two types of tasks have to compete for resources, and a heavy measurement task inevitably reduces available resources for data transmission. This prevents interference graph estimation (IGE), a heavy yet important measurement task, from being widely used in practice. To resolve this issue, we propose to use power as a new dimension for interference measurement in full-duplex millimeter-wave backhaul networks, such that data transmission and measurement can be done simultaneously using the same frequency-time resources. Our core insight is to consider the mmWave network as a linear system, where the received power of a node is a linear combination of the channel gains. By controlling the powers of transmitters, we can find unique solutions for the channel gains of interference links and use them to estimate the interference. To accomplish resource allocation and IGE simultaneously, we jointly optimize resource allocation and IGE with power control. Extensive simulations show that significant links in the interference graph can be accurately estimated with minimal extra power consumption, independent of the time and carrier frequency offsets between nodes.</description>

      <title>Blockchains for Internet of Things: Fundamentals, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) services necessitate the storage, transmission, and analysis of diverse data for inference, autonomy, and control. Blockchains, with their inherent properties of decentralization and security, offer efficient database solutions for these devices through consensus-based data sharing. However, it's essential to recognize that not every blockchain system is suitable for specific IoT applications, and some might be more beneficial when excluded with privacy concerns. For example, public blockchains are not suitable for storing sensitive data. This paper presents a detailed review of three distinct blockchains tailored for enhancing IoT applications. We initially delve into the foundational aspects of three blockchain systems, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and implementation needs. Additionally, we discuss the security issues in different blockchains. Subsequently, we explore the blockchain's application in three pivotal IoT areas: edge AI, communications, and healthcare. We underscore potential challenges and the future directions for integrating different blockchains in IoT. Ultimately, this paper aims to offer a comprehensive perspective on the synergies between blockchains and the IoT ecosystem, highlighting the opportunities and complexities involved.</description>
