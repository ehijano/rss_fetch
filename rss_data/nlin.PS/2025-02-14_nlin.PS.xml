      <title>Unilateral vibration transmission in mechanical systems with bilinear coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unilateral transmission refers to the scenario in which the waves transmitted through a system remain in pure tension or pure compression. This transmission phenomenon may occur in systems that exhibit different effective elasticity in compression and tension; i.e. bilinear elasticity. We present a computational investigation of unilateral transmission in the steady-state response of harmonically driven mechanical systems with bilinear coupling. Starting with two bilinearly coupled oscillators, we find that breaking the mirror symmetry of the system, in either elastic or inertial properties, facilitates unilateral transmission by allowing it to occur near a primary resonance. This asymmetry also enables nonreciprocal transmission to occur. We then investigate the nonreciprocal dynamics of the system, including linear stability analysis, with a focus on unilateral transmission. We also extend our discussion to a bilinear periodic structure, for which we investigate the influence of the number of units and energy dissipation on unilateral transmission. We report on the existence of stable nonreciprocal unilateral transmission near primary and internal resonances of the system, as well as other nonreciprocal features such as period-doubled and quasiperiodic response characteristics.</description>

      <title>Solitons in Bose-Einstein Condensates with Attractive Self-Interaction on a M\"obius Strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the matter-wave solitons in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) trapped on a M\"{o}bius strip (MS), based on the respective Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation with the mean-field theory. In the linear regime, vortex states are characterized by quantum numbers, $n$ and $m$, corresponding to the transverse and circumferential directions, with the phase structure determined by the winding number (WN) $m$. Odd and even values of $n$ must associate, respectively, with integer and half-integer values of $m$, the latter ones requiring two cycles of motion around MS for returning to the initial phase. Using variational and numerical methods, we solve the GP equation with the attractive nonlinearity, producing a family of ground-state (GS) solitons for values of the norm below the critical one, above which the collapse sets in. Vortex solitons with $n=1,m=1$ and $% n=2,m=1/2$ are obtained in a numerical form. The vortex solitons with $% n=1,m=1$ are almost uniformly distributed in the azimuthal direction, while ones with $n=2,m=1/2$ form localized states. The Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion and linear-stability analysis for the GS soliton solutions and vortices with $n=1,m=1$ demonstrates that they are completely stable, while the localized states with $n=2,m=1/2$ are completely unstable. Finally, the motion of solitons on the MS and the collision of two solitons are discussed.</description>

      <title>Defects, parcellation, and renormalized negative diffusivities in non-homogeneous oscillatory media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling among oscillators in spatially-extended systems tends to lock their frequency at a common value. In the presence of spatial non-homogeneities, locking of different regions at different frequencies leads to parcellation, i.e., a series of synchronized clusters (plateaus). Motivated by rhythmic dynamics in physiological systems, we consider a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model with a gradient of natural frequencies. We determine the scaling of the number of plateaus and their typical length {\it vs} dynamical parameters. Plateaus are separated by defects, where the amplitude of the GL field vanishes and phase differences are reset. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, we use asymptotic methods to determine the field profile around defects. For Neumann boundary conditions, we relate the stability phase diagram and defects' precursors to the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Bloch-Torrey equation, originally introduced for nuclear magnetic resonance. In the non-linear regime, we trace the formation of defects to a non-linear renormalization of the diffusivity, which leads to spatially-modulated negative values and an instability that drives amplitude modulation.</description>

      <title>Velocity correlations of vortices and rarefaction pulses in compressible planar quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a quantitive analytical treatment of two-point velocity correlations for two important classes of superfluid excitation in compressible quantum fluids: vortices, and rarefaction pulses. We achieve this using two approaches. First, we introduce a new ansatz for describing vortex cores in planar quantum fluids with improved analytic integrability that provides analytic results for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions, in good agreement with numerical results using the exact vortex shape. The results show signatures of short and long range correlations associated with vortex dipoles and vortex pairs respectively. Second, for the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton the asymptotic high velocity wavefunction provides analytical results for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the main length scale of the soliton. We compare our analytical treatment of the homogeneous system with numerical results for a trapped system, finding good quantitative agreement. Our results are relevant to experimental work to characterize quantum vortices and solitons in quantum fluids of atoms and light, and for studies of quantum turbulence.</description>

      <title>Oscillons from $Q$-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Renormalization Group Theory we show that oscillons in (1+1)-dimensions can be obtained, at the leading nonlinear order, from $Q$-balls of universal complex field theories. For potentials with a nonzero cubic or quartic term the universal $Q$-ball theory is well approximated by the integrable complex sine-Gordon model. This allows us to generalize the usual perturbative expansion by Fodor et. al. beyond the simplest unmodulated oscillon case. Concretely, we explain the characteristic amplitude modulations of excited oscillons as an effect of formation of a two-Q-ball (two-oscillon) bound state.</description>
