      <title>Chirality-Driven Orbital Angular Momentum and Circular Dichroism in CoSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral crystals and molecules were recently predicted to form an intriguing platform for unconventional orbital physics. Here, we report the observation of chirality-driven orbital textures in the bulk electronic structure of CoSi, a prototype member of the cubic B20 family of chiral crystals. Using circular dichroism in soft X-ray angle-resolved photoemission, we demonstrate the formation of a bulk orbital-angular-momentum texture and monopole-like orbital-momentum locking that depends on crystal handedness. We introduce the intrinsic chiral circular dichroism, icCD, as a differential photoemission observable and a natural probe of chiral electron states. Our findings render chiral crystals promising for spin-orbitronics applications.</description>

      <title>Incorporating non-linear effects in fast semi-analytical thermal modelling of powder bed fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usefulness of semi-analytical thermal models for predicting the connection between process, microstructure and properties in powder bed fusion has been well illustrated in recent years. Such an approach provides the promise of accuracy comparable to tools that are orders of magnitude more computationally expensive. The opportunity to make predictions that span several orders of magnitude in space and time comes at the cost of significant simplifications, limiting fully quantitative predictions without empirical calibration. This approach relies on solving a linear problem meaning that first order non-linear effects induced by e.g. the temperature dependence of material properties and surface boundary conditions, are not incorporated. Here, we revisit these limitations and highlight ways that temperature varying material properties and radiative heat loss from the melt pool can be systematically accounted for. These corrections, made with an eye to minimizing additional computational overhead, bring the technique's predictive capability much closer to that of high fidelity thermal simulations. Quantitative comparisons to experiments are used to illustrate the important impact of including such corrections.</description>

      <title>Even-Odd Layer-Dependent Exchange Bias Effect in MnBi2Te4 Chern Insulator Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials with coexisting magnetism and non-trivial band structures exhibit many novel quantum phenomena, including the quantum anomalous Hall effect, the axion insulator state, and the Weyl semimetal phase. As a stoichiometric layered antiferromagnetic topological insulator, thin films of MnBi2Te4 show fascinating even-odd layer-dependent physics. In this work, we fabricate a series of thin-flake MnBi2Te4 devices using stencil masks and observe the Chern insulator state at high magnetic fields and a square hysteresis loop near zero magnetic field in all these devices. Upon magnetic field training, a large exchange bias effect is observed in odd but not in even septuple layer (SL) devices. Our theoretical calculations interpret this even-odd layer-dependent exchange bias effect as a consequence of contrasting surface and bulk magnetic properties of MnBi2Te4 devices. Our findings reveal the microscopic magnetic configuration of MnBi2Te4 thin flakes and highlight the challenges in replicating the zero magnetic field quantum anomalous Hall effect in odd SL MnBi2Te4 devices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Phase Stability and Coercivity of MnAl $\tau$-L$1_0$ with Fe and Ni Substitutions: \textit{ab initio} and Micromagnetic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The binary manganese aluminium (MnAl) alloy with L$1_0$ crystal structure, which exhibits exceptional magnetic properties, is a promising rare earth element free permanent magnet material. However, according to experimental reports, synthesizing it in a stable bulk form is extremely challenging. Here, we propose and theoretically verify an alternative method of stabilizing the material by partially substituting Mn and Al sites by Fe and Ni and identify its stability, electronic structure, and magnetic properties from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. When considering a fixed ($50\%$)-Ni, the magnetic anisotropy increases with the increasing Fe content, but the trend is opposite in terms of formation energy. The calculated formation energies demonstrate that all the binary and quaternary compositions are stable. Through the analysis of calculated elastic constants and phonon frequencies, we confirm that all compositions are mechanically and dynamically stable. Most importantly, both magnetic moment and magnetic anisotropy constant in $50\%$-Fe substituted composition (equiatomic phase) increases significantly as compared to the MnAl. Predicted coercivity of equiatomic phase is larger than parent compound obtained by combining DFT computed parameters with micromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Computational Study Based Prediction of New Photocatalysts for water splitting by systematic manipulation of MXene surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compositional and structural flexibility of functionalised two-dimensional metal carbonitrides or MXenes has been exploited through a combinatorial search for new materials that can act as catalysts for photo-assisted water splitting by absorbing sunlight with energy in the infra-red region. Detailed calculations on 49 Janus MXenes where two surfaces are of asymmetric nature are carried out by first-principles Density Functional Theory. A screening procedure is adopted to arrive at potential candidates. Our calculations predict four new materials whose surfaces can activate both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions upon splitting water, two out of which are infra-red active, and the rest are visible light-active. We have performed a detailed microscopic analysis to find out the interrelations of the structural model of surface functionalisation, the chemistry of the surfaces, the electronic structure, and the alignment of bands with respect to the reaction potentials that explain our results. Apart from these four compounds, we find thirteen other compounds that are suitable for either hydrogen evolution or oxygen reduction reactions. This study lays out a guideline for the systematic discovery of potential new catalysts for water splitting under sunlight irradiation.</description>

      <title>Direct visualization of local magnetic domain dynamics in a 2D Van der Walls material/ferromagnet interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring new strategies for controlling the magnetic domain propagation is the key to realize ultrafast, high-density domain wall-based memory and logic devices for next generation computing. These strategies include strain modulation in multiferroic devices, geometric confinement and area-selective pinning of domain wall. 2D Van der Waals materials introduce localized modifications to the interfacial magnetic order, enabling control over the propagation of magnetic domains. Here, using Lorentz-Transmission Electron Microscopy (L-TEM) along with the Modified Transport of Intensity equations (MTIE), we demonstrate controlled domain expansion with in-situ magnetic field in a ferromagnet (Permalloy, NiFe) interfacing with a 2D Van der Waals material Graphene (Gr). The Gr/NiFe interface exhibits distinctive domain expansion rate with magnetic field selectively near the interface which is further analyzed using micromagnetic simulations. Our findings are crucial for comprehending direct visualization of interface controlled magnetic domain expansion, offering insights for developing future domain wall-based technology.</description>

      <title>Giant and controllable nonlinear magneto-optical effects in two-dimensional magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of polarization and magnetism in materials with light can create rich nonlinear magneto-optical (NLMO) effects, and the recent discovery of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnets provides remarkable control over NLMO effects due to their superb tunability. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we reported giant NLMO effects in CrI3-based 2D magnets, including a dramatic change of second-harmonics generation (SHG) polarization direction (90 degrees) and intensity (on/off switch) under magnetization reversal, and a 100% SHG circular dichroism effect. We further revealed that these effects could not only be used to design ultra-thin multifunctional optical devices, but also to detect subtle magnetic orderings. Remarkably, we analytically derived conditions to achieve giant NLMO effects and propose general strategies to realize them in 2D magnets. Our work not only uncovers a series of intriguing NLMO phenomena, but also paves the way for both fundamental research and device applications of ultra-thin NLMO materials.</description>

      <title>Competitive coexistence of ferromagnetism and metal--insulator transition of VO$_2$ nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the magnetic and electric properties of nanometer-sized vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) particles. VO$_2$ nanoparticles were formed by milling VO$_2$ powder. We measured the magnetic field dependence of the magnetization of the VO$_2$ powder and nanoparticles. The VO$_2$ powder did not exhibit ferromagnetism, whereas the VO$_2$ nanoparticles exhibited ferromagnetism. In addition, we fabricated samples by bridging between electrodes with the VO$_2$ nanoparticles, and the temperature dependence of their resistance was measured. Metal-insulator transitions (MITs) were observed, and the temperature range where the MIT occurred was wider than that in a typical bulk VO$_2$. The VO$_2$ nanoparticles exhibited these properties of ferromagnetism and MIT possibly because of the surface and size effects of the VO$_2$ nanoparticles. These results indicate the first observation of the competitive coexistence of ferromagnetism and MIT of VO$_2$ nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Adsorption of Gases on Ti3C2Tx MXene: Implications from X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most explored MXenes is the Ti3C2Tx, where Tx is designated to inherently formed termination species. Among many applications, Ti3C2Tx is an excellent material for energy storage, energy converting, and CO2-capturing devices. However, active sites for adsorption and surface reactions on the Ti3C2Tx-surface are still open questions to explore, which have implications for preparation methods when to obtain correct and optimized surface requirements. Here we use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to study adsorption of common gas molecules such as H2, CO2, and H2O, which all might be present in energy storage, energy converting, and CO2-capturing devices based on 2D flakes of Ti3C2Tx. The study shows that H2O, with a strong bonding to the Ti-Ti bridge-sites, can be considered as a termination species. An H2O terminated Ti3C2Tx-surface restricts the CO2 adsorption to the Ti on-top sites and reduces the ability to store positive ions, such as Li+ and Na+. On the other hand, an H2O terminated Ti3C2Tx-surface shows the capability to split water. The study further shows that H2 has the ability to remove F at moderate temperatures. The results from this study have implications for correct selection of MXene preparations and the environment around the MXene in different implementations.</description>

      <title>Significantly Enhanced Vacancy Diffusion in Mn-containing Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating point defects for tailored macroscopic properties remains a formidable challenge in materials science. This study demonstrates a proof-of-principle for a universal law involving element Mn, significantly enhancing vacancy diffusion through an unprecedented anomalous Friedel Oscillations phenomenon, across most metals in the periodic table. The correlation between Mn-induced point-defect dynamic changes and intrinsic macro-properties is robustly validated through the first-principles theory and well-designed experiments. The physical origin stems from Mn's exceptionally large effective intra-elemental 3d electron interactions, surpassing the Coulomb attraction induced by vacancy and disrupting the electron screening effect. Given the ubiquitous nature of vacancies and their recognition as the most crucial defects influencing nearly all physical and mechanical properties of crystalline materials, this outcome may drive advances in a broad domain.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of noncentrosymmetric B20 compound HfSn and tuning of multifold band-crossing points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed theoretical study of the electronic structure of hafnium tin HfSn crystallizing in a B$20$ structure, renowned for the diversity of physical and peculiar topological properties. The chiral crystal structure of these materials protects multifold band crossings located at high symmetry points. We employ density functional methods to reveal basic features of the band structure and Fermi surface topology of HfSn, on top of which an effective tight-binding model is built. The compound exhibits a fourfold band crossing pinned at the ${\Gamma}$ point. We investigate routes that can shift such crossings towards the Fermi level, offering a unique way to possibly tune the compound`s properties. Specifically, we show that the energy position of the fourfold crossing can be easily manipulated via external perturbations such as strain and pressure. Considering that this point carries a topological charge larger than one, such tuning is of great importance. We anticipate that the approach presented in the current study can be utilized to investigate symmetry protected crossings in a wide class of materials.</description>

      <title>Material design optimization for large-m 11B4C-based Ni/Ti supermirror neutron optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art Ni/Ti supermirror neutron optics have limited reflected intensity and a restricted neutron energy range due to the interface width. Incorporating low-neutron-absorbing 11B4C enhances reflectivity and allows for thinner layers to be deposited, with which more efficient supermirrors with higher m-values can be realized. However, incorporating 11B4C reduces the optical contrast, limiting the attainable reflectivity at low scattering vectors, making this approach infeasible. This study explores various approaches to optimize the material design of 11B4C-containing Ni/Ti supermirrors to maintain high reflectivity at low scattering vectors and achieve low interface widths at large scattering vectors. The scattering length density contrast versus interface width is investigated for multilayer periods of 30 {\AA}, 48 {\AA}, and 84 {\AA}, for designs involving pure Ni/Ti multilayers, multilayers with 11B4C co-deposited in Ni and Ti layers, multilayers with 11B4C co-deposited only in Ni layers, and multilayers with 11B4C as thin interlayers between Ni and Ti layers. Our results suggest that a depth-graded hybrid material design by incorporating 11B4C inside the Ni and Ti layers, below approximately 26 {\AA}, and introducing 1.5 {\AA} 11B4C interlayers between the thicker Ni and Ti layers can achieve a higher reflectivity than state-of-the-art Ni/Ti multilayers over the entire scattering vector range.</description>

      <title>Peculiar magnetism and magneto-transport properties in a non-centrosymmetric self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet Cr5Te8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trigonal Cr5Te8, a self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet with an out of plane magnetic anisotropy, has long been known to crystallise in a centrosymmetric structure. Through detailed structural analysis together with second harmonic generation experiments, we show that the compound actually adopts a non-centrosymmetric structure. A large anomalous Hall conductivity of 102 {\Omega}^(-1) cm^(-1) at low temperature stems from intrinsic origin, which is larger than any previously reported values in bulk Cr-Te system. In addition, we observe a hump-like feature in the field-dependent Hall resistivity data, resembling a typical topological Hall signal. We demonstrate that the feature is highly tunable and is not related to topological Hall effect even though we observe N\'eel-type skyrmions by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy which is consistent with the non-centrosymmetric structure of the compound.</description>

      <title>Towards tailored magnetic anisotropy: A first-principles study of L1$_0$ FeNi ultrathin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous experiments, thin films of L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi with different surfaces, including (001), (110) and (111), were produced and studied. Each surface defines a different alignment of the crystallographic tetragonal axis with respect to the film's plane, resulting in different magnetic anisotropies. In this study, we use density functional theory calculations to examine three series of L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with surfaces (001), (010), and (111), and with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 3 nm (from 4 to 16 atomic monolayers). Our results show that films (001) have perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, while (010) favor in-plane magnetization, with a clear preference for the tetragonal axis [001]. We propose calling this type of in-plane anisotropy fixed in plane. A film with surface (111) and a thickness of four atomic monolayers has the magnetization easy axis almost perpendicular to the plane of the film. As the thickness of the (111) film increases, the direction of magnetization rotates towards a tetragonal axis [001], positioned at an angle of about 45$^{o}$ to the plane of the film. Furthermore, the magnetic moment of ultrathin films increases by a maximum of 5%, and the most significant changes in spin and orbital magnetic moments occur at a depth of about three near-surface atomic monolayers. The presented results could be useful for experimental efforts to synthesize ultrathin L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with different surfaces. Ultrathin L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with varying magnetic anisotropies may find applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Materials for High Temperature Digital Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon microelectronics, consisting of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, have changed nearly all aspects of human life from communication to transportation, entertainment, and healthcare. Despite the widespread and mainstream use, current silicon-based devices suffer significant reliability issues at temperatures exceeding 125 {\deg}C. The emergent technological frontiers of space exploration, geothermal energy harvesting, nuclear energy, unmanned avionic systems, and autonomous driving will rely on control systems, sensors, and communication devices which operate at temperatures as high as 500 {\deg}C and beyond. At these extreme temperatures, active (heat exchanger, phase change cooling) or passive (fins and thermal interface materials) cooling strategies add significant mass and complication which is often infeasible. Thus, new material solutions beyond conventional silicon CMOS devices are necessary for high temperature, resilient electronic systems. Accomplishing this will require a united effort to explore development, integration, and ultimately manufacturing of non-silicon-based logic and memory technologies, non-traditional metals for interconnects, and ceramic packaging technology.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent optical and magneto-optical spectra of ferromagnetic BCC Fe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical and magneto-optical properties of magnetic materials have been widely exploited to characterize magnetic structures and phenomena, however, their temperature dependence is not well understood. This study implements the supercell approach with thermal lattice and magnetic disorders to obtain optical and magneto-optical spectra at finite temperatures based on Williams-Lax theory. Our results show that large optical spectrum signals are generated at photon energies below 1 eV, originating from the phonon- and magnon-assisted intraband transitions as lattice and magnetic temperatures increase. In addition, the prominent peak near 2.7 eV is redshifted proportionally to magnetic temperature but depends much less on lattice temperature. By analyzing unfolded bands, we show that the reduction of exchange splitting due to the thermal demagnetization causes this redshift. Our unfolded electronic band structure with magnetic disorder shows band kinks, which are characteristic evidence of the coupling between electrons and magnetic excitations. First-order magneto-optical spectra at finite temperature are also predicted, but due to their small magnitude suffer more from sampling errors. We discuss the effect of zero-point vibrations and the connection of these simulations to the Drude model for intraband transitions.</description>

      <title>The influence of substantial intragranular orientation gradients on the micromechanical response of heavily-worked material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the role of relatively large amounts of intragranular lattice misorientation - present after many thermomechanical processes - through three-dimensional (3D) micromechanical simulations of forged Al-7085 with a modified T7452 temper. We utilize near-field high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy (HEDM) to measure 3D spatial orientation fields, and employ a novel reconstruction method that utilizes grain orientation envelopes measured using far-field HEDM to enable reconstruction of grains with intragranular orientation spreads &gt;10{\deg}. We construct two primary virtual polycrystalline specimens for use in crystal plasticity simulations to assess the effect of appreciable intragranular misorientation on the predicted deformation response: the first a faithful representation of the HEDM reconstruction, the second a microstructure with no intragranular misorientation (i.e., grain-averaged orientations). We find significant differences in the predicted deformation mechanism activation, distribution of stress, and distribution of plastic strain between simulations containing intragranular misorientation and those with homogenized orientations. The influence of elastic anisotropy is discussed, along with the effects of intragranular misorientation on fatigue life through the calculation and analysis of fatigue indicator parameters.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Mn $L_3$-edge RIXS spectrum of lightly manganese doped Sr$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) experiment was performed at the Mn $L_3$ edge. A 10 $\%$ Mn-doped Sr$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$ compound, where the Mn$^{3+}$ ions are in the 3$d^4$ state, were probed for $dd$ excitations. The dilute doping concentration allows one to treat the dopant Mn$^{3+}$ ions as effectively free in the host ruthenium compound. The local nature of $dd$ RIXS spectroscopy permits one to use a single-site model to simulate the experimental spectra. The simulated spectra reproduces the in-plane [100] experimental RIXS spectrum. We also predict the intensity for the in-plane [110] direction and the out-of-plane spin orientation configuration [001]. Based on our single-ion model we were able to fit the experimental data to obtain the crystal field parameters, the 10Dq value, and the intra-orbital spin-flip energy 2$\mathcal{J}$(or $3J_{H}$, where $J_{H}$ is the Hund's energy) of the Mn$^{3+}$ ion. Utilizing our computed RIXS quantum transition amplitudes between the various $d$ orbitals of the Mn$^{3+}$ ion, the expression for the Kramers-Heisenberg cross section, and a self-consistent fitting procedure we also identify the energy boundaries of the non-spin-flip and spin-flip $dd$ excitations present in the experimental data. From our fitting procedure we obtain $2\mathcal{J} (3J_{H})=2.06$ eV, a value which is in excellent agreement with that computed from the free ion Racah parameters. We also identified the charge transfer boundary. In addition to predicting the microscopic parameters, we find a quantum spin-flip transition in the non-cross ($\sigma_{in}-\sigma_{out}$, $\pi_{in}-\pi_{out}$) x-ray polarization channels of the $dd$ RIXS spectra. A similar transition, was previously predicted to occur in the $\pi-\pi$ channel of the magnon spectrum in the non-collinear non-coplanar Kagome compound composed of Cu$^{2+}$ 3d$^{9}$ ion.</description>

      <title>Damping Reveals Hidden Dimensions in Elastic Metastructures Through Induced Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Damping typically results in attenuation of vibrations and elastic wave propagation in mechanical systems. Contrary to this conventional understanding, we demonstrate experimentally and explain theoretically the revival of an elastic wave transmitted through a periodic metastructure when a weak non-Hermitian defect (damping mechanism) induces violation of time-reversal symmetry. Damping alters the nature of the system's resonant modes, instigating interference in the scattering field. This leads to transmission revival, revealing the presence of hidden modes which are otherwise masked by the symmetry. Our findings offer an innovative approach for designing dissipation-driven switches and controllers and non-destructive structural health monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Remote-contact catalysis for target-diameter semiconducting carbon nanotube array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrostatic catalysis has been an exciting development in chemical synthesis (beyond enzymes catalysis) in recent years, boosting reaction rates and selectively producing certain reaction products. Most of the studies to date have been focused on using external electric field (EEF) to rearrange the charge distribution in small molecule reactions such as Diels-Alder addition, carbene reaction, etc. However, in order for these EEFs to be effective, a field on the order of 1 V/nm (10 MV/cm) is required, and the direction of the EEF has to be aligned with the reaction axis. Such a large and oriented EEF will be challenging for large-scale implementation, or materials growth with multiple reaction axis or steps. Here, we demonstrate that the energy band at the tip of an individual single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) can be spontaneously shifted in a high-permittivity growth environment, with its other end in contact with a low-work function electrode (e.g., hafnium carbide or titanium carbide). By adjusting the Fermi level at a point where there is a substantial disparity in the density of states (DOS) between semiconducting (s-) and metallic (m-) SWCNTs, we achieve effective electrostatic catalysis for s-SWCNT growth assisted by a weak EEF perturbation (200V/cm). This approach enables the production of high-purity (99.92%) s-SWCNT horizontal arrays with narrow diameter distribution (0.95+-0.04 nm), targeting the requirement of advanced SWCNT-based electronics for future computing. These findings highlight the potential of electrostatic catalysis in precise materials growth, especially for s-SWCNTs, and pave the way for the development of advanced SWCNT-based electronics.</description>

      <title>Electronic ferroelectricity in monolayer graphene for multifunctional neuromorphic electronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectricity is intriguing for its spontaneous electric polarization, which is switchable by an external electric field. Expanding ferroelectric materials to two-dimensional limit will provide versatile applications for the development of next-generation nonvolatile devices. Conventional ferroelectricity requires the materials consisting of at least two constituent elements associated with polar crystalline structures. Monolayer graphene as an elementary two-dimensional material unlikely exhibits ferroelectric order due to its highly centrosymmetric hexagonal lattices. Nevertheless, two-dimensional moire superlattices offer a powerful way to engineer diverse electronic orders in non-polar materials. Here, we report the observations of electronic ferroelectricity in monolayer graphene by introducing asymmetric moire superlattice at the graphene/h-BN interface. Utilizing Hall measurements, the electric polarization is identified to stem from electron-hole dipoles, suggesting the electronic dynamics of the observed ferroelectricity. Standard polarization-electric field hysteresis loops, as well as unconventional multiple switchable polarization states, have been achieved. By in-situ comparing with control devices, we found that the electronic ferroelectricity in graphene moire systems is independent of layer number of graphene and the corresponding fine band structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applications of this ferroelectric moire structures in multi-state non-volatile data storage and the emulation of versatile synaptic behaviors, including short-term plasticity, long-term potentiation and long-term depression. This work not only enriches the fundamental understanding of ferroelectricity, but also demonstrates the promising applications of graphene in multi-state memories and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Size dependent photoemission study by electrochemical coarsening of nanoporous gold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation and utilization of hot charge carriers in plasmonic materials have emerged as a topic of significant importance, with profound implications across multiple disciplines, including optoelectronics, photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and sensing. In this study, we investigate the hot electron transfer from nanoporous gold (npAu) in dependence of the structure size, utilizing both the nanoscale feature size and the interconnected nature of this material. We employ photoelectron injection from nanoporous gold into the electrolyte under UV illumination as a test electron transfer process. Nanoporous gold thin films with sub-10 nm initial ligament diameter are stepwise coarsened by potential cycles in a photoelectrochemical setup, thereby allowing us to precisely probe the influence of ligament diameter on the photocurrent response. The resulting ligament diameter variations are confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. As the ligament diameter increased from 8 to 16 nm, there was a corresponding decrease in quantum efficiency proportional to the inverse ligament diameter squared. Such dependency is expected for electrons excited by surface collisions. For the small ligament diameter of 10 nm we estimate an emission efficiency of excited 6sp electrons as 3.14%, reaching 23% for the surface excited electrons.</description>

      <title>Electronic transport, metal-insulator transition, and Wigner crystallization in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two recent electronic transport experiments from Columbia University and Harvard University have reported record high mobility and low channel densities in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) WSe$_2$ monolayers [J. Pack, et al., arXiv:2310.19782; A. Y. Joe, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 056303 (2024)]. A two-dimensional (2D) metal-insulator transition (MIT) is demonstrated in the Columbia sample at low densities, a regime where the formation of a Wigner crystal (WC) is theoretically anticipated in the absence of disorder. We employ the finite-temperature Boltzmann theory to understand the low-temperature transport properties of monolayer TMDs, taking into account realistic disorder scattering. We analyze the experimental results, focusing on the 2D MIT behavior and the influence of temperature and density on mobility and resistivity in the metallic phase. We provide a discussion of the nontrivial carrier density dependence of our transport results. Our analysis elucidates the linear-in-$T$ resistivity in the metallic phase, attributing it to Friedel oscillations associated with screened charged impurities. Furthermore, we explore whether Coulomb disorder could lead to the MIT through either a quantum Anderson localization transition or a classical percolation transition. Our theoretical estimates of the disorder-induced MIT critical densities, although smaller, are within a factor of ~2 of the experimental critical density. We examine the exceptionally high melting temperature ~10 K of WCs observed experimentally in the MoSe$_2$ systems at low density, an order of magnitude larger than the pristine melting temperature. This suggests that the observed 2D low-density MIT behavior is likely a result of the complex interplay between disorder effects and interaction-driven WC physics, offering a comprehensive understanding of the low-temperature transport phenomena in TMD monolayers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Residual stress and plastic strain in additive manufactured materials can exhibit significant microscopic variation at the powder scale, profoundly influencing the overall properties of printed components. This variation depends on processing parameters and stems from multiple factors, including differences in powder bed morphology, non-uniform thermo-structural profiles, and inter-layer fusion. In this research, we propose a powder-resolved multilayer multiphysics simulation scheme tailored for porous materials through the process of selective laser sintering. This approach seamlessly integrates finite element method (FEM)-based non-isothermal phase-field simulation with thermo-elasto-plastic simulation, incorporating temperature- and phase-dependent material properties. The outcome of this investigation includes a detailed depiction of the mesoscopic evolution of stress and plastic strain within a transient thermo-microstructure, evaluated across a spectrum of beam power and scan speed parameters. Simulation results further reveal the underlying mechanisms. For instance, stress concentration primarily occurs at the necking region of partially melted particles and the junctions between different layers, resulting in the accumulation of plastic strain and residual stress, ultimately leading to structural distortion in the materials. Based on the simulation data, phenomenological relation regarding porosity/densification control by the beam energy input was examined along with the comparison to experimental results. Regression models were also proposed to describe the dependency of the residual stress and the plastic strain on the beam energy input.</description>

Abstract: We compute the ab-initio electron density beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in crystalline LiH and LiD with density functional methods. We report significant beyond Born-Oppenheimer corrections to electron density in the vicinity of nuclei equilibrium positions. We thus verify the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, as earlier suggested on experimental grounds. A reasonable agreement between the experimental and computational results is found. The results indicate the existence of beyond Born-Oppenheimer effects in solids at normal pressures and suggest that these effects can be significant also in solids containing elements other than hydrogen as well.</description>

      <title>Tuning intrinsic anomalous Hall effect from large to zero in two ferromagnetic states of SmMn2Ge2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in a ferromagnetic metal is completely determined by its band structure. Since the spin orientation direction is an important band structure tuning parameter, it is highly desirable to study the anomalous Hall effect in a system with multiple spin reorientation transitions. We study a layered tetragonal room temperature ferromagnet SmMn2Ge2, which gives us the opportunity to measure magneto-transport properties where the long c-axis and the short a-axis can both be magnetically easy axes depending on the temperature range we choose. We show a moderately large fully intrinsic AHC up to room temperature when the crystal is magnetized along the c-axis. Interestingly, the AHC can be tuned to completely extrinsic with extremely large values when the crystal is magnetized along the a-axis, regardless of whether the a-axis is magnetically easy or hard axis. First principles calculations show that nodal line states originate from Mn-d orbitals just below the Fermi energy (EF) in the electronic band structure when the spins are oriented along the c-axis. Intrinsic AHC originates from the Berry curvature effect of the gapped nodal lines in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. AHC almost disappears when the spins are aligned along the a-axis because the nodal line states shift above EF and become unoccupied states. Since the AHC can be changed from fully extrinsic to intrinsic even at 300 K, SmMn2Ge2 becomes a potential candidate for room temperature spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Electron-Phonon Coupling using Many-Body Perturbation Theory: Implementation in the Questaal Electronic Structure Suite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to calculate the electron-phonon coupling (e-ph) from first principles is of tremendous interest in materials science, as it provides a non-empirical approach to understand and predict a wide range of phenomena. While this has largely been accomplished in the Kohn-Sham framework of density functional theory (KS-DFT), it is becoming more apparent that standard approximations in KS-DFT can be inaccurate. These discrepancies are often attributed to a non-local potential where more advanced approaches to DFT or many-body perturbation theory have been used. However, a highly reliable and efficient first-principles approach to compute these quantities is still missing. With the goal of realizing a high-fidelity description of e-ph, we present a new field-theoretical methodology, incorporating the seminal work of Baym and Hedin within the quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QSGW) approximation, and the Questaal electronic structure package.</description>

Abstract: A new microscopic formula for the viscosity of liquids and solids is derived rigorously from a first-principles (microscopically reversible) Hamiltonian for particle-bath atomistic motion. The derivation is done within the framework of nonaffine linear response theory. The new formula may lead to a valid alternative to the Green-Kubo approach to describe the viscosity of condensed matter systems from molecular simulations without having to fit long-time tails. Furthermore, it provides a direct link between the viscosity, the vibrational density of states of the system, and the zero-frequency limit of the memory kernel.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic amplification of the pull-off stress in the detachment of a rigid flat punch from an adhesive soft viscoelastic layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of the detachment of a sufficiently large flat indenter from a plane adhesive viscoelastic strip of thickness "b" is studied. For any given retraction speed, three different detachment regimes are found: (i) for very small "b" the detachment stress is constant and equal to the theoretical strength of the interface, (ii) for intermediate values of "b" the detachment stress decays approximately as b^(-1/2), (iii) for thick layers a constant detachment stress is obtained corresponding to case the punch is detaching from a halfplane. By using the boundary element method a comprehensive numerical study is performed which assumes a linear viscoelastic material with a single relaxation time and a Lennard-Jones force-separation law. Pull-off stress is found to consistently and monotonically increase with unloading rate, but to be almost insensitive to the history of the contact. Due to viscoelasticity, unloading at high enough retraction velocity may allow punches of macroscopic size to reach the theoretical strength of the interface. Finally, a corrective term in Greenwood or Persson theories considering finite size effects is proposed. Theoretical and numerical results are found in very good agreement.</description>

Abstract: The crystal structures of ANb$_3$Br$_7$S (A = Rb and Cs) have been refined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, and are found to form highly anisotropic materials based on chains of the triangular Nb$_3$ cluster core. The Nb$_3$ cluster core contains seven valence electrons, six of them being assigned to Nb-Nb bonds within the Nb$_3$ triangle and one unpaired d electron. The presence of this surplus electron gives rise to the formation of correlated electronic states. The connectivity in the structures is represented by one-dimensional [Nb$_3$Br$_7$S]$^-$ chains, containing a sulphur atom capping one face ($\mu_3$) of the triangular niobium cluster, which is believed to induce an important electronic feature. Several types of studies are undertaken to obtain deeper insight into the understanding of this unusual type of material: the crystal structure, morphology and elastic properties are analysed, as well the (photo-) electrical properties and NMR relaxation. Electronic structure (DFT) calculations are performed in order to understand the electronic structure and transport in these compounds, and, based on the experimental and theoretical results, we propose that the electronic interactions along the Nb chains are sufficiently one-dimensional to give rise to Luttinger liquid (rather than Fermi liquid) behaviour of the metallic electrons.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic magnons on a M\"obius strip: topology-induced symmetry breaking</title>

Abstract: A M\"obius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains showcase exotic magnon excitations with non-trivial physical behavior, which is solely attributed to the real-space boundary condition even in the absence of local curvature effects. Counterintuitively, magnons on a M\"obius strip feature linear polarization of the N\'eel vector devoid of chirality even when the spin Hamiltonian preserves local rotational symmetry around the anisotropic easy axis. These linearly-polarized magnons form two non-degenerate branches that can neither be smoothly connected to nor be decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons of opposite chirality commonly found in antiferromagnets. Only one branch supports standing-wave formation on the M\"obius strip while the other does not, owing to its spectral shift incurred by the boundary condition. By unraveling a hitherto unknown mechanism of topology-induced symmetry breaking, our findings highlight the profound impact of real-space topology on the physical nature of not only magnons but also other bosonic quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of transient finite-strain coupled diffusion-deformation theories for hydrogels</title>

Abstract: This work presents a comparative review and classification between some well-known thermodynamically consistent models of hydrogel behavior in a large deformation setting, specifically focusing on solvent absorption/desorption and its impact on mechanical deformation and network swelling. The proposed discussion addresses formulation aspects, general mathematical classification of the governing equations, and numerical implementation issues based on the finite element method. The theories are presented in a unified framework demonstrating that, despite not being evident in some cases, all of them follow equivalent thermodynamic arguments. A detailed numerical analysis is carried out where Taylor-Hood elements are employed in the spatial discretization to satisfy the inf-sup condition and to prevent spurious numerical oscillations. The resulting discrete problems are solved using the FEniCS platform through consistent variational formulations, employing both monolithic and staggered approaches. We conduct benchmark tests on various hydrogel structures, demonstrating that major differences arise from the chosen volumetric response of the hydrogel. The significance of this choice is frequently underestimated in the state-of-the-art literature but has been shown to have substantial implications on the resulting hydrogel behavior.</description>

      <title>A generalized approach for rapid entropy calculation of liquids and solids</title>

Abstract: We build a comprehensive methodology for the fast computation of entropy across both solid and liquid phases. The proposed method utilizes a single trajectory of molecular dynamics (MD) to facilitate the calculation of entropy, which is composed of three components. The electronic entropy is determined through the temporal average acquired from density functional theory (DFT) MD simulations. The vibrational entropy, typically the predominant contributor to the total entropy, even within the liquid state, is evaluated by computing the phonon density of states via the velocity auto-correlation function. The most arduous component to quantify, the configurational entropy, is assessed by probability analysis of the local structural arrangement and atomic distribution. We illustrate, through a variety of examples, that this method is both a versatile and valid technique for characterizing the thermodynamic states of both solids and liquids. Furthermore, this method is employed to expedite the calculation of melting temperatures, demonstrating its practical utility in computational thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Chiral Spin Textures Driven by Emergent Spin-Orbit Interaction: A Numerical Study</title>

Abstract: We explore numerically the intricate interplay between Berry phases in both real and momentum spaces within itinerant magnets. This interplay manifests as an emergent spin-orbit coupling, where charge carriers occupying a Berry-curved band generate an orbital magnetization, inducing a pseudo-magnetic field originating in chiral spin textures. Using density-matrix-renormalization-group techniques, we demonstrate that switching on a band Berry curvature in a metallic ferromagnetic phase results in chiral magnetic textures. Furthermore, employing a two-leg strip geometry, we establish a connection between charge and spin chirality, further supporting this emergent spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Bacterial cell death: Atomistic simulations reveal pore formation as a mode of action of structurally nano engineered star peptide polymers</title>

Abstract: Multidrug resistance (MDR) to conventional antibiotics is one of the most urgent global health threats, necessitating the development of effective and biocompatible antimicrobial agents that are less inclined to provoke resistance. Structurally Nanoengineered Antimicrobial Peptide Polymers (SNAPPs) are a novel and promising class of such alternatives. These star-shaped polymers are made of a dendritic core with multiple arms made of co-peptides with varying amino acid sequences. Through a comprehensive set of in vivo experiments, we (Nature Microbiology, 1, 16162, 2016) showed that SNAPPs with arms made of random blocks of lysine (K) and valine (V) residues exhibit sub-micron M efficacy against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria tested. Cryo-TEM images suggested pore formation by SNAPP with random block co-peptide arms as one of their mode of actions. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this mode of action of SNAPP were not fully understood. To address this gap, we employed atomistic molecular dynamics simulation technique to investigate the influence of three different sequences of amino acids, namely 1) alternating block KKV 2) random block and 3) di-block motifs on secondary structure of their arms and SNAPP's overall configuration as well as their interactions with lipid bilayer. We, for the first time identified a step-by-step mechanism through which alternating block and random SNAPPs interact with lipid bilayer and leads to pore formation, hence cell death. These insights provide a strong foundation for further optimization of the chemical structure of SNAPPs for maximum performance against MDR bacteria, therefore offering a promising avenue for addressing antibiotic resistance and development of effective antibacterial agents.</description>
