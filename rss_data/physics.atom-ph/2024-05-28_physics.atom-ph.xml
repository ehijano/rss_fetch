      <title>Chip-Scale Point-Source Sagnac Interferometer by Phase-Space Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry is essential to both science and technology. Phase-space squeezing has been shown to be an advantageous source of atoms, whereby the spread in momentum is decreased. Here, we show that the opposite squeezing may be just as advantageous. As a case in point, we analyze the effect of such a source on point source atom interferometry (PSI), which enables rotation sensing. We describe how a squeezed PSI (SPSI) increases the sensitivity and dynamic range while facilitating short cycle times and high repetition rates. We present regions in parameter space for which the figures of merit are improved by orders of magnitude and show that under some definition of compactness, the SPSI is superior by more than four orders of magnitude. The SPSI thus enables either enhancing the performance for standard size devices or maintaining the performance while miniaturizing to a chip-scale device, opening the door to real-life applications.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation in weakly-driven arrays of multilevel atoms via dipolar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the driven-dissipative dynamics of 1D and 2D arrays of multilevel atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions and trapped at subwavelength scales. Here we show that in the weakly driven low excitation regime, multilevel atoms, in contrast to two-level atoms, can become strongly entangled. The entanglement manifests as the growth of collective spin-waves in the ground state manifold, and survives even after turning off the drive. We propose to use the $\sim 2.9~\mu$m transition between $\rm ^3{\rm P}_2 \leftrightarrow \, ^3{\rm D}_3$ in $\rm ^{88}Sr$ with $\rm 389~nm$ trapping light as an ideal experimental platform for validating our predictions and as a novel quantum interface for the exploration of complex many-body phenomena emerging from light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Generation and robustness of non-local correlations induced by Heisenberg XYZ and intrinsic decoherence models: (x,y)-spin-orbit interactions and $x$- magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the Milburn intrinsic decoherence model is used to investigate the role of spin-spin Heisenberg XYZ interaction supported by spin-orbit Dzyaloshinsky Moriya (DM) interactions of x and y directions together in the non-local correlation (NLC) dynamics of Local quantum Fisher information (LQFI), local quantum uncertainty (LQU), and Log-negativity's entanglement. The two-qubit Heisenberg XYZ (non-X) states' nonlocal correlation generations are explored under the effects of the uniformity and the inhomogeneity of an applied x-direction external inhomogeneous magnetic field (EIMF). Our meticulous exploration of the obtained results shows that the spin-spin Heisenberg XYZ and x,y-spin-orbit interactions have a high capability to raise non-local correlations in the presence of a weak external magnetic field. The raised non-local correlation can be improved by strengthening the spin-spin and x,y spin-orbit interactions and increasing the EIMF's inhomogeneity and uniformity. Non-local correlation oscillations' amplitudes and fluctuations are increased. The degradations of the NLCs' generations in the presence of intrinsic decoherence (NLCs' robustness against intrinsic decoherence) can be decreased by strengthening the spin-spin interactions. They can be increased by increasing the intensities of x,y spin-orbit interactions as well as increasing the EIMF's inhomogeneity and uniformity.</description>

      <title>Understanding inner-shell excitations in molecules through spectroscopy of the 4f hole states of YbF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecules containing a lanthanide atom have sets of electronic states arising from excitation of an inner-shell electron. These states have received little attention, but are thought to play an important role in laser cooling of such molecules and may be a useful resource for testing fundamental physics. We study a series of inner-shell excited states in YbF using resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionisation spectroscopy. We investigate the excited states of lowest energy, 8474, 9013 and 9090 cm$^{-1}$ above the ground state, all corresponding to the configuration 4f$^{13}$6s$^{2}$ ${}^{2}F_{7/2}$ of the Yb$^+$ ion. They are metastable, since they have no electric dipole allowed transitions to the ground state. We also characterize a state at 31050 cm$^{-1}$ that is easily excited from both the ground and metastable states, which makes it especially useful for this spectroscopic study. Finally, we study a state at 48729 cm$^{-1}$, which is above the ionization limit and features strong auto-ionizing resonances that prove useful for efficient detection of the molecules and for identifying the rotational quantum number of each line in the spectrum. We resolve the rotational structures of all these states and find that they can all be described by a very simple model based on Hund's case (c). Our study provides information necessary for laser slowing and magneto-optical trapping of YbF, which is an important species for testing fundamental physics. We also consider whether the low-lying inner-shell states may themselves be useful as probes of the electron's electric dipole moment or of varying fundamental constants, since they are long-lived states in a laser-coolable molecule featuring closely-spaced levels of opposite parity.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamic derivation of the energy resolution limit in magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently demonstrated that a large number of magnetic sensing technologies satisfy the energy resolution limit, which connects a quantity composed by the variance of the magnetic field estimate, the sensor volume and the measurement time, and having units of action, with $\hbar$. A first-principles derivation of the energy resolution limit is still elusive. We here present such a derivation based on quantum thermodynamic arguments. We show that the energy resolution limit is a result of quantum thermodynamic work associated with quantum measurement and Landauer erasure, the work being exchanged with the magnetic field. We apply these considerations to atomic magnetometers and SQUIDS. Regarding the former, we unravel a new spin correlation effect relevant to the magnetic noise produced by atomic vapors.</description>
