      <title>Ab initio study of the beryllium isotopes $^{7}$Be to $^{12}$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic \textit{ab initio} study of the low-lying states in beryllium isotopes from $^7\text{Be}$ to $^{12}\text{Be}$ using nuclear lattice effective field theory with the N$^3$LO interaction. Our calculations achieve excellent agreement with experimental data for energies, radii, and electromagnetic properties. We introduce a novel, model-independent method to quantify nuclear shapes, uncovering a distinct pattern in the interplay between positive and negative parity states across the isotopic chain. Our geometrical analysis reveals prominent two-center cluster structures, the emergence of one-neutron halo, and complex nuclear molecular dynamics, underscoring the strong clustering features inherent to beryllium isotopes.</description>

      <title>Study of collective phenomena via the production of heavy quarks and quarkonia in hadronic collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open heavy flavor and quarkonia have long been identified as ideal probes for understanding the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Heavy quarks are produced in the early stage of the heavy-ion collisions. Therefore they experience the evolution of the medium produced, providing an important tool to investigate the properties of the QGP. In particular, the magnitude of the elliptic flow measured at the LHC is interpreted as a signature of the charm-quark thermalization in the QGP. This is reflected in the azimuthal anisotropies of the final particles. In addition, the observation of collective-like effects in high-multiplicity pp and p--Pb collisions provides new insights on the evolution of QGP-related observables going from large to small collision systems. A better understanding of heavy-quark energy loss, quarkonium dissociation, and production mechanism can therefore be obtained with those system-size dependent observables. We present recent results of the $\mathrm{J}/\psi $ and open heavy-flavor hadrons flow in pp, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb collisions carried out by the ALICE collaboration.</description>

      <title>A Kalman Filter for track reconstruction in very large time projection chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a Kalman Filter tailored for homogeneous gas Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), adapted from the algorithm utilized by the ALICE experiment. In order to describe semi-circular paths in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field, we introduce a novel mirror rotation technique into the Kalman Filter algorithm, enabling effective tracking of trajectories of varying lengths, including those with multiple circular paths within the detector, also known as "loopers". Demonstrated relative improvements of up to 80% in electron momentum resolution and up to 50% in muon and pion momentum resolution underscore the significance of this enhancement. Significant improvements in the reconstruction efficiency for relatively short low momentum "looper" tracks are also shown. Such advancements hold promise not only for the future of the ALICE TPC but also for neutrino high-pressure gas TPCs, where loopers become significant owing to the randomness of production points and their relatively low energies in neutrino interactions. In particular, an improvement in low energy electron reconstruction, for which the production of "looping" tracks is likely and the impact of the new algorithm is directly demonstrated, could significantly impact the quality of flux determination, which in accelerator neutrino experiments relies on the measurement of $\nu_e$ electron scatterings.</description>

      <title>Systematic shell-model analysis of $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge and $^{96}$Zr to the ground and excited states of $^{76}$Se and $^{96}$Mo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge and $^{96}$Zr isotopes utilizing large-scale shell-model calculations. The GWBXG effective interaction has been employed in the calculation of $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay nuclear matrix elements (NMEs). We have tested the effective interaction by comparing the predicted spectroscopic properties, such as energy spectra and transition probabilities, with the available experimental data. The variation of cumulative NMEs with respect to the $1^+$ state energies of the intermediate nucleus is also studied, corresponding to $0^+_{\rm g.s.}\rightarrow0^+_{\rm g.s.}$, $0^+_{\rm g.s.}\rightarrow0^+_{2}$, and $0^+_{\rm g.s.}\rightarrow2^+_{1}$ transitions between the parent and grand-daughter nuclei. The effective values of axial-vector coupling strength ($g_A^{\rm eff}$) are calculated using the predicted NMEs and experimental half-lives for $0^+_{\rm g.s.}\rightarrow0^+_{\rm g.s.}$ transitions. The extracted half-lives for $0^+_{\rm g.s.}\rightarrow0^+_{2}$, and $0^+_{\rm g.s.}\rightarrow2^+_{1}$ transitions using the shell-model predicted NMEs are consistent with the recent experimental data. The comparison of the shell-model predicted NMEs with previous NMEs available in the literature is discussed. Also, the computed branching ratios for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge and both the $2\nu\beta\beta$ and single-$\beta$ decay of $^{96}$Zr are reported corresponding to the calculated $g_A^{\rm eff}$ values.</description>
