      <title>The geometry of online conversations and the causal antecedents of conflictual discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the causal antecedents of conflictual language and the geometry of interaction in online threaded conversations related to climate change. We employ three annotation dimensions, inferred through LLM prompting and averaging, to capture complementary aspects of discursive conflict (such as stance: agreement vs disagreement; tone: attacking vs respectful; and emotional versus factual framing) and use data from a threaded online forum to examine how these dimensions respond to temporal, conversational, and arborescent structural features of discussions. We show that, as suggested by the literature, longer delays between successive posts in a thread are associated with replies that are, on average, more respectful, whereas longer delays relative to the parent post are associated with slightly less disagreement but more emotional (less factual) language. Second, we characterize alignment with the local conversational environment and find strong convergence both toward the average stance, tone and emotional framing of older sibling posts replying to the same parent and toward those of the parent post itself, with parent post effects generally stronger than sibling effects. We further show that early branch-level responses condition these alignment dynamics, such that parent-child stance alignment is amplified or attenuated depending on whether a branch is initiated in agreement or disagreement with the discussion's root message. These influences are largely additive for civility-related dimensions (attacking vs respectful, disagree vs agree), whereas for emotional versus factual framing there is a significant interaction: alignment with the parent's emotionality is amplified when older siblings are similarly aligned.</description>

      <title>SVD Incidence Centrality: A Unified Spectral Framework for Node and Edge Analysis in Directed Networks and Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying influential nodes and edges in directed networks remains a fundamental challenge across domains from social influence to biological regulation. Most existing centrality measures face a critical limitation: they either discard directional information through symmetrization or produce sparse, implementation-dependent rankings that obscure structural importance. We introduce a unified spectral framework for centrality analysis in directed networks grounded in the Singular value decomposition of the incidence matrix. The proposed approach derives both vertex and edge centralities via the pseudoinverse of Hodge Laplacians, yielding dense and well-resolved rankings that overcome the sparsity limitations commonly observed in betweenness centrality for directed graphs. Unlike traditional measures that require graph symmetrization, our framework naturally preserves directional information, enabling principled hub/authority analysis while maintaining mathematical consistency through spectral graph theory. The method extends naturally to hypergraphs through the same mathematical foundation. Experimental validation on real-world networks demonstrates the framework's effectiveness across diverse domains where traditional centrality measures encounter limitations due to implementation dependencies and sparse outputs.</description>

      <title>Social Life of Code: Modeling Evolution through Code Embedding and Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software repositories provide a detailed record of software evolution by capturing developer interactions through code-related activities such as pull requests and modifications. To better understand the underlying dynamics of codebase evolution, we introduce a novel approach that integrates semantic code embeddings with opinion dynamics theory, offering a quantitative framework to analyze collaborative development processes. Our approach begins by encoding code snippets into high-dimensional vector representations using state-of-the-art code embedding models, preserving both syntactic and semantic features. These embeddings are then processed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, with data normalized to ensure comparability. We model temporal evolution using the Expressed-Private Opinion (EPO) model to derive trust matrices and track opinion trajectories across development cycles. These opinion trajectories reflect the underlying dynamics of consensus formation, influence propagation, and evolving alignment (or divergence) within developer communities -- revealing implicit collaboration patterns and knowledge-sharing mechanisms that are otherwise difficult to observe. By bridging software engineering and computational social science, our method provides a principled way to quantify software evolution, offering new insights into developer influence, consensus formation, and project sustainability. We evaluate our approach on data from three prominent open-source GitHub repositories, demonstrating its ability to reveal interpretable behavioral trends and variations in developer interactions. The results highlight the utility of our framework in improving open-source project maintenance through data-driven analysis of collaboration dynamics.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Approaches to Opinion Selection for Online Deliberation: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During deliberation processes, mediators and facilitators typically need to select a small and representative set of opinions later used to produce digestible reports for stakeholders. In online deliberation platforms, algorithmic selection is increasingly used to automate this process. However, such automation is not without consequences. For instance, enforcing consensus-seeking algorithmic strategies can imply ignoring or flattening conflicting preferences, which may lead to erasing minority voices and reducing content diversity. More generally, across the variety of existing selection strategies (e.g., consensus, diversity), it remains unclear how each approach influences desired democratic criteria such as proportional representation. To address this gap, we benchmark several algorithmic approaches in this context. We also build on social choice theory to propose a novel algorithm that incorporates both diversity and a balanced notion of representation in the selection strategy. We find empirically that while no single strategy dominates across all democratic desiderata, our social-choice-inspired selection rule achieves the strongest trade-off between proportional representation and diversity.</description>

      <title>Reranking Social Media Feeds: A Practical Guide for Field Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media plays a central role in shaping public opinion and behavior, yet performing experiments on these platforms and, in particular, on feed algorithms is becoming increasingly challenging. This guide offers practical recommendations for researchers developing and deploying field experiments focused on real-time reranking of social media feeds. The article is organized around two contributions. First, we provide an overview of an experimental method using web browser extensions that intercepts and reranks content in real time, enabling naturalistic reranking field experiments. We then describe feed interventions and measurements that this paradigm enables on participants' actual feeds, without requiring the involvement of social media platforms. Second, we offer concrete technical recommendations for intercepting and reranking social media feeds with minimal user-facing delay, and provide an open-source implementation. This document aims to summarize lessons learned in running field experiments on social media, provide concrete implementation details, and foster the ecosystem of independent social media research. Finally, we release the source code that serves as a blueprint for implementing future feed-ranking experiments.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Social Network Topology in Reddit and Moltbook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in agent-mediated systems have enabled a new paradigm of social network simulation, where AI agents interact with human-like autonomy. This evolution has fostered the emergence of agent-driven social networks such as Moltbook, a Reddit-like platform populated entirely by AI agents. Despite these developments, empirical comparisons between agent-driven and human-driven social networks remain scarce, limiting our understanding of how their network topologies might diverge. This paper presents the first comparative analysis of network topology on Moltbook, utilizing a comment network comprising 33,577 nodes and 697,688 edges. To provide a benchmark, we curated a parallel dataset from Reddit consisting of 7.8 million nodes and 51.8 million edges. We examine key structural differences between agent-drive and human-drive networks, specifically focusing on topological patterns and the edge formation efficacy of their respective posts. Our findings provide a foundational profile of AI-driven social structures, serving as a preliminary step toward developing more robust and authentic agent-mediated social systems.</description>
