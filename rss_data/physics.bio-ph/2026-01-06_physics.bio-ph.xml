      <title>Nanodiamond-Enabled Torsion Microscopy Uncovers Multidimensional Cell-Matrix Mechanical Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional cellular force-sensing techniques, such as traction force microscopy (TFM), are predominantly limited to measuring linear tractions, overlooking and technically unable to capture the nanoscale torsional forces that are critical in cell-matrix interactions. Here, we introduce a nanodiamond-enabled torsion microscopy (DTM) that integrates nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers as orientation markers with micropillar arrays to decouple and quantify nanoscale rotational and translational motions induced by cells. This approach achieves high precision (~1.47 degree rotational accuracy and ~3.13*10-15 Nm torque sensitivity), enabling reconstruction of cellular torsional force fields and twisting energy distributions previously underestimated. Our findings reveal the widespread presence of torsional forces in cell-matrix interactions, introducing "cellular mechanical modes" where different adhesion patterns dictate the balance between traction- and torque- mediated mechanical energy transferred to the substrate. Notably, in immune cells like macrophages that generally exert low linear tractions, torque overwhelmingly dominates traction, highlighting a unique mechanical output for specific cellular functions. By uncovering these differential modes, DTM provides a versatile tool to advance biomechanical investigations, with potential applications in disease diagnostics and therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunnelling-integrated optoplasmonic nanotrap enables conductance visualisation of individual proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological electron transfer (ET) relies on quantum mechanical tunnelling through a dynamically folded protein. Yet, the spatiotemporal coupling between structural fluctuations and electron flux remains poorly understood, largely due to limitations in existing experimental techniques, such as ensemble averaging and non-physiological operating conditions. Here, we introduce a quantum tunnelling-integrated optoplasmonic nanotrap (QTOP-trap), an optoelectronic platform that combines plasmonic optical trapping with real-time quantum tunnelling measurements. This label-free approach enables single-molecule resolution of protein conductance in physiological electrolytes, achieving sub-3 nm spatial precision and 10-{\mu}s temporal resolution. By synchronising optoelectronic measurements, QTOP-trap resolves protein-specific conductance signatures and directly correlates tertiary structure dynamics with conductance using a "protein switch" strategy. This methodology establishes a universal framework for dissecting non-equilibrium ET mechanisms in individual conformational-active proteins, with broad implications for bioenergetics research and biomimetic quantum device design.</description>

      <title>Is There Elliptic Distortion in the Light Harvesting Complex 2 of Purple Bacteria?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single molecule spectroscopy (SMS) revealed unusually large gap between two major exciton peaks of the B850 unit of light harvesting complex 2 (LH2), which could be explained assuming elliptic distortion or k=2 symmetry modulation in the site excitation energy. On the basis of extensive simulation of the SMS data and ensemble lineshape, we found that uniform modulation of k=2 symmetry cannot explain the dependence of intensity ratios on the gap of the two major peaks, which are available from SMS, nor the ensemble lineshape. Alternative models of disorder with k=1 and k=2 symmetry correlation are shown to reproduce these data reasonably well and can even explain the gap distribution when it is assumed that the lower major peak in the SMS lineshape is an intensity weighted average of k=1- and k=0 states.</description>

      <title>An AI-guided mechanotyping instrument for fully automated oocyte quality assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of oocytes are regarded as important indicators of their developmental potential. During fertilization, deviations from the normal mechanical range can hinder sperm penetration, ultimately reducing fertilization efficiency and compromising embryo quality. However, current methods for measuring oocyte mechanics often suffer from serious cellular damage, low automation levels, and large measurement errors. To address these limitations, we developed an AI-guided micronewton-scale mechanical measurement system for safe and automated oocyte quality assessment. The system integrates voice interaction with automated experimental workflows to control a magnetically actuated microgripper, which applies defined loading forces to induce micron-scale compressive deformation of the oocyte. Combined with AI-assisted object detection and image segmentation algorithms, the system captures cellular deformation in real time, enabling precise calculation of the oocyte's compressive modulus. This measurement system enables automated, quantitative, and non-destructive evaluation of oocyte mechanical properties, providing an effective approach for oocyte quality screening in in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other assisted reproductive technologies (ART).</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Hyperspectral Interferometry and Single-Cell Dispersion Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometry techniques are essential for extracting phase information from optical systems, enabling precise measurements of dispersion and highly sensitive detection of perturbations. While phase sensing offers enhanced sensitivity compared to conventional spectroscopy methods, this sensitivity often makes systems more vulnerable to external factors such as vibrations, introducing instability and noise. In this work, we demonstrate a broadband and AI-enhanced interferometry method, denoted general polarization common-path interferometry (GPCPI), that relaxes the polarization constraints of traditional common-path interferometry. The polarization decoupling feature enables simultaneous amplitude and phase measurements supplemented with deep neural autoencoders to detect phase anomalies in the spectrum through the analysis of second order derivative mapping of the phase profile, enhancing the accuracy of broadband phase measurements. The approach enables an order of magnitude improvement in phase stability compared to state-of-the-art interferometry techniques, leading to higher accuracy in phase sensing. Plasmonic metasurface phase sensing and hyperspectral single-cell dispersion imaging demonstrate the capability and sensitivity of the method over conventional spectroscopy. Our own adopted version of deep learning model, ConvNeXt V2, enables single-shot and real-time tracking of phase variation with minimized noise. Interference fringes over the cell cultured samples reveal the fingerprints of the normal (CCD-32Sk) vs cancerous (COLO-829) skin cells, enabling robust cell classification and disease diagnosis at single-cell level. The proposed interferometry technique offers a reliable, compact, and stable solution for broadband phase measurements and single-cell dispersion imaging for applications in metrology, molecular diagnostics, drug discovery, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>A Universal Model for the Resting Potential in Nanofluidic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resting voltage, $V$, which is the potential drop required to nullify the electrical current ($i=0$), is a key characteristic of water desalination and energy harvesting systems that utilize macroscopically large nanoporous membranes, as well as for physiological ion channels subjected to asymmetric salt concentrations. To date, existing analytical expressions for $V_{i=0}$ have been limited to simple scenarios. In this work, we derive a universal, self-consistent theoretical model, devoid of unnecessary oversimplifying assumptions, that unifies all previous models within a single framework. This new model, verified by non-approximated numerical simulations, predicts the behavior of $V_{i=0}$ for arbitrary concentration gradients and for arbitrary diffusion coefficients and ionic valences. We show how the interplay between diffusion coefficients and ionic valencies significantly varies the system response and why it is essential to account for all system parameters. Ultimately, this model can be used to improve experimental interpretation of ion transport measurements.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal visual perception and polar alignment drive collective states in chiral active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles rarely move in straight lines; environmental interactions, shape asymmetry, and intrinsic torques generically induce curved or fluctuating trajectories. In biological and synthetic systems, this curvature often coexists with directional sensing and non-reciprocal interactions. Motivated by this, we explore the collective dynamics of chiral intelligent active Brownian particles (iABPs) that combine polar alignment with vision-based sensing. By varying the ratio of alignment to visual maneuverability, the vision angle, and the reduced chirality $(\omega/D_r)$, we construct a phase diagram exhibiting diverse collective states: spinners, vortices, ripples, worm-like swarms, rotary clusters, and irregular aggregates. Chirality critically governs their morphology: high chirality yields dilute phases, while moderate to low chirality produces cohesive yet dynamic patterns. Ripple loops emerge as a distinct state, characterized by expanding ring-like motion driven by outward torques and sustained only when both particle number and visual maneuverability are large. Structural and dynamical measures, including polarization, pair correlations, mean-square displacement, and orientation correlations, reveal clear signatures distinguishing these phases. Overall, our results show how chirality, non-reciprocal perception, and alignment together generate collective states inaccessible to non-chiral systems, with implications for chiral active matter in biological and synthetic contexts.</description>

      <title>Allostery Beyond Amplification: Temporal Regulation of Signaling Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Allostery is a fundamental mechanism of protein regulation and is commonly interpreted as modulating enzymatic activity or product abundance. Here we show that this view is incomplete. Using a stochastic model of allosteric regulation combined with an information-theoretic analysis, we quantify the mutual information between an enzyme's regulatory state and the states of downstream signaling components. Beyond controlling steady-state production levels, allostery also regulates the timing and duration over which information is transmitted. By tuning the temporal operating regime of signaling pathways, allosteric regulation enables distinct dynamical outcomes from identical molecular components, providing a physical mechanism for temporal information flow, signaling specificity, and coordination without changes in metabolic pathways.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of macroscopic contractility in actin-myosin active gel models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Actin filaments, crosslinkers and myosin molecular motors form contractile networks. For instance, the cell cortex is a thin network below the cell membrane ; contraction of the cell cortex allows cells to round up during cell division. Contractile actin-myosin networks are often represented at large scale by continuous theories such as active gel models. However, experimental perturbations are microscopic while parameters in continuous models are macroscopic, thus making those models hard to falsify experimentally. Here we use numerical simulations, in which we can access both microscopic and macroscopic quantities, to show that active gel models can indeed be applied to describe contractile actin. We predict that contractile stress should scale linearly with actin density, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, we can accurately predict how the contractile stress depends on motor properties such as unloaded speed and stall force.</description>

      <title>Modes of Mechanical Guidance of Adhesion-Independent Cell Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adhesion-independent migration is a prominent mode of cell motility in confined environments, yet the physical principles that guide such movement remain incompletely understood. We present a phase-field model for simulating the motility of deformable, non-adherent cells driven by contractile surface instabilities of the cell cortex. This model couples surface and bulk hydrodynamics, accommodates large shape deformations and incorporates a diffusible contraction-generating molecule (myosin) that drives cortical flows. These capabilities enable a systematic exploration of how mechanical cues direct cell polarization and migration. We first demonstrate that spontaneous symmetry breaking of cortical activity can lead to persistent and directed movement in channels. We then investigate how various physical cues - including gradients in friction, viscosity, and channel width as well as external flows and hydrodynamic interactions between cells - steer migration. Our results show that active surface dynamics can generate stimulus-specific cell behaviors, such as migration up friction gradients or escape from narrow regions. Beyond cell migration, the model offers a versatile platform for exploring the mechanics of active surfaces in biological systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As minimal cells or protocells are dramatically simpler than modern unicells it is possible to quantitatively estimate free energy changes for every process in the lifecycle of a protocell and compare these with estimates of the free energy changes for lifecycles in modern unicells. We present quantitative estimates of all metabolic changes in part by new density function theory (DFT) estimations, in part by compiling previously measured or estimated free energy changes, and in part by new thermodynamic calculations for all self-assembly, vesicle bending, and fission energies.</description>

      <title>Proliferating Nematic That Collectively Senses an Anisotropic Substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on growing fibroblasts, we examine the development of nematic order in a colony of elongated cells proliferating on a nematic elastomer substrate. After sparse seeding, the cells divide and grow into locally ordered, but randomly oriented, domains that then interact with each other and the substrate. Global alignment with the substrate is only achieved above a critical density, suggesting a collective mechanism for the sensing of substrate anisotropy. The system jams at high density, where both reorientation and proliferation stop. Using a continuum model of a proliferating nematic liquid crystal, we examine the competition between growth-driven alignment and substrate-driven alignment in controlling the density and structure of the final jammed state. We propose that anisotropic traction forces and the tendency of cells to align perpendicular to the direction of density gradients act in concert to provide a mechanism for collective cell alignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtually every biological rate depends on temperature, yet the resulting rate-temperature relationships often deviate strongly from simple Arrhenius behavior. In this first part of a two-part review, we survey empirical and phenomenological models used to describe biological temperature responses across scales, from enzymatic reactions to organismal performance. We discuss common functional forms, including symmetric and asymmetric thermal performance curves and extensions of the Arrhenius law, and we highlight how these models define operational quantities such as optimal temperatures, thermal breadths, and thermal limits. In Part II of this review, we will discuss how system-level temperature response curves emerge from the interaction of many underlying reactions.</description>
