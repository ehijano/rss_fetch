      <title>Maximizing higher eigenvalues in dimensions three and above</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing the $k$-th eigenvalue functional over the class of absolutely continuous measures on a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $m\geq 3$.
  For dimensions $3 \leq m \leq 6$, we generalize the work of Karpukhin and Stern on the first eigenvalue, showing that the maximizing measures are realized by smooth harmonic maps into finite-dimensional spheres.
  For $m \geq 7$, the maximizing measures are again induced by harmonic maps, which may now exhibit singularities. We prove that $m-7$ is the optimal upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set. More precisely, for any $m \geq 7$, there exist maximizing harmonic maps on the $m$-dimensional sphere whose singular sets have any prescribed integer dimension up to $m - 7$.</description>

      <title>The Levine--Weinberger and Friedlander--Filonov inequalities for some classes of elliptic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvalue problem for certain classes of elliptic operators, namely inhomogeneous membrane operators $ L = \tfrac{1}{ \rho } ( -\Delta + V ) $ and divergence form operators $ L = -\operatorname{div} A \nabla $, on bounded domains. For these operators, we prove ordering inequalities between the Dirichlet and the Neumann eigenvalues, generalizing results of Levine--Weinberger and Friedlander--Filonov for the Laplacian. We take inspiration from their proofs and derive sufficient conditions on the coefficients of the operator that ensure that the inequalities remain valid.</description>

      <title>Geometric effects of hyperbolic cohomology classes on K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic manifold, as a"topological" generalization of K\"ahler [Gro91] and weakly K\"ahler [BDET24] hyperbolic manifolds. Analogously to [BCDT24], we show the birational invariance of this property and then that K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic manifolds are not uniruled nor bimeromorphic to compact K\"ahler manifolds with trivial first real Chern class. Then, we prove spectral gap theorems for positive holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles on K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic manifolds, obtaining in particular effective non vanishing results \`a la Kawamata for adjoint line bundles. We finally explore the effects of K\"ahler topologically hyperbolicity on Ricci and scalar curvature of K\"ahler metrics.</description>

      <title>Friedman-Ramanujan functions in random hyperbolic geometry and application to spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This two-part paper studies the Weil-Petersson measure on the moduli space of compact hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$. In this first part, we define "volume functions" $V_g^{T}(l)$ associated with arbitrary topological types $T$ of closed geodesics, generalising the "volume polynomials" studied by M. Mirzakhani for simple closed geodesics. Our programme is to study the structure of these functions, focusing on their behaviour as a function of $l$ in the limit $g\rightarrow +\infty$.
  In this first article, motivated by J. Friedman's work on random graphs, we prove that volume functions admit asymptotic expansions to any order in powers of $1/g$, and claim that the coefficients in these expansions belong to a newly-introduced class of functions called "Friedman-Ramanujan functions". We prove the claim for closed geodesics filling a surface of Euler characteristic $0$ and $-1$. This result is then applied to prove that a random hyperbolic surface has spectral gap $\geq 2/9-\epsilon$ with high probability as $g \rightarrow +\infty$, using the trace method and cancellation properties of Friedman--Ramanujan functions.</description>

      <title>Explicit Spectral Analysis for Operators Representing the unitary group $\mathbb{U}(d)$ and its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{u}(d)$ through the Metaplectic Representation and Weyl Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we compute and analyze the spectrum of operators defined by the metaplectic representation $\mu$ on the unitary group $\mathbb{U}(d)$ or operators defined by the corresponding induced representation $d\mu$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{u}(d)$. It turns out that the point spectrum of both types of operators can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the corresponding matrices. For each $A\in\mathfrak{u}(d)$, it is known that the selfadjoint operator $H_A=-i d\mu(A)$ has a quadratic Weyl symbol and we will give conditions on to guarantee that it has discrete spectrum. Under those conditions, using a known result in combinatorics, we show that the multiplicity of the eigenvalues of $H_A$ is (up to some explicit translation and scalar multiplication) a quasi polynomial of degree $d-1$. Moreover, we show that counting eigenvalues function behaves as an Ehrhart polynomial. Using the latter result, we prove a Weyl's law for the operators $H_A$.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity and Fourier asymptotics of spectral measures for 1D Schr\"odinger operators under exponentially decaying perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity, or even the Lipschitz property, for the spectral measures of half-line discrete Schr\"odinger operators under suitable boundary conditions and exponentially decaying small potentials. These are the first known examples, apart from the free case, of Schr\"odinger operators with Lipschitz continuous spectral measures up to the spectral edge, and it was obtained as a consequence of the Dirichlet boundary condition. Notably, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the time-averaged quantum return probability, either $\log (t) / t$ or $1 / t$, as in the case of the free Laplacian, remains unchanged in this setting. Furthermore, we prove the persistence of the purely absolutely continuous spectrum and the $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity of the spectral measures for (Diophantine) quasi-periodic operators under exponentially decaying small perturbations. These results are optimal and hold for all energies, up to the border of the absolutely continuous spectrum.</description>

      <title>Friedman-Ramanujan functions in random hyperbolic geometry and application to spectral gaps II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The core focus of this series of two articles is the study of the distribution of the length spectrum of closed hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$, sampled randomly with respect to the Weil-Petersson probability measure. In the first article, we introduced a notion of local topological type $T$, and established the existence of a density function $V_g^T(l)$ describing the distribution of the lengths of all closed geodesics of type $T$ in a genus $g$ hyperbolic surface. We proved that $V_g^{T}(l)$ admits an asymptotic expansion in powers of $1/g$. We introduced a new class of functions, called Friedman-Ramanujan functions, and related it to the study of the spectral gap $\lambda_1$ of the Laplacian.
  In this second part, we provide a variety of new tools allowing to compute and estimate the volume functions $V_g^{T}(l)$. Notably, we construct new sets of coordinates on Teichm\"uller spaces, distinct from Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates, in which the Weil-Petersson volume has a simple form. These coordinates are tailored to the geodesics we study, and we can therefore prove nice formulae for their lengths. We use these new ideas, together with a notion of pseudo-convolutions, to prove that the coefficients of the expansion of $V_g^{T}(l)$ in powers of $1/g$ are Friedman-Ramanujan functions, for any local topological type $T$. We then exploit this result to prove that, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, $\lambda_1 \geq \frac14 - \epsilon$ with probability going to one as $g \rightarrow + \infty$, or, in other words, typical hyperbolic surfaces have an asymptotically optimal spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Orthogonalisability of joins of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph is said to be orthogonalisable if the set of real symmetric matrices whose off-diagonal pattern is prescribed by its edges contains an orthogonal matrix. We determine some necessary and some sufficient conditions on the sizes of the connected components of two graphs for their join to be orthogonalisable. In some cases, those conditions coincide, and we present several families of joins of graphs that are orthogonalisable.</description>
