      <title>An Immersed Interface Method for Incompressible Flows and Near Contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an enhanced immersed interface method for simulating incompressible fluid flows in thin gaps between closely spaced immersed boundaries. This regime, common in engineered structures such as including tribological interfaces and bearing assemblies, poses significant computational challenges because of limitations in grid resolution and the prohibitive cost of mesh refinement near contact. The immersed interface method imposes jump conditions that capture stress discontinuities generated by forces that are concentrated along immersed boundaries. Our approach introduces a bilinear velocity interpolation operator that incorporates jump conditions from multiple nearby interfaces when they occupy the same interpolation stencil. Numerical results demonstrate substantial improvements in both interface and Eulerian velocity accuracy compared to lubrication-based immersed boundary and immersed interface methods. The proposed method improves upon previous interpolation schemes, and eliminates the need for prior knowledge of interface orientation or geometry. This makes it broadly applicable to a wide range of fluid--structure interaction problems involving near-contact dynamics.</description>

      <title>Diffusive interface approach to oxygen transport and metabolism under cellular flow dynamics in microcirculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between the spatiotemporal distribution of oxygen transport and cellular flow dynamics is of fundamental importance for understanding microcirculation systems. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling is indispensable for addressing complex oxygen transport and cellular behaviors in capillary networks; however, the computational approach is formidable for enforcing interface (or jump) conditions on largely moving and deforming interfaces. In this paper, we propose a diffusive interface approach for the oxygen transport using a mixture formulation. We formulate oxygen transport using an advection-diffusion-reaction equation and rewrite all governing equations in mixture forms using phase indicator functions, where all the interface conditions are included in the governing equations. This innovation avoids the complexity associated with discontinuities for largely moving interfaces in highly dense red blood cell (RBC) conditions. We model cellular flow as a fluid-membrane interaction problem using the immersed boundary method (IBM). The method allows the seamless calculation of coupling problems for cellular flows and oxygen transports in the cytoplasm (internal fluid) of the RBC, plasma (external fluid), and tissue regions using a fixed Cartesian coordinate mesh. The proposed method accurately captures the analytical solution for spherically symmetric diffusion, and successfully demonstrates oxygen transport in both straight capillaries and their networks.</description>

      <title>Analysis of near wall flame and wall heat flux modeling in turbulent premixed combustion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactive flows in confined spaces involve complex flame-wall interaction (FWI). This work aims to gain more insights into the physics of the premixed near-wall flame and the wall heat flux as an important engineering relevant quantity. Two different flame configurations have been studied, including the normal flushing flame and inclined sweeping flame. By introducing the skin friction vector defined second-order tensor, direct numerical simulation (DNS) results of these two configurations show consistently that larger flame curvatures are associated with small vorticity magnitude under the influence of the vortex pair structure. Correlation of both the flame normal and tangential strain rates with the flame curvature has also been quantified. Alignment of the progress variable gradient with the most compressive eigenvector on the wall is similar to the boundary free behavior. To characterize the flame ordered structure, especially in the near-wall region, a species alignment index is proposed. The big difference in this index for flames in different regions suggests distinct flame structures. Building upon these fundamental insights, a predictive model for wall heat flux is proposed. For the purpose of applicability, realistic turbulent combustion situations need to be taken into account, for instance, flames with finite thickness, complex chemical kinetics, non-negligible near-wall reactions, and variable flame orientation relative to the wall. The model is first tested in an one-dimensional laminar flame and then validated against DNS datasets, justifying the model performance with satisfying agreement.</description>

      <title>Stability of plane Couette and Poiseuille flows rotating about the streamwise axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of plane Poiseuille flow (PPF) and plane Couette flow (PCF) subject to streamwise system rotation using linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulations. The linear stability analysis reveals two asymptotic regimes depending on the non-dimensional rotation rate ($Ro$): a low-$Ro$ and a high-$Ro$ regime. In the low-$Ro$ regime, the critical Reynolds number $Re_c$ and critical streamwise wavenumber $\alpha_c$ are proportional to $Ro$, while the critical spanwise wavenumber $\beta_c$ is constant. In the high-$Ro$ regime, as $Ro \rightarrow \infty$, we find $Re_c = 66.45$ and $\beta_c = 2.459$ for streamwise rotating PPF, and $Re_c = 20.66$ and $\beta_c = 1.558$ for streamwise rotating PCF, with $\alpha_c\propto 1/Ro$. Our results for streamwise rotating PPF match previous findings by Masuda et al. (2008). Interestingly, the critical values of $\beta_c$ and $Re_c$ at $Ro \rightarrow \infty$ in streamwise rotating PPF and PCF coincide with the minimum $Re_c$ reported by Lezius &amp; Johnston (1976) and Wall &amp; Nagata (2006) for spanwise rotating PPF at $Ro=0.3366$ and PCF at $Ro=0.5$. We explain this similarity through an analysis of the perturbation equations. Consequently, the linear stability of streamwise rotating PCF at large $Ro$ is closely related to that of spanwise rotating PCF and Rayleigh-Benard convection, with $Re_c = \sqrt{Ra_c}/2$, where $Ra_c$ is the critical Rayleigh number. To explore the potential for subcritical transitions, direct numerical simulations were performed. At low $Ro$, a subcritical transition regime emerges, characterized by large-scale turbulent-laminar patterns in streamwise rotating PPF and PCF. However, at higher $Ro$, subcritical transitions do not occur and the flow relaminarizes for $Re &lt; Re_c$. Furthermore, we identify a narrow $Ro$-range where turbulent-laminar patterns develop under supercritical conditions.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric behaviour of turbulence in the wake of wind farms caused by the Coriolis force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large offshore wind farm wakes in shallow atmospheric boundary layers (ABL) exhibit often an asymmetric behaviour when observed through Synthetic-Aperture-Radar or simulated through Large-Eddy Simulations (LES). In previous LES of wind farms in the northern hemisphere, the asymmetry manifests as a streak at the left side of the wake, looking downstream, where the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) is greater than the surrounding flow. This work aims at clarifying the physical mechanism that leads to the formation of such a phenomenon. Identifying the Coriolis force as one possible source of asymmetry in the resolved physics, we simulate a real wind farm located in the German Bight operating under different ABLs: one representative of the northern hemisphere; one of the southern hemisphere; and three fictitious ABLs where the Coriolis effects on the inflow and wake, i.e. veer and the wake deflecting force, are removed individually or altogether. Our results show that the TKE streak appears on the opposite side of the wake, i.e. the right one, in the southern hemisphere, and it is primarily caused by veer in the incoming flow, a result of the Coriolis force in a marine ABL. The process involves a larger TKE production which originates from a larger vertical shear promoted where the undisturbed veer profile converges towards the wake in the top part of the ABL. We find that the TKE streak improves the farm wake recovery modestly. Finally, we compare the asymmetry modelled by LES with those observed in several on-field measurements, finding striking similarities.</description>

      <title>Height-Dependent Rotor Noise and Thrust in Urban Air Mobility: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic characteristics of a propeller operating under varying rotational speeds (RPM) and heights ("H" ), with a particular focus on the effects of upstream obstruction modelled as a tall building. Unlike previous studies that primarily examined rotor noise under axial inflow conditions, this work explores how vortex shedding and flow ingestion from different elevations influence rotor performance and noise emissions. Experiments were carried out in an anechoic wind tunnel, where a tall cylinder was positioned above the propeller to replicate real-world obstruction scenarios. Results revealed that lower propeller heights led to increased broadband noise due to intensified turbulence interactions and reduced aerodynamic efficiency, while higher positions improved thrust performance and mitigated noise effects under certain conditions. The findings contribute to understanding noise sources in eVTOL propulsion systems and provide insights for optimizing propeller placement to enhance aerodynamic efficiency and noise reduction in urban environments</description>

      <title>Evolving wrinkles: time-dependent buckling of an elastic sheet on a liquid substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the formation and evolution of wrinkles in a floating elastic sheet under uniaxial compression. This is a canonical setup in the study of wrinkling, and whilst its static equilibrium configuration is well characterised, its dynamics are not. In this work, we focus on modelling the transition from early, inertia-dominated wrinkle growth to late-time gravity-moderated equilibrium. For an initial configuration in which the sheet is flat, an initial disturbance will first grow at the shortest available wavelengths, because this requires the least kinetic energy, but will subsequently transition to a longer preferred wavelength that minimises potential energy. We observe that the evolving wave pattern must be a spectrum, as opposed to a fundamental wrinkle mode whose wavelength evolves in time. Our results demonstrate that changes in the dominant wrinkle wavelength are coupled to a decay in the compressive force, which is to be expected from equilibrium theory.</description>

      <title>Filament inclination effect on turbulent canopy flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the spontaneous behaviour observed in filamentous layers -- where the balance between flow-induced drag and structural elasticity dictates the filaments' equilibrium streamlined posture -- we perform a series of large-eddy simulations to investigate how filament inclination affects turbulent shear flows developing both above and within a canopy of filaments. We examine six distinct filament inclination angles ranging from 0\deg to 90\deg. The in-plane solid fraction and filament length are chosen to achieve a fully dense canopy at zero inclination, and these parameters remain constant throughout our study. By setting a nominal bulk Reynolds number of 6000, we provide a detailed statistical characterisation of the turbulent flow. Our findings illustrate distinct changes in the flow regime with varying filament inclination. At lower angles, the canopy remains dense and significantly influences the flow, conforming to a classical canopy-flow regime. However, as the inclination approaches 90\deg, the intra-canopy region progressively becomes shielded from the outer flow. Remarkably, at 90\deg inclination, the flow drag reduces significantly, and the total drag becomes lower than that typically seen in an open, filament-free flow. We document this transition from a canopy-dominated regime to a scenario where the canopy becomes largely sheltered from the outer turbulent flow, highlighting key alterations in intra-canopy dynamics as filament inclination increases. Our observations are substantiated by an analysis of the velocity spectra, providing deeper insight into the interactions between the canopy and the developing turbulent boundary layer.</description>

      <title>Study of arbitrarily low shear rate rheology using dissipative particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation to study the rheology of fluids under shear has always been of great interest to the research community. Despite being a powerful tool, a limitation of DPD is the need to use high shear rates to obtain viscosity results with a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This often leads to simulations with unrealistically large deformations that do not reflect typical stress conditions on the fluid. In this work, the transient time correlation function (TTCF) technique is used for a simple Newtonian DPD fluid to achieve high SNR results even at arbitrarily low shear rates. The applicability of the TTCF on DPD systems is assessed, and the modifications required by the nature of the DPD force field are discussed. The results showed that the standard error (SE) of viscosity values obtained with TTCF is consistently lower than that of the classic averaging procedure across all tested shear rates. Moreover, the SE resulted proportional to the shear rate, leading to a constant SNR that does not decrease at lower shear rates. Additionally, the effect of trajectory mapping on DPD is studied, and a TTCF approach that does not require mappings is consolidated. Remarkably, the absence of mappings has not reduced the precision of the method compared with the more common mapped approach.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Rayleigh-Benard convection with reinforcement learning trained on a reduced-order model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rayleigh-Benard convection (RBC) is a canonical system for buoyancy-driven turbulence and heat transport, central to geophysical and industrial flows. Developing efficient control strategies remains challenging at high Rayleigh numbers, where fully resolved simulations are computationally expensive. We use a control framework that couples data-driven manifold dynamics (DManD) with reinforcement learning (RL) to suppress convective heat transfer. We find a coordinate transformation to a low-dimensional system using POD and autoencoders, and then learn an evolution equation for this low-dimensional state using neural ODEs. The reduced model reproduces key system features while enabling rapid policy training. Policies trained in the DManD environment and deployed in DNS achieve a 16-23 % reduction in the Nusselt number for both single- and dual-boundary actuation. Physically, the learned strategy modulates near-wall heat flux to stabilize and thicken the thermal boundary layer, weaken plume ejection, and damp the wall-driven instabilities that seed convective bursts. Crucially, the controller drives the flow toward a quasi-steady state characterized by suppressed temporal fluctuations and spatially steady heat-flux patterns. This work establishes DManD-RL as a physically interpretable, scalable approach for turbulence control in high-dimensional flows.</description>

      <title>Reducing base drag on road vehicles using pulsed jets optimized by hybrid genetic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerodynamic drag on flat-backed vehicles like vans and trucks is dominated by a low-pressure wake, whose control is critical for reducing fuel consumption. This paper presents an experimental study at $Re_W\approx 78,300$ on active flow control using four pulsed jets at the rear edges of a bluff body model. A hybrid genetic algorithm, combining a global search with a local gradient-based optimizer, was used to determine the optimal jet actuation parameters in an experiment-in-the-loop setup. The cost function was designed to achieve a net energy saving by simultaneously minimizing aerodynamic drag and penalizing the actuation's energy consumption. The optimization campaign successfully identified a control strategy that yields a drag reduction of approximately 10%. The optimal control law features a strong, low-frequency actuation from the bottom jet, which targets the main vortex shedding, while the top and lateral jets address higher-frequency, less energetic phenomena. Particle Image Velocimetry analysis reveals a significant upward shift and stabilization of the wake, leading to substantial pressure recovery on the model's lower base. Ultimately, this work demonstrates that a model-free optimization approach can successfully identify non-intuitive, multi-faceted actuation strategies that yield significant and energetically efficient drag reduction.</description>

      <title>A new particle-based code for Lagrangian stochastic models applied to stellar turbulent convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inclusion of convection in stellar evolution models lacks realism, especially near convective-radiative interfaces. Furthermore, the interaction of convection with oscillations prevent us from accurately predicting seismic frequencies, and therefore from fully exploiting the asteroseismic data of low-mass stars. We aim to develop a new formalism to model the one-point statistics of stellar convection, to implement it in a new numerical code, and to validate this implementation against benchmark cases. This new formalism is based on Lagrangian Probability Density Function (PDF) methods, where a Fokker-Planck equation for the PDF of particle-based turbulent properties is integrated in time. We then develop a Monte-Carlo implementation of this method, where the flow is represented by a large number of notional particles acting as realisations of the PDF. Notional particles interact with each other through the time- and space-dependent mean flow, which is estimated from the particle realisations through a scheme similar to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. We establish a model for the evolution of turbulent properties along Lagrangian trajectories applicable to stellar turbulent convection, with only a minimal number of physical assumptions necessary to close the system. In particular, no closure is needed for the non-linear advection terms, which are included exactly through the Lagrangian nature of formalism. The numerical implementation of this new formalism allows us to extract time-dependent maps of the statistical properties of turbulent convection in a way which is not possible in grid-based large-eddy simulations, in particular the turbulent pressure, Reynolds stress tensor, internal energy variance and convective flux.</description>

      <title>Light-scattering reconstruction of transparent shapes using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate characterisation of the 3D deformations of slender fibres and thin sheets in flow, is a key experimental challenge in the study of particle-laden flows. We propose a high-resolution, single-camera method to visualise non-intrusively the shape of a transparent crumpled sheet, as it translates, rotates and deforms. We perform periodic scans of the crumpled shape by illuminating it with a sequence of stacked light sheets at a rate much faster than its deformation and image the scattered light signal in a plane near-orthogonal to the plane of lighting. Processing of the data using a pinhole camera model yields a noisy spatio-temporal dataset of the strongly deformed time-evolving surface of the sheet, which we reconstruct in 3D using a neural autoencoder. We validate the robustness of the shape reconstruction algorithm to noise using synthetic data sets, and demonstrate the accurate reconstruction of laboratory sedimentation experiments with elastic disks. We find that the inclusion of isometricity-enforcing penalties into the cost function of the autoencoder enables us to robustly reconstruct highly folded shapes, where different regions of the sheet overlap.</description>

Abstract: Suspensions of swimming micro-organisms are known to undergo intricate collective dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic and collision interactions. Micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, naturally live and have evolved in complex habitats that include impurities, obstacles and interfaces. To elucidate their dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, we consider a continuum theory where the the micro-swimmers are embedded in a Brinkman wet porous medium, which models viscous flow with an additional resistance or friction due to the presence of smaller stationary obstacles. The conservation equation for the swimmer configurations includes advection and rotation by the immersing fluid, and is coupled to the viscous Brinkman fluid flow with an active stress due to the swimmers' motion in it. Resistance alters individual swimmer locomotion and the way it disturbs the surrounding fluid, and thus it alters its hydrodynamic interactions with others and and such affects collective dynamics.The entropy analysis and the linear stability analysis of the system of equations both reveal that resistance delays and hinders the onset and development of the collective swimming instabilities, and can completely suppress it if sufficiently large. Simulations of the full nonlinear system confirm these. We contrast the results with previous theoretical studies on micro-swimmers in homogeneous viscous flow, and discuss relevant experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>openKARST: A novel open-source flow simulator for karst systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the open-source Python-based code openKARST for flow in karst conduit networks. Flow and transport in complex karst systems remain a challenging area of hydrogeological research due to the heterogeneous nature of conduit networks. Flow regimes in these systems are highly dynamic, with transitions from free-surface to fully pressurized and laminar to turbulent flow conditions and Reynolds numbers often exceeding one million. These transitions can occur simultaneously within a network, depending on conduit roughness properties and diameter distributions. openKARST solves the transient dynamic wave equation using an iterative scheme and is optimized through an efficient vectorized structure. Transitions from free-surface to pressurized flows in smooth and rough circular conduits are realized via a Preissmann slot approach in combination with an implementation of the Darcy--Weisbach and Manning equations to compute friction losses. To mitigate numerical fluctuations commonly encountered in the Colebrook--White equation, the dynamic switching from laminar to turbulent flows is modeled with a continuous Churchill formulation for the friction factor computation. openKARST supports common boundary conditions encountered in karst systems, as and includes functionalities for network import, export and visualization. The code is verified via comparison against several analytical solutions and validated against a laboratory experiment. Finally, we demonstrate the application of openKARST by simulating a synthetic recharge event in one of the largest explored karst networks, the Ox Bel Ha system in Mexico.</description>

      <title>Laser-driven droplet deformation at low Weber numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate droplet deformation following laser-pulse impact at low Weber numbers (We ~ 0.1-100). Droplet dynamics can be characterized by two key parameters: the impact We number and the width, W, of the distribution of the impact force over the droplet surface. By varying laser pulse energy, our experiments traverse a phase space comprising (I) droplet oscillation, (II) breakup, or (III) sheet formation. Numerical simulations complement the experiments by determining the pressure width and by allowing We and W to be varied independently, despite their correlation in the experiments. A single phase diagram, integrating observations from both experiments and simulations, demonstrates that all phenomena can be explained by a single parameter: the deformation Weber number Wed=f(We, W) that is based on the initial radial expansion speed of the droplet, following impact. The resulting phase diagram separates (I) droplet oscillation for Wed&lt;5, from (II) breakup for 5&lt;Wed&lt;60, and (III) sheet formation for Wed&gt;60.</description>

      <title>Meshless projection model-order reduction via reference spaces for smoothed-particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A model-order reduction framework for the meshless smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is presented. The proposed framework introduces the concept of modal reference spaces to overcome the challenges of discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic, and mixing numerical topology that occurs in SPH simulations. These reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the field equations while maintaining the inherent meshless qualities of SPH. Modal reference spaces are constructed by projecting snapshot data onto a reference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered via traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)). Modal quantities are mapped back to the meshless SPH space via scattered data interpolation during the online predictive stage. The proposed model-order reduction framework is cast into the meshless Galerkin POD and the Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin projection model-order reduction (PMOR) formulation. The PMORs are tested on three numerical experiments: 1) the Taylor--Green vortex; 2) the lid-driven cavity; and 3) the flow past an open cavity. Results show good agreement in reconstructed and predictive velocity fields, which showcase the ability of this framework to evolve the field equations in a low-dimensional subspace on an unstructured, dynamic, and mixing numerical topology. Results also show that the pressure field is sensitive to the projection error due to the stiff weakly-compressible assumption made in the current SPH framework, but this sensitivity can be alleviated through nonlinear approximations, such as the APG approach. The proposed meshless model-order reduction framework reports up to 90,000x dimensional compression within 10% error in quantities of interest, marking a step toward drastic cost reduction in SPH simulations.</description>
