      <title>Meal-taking activity monitoring in the elderly based on sensor data: Comparison of unsupervised classification methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era marked by a demographic change towards an older population, there is an urgent need to improve nutritional monitoring in view of the increase in frailty. This research aims to enhance the identification of meal-taking activities by combining K-Means, GMM, and DBSCAN techniques. Using the Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) for the optimal meal taking activity clustering, the results show that K-Means seems to be the best solution, thanks to its unrivalled efficiency in data demarcation, compared with the capabilities of GMM and DBSCAN. Although capable of identifying complex patterns and outliers, the latter methods are limited by their operational complexities and dependence on precise parameter configurations. In this paper, we have processed data from 4 houses equipped with sensors. The findings indicate that applying the K-Means method results in high performance, evidenced by a particularly low Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI), illustrating optimal cluster separation and cohesion. Calculating the average duration of each activity using the GMM algorithm allows distinguishing various categories of meal-taking activities. Alternatively, this can correspond to different times of the day fitting to each meal-taking activity. Using K-Means, GMM, and DBSCAN clustering algorithms, the study demonstrates an effective strategy for thoroughly understanding the data. This approach facilitates the comparison and selection of the most suitable method for optimal meal-taking activity clustering.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Two-Dimensional Functional Mixed-Effect Model Framework for Repeatedly Measured Functional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of wearable device technologies, accelerometers can record minute-by-minute physical activity for consecutive days, which provides important insight into a dynamic association between the intensity of physical activity and mental health outcomes for large-scale population studies. Using Shanghai school adolescent cohort we estimate the effect of health assessment results on physical activity profiles recorded by accelerometers throughout a week, which is recognized as repeatedly measured functional data. To achieve this goal, we propose an innovative two-dimensional functional mixed-effect model (2dFMM) for the specialized data, which smoothly varies over longitudinal day observations with covariate-dependent mean and covariance functions. The modeling framework characterizes the longitudinal and functional structures while incorporating two-dimensional fixed effects for covariates of interest. We also develop a fast three-stage estimation procedure to provide accurate fixed-effect inference for model interpretability and improve computational efficiency when encountering large datasets. We find strong evidence of intraday and interday varying significant associations between physical activity and mental health assessments among our cohort population, which shed light on possible intervention strategies targeting daily physical activity patterns to improve school adolescent mental health. Our method is also used in environmental data to illustrate the wide applicability. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.</description>

      <title>Algorithm-agnostic significance testing in supervised learning with multimodal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valid statistical inference is crucial for decision-making but difficult to obtain in supervised learning with multimodal data, e.g., combinations of clinical features, genomic data, and medical images. Multimodal data often warrants the use of black-box algorithms, for instance, random forests or neural networks, which impede the use of traditional variable significance tests. We address this problem by proposing the use of COvariance Measure Tests (COMETs), which are calibrated and powerful tests that can be combined with any sufficiently predictive supervised learning algorithm. We apply COMETs to several high-dimensional, multimodal data sets to illustrate (i) variable significance testing for finding relevant mutations modulating drug-activity, (ii) modality selection for predicting survival in liver cancer patients with multiomics data, and (iii) modality selection with clinical features and medical imaging data. In all applications, COMETs yield results consistent with domain knowledge without requiring data-driven pre-processing which may invalidate type I error control. These novel applications with high-dimensional multimodal data corroborate prior results on the power and robustness of COMETs for significance testing. COMETs are implemented in the comets R package available on CRAN and pycomets Python library available on GitHub. Source code for reproducing all results is available at https://github.com/LucasKook/comets. All data sets used in this work are openly available.</description>

      <title>When Audits and Recounts Distract from Election Integrity: The 2020 U.S. Presidential Election in Georgia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Georgia was central to efforts to overturn the 2020 Presidential election, including a call from then-president Trump to Georgia Secretary of State Raffensperger asking Raffensperger to `find' 11,780 votes. Raffensperger has maintained that a `100% full-count risk-limiting audit' and a machine recount agreed with the initial machine-count results, which proved that the reported election results were accurate and that `no votes were flipped.' There is no indication of widespread fraud, but there is reason to distrust the election outcome: the two machine counts and the manual `audit' tallies disagree substantially, even about the number of ballots cast. Some ballots in Fulton County were included in the original count at least twice; some were included in the machine recount at least thrice. Audit results for some tally batches were omitted from the reported audit totals. The two machine counts and the audit were not probative of who won because of poor processes and controls: a lack of secure physical chain of custody, ballot accounting, pollbook reconciliation, and accounting for other election materials such as memory cards. Moreover, most voters voted with demonstrably untrustworthy ballot-marking devices, so even a perfect handcount or audit would not necessarily reveal who really won. True risk-limiting audits (RLAs) and rigorous recounts can limit the risk that an incorrect electoral outcome will be certified rather than being corrected. But no procedure can limit that risk without a trustworthy record of the vote. And even a properly conducted RLA of some contests in an election does not show that any other contests in that election were decided correctly. The 2020 U.S. Presidential election in Georgia illustrates unrecoverable errors that can render recounts and audits `security theater' that distract from the more serious problems rather than justifying trust.</description>

      <title>Ecosystem knowledge should replace coexistence and stability assumptions in ecological network modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative population modelling is an invaluable tool for identifying the cascading effects of ecosystem management and interventions. Ecosystem models are often constructed by assuming stability and coexistence in ecological communities as a proxy for abundance data when monitoring programs are not available. However, a growing body of literature suggests that these assumptions are inappropriate for modelling conservation outcomes. In this work, we develop an alternative for dataless population modelling that instead relies on expert-elicited knowledge of species abundances. While time series abundance data is often not available for ecosystems of interest, these systems may still be highly studied or observed in an informal capacity. In particular, limits on population sizes and their capacity to rapidly change during an observation period can be reasonably elicited for many species. We propose a robust framework for generating an ensemble of ecosystem models whose population predictions match the expected population dynamics, as defined by experts. Our new Bayesian algorithm systematically removes model parameters that lead to unreasonable population predictions without incurring excessive computational costs. Our results demonstrate that models constructed using expert-elicited information, rather than stability and coexistence assumptions, can dramatically impact population predictions, expected responses to management, conservation decision-making, and long-term ecosystem behaviour. In the absence of data, we argue that field observations and expert knowledge are preferred for representing ecosystems observed in nature instead of theoretical assumptions of coexistence and stability.</description>
