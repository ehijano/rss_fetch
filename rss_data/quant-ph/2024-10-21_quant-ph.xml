      <title>Exploiting recursive structures for the design of novel quantum primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of fault-tolerant quantum computers marks a significant milestone, yet the development of practical quantum algorithms remains a critical challenge. Effective quantum algorithms are essential for leveraging the power of quantum computers, and their design is often non-intuitive. This paper addresses the issue of generating novel quantum primitives by focusing on recursive circuits. We explore the recursive circuit structures prevalent in existing quantum algorithms and demonstrate how these structures can be exploited to design new, potentially advantageous quantum algorithms. We base our discussion on the quantum Fourier transform (QFT), which is a primitive that is widely used in quantum algorithms. We show that the recursive structure in well-established fast classical transforms forms a fruitful bridge with quantum algorithms, enabling the design of novel quantum primitives and the discovery of new discrete numerical transforms. The discussion is split into two complementary parts, the forward and the reverse direction, in which existing classical transforms are implemented using polynomial-time quantum circuits and recursive circuits are used to find novel non-sparse classical transforms with guaranteed quantum speedup, respectively. We comment on the potential impact on quantum algorithms, numerical analysis, and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Extractable energy from quantum superposition of current states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the energy content of superpositions of current states. Specifically, we focus on the maximum energy that can be extracted from them through local unitary transformations. The figure of merit we employ is the local ergotropy. We perform a complete analysis in the whole range of the system's parameters. This way, we prove that superpositions of two current states in spatially closed spin networks are characterized by specific peaks in extractable energy, generally overcoming the power of each of the two separate current states characterized by a single winding number. The many-body state dynamics entails to ergotropy evolving in a controlled fashion. The implementation we suggest is based on a Rydberg-atom platform. Optimal transformations able to extract locally the maximum possible amount of energy are sorted out.</description>

      <title>Quantum computational complexity of matrix functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dividing line between classical and quantum computational power in estimating properties of matrix functions. More precisely, we study the computational complexity of two primitive problems: given a function $f$ and a Hermitian matrix $A$, compute a matrix element of $f(A)$ or compute a local measurement on $f(A)|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$, with $|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$ an $n$-qubit reference state vector, in both cases up to additive approximation error. We consider four functions -- monomials, Chebyshev polynomials, the time evolution function, and the inverse function -- and probe the complexity across a broad landscape covering different problem input regimes. Namely, we consider two types of matrix inputs (sparse and Pauli access), matrix properties (norm, sparsity), the approximation error, and function-specific parameters.
  We identify BQP-complete forms of both problems for each function and then toggle the problem parameters to easier regimes to see where hardness remains, or where the problem becomes classically easy. As part of our results we make concrete a hierarchy of hardness across the functions; in parameter regimes where we have classically efficient algorithms for monomials, all three other functions remain robustly BQP-hard, or hard under usual computational complexity assumptions. In identifying classically easy regimes, among others, we show that for any polynomial of degree $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ both problems can be efficiently classically simulated when $A$ has $O(\log n)$ non-zero coefficients in the Pauli basis. This contrasts with the fact that the problems are BQP-complete in the sparse access model even for constant row sparsity, whereas the stated Pauli access efficiently constructs sparse access with row sparsity $O(\log n)$. Our work provides a catalog of efficient quantum and classical algorithms for fundamental linear-algebra tasks.</description>

      <title>Photonic Simulation of Localization Phenomena Using Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation in its current state faces experimental overhead in terms of physical space and cooling. We propose boson sampling as an alternative compact synthetic platform performing at room temperature. Identifying the capability of estimating matrix permanents, we explore the applicability of boson sampling for tackling the dynamics of quantum systems without having access to information about the full state vector. By mapping the time-evolution unitary of a Hamiltonian onto an interferometer via continuous-variable gate decompositions, we present proof-of-principle results of localization characteristics of a single particle. We study the dynamics of one-dimensional tight-binding systems in the clean and quasiperiodic-disordered limits to observe Bloch oscillations and dynamical localization, and the delocalization-to-localization phase transition in the Aubry- Andre-Harper model respectively. Our computational results obtained using boson sampling are in complete agreement with the dynamical and static results of non-interacting tight-binding systems obtained using conventional numerical calculations. Additionally, our study highlights the role of number of sampling measurements or shots for simulation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of atoms in number-theory-inspired potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study transitions of atoms between energy levels of several number-theory-inspired atom potentials, under the effect of time-dependent perturbations. First, we simulate in detail the case of a trap whose one-particle spectrum is given by prime numbers. We investigate one-body Rabi oscillations and the excitation lineshape for two resonantly coupled energy levels. We also show that techniques from quantum control are effective in reducing the transition time, compared to the case of a periodic perturbation. Next, we investigate cascades of such transitions. To this end, we pose the following question: can one construct a quantum system where the existence of a continuous resonant cascade is predicted on the validity of a particular statement in number theory? We find that a one-body trap with a log-natural spectrum, parametrically driven with a perturbation of a log-natural frequency, provides such a quantum system. Here, powers of a given natural number will form a ladder of equidistant energy levels; absence of gaps in this ladder is an indication of the validity of the number theory statement in question. Ideas for two more resonance cascade experiments are presented as well: they are designed to illustrate the validity of the Diophantus-Brahmagupta-Fibonacci identity (the set of sums of two squares of integers is closed under multiplication) and the validity of the Goldbach conjecture (every even number is a sum of two primes).</description>

      <title>Quasi-Perfect State Transfer in Spin Chains via Parametrization of On-Site Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of state transfer in spin chains, with the aim of achieving perfect state transfer for quantum information processing applications. Previous research has mainly focused on manipulating inter-site couplings within spin chains; here, we investigate in detail the potential of modifying on-site energies to facilitate precise quantum information transfer. Our findings demonstrate that through targeted adjustments to the diagonal elements of the XY Hamiltonian and leveraging a genetic algorithm, quasi-perfect state transfer can be achieved with careful consideration of the system's spectral characteristics. This investigation into on-site energies offers an alternative approach for achieving high-fidelity state transfer, especially in cases where manipulation of inter-site couplings may be impractical. This study thus represents a significant advancement towards unlocking the diverse applications of spin chains within practical quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>CUT-E as a $1/N$ expansion for multiscale molecular polariton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular polaritons arise when the collective coupling between an ensemble of $N$ molecules and an optical mode exceeds individual photon and molecular linewidths. The complexity of their description stems from their multiscale nature, where the local dynamics on each molecule can, in principle, be influenced by the collective behavior of the entire ensemble. To address this, we previously introduced a formalism called collective dynamics using truncated equations (CUT-E). CUT-E approaches the problem in two stages. First, it exploits permutational symmetries to obtain a substantial simplification of the problem. However, this is often insufficient for parameter regimes relevant to most experiments. Second, it takes the exact solution of the problem in the $N\to\infty$ limit as a reference and derives systematic $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ corrections. Here we provide a novel derivation of CUT-E based on recently developed bosonization techniques. We lay down its connections with $1/N$ expansions that are ubiquitous in other fields of physics, and present previously unexplored key aspects of this formalism, including various types of approximations and extensions to high excitation manifolds.</description>

      <title>Quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms for multijet clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet clustering or reconstruction, a procedure to identify sprays of collimated particles originating from the fragmentation and hadronization of quarks and gluons, is a key component at high energy colliders. It is a complicated combinatorial optimization problem and requires intensive computing resources. In this study, we formulate jet reconstruction as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and introduce novel quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms for clustering multiple jets in electron-positron collision events. One of these quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms, ballistic simulated bifurcation, overcomes problems previously observed in multijet clustering with quantum-annealing approaches. We find that both the distance defined in the QUBO matrix as well as the prediction power of the QUBO solvers have crucial impacts on the multijet clustering performance. This study opens up a new approach to globally reconstruct multijet beyond dijet in one-go, in contrast to the traditional iterative method.</description>

      <title>Explicit error bounds with commutator scaling for time-dependent product and multi-product formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Product formula (PF), which approximates the time evolution under a many-body Hamiltonian by the product of local time evolution operators, is one of the central approaches for simulating quantum dynamics by quantum computers. It has been of great interest whether PFs have a bound of the error from the exact time evolution, which is expressed by commutators among local terms (called commutator scaling), since it brings the substantial suppression of the computational cost in the system size. Although recent studies have revealed the presence and the explicit formulas of the PF error bounds for time-independent systems, those for time-dependent Hamiltonians remain to be a difficult problem except for low-order PFs. In this paper, we derive an explicit error bound of generic PFs for smooth time-dependent Hamiltonians, which is expressed by commutators among local terms and their time derivatives. This error bound can also host the substantial suppression in the system size for generic local Hamiltonians with finite-, short-, and long-ranged interactions, thereby giving a much better estimate of gate counts. Our derivation employs Floquet theory; Embedding generic smooth time-dependent Hamiltonians into time-periodic ones, we map the time-dependent PF error to the time-independent one defined on an infinite-dimensional space. This approach allows to obtain the error bounds not only for the ordinary time-dependent PF but also for its various family. In particular, we also clarify the explicit error bound of a time-dependent multi-product formula, with which we can achieve much smaller error by a linear combination of time-dependent PFs. Our results will shed light on various applications of quantum computers, ranging from quantum simulation of nonequilibrium materials to faster algorithms exploiting time-dependent Hamiltonians like adiabatic state preparation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed state topological order in a stabilizer system under stochastic decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering quantum orders in mixed many-body systems is an ongoing issue. Very recently, the notion of an intrinsic mixed state topologically-ordered (IMTO) state was proposed. As a concrete example, we observe the emergence of IMTO by studying the toric code system under stochastic maximal decoherence by $ZX$-diagonal type projective measurement without monitoring. We study how the toric code state changes to an IMTO state at the level of the averaged quantum trajectories. This phase transition is understood from the viewpoint of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 1-form weak symmetry, that is, the IMTO is characterized by the symmetry restoration from the SSB, which comes from the proliferation of anyons. To understand the emergent IMTO, order and disorder parameters of 1-form symmetry are numerically studied by stabilizer simulation. The present study clarifies the existence of two kinds of fermionic anyons, and also the obtained critical exponents indicate strong relation between IMTO and percolation.</description>

      <title>Smolyak algorithm assisted robust control for quantum systems with uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and systematic numerical methods for robust control design are highly desired in the study of quantum systems, since system imperfections such as uncertainties or disturbances inevitably exist. By modeling uncertainties as combinations of random variables following prescribed distributions, the expectation of infidelity can be used to quantify the level of robustness as a performance index in various control problems. Inspired by sample-based algorithms, we consider the level of robustness as a weighted tensor product quadrature, and take advantage of Smolyak's sparse grid algorithm to develop a parametric robust quantum control scheme, with the purpose of reducing computation cost and improving accuracy. Furthermore, the features and strengths of the scheme proposed in this paper have been illustrated in the context of robust control problems, including state transfer and realization of quantum gates, where ultrahigh fidelity can be achieved with strong robustness using Smolyak algorithm-assisted gradient-based methods. Therefore, our results can contribute to reliable and secure quantum computing as well as communication.</description>

      <title>Entanglement between dependent degrees of freedom: Quasi-particle correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common notions of entanglement are based on well-separated subsystems. However, obtaining such independent degrees of freedom is not always possible because of physical constraints. In this work, we explore the notion of entanglement in the context of dependent degrees of freedom. As a physically relevant application, we specifically study quantum correlation features for quasi-particle descriptions. Those are paramount for interacting light-matter systems, utilizing excitations of fermion-boson hybrid modes. By comparing independent and dependent degrees of freedom, we uncover that certain states are non-entangled although they would be entangled when only focusing on the common, independent description, and vice versa. Therefore, new insight is provided into the resourcefulness of quantum correlations within the rarely discussed context of dependent degrees of freedom for light-matter links in quantum information applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time dynamics of generic time-dependent Lindblad master equations. In particular, we provide sufficient conditions such that asymptotically the dynamics is independent on the initial state preparation. These conditions represent a natural extension of Spohn's theorem to the case of a time-dependent generator. To illustrate our results, we analyse a quantum thermodynamics scenario and discuss the uniqueness of the limit cycle in a continuous Otto engine fuelled by a driven Ising chain, where the dissipation is described by non-local jump operators. As corollary of our main result, we show that any master equation which exhibits non-Markovianity in a finite time interval can be equally addressed by means of our approach. These findings pave the way for developing a more general theory of relaxation beyond the Markovian case.</description>

Abstract: This essay reviews a modern understanding of a quantum measurement. Rather than reducing the picture to the observer's experience with quantum system, we try to put it in the context of a broader physical picture. We also attempt to distinguish some basic components and stages of a generic measurement. In this way, we want to understand which aspects of quantum measurements are important to mainstream interpretations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Efficient charge-preserving excited state preparation with variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the spectrum and wave functions of excited states of a system is crucial in quantum physics and chemistry. Low-depth quantum algorithms, such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its variants, can be used to determine the ground-state energy. However, current approaches to computing excited states require numerous controlled unitaries, making the application of the original Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm to problems in chemistry or physics suboptimal. In this study, we introduce a charge-preserving VQD (CPVQD) algorithm, designed to incorporate symmetry and the corresponding conserved charge into the VQD framework. This results in dimension reduction, significantly enhancing the efficiency of excited-state computations. We present benchmark results with GPU-accelerated simulations using systems up to 24 qubits, showcasing applications in high-energy physics, nuclear physics, and quantum chemistry.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a simple quantum algorithm for simulating time-dependent Hamiltonian, extending the methodology of quantum signal processing. Thus, the framework achieves optimal scaling up to some factor scaling with other parameters, and nearly optimal in inverse of error tolerance, which could be improved to optimal scaling under certain input models.</description>

      <title>The State of Factoring on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the current state of factoring integers on both digital and analog quantum computers. For digital quantum computers, we study the effect of errors for which one can formally prove that Shor's factoring algorithm fails. For analog quantum computers, we experimentally test three factorisation methods and provide evidence for a scaling performance that is absolutely and asymptotically better than random guessing but still exponential. We conclude with an overview of future perspectives on factoring large integers on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Enhanced microscale NMR spectroscopy of low-gyromagnetic ratio nuclei via hydrogen transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical shifts and J-couplings are fundamental parameters in NMR spectroscopy as they provide structural information about molecules. Extracting these quantities from isotopes such as carbon or nitrogen results in reduced sensitivity due to their low gyromagnetic ratios. In this work, we present a method for detecting chemical shifts and J-couplings at the microscale in low-gyromagnetic-ratio nuclei using NV centers. By leveraging hydrogen nuclei, we achieve strong coupling with NVs and fast signal emission that aligns with NV coherence times. In addition, the technique is well-suited for implementations under high magnetic fields. We demonstrate that our protocol achieves a sensitivity enhancement of more than one order of magnitude for scenarios involving $^{13}$C, with even greater improvements for nuclei with lower gyromagnetic ratios.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological quantum mechanics: deducing the formalism from experimental observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics from phenomenological observations only. Thus, the only assumed inputs are the multi-time probability distributions estimated from the results of sequential measurements of quantum observables; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are allowed. We show that it is indeed possible to derive in such a way a complete and fully functional formalism based on the structures of Hilbert spaces. However, the obtained formal description -- the bi-trajectory formalism -- turns out to be quite different from the standard state-focused formalism.</description>

      <title>Simulating Time-dependent Hamiltonian Based On High Order Runge-Kutta and Forward Euler Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method for simulating certain type of time-dependent Hamiltonian $H(t) = \sum_{i=1}^m \gamma_i(t) H_i$ where $\gamma_i(t)$ (and its higher order derivatives) is bounded, computable function of time $t$, and each $H_i$ is time-independent, and could be efficiently simulated. Our quantum algorithms are based on high-order Runge-Kutta method and forward Euler method, where the time interval is divided into subintervals. Then in an iterative manner, the evolution operator at given time step is built upon the evolution operator at previous time step, utilizing algorithmic operations from the recently introduced quantum singular value transformation framework.</description>

      <title>An abstract structure determines the contextuality degree of observable-based Kochen-Specker proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article delves into the concept of quantum contextuality, specifically focusing on proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem obtained by assigning Pauli observables to hypergraph vertices satisfying a given commutation relation. The abstract structure composed of this hypergraph and the graph of anticommutations is named a hypergram. Its labelings with Pauli observables generalize the well-known magic sets. A first result is that all these quantum labelings satisfying the conditions of a given hypergram inherently possess the same degree of contextuality. Then we provide a necessary and sufficient algebraic condition for the existence of such quantum labelings and an efficient algorithm to find one of them. We finally attach to each assignable hypergram an abstract notion of contextuality degree. By presenting the study of observable-based Kochen-Specker proofs from the perspective of graphs and matrices, this abstraction opens the way to new methods to search for original contextual configurations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel technique to numerically calculate R\'enyi entanglement entropies in lattice quantum field theory using generative models. We describe how flow-based approaches can be combined with the replica trick using a custom neural-network architecture around a lattice defect connecting two replicas. Numerical tests for the $\phi^4$ scalar field theory in two and three dimensions demonstrate that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art Monte Carlo calculations, and exhibit a promising scaling with the defect size.</description>

      <title>The multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality and the squashed entanglement of the extreme multimode bosonic Gaussian channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality for bosonic quantum systems. This inequality determines the minimum conditional von Neumann entropy of the output of the most general linear mixing of bosonic quantum modes among all the input states of the modes with given conditional entropies. Bosonic quantum systems constitute the mathematical model for the electromagnetic radiation in the quantum regime, which provides the most promising platform for quantum communication and quantum key distribution. We apply our multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality to determine new lower bounds to the squashed entanglement of a large family of bosonic quantum Gaussian states. The squashed entanglement is one of the main entanglement measures in quantum communication theory, providing the best known upper bound to the distillable key. Exploiting this result, we determine a new lower bound to the squashed entanglement of the multimode bosonic Gaussian channels that are extreme, i.e., that cannot be decomposed as a non-trivial convex combination of quantum channels. The squashed entanglement of a quantum channel provides an upper bound to its secret-key capacity, i.e., the capacity to generate a secret key shared between the sender and the receiver. Lower bounds to the squashed entanglement are notoriously hard to prove. Our results contribute to break this barrier and will stimulate further research in the field of quantum communication with bosonic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Nearly query-optimal classical shadow estimation of unitary channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical shadow estimation (CSE) is a powerful tool for learning properties of quantum states and quantum processes. Here we consider the CSE task for quantum unitary channels. By querying an unknown unitary channel $\mathcal{U}$ multiple times in quantum experiments, the goal is to learn a classical description of $\mathcal{U}$ such that one can later use it to accurately predict many different linear properties of the channel, i.e., the expectation values of arbitrary observables measured on the output of $\mathcal{U}$ upon arbitrary input states. Based on collective measurements on multiple systems, we propose a query efficient protocol for this task, whose query complexity achieves a quadratic advantage over previous best approach for this problem, and almost saturates the information-theoretic lower bound. To enhance practicality, we also present a variant protocol using only single-copy measurements, which still offers better query performance than any previous protocols that do not use additional quantum memories. In addition to linear properties, our protocol can also be applied to simultaneously predict many non-linear properties such as out-of-time-ordered correlators. Given the importance of CSE, this work may represent a significant advance in the study of learning unitary channels.</description>

      <title>Surpassing the fundamental limits of distillation with catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resource distillation is a fundamental task in quantum information science. Minimizing the distillation overhead, i.e., the amount of noisy source states required to produce some desired output state within some target error, is crucial for the scalability of quantum computation and communication. Here, we show that quantum catalysts -- an additional resource that facilitates the transformation but remains unchanged before and after the process -- can help surpass previously known fundamental limitations on distillation overhead. Specifically, we show that multi-shot distillation protocols can be converted into one-shot catalytic protocols, which hold significant practical benefits, while maintaining the distillation overhead. In particular, in the context of magic state distillation, our result indicates that the code-based low-overhead distillation protocols that rely on divergingly large batches can be promoted to the one-shot setting where the batch volume can be arbitrarily small for any accuracy. Combining with very recent results on asymptotically good quantum codes with transversal non-Clifford gates, we demonstrate that magic state distillation with constant overhead can be achieved with controllable output size using catalytic protocols. Furthermore, we demonstrate that catalysis enables a spacetime trade-off between overhead and success probability. Notably, we show that the optimal constant for constant-overhead catalytic magic state distillation can be reduced to $1$ at the price of compromising the success probability by a constant factor. Finally, we present an illustrative example that extends the catalysis techniques to the study of dynamic quantum resources. This provides the channel mutual information with a one-shot operational interpretation, thereby addressing an open question posed by Wilming.</description>

Abstract: Quantum mechanics and thermodynamics are foundational to modern physics. This paper introduces a novel framework, based on local operations with classical communication, fundamental paradigm in quantum information, incorporating the preservation of thermal equilibrium: local thermal operations and classical communication (LTOCC). We introduce a hierarchy of LTOCC, ordered according to the amount of control and communication. Next, we provide a detailed analysis of symmetric local thermal operations and classical communication ($\mathcal{S}$LTOCC), including majorization-based bounds on possible transitions and properties such as generation of strong correlations from Gibbs states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-duration and efficient quantum memories for photons are key components of quantum repeater and network applications. To achieve long duration storage in atomic systems, a short-lived optical coherence can be mapped into a long-lived spin coherence, which is the basis for many quantum memory schemes. In this work, we present modeling and measurements of the back-and-forth, i.e. reversible, optical-to-spin conversion for an atomic frequency comb memory. The AFC memory is implemented in $^{151}\textrm{Eu}^{3+}:\textrm{Y}_2\textrm{SiO}_5$ with an applied magnetic field of 231 mT, which allows lifting Zeeman transition degeneracy which otherwise cause time-domain interference in the optical-to-spin conversion. By optimizing the conversion using the developed simulation tool, we achieve a total efficiency of up to 96%, including the spin echo sequence and spin dephasing, for a storage time of 500 $\mu$s. Our methods and results pave the way for long-duration storage of single photon states in 151Eu3+:Y2SiO5 with high signal-to-noise, at the millisecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Many-body enhancement of energy storage in a waveguide-QED quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries have demonstrated remarkable charging properties, showing that a quantum advantage is possible in the realm of quantum thermodynamics. However, finding an effective strategy to store energy for long periods remains crucial in these systems. Here, we investigate different configurations of a waveguide-QED system acting as a quantum battery and show that, in this context, collective effects can slow down the self-discharging time of the battery, thus improving the storage time. Specifically, when the artificial atoms of the array are arranged randomly, the energy and ergotropy of the optical system are shown to decay at a subexponential rate over long periods, in contrast to the energy decay of a single atom in a waveguide. In the case of atoms arranged in an ordered lattice, collective effects slow down dissipative discharging only for a specific lattice spacing. Thus, in both configurations, collective effects can be used to boost the energy-protection properties of optical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal effects in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Hegger (SSH) topological insulator are studied. Particularly, we focus on quantum information processing (QIP) capacity for thermal ensembles. To evaluate QIP an optimized quantum Fisher information (OQFI) is introduced as a quantifier of entanglement and topological phases are calculated by a definition in real space for the electric polarization of mixture states. For the thermal ensemble, there is a relationship between the Fisher metric and the electric polarization in such a way that in the topological region, there is more entanglement, therefore, these generate more robustness and protection in the quantum information due to thermal effects. Also, long-range hopping effects are studied and it is found that in this case, the OQFI captures these topological phase transitions in the limit of low temperature by this formalism in real space.</description>

      <title>Spoofing of Quantum Channels Enables Low-Rank Projective Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to characterise and discern quantum channels is a crucial aspect of noisy quantum technologies. In this work, we explore the problem of distinguishing quantum channels when limited to sub-exponential resources, framed as von Neumann (projective) measurements. We completely characterise equivalence classes of quantum channels with different Kraus ranks that have the same marginal distributions under compatible projective measurements. In doing so, we explicitly identify gauge freedoms which can be varied without changing those compatible marginal outcome distributions, opening new avenues for quantum channel simulation, variational quantum channels, as well as novel adversarial strategies in noisy quantum device certification. Specifically, we show how a Sinkhorn-like algorithm enables us to find the minimum admissible Kraus rank that generates the correct outcome marginals. For a generic $d$-dimensional quantum system, this lowers the Kraus rank from $d^2$ to the theoretical minimum of $d$. For up to $d = 20$, we numerically demonstrate our findings, for which the code is available and open source. Finally, we provide an analytic algorithm for the special case of spoofing Pauli channels.</description>

      <title>Experimental protocol for observing single quantum many-body scars with transmon qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are energy eigenstates which fail to reproduce thermal expectation values of local observables in systems, where the rest of the many-body spectrum fulfils eigenstate thermalization. Experimental observation of quantum many-body scars has so far been limited to models with multiple scar states. Here we propose protocols to observe single scars in architectures of fixed-frequency, fixed-coupling superconducting qubits. We first adapt known models possessing the desired features into a form particularly suited for the experimental platform. We develop protocols for the implementation of these models, through trotterized sequences of two-qubit cross-resonance interactions, and verify the existence of the approximate scar state in the stroboscopic effective Hamiltonian. Since a single scar cannot be detected from coherent revivals in the dynamics, differently from towers of scar states, we propose and numerically investigate alternative and experimentally-accessible signatures. These include the dynamical response of the scar to local state deformations, to controlled noise, and to the resolution of the Lie-Suzuki-Trotter digitization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major goal in quantum computing is to build a fault-tolerant quantum computer. One approach involves quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes that support transversal non-Clifford gates. In this work, we provide a large family of such codes. The key insight is to interpret the logical operators of qLDPC codes as geometric surfaces and use the intersection number of these surfaces to define the non-Clifford operation. At a more abstract level, this construction is based on defining the cup product on the chain complex induced from a sheaf.</description>

      <title>Generalization Error in Quantum Machine Learning in the Presence of Sampling Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tackling sampling noise due to finite shots of quantum measurement is an unavoidable challenge when extracting information in machine learning with physical systems. Eigentask Learning was developed in recent work as a framework for learning in the presence of sampling noise. In that work, numerical evidence was presented that extracting low-noise contributions of features can improve performance for machine learning tasks, displaying robustness to overfitting, and increasing generalization accuracy. The issue of characterizing generalization errors in situations where the training dataset is finite remains unresolved in the previous work. In this study, we use methodologies from statistical mechanics to calculate the training and generalization errors of a generic quantum machine learning system when the input training dataset and output measurement sampling shots are both finite. Our analytical findings, supported by numerical validation, offer solid justification that Eigentask Learning provides optimal learning in the sense of minimizing generalization errors.</description>

      <title>Quantum LDPC Codes with Transversal Non-Clifford Gates via Products of Algebraic Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every integer $r\geq 2$ and every $\epsilon&gt;0$, we construct an explicit infinite family of quantum LDPC codes supporting a transversal $C^{r-1}Z$ gate with length $N$, dimension $K\geq N^{1-\epsilon}$, distance $D\geq N^{1/r}/\operatorname{poly}(\log N)$, and stabilizer weight $w\leq\operatorname{poly}(\log N)$. The previous state of the art construction (in most parameter regimes) was the $r$-dimensional color code, which has only constant dimension $K=O(1)$, and otherwise has the same parameters up to polylogarithmic factors. Our construction provides the first known codes with low-weight stabilizers that are capable of magic state distillation with arbitrarily small yield parameter $\gamma=\log(N/K)/\log(D)&gt;0$.
  A classical analogue of transversal $C^{r-1}Z$ gates is given by the multiplication property, which requires component-wise products of classical codewords to belong to another similar code. As a byproduct of our techniques, we also obtain a new construction of classical locally testable codes with such a multiplication property.
  We construct our codes as products of chain complexes associated to classical LDPC codes, which in turn we obtain by imposing local Reed-Solomon codes on a specific spectral expander that we construct. We prove that our codes support the desired transversal $C^{r-1}Z$ gates by using the multiplication property to combine local circuits based on the topological structure.</description>

      <title>Probing hidden topology with quantum detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the transition rate of a static Unruh-DeWitt detector in two $(2+1)$-dimensional black hole spacetimes that are isometric to the static Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole outside the horizon but have no asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter exterior behind the horizon. The spacetimes are the $\mathbb{R}\text{P}^{2}$ geon, with spatial topology $\mathbb{R}\text{P}^{2}\setminus\{\text{point at infinity}\}$, and the Swedish geon of \AA{}minneborg et al, with spatial topology $T^{2}\setminus\{\text{point at infinity}\}$. For a conformal scalar field, prepared in the Hartle-Hawking-type state that is induced from the global vacuum on the anti-de Sitter covering space, we show numerically that the detector's transition rate distinguishes the two spacetimes, particularly at late exterior times, and we trace this phenomenon to the differences in the isometries that are broken by the quotient construction from the universal covering space. Our results provide an example in which information about the interior topology of a black hole is accessible to a quantum observer outside the black hole.</description>

      <title>Wave turbulence in driven dipolar gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium turbulent response of driven three-dimensional dipolar gases is monitored by dynamically crossing the supersolid-to-superfluid phase transition and vice versa utilizing a periodically modulated scattering length. Following the generation of vortical defects in the bulk, a direct cascade front emerges transporting energy from larger to smaller length scales and leading to a nonequilibrium quasi-steady state at long evolution times. This quasi-steady state is evidenced by the self-similar character of the momentum distributions featuring an algebraic reduction at large momenta with scaling exponents supporting the existence of wave turbulence. We observe that supersolidity sustaining higher-lying momenta, associated with the roton minimum, promotes the emergence of turbulence. Our results provide a stepping stone for unravelling and exploiting turbulent and self-similar behavior in anisotropically interacting quantum gases amenable in current experiments.</description>

      <title>Wigner-function formalism for the detection of single microwave pulses in a resonator-coupled double quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor double quantum dots (DQD) coupled to superconducting microwave resonators offer a promising platform for the detection of single microwave photons. In previous works, the photodetection was studied for a monochromatic source of microwave photons. Here, we theoretically analyze the photodetection of single microwave pulses. The photodetection in this case can be seen as a non-linear filtering process of an incoming signal, the pulse, to an outgoing one, the photocurrent. This analogy to signal processing motivated the derivation of a Wigner-function formalism which provides a compelling visualization of the time and frequency properties of the photodetector for low intensities. We find a trade-off between detecting the time and the frequency of the incoming photons in agreement with the time-energy uncertainty relation. As the intensity of the source increases, the photodetection is influenced by coherent Rabi oscillations of the DQD. Our findings give insight into the time-dependent properties of microwave photons interacting with electrons in a DQD-resonator hybrid system and provide guidance for experiments on single microwave pulse detection.</description>

      <title>Quenching from superfluid to free bosons in two dimensions: entanglement, symmetries, and quantum Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of bosons in a two-dimensional optical lattice after a sudden quench from the superfluid phase to the free-boson regime. The initial superfluid state is described approximately using both the Bogoliubov theory and the Gaussian variational principle. The subsequent time evolution remains Gaussian, and we compare the results from each approximation of the initial state by examining different aspects of the dynamics. First, we analyze the entanglement entropy and observe that, in both cases, it increases linearly with time before reaching a saturation point. This behavior is attributed to the propagation of entangled pairs of quantum depletions in the superfluid state. Next, we explore the fate of particle-number symmetry, which is spontaneously broken in the superfluid phase. To do so, we use the entanglement asymmetry, a recently introduced observable that enables us to track symmetry breaking within a subsystem. We observe that its evolution varies qualitatively depending on the theory used to describe the initial state. However, in both cases, the symmetry remains broken and is never restored in the stationary state. Finally, we assess the time it takes to reach the stationary state by evaluating the quantum fidelity between the stationary reduced density matrix and the time-evolved one. Interestingly, within the Gaussian variational principle, we find that an initial state further from the stationary state can relax more quickly than one closer to it, indicating the presence of the recently discovered quantum Mpemba effect. We derive the microscopic conditions necessary for this effect to occur and demonstrate that these conditions are never met in the Bogoliubov theory.</description>

      <title>Pull-in features of nanoswitches in the Casimir regime with account of contact repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cantilever tip of a nanoswitch in close proximity to the ground plate is considered with account of electrostatic, elastic, van der Waals (Casimir), and also contact repulsive forces. The van der Waals (Casimir) and contact repulsive forces are computed for a Si cantilever and either Au or Ni ground plates using the Lifshitz theory and the method of pairwise summation with account of surface roughness. It is shown that at short separations an impact of the van der Waals (Casimir) force leads to the pull-in and collapse of a cantilever onto the ground plate if the contact repulsion is disregarded. Taking into consideration contact repulsion, the nanoswitch is demonstrated to have the stable cyclic behavior with no pull-in when switching voltage on and off.</description>

      <title>Side-gate modulation of supercurrent in InSb nanoflag-based Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: InSb nanoflags, due to their intrinsic spin-orbit interactions, are an interesting platform in the study of planar Josephson junctions. Ballistic transport, combined with high transparency of the superconductor/semiconductor interfaces, was reported to lead to interesting phenomena such as the Josephson diode effect. The versatility offered by the planar geometry can be exploited to manipulate both carrier concentration and spin-orbit strength by electrical means. Here we present experimental results on InSb nanoflag-based Josephson junctions fabricated with side-gates placed in close proximity to the junction. We show that side-gates can efficiently modulate the current through the junction, both in the dissipative and in the dissipation-less regimes, similarly to what obtained with a conventional back-gate. Furthermore, the side-gates can be used to influence the Fraunhofer interference pattern induced by the presence of an external out-of-plane magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Probing the massive scalar mode in the levitated sensor detector of gravitational wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to the mass scale associated with the scalar longitudinal mode signal of gravitational wave predicted by modified theories of gravity, it should propagate at a subluminal speed and with a different frequency compared to the massless tensor mode signals which moves at the speed of light and are present in both standard general relativity and modified theories. This is ensured by the massless and massive dispersion relations obeyed respectively by the tensor and scalar modes of gravitational wave coming from a given source and thus having the same propagation vector. We show that because of its wider operational frequency band the recently designed levitated sensor detector \cite{Aggarwal} of gravitational wave has a better chance of detecting both the scalar and tensor modes at these different frequencies and thus can provide observational evidence in favour of modified theories of gravity over general relativity. This detector works on the principle of optical trapping \cite{Ashkin_1970} of a dielectric nanosphere sensor\cite{Geraci}. By adjusting the intensity of the optical beam the frequency of the harmonic potential trap can be varied widely so that the nanosphere sensor can undergo distinct resonant transitions induced by the tensor and scalar modes. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the sensor mass obeys a geodesic deviation equation in the proper detector frame and construct a quantum mechanical description of this system in modified gravity framework to compute the probabilities of resonant transitions in response to incoming gravitational wave signals of both periodic and aperiodic kind.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study a previously unexplored class of topological states protected by hidden chiral symmetries that are local, that is, that protect against any off-diagonal disorder. We derive their related topological invariant for the first time, and show that these previously unidentified symmetries can act together with standard chiral symmetries to increase the protection of the end modes, using the Creutz ladder as an example. Finally, thanks to local hidden symmetries, we show that the diamond necklace chain can have three different types of topological end modes: strong, weak or square-root, with some of the states inheriting their topology from others. This marks the first time a square-root topological insulator is identified as its own parent.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum computational framework for SU(2) lattice gauge theory, leveraging continuous variables instead of discrete qubits to represent the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of the gauge fields. We consider a ladder as well as a two-dimensional grid of plaquettes, detailing the use of gauge fixing to reduce the degrees of freedom and simplify the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate how the system dynamics, ground states, and energy gaps can be computed using the continuous-variable approach to quantum computing. Our results indicate that it is feasible to study non-Abelian gauge theories with continuous variables, providing new avenues for understanding the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effect of coupling a two-dimensional many-body localized system to a finite heat bath, using shallow quantum circuits as a variational ansatz. Specifically, we simulate optical lattice experiments with two components of ultracold bosons, where only one species is subject to a random disorder potential and the other acts as a heat bath. We obtain a filling fraction dependent phase diagram with a critical filling consistent with experiments. We also calculate two-point correlation functions and the quantum mutual information between sites. We observe a distribution of the quantum mutual information in the many-body localized regime which is consistent with the presence of resonances, similar to those observed in one-dimensional many-body localized systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Universally Composable Oblivious Linear Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.14171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oblivious linear evaluation is a generalization of oblivious transfer, whereby two distrustful parties obliviously compute a linear function, f (x) = ax + b, i.e., each one provides their inputs that remain unknown to the other, in order to compute the output f (x) that only one of them receives. From both a structural and a security point of view, oblivious linear evaluation is fundamental for arithmetic-based secure multi-party computation protocols. In the classical case, oblivious linear evaluation protocols can be generated using oblivious transfer, and their quantum counterparts can, in principle, be constructed as straightforward extensions using quantum oblivious transfer. Here, we present the first, to the best of our knowledge, quantum protocol for oblivious linear evaluation that, furthermore, does not rely on quantum oblivious transfer. We start by presenting a semi-honest protocol, and then extend it to the dishonest setting employing a commit-and-open strategy. Our protocol uses high-dimensional quantum states to obliviously compute f (x) on Galois Fields of prime and prime-power dimension. These constructions utilize the existence of a complete set of mutually unbiased bases in prime-power dimension Hilbert spaces and their linear behaviour upon the Heisenberg-Weyl operators. We also generalize our protocol to achieve vector oblivious linear evaluation, where several instances of oblivious linear evaluation are generated, thus making the protocol more efficient. We prove the protocols to have static security in the framework of quantum universal composability.</description>

      <title>On the stability of solutions to Schr\"{o}dinger's equation short of the adiabatic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an adiabatic theorem that applies at timescales short of the typical adiabatic limit. Our proof analyzes the stability of solutions to Schrodinger's equation under perturbation. We directly characterize cross-subspace effects of perturbation, which are typically significantly less than suggested by the perturbation's operator norm. This stability has numerous consequences: we can (1) find timescales where the solution of Schrodinger's equation converges to the ground state of a subspace, (2) lower bound the convergence to the global ground state by demonstrating convergence to some other known quantum state, (3) guarantee faster convergence than the standard adiabatic theorem when the ground state of the perturbed Hamiltonian is close to that of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, and (4) bound leakage effects in terms of the global spectral gap when the Hamiltonian is ``stoquastic'' (a $Z$-matrix). Our results can help explain quantum annealing protocols that exhibit faster convergence than is guaranteed by a standard adiabatic theorem. Our upper and lower bounds demonstrate that at timescales short of the adiabatic limit, subspace dynamics can dominate over global dynamics. Thus, we see that, when our results apply, convergence to particular global target states can be understood as the result of local dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we introduce an autonomous method for addressing the detection and classification of quantum entanglement, a core element of quantum mechanics that has yet to be fully understood. We employ a multi-layer perceptron to effectively identify entanglement in both two- and three-qubit systems. Our technique yields impressive detection results, achieving nearly perfect accuracy for two-qubit systems and over $90\%$ accuracy for three-qubit systems. Additionally, our approach successfully categorizes three-qubit entangled states into distinct groups with a success rate of up to $77\%$. These findings indicate the potential for our method to be applied to larger systems, paving the way for advancements in quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Quantum Hopfield Network: A numerical analysis</title>

Abstract: We present extensive simulations of a quantum version of the Hopfield Neural Network to explore its emergent behavior. The system is a network of $N$ qubits oscillating at a given $\Omega$ frequency and which are coupled via Lindblad jump operators built with local fields $h_i$ depending on some given stored patterns. Our simulations show the emergence of pattern-antipattern oscillations of the overlaps with the stored patterns similar (for large $\Omega$ and small temperature) to those reported within a recent mean-field description of such a system, and which are originated deterministically by the quantum term including $s_x^i$ qubit operators. However, in simulations we observe that such oscillations are stochastic due to the interplay between noise and the inherent metastability of the pattern attractors induced by quantum oscillations, and then are damped in finite systems when one averages over many quantum trajectories. In addition, we report the system behavior for large number of stored patterns at the lowest temperature we can reach in simulations (namely $T=0.005\, T_C$). Our study reveals that for small-size systems the quantum term of the Hamiltonian has a negative effect on storage capacity, decreasing the overlap with the starting memory pattern for increased values of $\Omega$ and number of stored patterns. However, it also impedes the system to be trapped for long time in mixtures and spin-glass states. Interestingly, the system also presents a range of $\Omega$ values for which, although the initial pattern is destabilized due to quantum oscillations, other patterns can be retrieved and remain stable even for many stored patterns, implying a quantum-dependent nonlinear relationship between the recall process and the number of stored patterns.</description>

Abstract: We present a new method for target finding and ranging in Lidar applications using high-dimensional Bell states. Combined with a sequential decision rule, this scheme asymptotically achieves zero error probability with finite energy expenditure. This result stems from the synergy of high-dimensional entanglement suppressing false positives and the sequential decision rule optimizing energy usage. It effectively provides a pathway to unbounded quantum advantage over classical methods and has substantial implications for high-precision sensing in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds on Pauli channel learning without entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource for learning properties from nature, but a precise characterization of its advantage can be challenging. In this work, we consider learning algorithms without entanglement to be those that only utilize states, measurements, and operations that are separable between the main system of interest and an ancillary system. Interestingly, we show that these algorithms are equivalent to those that apply quantum circuits on the main system interleaved with mid-circuit measurements and classical feedforward. Within this setting, we prove a tight lower bound for Pauli channel learning without entanglement that closes the gap between the best-known upper and lower bound. In particular, we show that $\Theta(2^n\varepsilon^{-2})$ rounds of measurements are required to estimate each eigenvalue of an $n$-qubit Pauli channel to $\varepsilon$ error with high probability when learning without entanglement. In contrast, a learning algorithm with entanglement only needs $\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2})$ copies of the Pauli channel. The tight lower bound strengthens the foundation for an experimental demonstration of entanglement-enhanced advantages for Pauli noise characterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a strategy to develop optimally designed fields for continuous dynamical decoupling. Using our methodology, we obtain the optimal continuous field configuration to maximize the fidelity of a general one-qubit quantum gate. To achieve this, considering dephasing-noise perturbations, we employ an auxiliary qubit instead of the boson bath to implement a purification scheme, which results in unitary dynamics. Employing the sub-Riemannian geometry framework for the two-qubit unitary group, we derive and numerically solve the geodesic equations, obtaining the optimal time-dependent control Hamiltonian. Also, due to the extended time required to find solutions to the geodesic equations, we train a neural network on a subset of geodesic solutions, enabling us to promptly generate the time-dependent control Hamiltonian for any desired gate, which is crucial in circuit optimization.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Purity and Heralding Efficiency of Type-I Down-Converted Photons Using Beam Focal Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate theoretically that correlated bi-photons can be generated with high heralding efficiency and high spectral purity for non-collinear Type-I spontaneous parametric down-conversion. In Type-I down-conversion, the generated photons have the same linear polarization that is perpendicular to the linear pump polarization. Previously, it was thought that high efficiency and purity could not be obtained for this configuration. We show that the non-collinear geometry gives an additional degree-of-freedom that allows for simultaneous optimization of these source metrics. We predict near-unity ($\approx0.97$) heralding efficiency and single-photon spectral purity by adjusting the beam focal parameters, which can be obtained over a wide range of pump, signal, and idler wavelengths without requiring special crystal dispersion characteristics. As an example, we predict a heralding efficiency of 0.97, a single-photon purity of 0.97, and a pair production rate of 0.50 pairs/(s$~$mW$~$THz) using a 400-$\mu$m-long $\beta$-barium borate crystal pumped by a 355-nm-wavelength pulsed laser with a bandwidth of 8-THz. Our work offers a simple and universal approach for producing high-quality quantum photonic states for a wide variety of quantum information science applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theory of detection of microwave photons with a flux qubit-based detector is presented. We consider semiclassical approximation with the electromagnetic field being in a coherent state. Flux qubit is considered as a multilevel quantum system (qudit). By solving the Lindblad equation, we describe the time evolution of occupations of the qudit's levels for readout and reset stages of detection. When considering the reset stage, the time evolution is described by multiple avoided-level crossings, thus providing a multilevel Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) problem. In addition to numerical calculations, we present an approximate solution for the description of the reset stage dynamics based on the adiabatic-impulse approximation and rate equation approach. Our theory may be useful for the theoretical description of driven-dissipative dynamics of qudits, including applications such as single-photon detection.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel input scheme for general second-quantized Hamiltonians of relativistic or non-relativistic many-fermion systems. This input scheme incorporates the fermionic anticommutation relations, particle number variations, and respects the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. Based on our input scheme, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework for spectral calculations on future quantum hardwares. We provide explicit circuit designs and the associated gate cost. We demonstrate our hybrid framework by solving the low-lying spectra of ${^{42}}$Ca and ${^{46}}$Ca. Our input scheme provides new pathways to solving the spectra and dynamics of the relativistic and nonrelativistic many-fermion systems via first-principles approaches.</description>

      <title>Catalytic enhancement in the performance of the microscopic two-stroke heat engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model of heat engine operating in the microscopic regime: the two-stroke engine. It produces work and exchanges heat in two discrete strokes that are separated in time. The working body of the engine consists of two $d$-level systems initialized in thermal states at two distinct temperatures. Additionally, an auxiliary non-equilibrium system called catalyst may be incorporated with the working body of the engine, provided the state of the catalyst remains unchanged after the completion of a thermodynamic cycle. This ensures that the work produced by the engine arises solely from the temperature difference. Upon establishing the rigorous thermodynamic framework, we characterize two-fold improvement stemming from the inclusion of a catalyst. Firstly, we prove that in the non-catalytic scenario, the optimal efficiency of the two-stroke heat engine with a working body composed of two-level systems is given by the Otto efficiency, which can be surpassed by incorporating a catalyst with the working body. Secondly, we show that incorporating a catalyst allows the engine to operate in frequency and temperature regimes that are not accessible for non-catalytic two-stroke engines. We conclude with general conjecture about advantage brought by catalyst: including the catalyst with the working body always allows to improve efficiency over the non-catalytic scenario for any microscopic two-stroke heat engines. We prove the conjecture for two-stroke engines when the working body is composed of two $d$-level systems initialized in thermal states at two distinct temperatures, as long as the final joint state leading to optimal efficiency in the non-catalytic scenario is not product, or at least one of the $d$-level system is not thermal.</description>

Abstract: Enhancing the precision of measurements by harnessing entanglement is a long-sought goal in the field of quantum metrology. Yet attaining the best sensitivity allowed by quantum theory in the presence of noise is an outstanding challenge, requiring optimal probe-state generation and readout strategies. Neutral atom optical clocks, leading systems for measuring time, have shown recent progress in terms of entanglement generation, but currently lack the control capabilities to realize such schemes. Here we show universal quantum operations and ancilla-based readout for ultranarrow optical transitions of neutral atoms. Our demonstration in a tweezer clock platform enables a circuit-based approach to quantum metrology with neutral atom optical clocks. To this end, we demonstrate two-qubit entangling gates with 99.62(3)% fidelity - averaged over symmetric input states - via Rydberg interactions and dynamical connectivity for optical clock qubits, which we combine with local addressing to implement universally programmable quantum circuits. Using this approach, we generate a near-optimal entangled probe state, a cascade of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states of different sizes, and perform dual-quadrature GHZ readout. We also show repeated fast phase detection with non-destructive conditional reset of clock qubits and minimal dead time between repetitions by implementing ancilla-based quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS) for neutral atoms. Finally, we extend this to multi-qubit parity checks and measurement-based, heralded, Bell state preparation. Our work lays the foundation for hybrid processor-clock devices with neutral atoms and more generally points to a future of practical applications for quantum processors linked with quantum sensors.</description>

Abstract: In optical communication the transmitter encodes information into a set of light states defined by the modulation format, selected to accommodate specific channel conditions and to remain sufficiently distinguishable at the output. Various receiver architectures have been designed to improve the demodulation performance, ultimately limited by quantum theory. In this work I introduce a new receiver based on a locally optimal greedy algorithm and apply it to pulse position modulation. The receiver reduces the error probabilities of previously proposed strategies in all signal strength regimes and achieves results comparable with those obtained by numerical optimization of the detection process. In contrast, however, it is conceptually simple and therefore can be scaled to arbitrarily high modulation orders for which numerical methods become intractable. In the photon-starved regime characteristic of deep space optical communication, the greedy receiver approaches the quantum-optimal Helstrom bound on state discrimination error probability. In the regime of few-photon pulses, the error reduction offered over the other methods grows up to an order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Computations with quantum harmonic oscillators, or qumodes, represents a promising and rapidly evolving approach for quantum computing. Unlike qubits, which are two-level quantum systems, bosonic qumodes can have an infinite number of discrete levels, and can also be represented using continuous-variable bases. One of the most promising applications of quantum computing is the simulation of many-fermion problems, such as those encountered in molecular electronic structure calculations. In this work, we demonstrate how an electronic structure Hamiltonian can be transformed into a system of qumodes through qubit-assisted fermion-to-qumode mapping. After mapping the electronic structure Hamiltonian to a qubit Hamiltonian, we show how to represent it as a linear combination of bosonic gates, which can be universally controlled by qubits. We illustrate the potential of this mapping by applying it to the dihydrogen molecule, mapping the four-qubit Hamiltonian to a qubit-qumode system. The preparation of the trial qumode state and the computation of the expectation value are achieved by coupling the mapped qubit-qumode system with an ancilla qubit. This enables the formulation of bosonic variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms, such as those on hybrid qubit-qumode gates like echoed conditional displacement (ECD-VQE) or selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP-VQE), to determine the ground state of the dihydrogen molecule. In circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) hardware, these methods can be efficiently implemented using a microwave resonator coupled to two superconducting transmon qubits. We anticipate the reported work will pave the way for simulating many-fermion systems by leveraging the potential of hybrid qubit-qumode quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density-matrix topology, defined through the geometric property of the relevant modular Hamiltonian, can undergo transitions in the corresponding open-system dynamics. While symmetry considerations are crucial to ensure such a dynamic topological transition, we show that a hidden parity-time symmetry can further facilitate it. Considering the Lindbladian dynamics of a fermionic Gaussian state, we extract the time-evolved density-matrix topology from the single-particle correlation, whose dynamics is governed by a non-Hermitian damping matrix. We show that, for a parity-time symmetric damping matrix and a chiral symmetric correlation matrix, a dynamic transition in the density-matrix topology necessarily occurs in the parity-time unbroken regime where eigenvalues of the damping matrix are real. We illustrate our results using a concrete model, and map out the dynamic phase diagram.Remarkably, we find that the dynamic transition can also happen periodically in the parity-time symmetry broken regime.</description>

Abstract: Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation is a promising approach for implementing quantum gates, offering both efficiency and robustness against certain types of errors. A key element of this approach is a geometric constraint known as the parallel transport condition. In line with the principle of covariance, this condition must be appropriately modified when changing reference frames. In this paper, we detail how to adjust the parallel transport condition when transitioning from the laboratory frame to a rotating reference frame. Furthermore, building on gauge invariance considerations, we develop a framework for nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation with projective gates. The parallel transport condition of this framework effectively addresses the issue of global dynamical phases inherent in conventional nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation. Finally, we extend the isoholonomic inequality to projective gates, establishing a minimum execution time for projective holonomic quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Entangling Quantum Memories at Channel Capacity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entangling quantum memories, mediated by optical-frequency or microwave channels, at high rates and fidelities is key for linking qubits across short and long ranges. All well-known protocols encode up to one qubit per optical mode, hence entangling one pair of memory qubits per transmitted mode over the channel, with probability $\eta$, the channel's transmissivity. The rate is proportional to $\eta$ ideal Bell states (ebits) per mode. The quantum capacity, $C(\eta) = -\log_2(1-{\eta})$ ebits per mode, which $\approx 1.44\eta$ for high loss, i.e., $\eta \ll 1$, thereby making these schemes near rate-optimal. However, $C(\eta) \to \infty$ as $\eta \to 1$, making the known schemes highly rate-suboptimal for shorter ranges. We show that a cavity-assisted memory-photon interface can be used to entangle matter memories with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) photonic qudits, which along with dual-homodyne entanglement swaps that retain analog information, enables entangling memories at capacity-approaching rates at low loss. We benefit from loss resilience of GKP qudits, and their ability to encode multiple qubits in one mode. Our memory-photon interface further supports the preparation of needed ancilla GKP qudits. We expect our result to spur research in low-loss high-cooperativity cavity-coupled qubits with high-efficiency optical coupling, and demonstrations of high-rate short-range quantum links.</description>

      <title>Interfacing Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Qubits to Quantum Memories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states have been demonstrated to pose significant advantages when utilized for fault-tolerant all optical continuous-variable quantum computing as well as for quantum communications links for entanglement distribution. However interfacing these systems to long-lived solid-state quantum memories has remained an open problem. Here we propose an interface between quantum memories and GKP qubit states based on a cavity-mediated controlled displacement gate. We characterize the quality of memory-GKP entanglement as a function of cavity parameters suggesting optimal regimes of operation for high-quality state transfer between either qubit states. We further extend this protocol to demonstrate the creation of GKP cluster states by avoiding the requirement of ancillary optical quadrature-squeezed light. Utilizing post-selected entanglement swapping operations for GKP qubits, we demonstrate the utility of our protocol for high-rate entanglement generation between quantum memories. Extensions and derivatives of our proposal could enable a wide variety of applications by utilizing the operational trade-offs for qubits encoded in memory and in the GKP basis.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Noise Induced Decoherence in Stern-Gerlach Interferometers for Gravity Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stern-Gerlach interferometer (SGI) is a kind of matter-wave interferometer driven by magnetic field and has been proposed for many gravity experiments. Acceleration noises such as vibration and inertial forces, together with higher-order noises like the fluctuation of the gravity gradient or the magnetic field, can cause decoherence problems of SGI, including dephasing, loss of contrast and position localization decoherence. In this paper, I will theoretically study these mechanisms of decoherence based on the analytical time-evolution operator of an SGI modelled as a harmonic oscillator under acceleration noises described by Gaussian stochastic processes. As will be proved, for a single arm of an SGI, the shape of the Wigner function keeps invariant under an acceleration noise, although the phase and the coordinate in the classical phase space fluctuate as linear responses to the noise, and the spatial quantum state of a single path experiences a fidelity loss and position localization decoherence. For the witness constructed in the spin space, the degrees of freedom in the classical phase space have to be traced out, then acceleration noises can lead to dephasing effects on the witness, while the fidelity loss or position localization decoherence don't affect the density matrix in spin space as long as the noise is uniform to both arms of the interferometer. By contrast, path-dependent noises can lead to a loss of Loschmidt echo, resulting in a decoherence in the spin space, known as the Humpty-Dumpty problem. A final remark is that the randomness of the noise is essential for dephasing and position-localization decoherence, and these two mechanisms don't cause purity loss or entropy increase if the noise is determinstic rather than stochastic.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Angular Momentum of a Neutron Using Earth's Rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A coupling between Earths rotation and orbital angular momentum (OAM), known as the Sagnac effect, is observed in entangled neutrons produced using a spin echo interferometer. After correction for instrument systematics the measured coupling is within 5% of theory, with an uncertainty of 7.2%. The OAM in our setup is transverse to the propagation direction and scales linearly with wavelength (4 A - 12.75 A), hence the coupling can be varied, without mechanically rotating the device. Therefore, the systematic error is lower than in previous experiments. The detected transverse OAM of our beam corresponds to 4098 +- 295 hbar A-1, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous neutron experiments, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of using the Sagnac effect to definitively measure neutron OAM and paving the way towards observations of the quantum Sagnac effect</description>

      <title>General theory of cavity-mediated interactions between low-energy matter excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The manipulation of low-energy matter properties such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity via cavity quantum electrodynamics engineering has been suggested as a way to enhance these many-body collective phenomena. In this work, we investigate the effective interactions between low-energy matter excitations induced by the off-resonant coupling with cavity electromagnetic modes. We extend previous work by going beyond the dipole approximation accounting for the full polarization and magnetization densities of matter. We further include the often neglected diamagnetic interaction and, for the cavity, we consider general linear absorbing media with possibly non-local and non-reciprocal response. We demonstrate that, even in this general scenario, the effective cavity-induced interactions between the matter degrees of freedom are of electrostatic and magnetostatic nature. This confirms the necessity of a multimode description for cavity engineering of matter systems where the low-energy assumption holds. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for studying the influence of general optical environments on extended low-energy matter excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce rainbow codes, a novel class of quantum error correcting codes generalising colour codes and pin codes. Rainbow codes can be defined on any $D$-dimensional simplicial complex that admits a valid $(D+1)$-colouring of its $0$-simplices. We study in detail the case where these simplicial complexes are derived from chain complexes obtained via the hypergraph product and, by reinterpreting these codes as collections of colour codes joined at domain walls, show that we can obtain code families with growing distance and number of encoded qubits as well as logical non-Clifford gates implemented by transversal application of $T$ and $T^\dag$. By combining these techniques with the quasi-hyperbolic colour codes of Zhu et al. (arXiv:2310.16982) we obtain families of codes with transversal non-Clifford gates and parameters $[\![n,O(n),O(log(n))]\!]$ which allow the magic-state yield parameter $\gamma = \log_d(n/k)$ to be made arbitrarily small. In contrast to other recent constructions that achieve $\gamma \rightarrow 0$ our codes are natively defined on qubits, are LDPC, and have logical non-Clifford gates implementable by single-qubit (rather than entangling) physical operations, but are not asymptotically good.</description>

      <title>High Precision Fault-Tolerant Quantum Circuit Synthesis by Diagonalization using Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resource efficient and high precision compilation of programs into quantum circuits expressed in Fault-Tolerant gate sets, such as the Clifford+T gate set, is vital for the success of quantum computing. Optimal analytical compilation methods are known for restricted classes of unitaries, otherwise the problem is intractable. Empirical search-based synthesis methods, including Reinforcement Learning and simulated annealing, can generate good implementations for a more extensive set of unitaries, but require trade-offs in approximation precision and resource use. We leverage search-based methods to reduce the general unitary synthesis problem to one of synthesizing diagonal unitaries; a problem solvable efficiently in general and optimally in the single-qubit case. We demonstrate how our approach improves the implementation precision attainable by Fault-Tolerant synthesis algorithms on an array of unitaries taken from real quantum algorithms. On these benchmarks, many of which cannot be handled by existing approaches, we observe an average of 95% fewer resource-intensive non-Clifford gates compared to the more general Quantum Shannon Decomposition. On a subset of algorithms of interest for future term applications, diagonalization can reduce T gate counts by up to 16.8% compared to other methods.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enhanced Counterdiabatic Quantum Algorithm for Qudits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qubit-based variational quantum algorithms have undergone rapid development in recent years but still face several challenges. In this context, we propose a symmetry-enhanced digitized counterdiabatic quantum algorithm utilizing qudits instead of qubits. This approach offers three types of compression as compared to with respect to conventional variational circuits. First, compression in the circuit depth is achieved by counterdiabatic protocols. Second, information about the problem is compressed by replacing qubits with qudits, allowing for a more efficient representation of the problem. Lastly, the number of parameters is reduced by employing the symmetries of the system. We illustrate this approach by tackling a graph-based optimization problem Max-3-Cut and a highly-entangled state preparation, the qutrit W state. As our numerical results show, we achieve a better convergence with a lower circuit depth and less measurement overhead in all the cases considered. This work leads to a better design of shallow variational quantum circuits, improving the feasibility of their implementation on near-term qudit devices</description>

      <title>Tailoring fusion-based photonic quantum computing schemes to quantum emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fusion-based quantum computation is a promising quantum computing model where small-sized photonic resource states are simultaneously entangled and measured by fusion gates. Such operations can be readily implemented with scalable photonic hardware: resource states can be deterministically generated by quantum emitters and fusions require only shallow linear-optical circuits. Here, we propose fusion-based architectures tailored to the capabilities and noise models in quantum emitters. We show that high tolerance to dominant physical error mechanisms can be achieved, with fault-tolerance thresholds of 8% for photon loss, 4% for photon distinguishability between emitters, and spin noise thresholds well above memory-induced errors for typical spin-photon interfaces. Our construction and analysis provide guidelines for the development of photonic quantum hardware targeting fault-tolerant applications with quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Code switching revisited: low-overhead magic state preparation using color codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to prepare a high-fidelity magic state on a 2D color code using a 3D color code. Our method modifies the known code switching protocol with (i) a transversal gate between the 2D and the 3D code and (ii) a judicious use of flag-based post-selection. We numerically demonstrate that these modifications lead to a significant improvement in the fidelity of the magic state. For instance, subjected to a uniform circuit-level noise of $10^{-3}$, our code switching protocol yields a magic state encoded in the distance-$3$ 2D color code with a logical infidelity of $4.6\times 10^{-5}\pm 1.6 \times 10^{-5}$ (quantified by an error-corrected logical state tomography) with a $84\%$ of acceptance rate. Used in conjunction with a more recently proposed post-selection approach, extrapolation from a polynomial fit suggests a fidelity improvement to $5.1 \times 10^{-7}$ for the same code. Finally, we also present a novel simulation technique akin to an extended stabilizer simulator which effectively incorporates the non-Clifford $T$-gate.</description>

      <title>Observable Measurement-Induced Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main postulates of quantum mechanics is that measurements destroy quantum coherence (wave function collapse). Recently it was discovered that in a many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence across the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase transition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different parts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe experimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially costly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the simulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the discovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed experimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase transition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is fully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum information is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change in the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in the process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each block the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the transition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions is increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through numerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations using an effective random-matrix theory model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the classical-quantum correspondence of non-Hermitian Spin-orbit (SO)-coupled bosonic junctions, where an effective decay term is introduced in one of the two wells. Starting from the normalized two-point functions, we analytically demonstrate that the mean-field system has a classical Hamiltonian structure, and we successfully derive a non-Hermitian discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger (Gross-Pitaevskii) equation. We discover that near the symmetry-breaking phase transition point, the correspondence between classical (mean-field) and quantum dynamics is more likely to break down. When the effective spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength assumes half-integer values, atomic self-trapping in the non-lossy well definitely occurs, regardless of the system parameters, and the quantum dynamics is insensitive to the number of particles. Additionally, we reveal that in both the mean-field and many-particle models, the SOC effects can greatly promote the synchronous periodic oscillations between the spin-up and spin-down components, and this synchronization dynamics is protected by a symmetry mechanism.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced dynamic control over the population of quantum emitters in two-dimensional materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of quantum emitters (QEs) in two-dimensional materials (2D) has triggered a surge of research to assess their suitability for quantum photonics. While their microscopic origin is still the subject of intense studies, position-controlled QEs are routinely fabricated using static strain gradients, which are used to drive excitons towards localized regions of the crystal where quantum light emission takes place. However, the use of strain in a dynamic fashion to control the brightness of single-photon sources in 2D materials has not been explored so far. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a novel hybrid semiconductorpiezoelectric device in which WSe2 monolayers are integrated onto piezoelectric pillars that provide both static and dynamic strains. The static strains are first used to induce the formation of QEs, whose emission shows photon anti-bunching. Their energy and brightness are then controlled via the application of voltages to the piezoelectric pillars. Numerical simulations combined with drift-diffusion equations show that these effects are due to a strain-induced modification of the confining-potential landscape, which in turn leads to a net redistribution of excitons among the different QEs. Our work provides a method to dynamically control the brightness of single photon sources based on 2D materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14121v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum phase transition of the one-dimensional long-range transverse-field Ising model is explored by combining the quantum Monte Carlo method and stochastic parameter optimization, specifically achieved by tuning correlation ratios so that space and imaginary time are isotropic. In our simulations, the simulator automatically determines the parameters to sample from, even without prior knowledge of the critical point and universality class. The leading-order finite-size corrections are eliminated by comparing two systems with different sizes; this procedure is also performed automatically. Varying the decay exponent of the long-range interaction, $\sigma$, we investigate $\sigma$-dependence of the dynamical exponent and the other critical exponents precisely in the mean-field, non-universal, and two-dimensional classical Ising universality regimes. We successfully obtained numerical evidence supporting $\sigma = 7/4$ as the universality boundary between the latter two.</description>

      <title>Circuit QED theory of direct and dual Shapiro steps with finite-size transmission line resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of direct and dual Shapiro steps for a Josephson junction coupled to a finite-size transmission line resonator. We treat both problems through a circuit QED approach with a large, but finite number of photon modes. For the dual case, we do not assume the (approximate) charge-phase duality, but include the full multi-band dynamics for the Josephson junction. Mean-field equations within such Hamiltonian approach reproduce the result obtained through a dissipative classical equation when the number of transmission line modes is large enough. To account for quantum and thermal fluctuations, we go beyond the mean-field treatment within a truncated Wigner approach. The fluctuations are shown to modify both the direct and the dual steps. We show how the dual steps are very sensitive to these fluctuations and identify the key physical parameters for the junction and the transmission line controlling their robustness, which is essential for applications to close the quantum metrological triangle.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek behavior in a topological phase transition with a quadratic band crossing</title>

Abstract: Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism describes the scaling behavior when driving a system across a continuous symmetry-breaking transition. Previous studies have shown that the KZ-like scaling behavior also lies in the topological transitions in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model (2D) and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model (1D), although symmetry breaking does not exist here. Both models with linear band crossings give that $\nu=1$ and $z=1$. We wonder whether different critical exponents can be acquired in topological transitions beyond linear band crossing. In this work, we look into the KZ behavior in a topological 2D checkerboard lattice with a quadratic band crossing. We investigate from dual perspectives: momentum distribution of the Berry curvature in clean systems for simplicity, and real-space analysis of domain-like local Chern marker configurations in disordered systems, which is a more intuitive analog to conventional KZ description. In equilibrium, we find the correlation length diverges with a power $\nu\simeq 1/2$. Then, by slowly quenching the system across the topological phase transition, we find that the freeze-out time $t_\mathrm{f}$ and the unfrozen length scale $\xi(t_\mathrm{f})$ both satisfy the KZ scaling, verifying $z\simeq 2$. We subsequently explore KZ behavior in topological phase transitions with other higher-order band crossing and find the relationship between the critical exponents and the order. Our results extend the understanding of the KZ mechanism and non-equilibrium topological phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: We propose that moments of time arise through the failed emergence of the temporal diffeomorphism as gauge symmetry, and that the passage of time is a continual process of an instantaneous state collapsing toward a gauge-invariant state. Unitarity and directedness of the resulting time evolution are demonstrated for a minisuperspace model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Microwave-Induced Cooling in Double Quantum Dots: Achieving Millikelvin Temperatures to Reduce Thermal Noise around Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a leading technology due to their scalability and long coherence times. However, maintaining these qubits at ultra-low temperatures typically requires complex cryogenic systems. This paper proposes a novel gate-defined double quantum dot (DQD) cooling system, where the DQDs act as refrigerants to reduce the local phonon environment around computational qubits. The cooling process occurs in two distinct stages: the first step involves microwave-induced state depopulation combined with fast cyclic detuning to transfer the DQD's population to the ground state, effectively lowering the DQD's temperature. In the second step, the cooled DQD interacts with and absorbs phonons resonant with the DQD spin energy, thereby filtering out these phonons that contribute to spin-lattice relaxation in the surrounding environment. This study focuses on the first step, presenting detailed calculations and numerical results that demonstrate the feasibility of achieving local DQD temperatures below 10 mK at a bath temperature of 1 K. The sensitivity of the cooling performance to detuning energy, magnetic field strength, and diabatic return time is analyzed, while the phonon filtering in the second step will require further investigation.</description>

      <title>Megastable quantization in generalized pilot-wave hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical particle in a harmonic potential gives rise to a continuous energy spectra, whereas the corresponding quantum particle exhibits countably infinite quantized energy levels. In recent years, classical non-Markovian wave-particle entities that materialize as walking droplets, have been shown to exhibit various hydrodynamic quantum analogs, including quantization in a harmonic potential via limit cycle orbits. However, the number of co-existing quantized states are limited to at most a few limit cycles. By considering a minimal generalized pilot-wave model of the system in the low-memory and low-dissipation regime, we obtain a classical harmonic oscillator perturbed by an oscillatory non-conservative force that displays a countably infinite coexisting limit-cycle states, also know as \emph{megastability}; thus forming a dynamical analog of infinite quantized states. Using averaging techniques, we derive an analytical approximation of the orbital radii, orbital frequency and Lyapunov energy function, of this megastable spectrum, and further show average energy conservation along these quantized states. Our formalism extends to a general class of self-excited oscillators and can be used to construct megastable spectrum with different energy-frequency relations.</description>
