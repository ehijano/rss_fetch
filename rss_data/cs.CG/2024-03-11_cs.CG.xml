      <title>A Clique-Based Separator for Intersection Graphs of Geodesic Disks in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $d$ be a (well-behaved) shortest-path metric defined on a path-connected subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and let $\mathcal{D}=\{D_1,\ldots,D_n\}$ be a set of geodesic disks with respect to the metric $d$. We prove that $\mathcal{G}^{\times}(\mathcal{D})$, the intersection graph of the disks in $\mathcal{D}$, has a clique-based separator consisting of $O(n^{3/4+\varepsilon})$ cliques. This significantly extends the class of objects whose intersection graphs have small clique-based separators.
  Our clique-based separator yields an algorithm for $q$-COLORING that runs in time $2^{O(n^{3/4+\varepsilon})}$, assuming the boundaries of the disks $D_i$ can be computed in polynomial time. We also use our clique-based separator to obtain a simple, efficient, and almost exact distance oracle for intersection graphs of geodesic disks. Our distance oracle uses $O(n^{7/4+\varepsilon})$ storage and can report the hop distance between any two nodes in $\mathcal{G}^{\times}(\mathcal{D})$ in $O(n^{3/4+\varepsilon})$ time, up to an additive error of one. So far, distance oracles with an additive error of one that use subquadratic storage and sublinear query time were not known for such general graph classes.</description>

      <title>Heuristic Approaches to Obtain Low-Discrepancy Point Sets via Subset Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the exact methods presented in our earlier work [J. Complexity, 2022], we introduce a heuristic approach for the star discrepancy subset selection problem. The heuristic gradually improves the current-best subset by replacing one of its elements at a time. While we prove that the heuristic does not necessarily return an optimal solution, we obtain very promising results for all tested dimensions. For example, for moderate point set sizes $30 \leq n \leq 240$ in dimension 6, we obtain point sets with $L_{\infty}$ star discrepancy up to 35% better than that of the first $n$ points of the Sobol' sequence. Our heuristic works in all dimensions, the main limitation being the precision of the discrepancy calculation algorithms.
  We also provide a comparison with a recent energy functional introduced by Steinerberger [J. Complexity, 2019], showing that our heuristic performs better on all tested instances.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Convex Hull of the Image of a Set with Smooth Boundary: Error Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the convex hull of the image $f(X)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ of a compact set $X\subset\mathbb{R}^m$ with smooth boundary through a smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^n$. Assuming that $f$ is a submersion, we derive a new bound on the Hausdorff distance between the convex hull of $f(X)$ and the convex hull of the images $f(x_i)$ of $M$ sampled inputs $x_i$ on the boundary of $X$. When applied to the problem of geometric inference from a random sample, our results give error bounds that are tighter and more general than in previous work. We present applications to the problems of robust optimization, of reachability analysis of dynamical systems, and of robust trajectory optimization under bounded uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Spectral Meets Spatial: Harmonising 3D Shape Matching and Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although 3D shape matching and interpolation are highly interrelated, they are often studied separately and applied sequentially to relate different 3D shapes, thus resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this work we present a unified framework to predict both point-wise correspondences and shape interpolation between 3D shapes. To this end, we combine the deep functional map framework with classical surface deformation models to map shapes in both spectral and spatial domains. On the one hand, by incorporating spatial maps, our method obtains more accurate and smooth point-wise correspondences compared to previous functional map methods for shape matching. On the other hand, by introducing spectral maps, our method gets rid of commonly used but computationally expensive geodesic distance constraints that are only valid for near-isometric shape deformations. Furthermore, we propose a novel test-time adaptation scheme to capture both pose-dominant and shape-dominant deformations. Using different challenging datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for both shape matching and interpolation, even compared to supervised approaches.</description>
