      <title>Minimization of an Energy Functional for an Electron in the quantized Radiation Field over quasifree States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the works of Bach, Breteaux, and Tzaneteas (2013) and of Bach and Hach (2022), the Bogolubov-Hartree-Fock (BHF) energy of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian is investigated. Upper and lower bounds on the BHF energy are derived, which suggest positivity of the minimizer, see Theorem IV.6. Under the assumption that the minimizer is indeed positive, a necessary condition on the minimizer is determined by introducing a parameterization, which simplifies the functions of operators appearing in the energy functional.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of $q$-deformed unitary ensembles with the Al-Salam--Carlitz weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $q$-deformed random unitary ensembles associated with the weight function of the Al-Salam--Carlitz orthogonal polynomials, indexed by a parameter $a &lt; 0$. In the special case $a = -1$, the model reduces to the $q$-deformed Gaussian unitary ensemble. Employing the Flajolet--Viennot theory together with the combinatorics of matchings, we derive an explicit positive-sum expression for the spectral moments. In the double-scaling regime $q = e^{-\lambda/N}$, where $N$ denotes the ensemble size and $\lambda &gt; 0$ is fixed, we derive the first two terms in the large-$N$ expansion of the spectral moments. As a consequence, we obtain a closed-form expression for the limiting spectral density. Notably, this density exhibits two successive phase transitions as $\lambda$ increases, characterised by a reduction in the number of soft edges from two, to one, and eventually to none. Furthermore, we show that the limiting density coincides with the limiting zero distribution of the Al-Salam--Carlitz orthogonal polynomials under the same scaling.</description>

      <title>A new Phase-Field Model for Anisotropic Surface Diffusion: Anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard Equation with Improved Conservation (ACH-IC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As popular approximations to sharp-interface models, the Cahn-Hilliard type phase-field models are usually used to simulate interface dynamics with volume conservation. However, the convergence rate of the volume enclosed by the interface to its sharp-interface limit is usually at first order of the interface thickness in the classical Cahn-Hilliard model with constant or degenerate mobilities. In this work, we propose a variational framework for developing new Cahn-Hilliard dynamics with enhanced volume conservation by introducing a more general conserved quantity. In particular, based on Onsager's variational principle (OVP) and a modified conservation law, we develop an anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard equation with improved conservation (ACH-IC) for approximating anisotropic surface diffusion. The ACH-IC model employs a new conserved quantity that approximates a step function more effectively, and yields second-order volume conservation while preserving energy dissipation for the classical anisotropic surface energy. The second-order volume conservation as well as the convergence to the sharp-interface surface diffusion dynamics is derived through comprehensive asymptotic analysis. Numerical evidence not only reveals the underlying physics of the proposed model in comparison with the classical one, but also demonstrates its exceptional performance in simulating anisotropic surface diffusion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of the periodic Fredkin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fredkin chain is a spin-$1/2$ model with interaction of three nearest neighbors. In the case of periodic boundary conditions the ground state is degenerated and can be described in terms of equivalence classes of the Dyck paths. We introduce two operators commuting with the Hamiltonian, which play the roles of lowering and raising operators when acting at the ground states. These operators generate the $B$- or $C$-type Lie algebras, depending on whether the number of sites $N$ is odd or even, respectively, with rank $n=\lceil N/2\rceil$. The third component of total spin operator can be represented as a sum of the Cartan subalgebra elements and some central element. In the $C$-type Lie algebra case (even number of sites) this representation coincides with a similar formula previously conjectured for spin-$1$ operators, in the context of periodic Motzkin chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The robustness of properties of a statistical physics model to slight perturbations in the exact local interactions of the model is a very relevant philosophical question, considering real-life measurements on which we base some models can only ever reach a finite precision. In this article, we will discuss this topic in a formal mathematical setting, and notably exhibit a family of models for which the low-temperature behaviour is highly non-robust.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher Information in Curved Spacetime: Dirac Particles in Noisy Channels around a Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information processing promises significant advantages over classical methods but remains vulnerable to decoherence induced by environmental interactions and spacetime effects. This work investigates the behavior of Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) as a diagnostic tool for entanglement and parameter estimation in a three-qubit entangled Dirac system subjected to dissipative noisy channels in the curved spacetime of a Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, we examine the influence of the squeezed generalized amplitude damping (SGAD) channel, along with its subchannels -- generalized amplitude damping (GAD) and amplitude damping (AD) -- on the QFI with respect to entanglement weight ($\theta$) and phase ($\phi$) parameters. Our results show that under strong squeezing ($r = 1$), the QFI with respect to $\theta$ becomes completely resistant to variations in the Hawking temperature ($T_H$), while still exhibiting degradation with increasing channel temperature ($T_C$). The QFI decay is significantly slower at $r = 1$ compared to $r = 0$, suggesting that squeezing can function as an error mitigation strategy. For QFI with respect to $\phi$, a transient spike is observed at $T_C = 2$, potentially due to thermal resonance or non-monotonic decoherence, and this behavior is unaffected by $T_H$. Similar patterns are noted in the GAD and AD channels, where $T_C$ consistently dominates as the principal source of decoherence. Overall, the results highlight the intricate interplay between environmental noise, relativistic effects, and quantum error resilience in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Nonspherically symmetric equilibrium bubbles in a steadily rotating incompressible fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note presents two nontrivial, rotational equilibrium solutions to the spatial uniform gas pressure (isobaric) approximate model of Prosperetti in the inviscid case. Building on Gavrilov's work [GAFA 2019], we first establish the existence of equilibrium solutions with nontrivial (rotational) liquid flow. Second, we construct a nonspherically symmetric, horn-torus-shaped equilibrium bubble under mild spatial decay conditions of the liquid flow. In addition, we extend earlier results on the characterization of spherical equilibrium bubbles to the axisymmetric, purely azimuthal setting. Finally, we implement a numerical simulation of the equilibrium bubble shape using the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approximation.</description>

      <title>Quantum ergodicity for contact metric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the proof of a Quantum Ergodicity (QE) theorem for the eigenfunctions of subLaplacians on contact metric manifolds, under the assumption that the Reeb flow is ergodic. To do so, we rely on a semiclassical pseudodifferential calculus developed for general filtered manifolds that we specialize to the setting of contact manifolds. Our strategy is then reminiscent of an implementation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation as we rely on the construction of microlocal projectors in our calculus which commute with the subLaplacian, called Landau projectors. The subLaplacian is then shown to act effectively on the range of each Landau projector as the Reeb vector field does. The remainder of the proof follows the classical path towards QE, once microlocal Weyl laws have been established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for response theory in diffusion processes governed by Fokker-Planck equations, based on the notion of the Dissipation Function. Using the analytically solvable Brownian oscillator model, we derive exact response formulae for both overdamped and underdamped dynamics of harmonically bound Brownian particles. We also demonstrate that for certain observables and under suitable time scaling, the operations of model reduction and response formula extraction commute.</description>

      <title>One reduction of the modified Toda hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modified Toda (mToda) hierarchy is a two-component generalization of the 1-st modified KP (mKP) hierarchy, which connects the Toda hierarchy via Miura links and has two tau functions. Based on the fact that the mToda and 1-st mKP hierarchies share the same fermionic form, we firstly construct the reduction of the mToda hierarchy $L_1(n)^M=L_2(n)^N+\sum_{l\in\mathbb{Z}}\sum_{i=1}^{m}q_{i,n}\Lambda^lr_{i,n+1}\Delta$ and $(L_1(n)^M+L_2(n)^N)(1)=0$, called the generalized bigraded modified Toda hierarchy, which can be viewed as a new two-component generalization of the constrained mKP hierarchy $\mathfrak{L}^k=(\mathfrak{L}^k)_{\geq 1}+\sum_{i=1}^m \mathfrak{q}_i\partial^{-1}\mathfrak{r}_i\partial$. Next the relation with the Toda reduction $\mathcal{L}_1(n)^M=\mathcal{L}_2(n)^{N}+\sum_{l\in \mathbb{Z}}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\tilde{q}_{i,n}\Lambda^l\tilde{r}_{i,n}$ is discussed. Finally we give equivalent formulations of the Toda and mToda reductions in terms of tau functions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between partial traces and their dilations for general complex matrices, focusing on two main aspects: the existence of (joint) dilations and norm inequalities relating partial traces and their dilations. Throughout our analysis, we pay particular attention to rank constraints. We find that every pair of matrices of equal size and trace admits dilations of any rank larger than one. We generalize Audenaert's subadditivity inequality to encompass general matrices, multiple tensor factors, and different norms. A central ingredient for this is a novel majorization relation for Kronecker sums. As an application, we extend the interval of Werner states in which they are provably 2-undistillable in any dimension $d\geq4$. We also prove new Schmidt-number witnesses and $k$-positive maps.</description>

      <title>Geometric Measures of Complexity for Open and Closed Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unitary dynamics of quantum systems can be modeled as a trajectory on a Riemannian manifold. This theoretical framework naturally yields a purely geometric interpretation of computational complexity for quantum algorithms, a notion originally developed by Michael Nielsen (Circa, 2007). However, for nonunitary dynamics, it is unclear how one can recover a completely geometric characterization of Nielsen-like geometric complexity. The main obstacle to overcome is that nonunitary dynamics cannot be characterized by Lie groups (which are Riemannian manifolds), as is the case for unitary dynamics. Building on Nielsen's work, we present a definition of geometric complexity for a fairly generic family of quantum channels. These channels are useful for modeling noise in quantum circuits, among other things, and analyze the geometric complexity of these quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Jacobi Hamiltonian Integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method of constructing structure-preserving integrators for Hamiltonian systems in Jacobi manifolds. Hamiltonian mechanics, rooted in symplectic and Poisson geometry, has long provided a foundation for modelling conservative systems in classical physics. Jacobi manifolds, generalizing both contact and Poisson manifolds, extend this theory and are suitable for incorporating time-dependent, dissipative and thermodynamic phenomena.
  Building on recent advances in geometric integrators - specifically Poisson Hamiltonian Integrators (PHI), which preserve key features of Poisson systems - we propose a construction of Jacobi Hamiltonian Integrators. Our approach explores the correspondence between Jacobi and homogeneous Poisson manifolds, with the aim of extending the PHI techniques while ensuring preservation of the homogeneity structure.
  This work develops the theoretical tools required for this generalization and outlines a numerical integration technique compatible with Jacobi dynamics. By focusing on the homogeneous Poisson perspective rather than on direct contact realizations, we provide a clear pathway for structure-preserving integration of time-dependent and dissipative systems within the Jacobi framework.</description>

Abstract: In $3+1$ dimensions, we study the stability of Kasner solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field-Vlasov system. This system incorporates gravity, electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions for the initial stage of our universe. Due to the presence of the Vlasov field, various new challenges arise. By observing detailed mathematical structures and designing new delicate arguments, we identify a new strong sub-critical regime and prove the nonlinear stability with Kasner exponents lying in this full regime. This extends the result of Fournodavlos-Rodnianski-Speck [8] from the Einstein-scalar field system to the physically more complex system with the Vlasov field.</description>

      <title>Implementation of the inverse scattering transform method for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the initial-value problem for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Application of the inverse scattering transform method involves solving direct and inverse scattering problems for the Zakharov-Shabat system with complex potentials. We solve these problems by using new series representations for the Jost solutions of the Zakharov-Shabat system. The representations have the form of power series with respect to a transformed spectral parameter. In terms of the representations, solution of the direct scattering problem reduces to computing the series coefficients following a simple recurrent integration procedure, computation of the scattering coefficients by multiplying corresponding pairs of polynomials (partial sums of the series representations) and locating zeros of a polynomial inside the unit disk. Solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of a system of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potential is recovered from the first coefficients. The system is obtained directly from the scattering relations. Thus, unlike other existing techniques, the method does not involve solving the Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko equation or the matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. The overall approach leads to a simple and efficient algorithm for the numerical solution of the initial-value problem for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which is illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Global fluctuations for standard Young tableaux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Young generating function for a probability measure on integer partitions. We use this object to characterize probability distributions over integer partitions satisfying a law of large numbers and those that satisfy a central limit theorem. We further establish a multilevel central limit theorem, which enables the study of random standard Young tableaux. As applications of these results, we describe the fluctuations of height functions associated with (i) the Plancherel growth process, (ii) random standard Young tableaux of fixed shape, and (iii) probability distributions induced by extreme characters of the infinite symmetric group $S_\infty$. In all cases, we identify the limiting fluctuations as a conditioned Gaussian Free Field.</description>

      <title>Diffusion as a Signature of Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While classical chaos is defined via a system's sensitive dependence on its initial conditions (SDIC), this notion does not directly extend to quantum systems. Instead, recent works have established defining both quantum and classical chaos via the sensitivity to adiabatic deformations and measuring this sensitivity using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP). Building on this formalism, we introduce the ``observable drift" as a probe of chaos in generic, non-Hamiltonian, classical systems. We show that this probe correctly characterizes classical systems that exhibit SDIC as chaotic. Moreover, this characterization is consistent with the measure-theoretic definition of chaos via weak mixing. Thus, we show that these two notions of sensitivity (to changes in initial conditions and to adiabatic deformations) can be probed using the same quantity, and therefore, are equivalent definitions of chaos. Numerical examples are provided via the tent map, the logistic map, and the Chirikov standard map.</description>

      <title>Bihamiltonian structure of the DR hierarchy in the semisimple case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Of the two approaches to integrable systems associated to semisimple cohomological field theories (CohFTs), the one suggested by Dubrovin and Zhang and the more recent one using the geometry of the double ramification (DR) cycle, the second has the advantage of being very explicit. The Poisson operator of the DR hierarchy is $\eta^{-1} \partial_x$, where $\eta$ is the metric of the CohFT, and the Hamiltonians are explicitly defined as generating functions of intersection numbers of the CohFT with the DR cycle, the top Hodge class $\lambda_g$, and powers of a psi-class. The question whether the DR hierarchy is endowed with a bihamiltonian structure appeared to be much harder. In our previous work in collaboration with S. Shadrin, when the CohFT is homogeneous, we proposed an explicit formula for a differential operator and conjectured that it would provide the required bihamiltonian structure. In this paper, we prove this conjecture. Our proof is based on two recently proved results: the equivalence of the DR hierarchy and the Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchy of a semisimple CohFT under Miura transformation and the polynomiality of the second Poisson bracket of the DZ hierarchy of a homogeneous semisimple CohFT. In particular, our second Poisson bracket coincides through the DR/DZ equivalence with the second Poisson bracket of the DZ hierarchy, hence providing a remarkably explicit approach to their bihamiltonian structure.</description>

      <title>Scattering of transient waves by an interface with time-modulated jump conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time modulation of the physical parameters offers interesting new possibilities for wave control. Examples include amplification of waves, harmonic generation and non-reciprocity, without resorting to non-linear mechanisms. Most of the recent studies focus on the time-modulation of the bulk physical properties. However, as the temporal modulation of these properties is difficult to achieve experimentally, we will concentrate here on the special case of an interface with time-varying jump conditions, which is simpler to implement. This work is focused on wave propagation in a one-dimensional medium containing one modulated interface. Properties of the scattered waves are investigated theoretically: energy balance, generation of harmonics, impedance matching and non-reciprocity. A fourth-order numerical method is also developed to simulate transient scattering. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the numerical scheme and to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>About diffusion equations in bounded systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential equations need boundary conditions (BC's) for their solution. It is commonly acknowledged that differential equations and BC's are representative of independent physical processes, and no correlations between them is required. Two recent papers [D. Hilhorst, et al, Nonlinear Analysis, 245, 113561 (2024); J-W.Chung, et al, Jour. Math. Phys. 65, 071501 (2024)] focus on diffusion equations (DE's) in a case with continuity of the physics at the boundary, where transport coefficients go smoothly to zero in a very small layer about it. They argue that, once the analytical expression of the DE is chosen, only one kind of BC's may emerge (e.g., Neumann rather than Dirichlet). In this paper, we show that this case is very peculiar. Indeed, DE's generally arise as long-wavelength limit out of a stochastic picture of microscopic dynamics, in the form of an integro-differential Master Equation (ME). Accordingly, they are justified only on a statistical basis, provide accurate pictures of the system's evolution only over large enough length and time scales. In realistic cases, the width of the interface between the interior and exterior of the system is much smaller than transport scales, providing effectively a discontinuity and therefore a decorrelation between DE and BC.</description>

      <title>A Family of Berndt-Type Integrals and Associated Barnes Multiple Zeta Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on calculating a specific class of Berndt integrals, which exclusively involves (hyperbolic) cosine functions. Initially, this integral is transformed into a Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum via contour integration. Subsequently, a function incorporating theta is defined. By employing the residue theorem, the mixed Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum with both hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine in the denominator is converted into a simpler Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum, which contains only hyperbolic cosine or hyperbolic sine in the denominator. The simpler Ramanujan-type hyperbolic (infinite) sum is then evaluated using Jacobi elliptic functions, Fourier series expansions, and Maclaurin series expansions. Ultimately, the result is expressed as a rational polynomial of Gamma and \sqrt{pi}.Additionally, the integral is related to the Barnes multiple zeta function, which provides an alternative method for its calculation.</description>

Abstract: The generalized Fierz identities are addressed in the K\"ahler-Atiyah bundle framework from the perspective of the equations governing constrained generalized Killing spinor fields. We explore the spin geometry in a Riemannian 8-manifold composing a warped flux compactification AdS$_3\times M_8$, whose metric and fluxes preserve one supersymmetry in AdS$_3$. Supersymmetry conditions can be efficiently translated into spinor bilinear covariants, whose algebraic and differential constraints yield identifying new spinor field classes. Intriguing implications and potential applications are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there exists a diffusion process whose invariant measure is the three dimensional polymer measure $\nu_\lambda$ for all $\lambda&gt;0$. We follow in part a previous incomplete unpublished work of the first named author with M. R\"ockner and X.Y. Zhou. For the construction of $\nu_\lambda$ we rely on previous work by J. Westwater, E. Bolthausen and X.Y. Zhou. Using $\nu_\lambda$, the diffusion is constructed by means of the theory of Dirichlet forms on infinite-dimensional state spaces. The closability of the appropriate pre-Dirichlet form which is of gradient type is proven, by using a general closability result in [AR89a]. This result does not require an integration by parts formula (which does not even hold for the two-dimensional polymer measure $\nu_\lambda$) but requires the quasi-invariance of $\nu_\lambda$ along a basis of vectors in the classical Cameron-Martin space such that the Radon-Nikodym derivatives have versions which form a continuous process.</description>

Abstract: We exhibit an uncountable family of extremal inhomogeneous Gibbs measures of the low temperature Ising model on regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These states arise as low temperature perturbations of local ground states having a sparse enough set of frustrated edges, the sparseness being measured in terms of the isoperimetric constant of the graph. This result is implied by an extension of the article [5] on regular trees to non-amenable graphs. We moreover argue how we can deduce the extremality of an uncountable subset of the Series--Sinai states [23] at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Flow Through Porous Media: A Hopf-Cole Transformation Approach for Modeling Pressure-Dependent Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most organic liquids exhibit a pressure-dependent viscosity, making it crucial to consider this behavior in applications where pressures significantly exceed ambient conditions (e.g., geological carbon sequestration). Mathematical models describing flow through porous media while accounting for viscosity-pressure dependence are nonlinear (e.g., the Barus model). This nonlinearity complicates mathematical analysis and makes numerical solutions more time-intensive and prone to convergence issues. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Hopf-Cole transformation, originally developed for Burgers' equation, can recast the governing equations -- describing flow through porous media with pressure-dependent viscosity -- into a linear form. The transformed equations, resembling Darcy's equations in the transformed variables, enable (a) systematic mathematical analysis to establish uniqueness and maximum principles, (b) the derivation of a mechanics-based principle, and (c) the development of efficient numerical solutions using solvers optimized for Darcy equations. Notably, many properties of the linear Darcy equations naturally extend to nonlinear models that depend on pressure. For example, solutions to these nonlinear models adhere to a reciprocal relation analogous to that observed in Darcy's equations.</description>

      <title>The Sky Remembers everything: Celestial amplitude, Shadow and OPE in quadratic EFT of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the celestial amplitude arising from higher curvature corrections to Einstein gravity, incorporating phase dressing. The inclusion of such corrections leads to effective modifications of the theory's ultraviolet (UV) behaviour. In the eikonal limit, we find that, in contrast to Einstein's gravity, where the $u$ and $s$-channel contributions cancel, these contributions remain non-vanishing in the presence of higher curvature terms. We examine the analytic structure of the resulting amplitude and derive a dispersion relation for the phase-dressed eikonal amplitude in quadratic gravity. Furthermore, we investigate the celestial conformal block expansion of the Mellin-transformed conformal shadow amplitude within the framework of celestial conformal field theory (CCFT). As a consequence, we compute the corresponding operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients using the Burchnall-Chaundy expansion. In addition, we evaluate the OPE via the Euclidean OPE inversion formula across various kinematic channels and comment on its applicability and implications. Finally, we briefly explore the Carrollian amplitude associated with the corresponding quadratic EFT.</description>

Abstract: The erasure of information is fundamentally an irreversible logical operation, carrying profound consequences for the energetics of computation and information processing. We investigate the thermodynamic costs associated with erasing (and preparing) quantum processes. Specifically, we analyze an arbitrary bipartite unitary gate acting on logical and ancillary input-output systems, where the ancillary input is always initialized in the ground state. We focus on the adversarial erasure cost of the reduced dynamics -- that is, the minimal thermodynamic work cost to erase the logical output of the gate for any logical input, assuming full access to the ancilla but no access to any purifying reference of the logical input state. We determine that this adversarial erasure cost is directly proportional to the negative min-entropy of the reduced dynamics, thereby giving the dynamical min-entropy a clear operational meaning. The dynamical min-entropy can take positive and negative values, depending on the underlying quantum dynamics. The negative value of the erasure cost implies that the extraction of thermodynamic work is possible instead of its consumption during the process. A key foundation of this result is the quantum process decoupling theorem, which quantitatively relates the decoupling ability of a process with its min-entropy. This insight bridges thermodynamics, information theory, and the fundamental limits of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks reveal topological flat bands, robust edge states and topological phase transitions in cyclic graphs</title>

Abstract: Topological phases, edge states, and flat bands in synthetic quantum systems are a key resource for topological quantum computing and noise-resilient information processing. We introduce a scheme based on step-dependent quantum walks on cyclic graphs, termed cyclic quantum walks (CQWs), to simulate exotic topological phenomena using discrete Fourier transforms and an effective Hamiltonian. Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless topological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically nontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to split-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit markedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat bands emerging exclusively in $4n$-site graphs ($n\in \mathbf{N}$). We analytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped flat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of Dirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at the interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle graphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against moderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against phase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and versatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge states, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</description>
