      <title>GEPAR3D: Geometry Prior-Assisted Learning for 3D Tooth Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tooth segmentation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) remains challenging, especially for fine structures like root apices, which is critical for assessing root resorption in orthodontics. We introduce GEPAR3D, a novel approach that unifies instance detection and multi-class segmentation into a single step tailored to improve root segmentation. Our method integrates a Statistical Shape Model of dentition as a geometric prior, capturing anatomical context and morphological consistency without enforcing restrictive adjacency constraints. We leverage a deep watershed method, modeling each tooth as a continuous 3D energy basin encoding voxel distances to boundaries. This instance-aware representation ensures accurate segmentation of narrow, complex root apices. Trained on publicly available CBCT scans from a single center, our method is evaluated on external test sets from two in-house and two public medical centers. GEPAR3D achieves the highest overall segmentation performance, averaging a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 95.0% (+2.8% over the second-best method) and increasing recall to 95.2% (+9.5%) across all test sets. Qualitative analyses demonstrated substantial improvements in root segmentation quality, indicating significant potential for more accurate root resorption assessment and enhanced clinical decision-making in orthodontics. We provide the implementation and dataset at https://github.com/tomek1911/GEPAR3D.</description>

      <title>On the Utility of Virtual Staining for Downstream Applications as it relates to Task Network Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual staining, or in-silico-labeling, has been proposed to computationally generate synthetic fluorescence images from label-free images by use of deep learning-based image-to-image translation networks. In most reported studies, virtually stained images have been assessed only using traditional image quality measures such as structural similarity or signal-to-noise ratio. However, in biomedical imaging, images are typically acquired to facilitate an image-based inference, which we refer to as a downstream biological or clinical task. This study systematically investigates the utility of virtual staining for facilitating clinically relevant downstream tasks (like segmentation or classification) with consideration of the capacity of the deep neural networks employed to perform the tasks. Comprehensive empirical evaluations were conducted using biological datasets, assessing task performance by use of label-free, virtually stained, and ground truth fluorescence images. The results demonstrated that the utility of virtual staining is largely dependent on the ability of the segmentation or classification task network to extract meaningful task-relevant information, which is related to the concept of network capacity. Examples are provided in which virtual staining does not improve, or even degrades, segmentation or classification performance when the capacity of the associated task network is sufficiently large. The results demonstrate that task network capacity should be considered when deciding whether to perform virtual staining.</description>

      <title>Weakly Supervised Intracranial Aneurysm Detection and Segmentation in MR angiography via Multi-task UNet with Vesselness Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are abnormal dilations of cerebral blood vessels that, if ruptured, can lead to life-threatening consequences. However, their small size and soft contrast in radiological scans often make it difficult to perform accurate and efficient detection and morphological analyses, which are critical in the clinical care of the disorder. Furthermore, the lack of large public datasets with voxel-wise expert annotations pose challenges for developing deep learning algorithms to address the issues. Therefore, we proposed a novel weakly supervised 3D multi-task UNet that integrates vesselness priors to jointly perform aneurysm detection and segmentation in time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA). Specifically, to robustly guide IA detection and segmentation, we employ the popular Frangi's vesselness filter to derive soft cerebrovascular priors for both network input and an attention block to conduct segmentation from the decoder and detection from an auxiliary branch. We train our model on the Lausanne dataset with coarse ground truth segmentation, and evaluate it on the test set with refined labels from the same database. To further assess our model's generalizability, we also validate it externally on the ADAM dataset. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique over the SOTA techniques for aneurysm segmentation (Dice = 0.614, 95%HD =1.38mm) and detection (false positive rate = 1.47, sensitivity = 92.9%).</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based User-Guided Data Augmentation for Coronary Stenosis Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronary stenosis is a major risk factor for ischemic heart events leading to increased mortality, and medical treatments for this condition require meticulous, labor-intensive analysis. Coronary angiography provides critical visual cues for assessing stenosis, supporting clinicians in making informed decisions for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential for automated localization and severity measurement of stenosis. In real-world scenarios, however, the success of these competent approaches is often hindered by challenges such as limited labeled data and class imbalance. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that uses an inpainting method based on a diffusion model to generate realistic lesions, allowing user-guided control of severity. Extensive evaluation on lesion detection and severity classification across various synthetic dataset sizes shows superior performance of our method on both a large-scale in-house dataset and a public coronary angiography dataset. Furthermore, our approach maintains high detection and classification performance even when trained with limited data, highlighting its clinical importance in improving the assessment of severity of stenosis and optimizing data utilization for more reliable decision support.</description>

      <title>FMPlug: Plug-In Foundation Flow-Matching Priors for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FMPlug, a novel plug-in framework that enhances foundation flow-matching (FM) priors for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Collaborative Satellite Object Detection for Space Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing density of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) presents serious challenges to space sustainability, primarily due to the increased risk of in-orbit collisions. Traditional ground-based tracking systems are constrained by latency and coverage limitations, underscoring the need for onboard, vision-based space object detection (SOD) capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel satellite clustering framework that enables the collaborative execution of deep learning (DL)-based SOD tasks across multiple satellites. To support this approach, we construct a high-fidelity dataset simulating imaging scenarios for clustered satellite formations. A distance-aware viewpoint selection strategy is introduced to optimize detection performance, and recent DL models are used for evaluation. Experimental results show that the clustering-based method achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to single-satellite and existing approaches, while maintaining a low size, weight, and power (SWaP) footprint. These findings underscore the potential of distributed, AI-enabled in-orbit systems to enhance space situational awareness and contribute to long-term space sustainability.</description>

      <title>DiSC-Med: Diffusion-based Semantic Communications for Robust Medical Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has driven smart health with next-generation wireless communication technologies, stimulating exciting applications in remote diagnosis and intervention. To enable a timely and effective response for remote healthcare, efficient transmission of medical data through noisy channels with limited bandwidth emerges as a critical challenge. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based semantic communication framework, namely DiSC-Med, for the medical image transmission, where medical-enhanced compression and denoising blocks are developed for bandwidth efficiency and robustness, respectively. Unlike conventional pixel-wise communication framework, our proposed DiSC-Med is able to capture the key semantic information and achieve superior reconstruction performance with ultra-high bandwidth efficiency against noisy channels. Extensive experiments on real-world medical datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating its potential for robust and efficient telehealth applications.</description>

      <title>IN2OUT: Fine-Tuning Video Inpainting Model for Video Outpainting Using Hierarchical Discriminator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.</description>

      <title>Semantic and Temporal Integration in Latent Diffusion Space for High-Fidelity Video Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex video super-resolution tasks.</description>

      <title>A Novel Modeling Framework and Data Product for Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light Image Reconstruction (1986-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities. Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details. Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the $\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99. Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource for the research community and is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.11888/HumanNat.tpdc.302930.</description>

      <title>SU-ESRGAN: Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN for Super-Resolution of Satellite and Drone Imagery with Fine-Tuning for Cross Domain Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN, segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical Uncertainty in Linear Registration: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While linear registration is a critical step in MRI preprocessing pipelines, its numerical uncertainty is understudied. Using Monte-Carlo Arithmetic (MCA) simulations, we assessed the most commonly used linear registration tools within major software packages (SPM, FSL, and ANTs) across multiple image similarity measures, two brain templates, and both healthy control (HC, n=50) and Parkinson's Disease (PD, n=50) cohorts. Our findings highlight the influence of linear registration tools and similarity measures on numerical stability. Among the evaluated tools and with default similarity measures, SPM exhibited the highest stability. FSL and ANTs showed greater and similar ranges of variability, with ANTs demonstrating particular sensitivity to numerical perturbations that occasionally led to registration failure. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between healthy and PD cohorts, suggesting that numerical stability analyses obtained with healthy subjects may generalise to clinical populations. Finally, we also demonstrated how numerical uncertainty measures may support automated quality control (QC) of linear registration results. Overall, our experimental results characterize the numerical stability of linear registration experimentally and can serve as a basis for future uncertainty analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical Image Analysis (MedIA) has become indispensable in modern healthcare, enhancing clinical diagnostics and personalized treatment. Despite the remarkable advancements supported by deep learning (DL) technologies, their practical deployment faces challenges due to distribution shifts, where models trained on specific datasets underperform across others from varying hospitals, regions, or patient populations. To navigate this issue, researchers have been actively developing strategies to increase the adaptability and robustness of DL models, enabling their effective use in unfamiliar and diverse environments. This paper systematically reviews approaches that apply DL techniques to MedIA systems affected by distribution shifts. Unlike traditional categorizations based on technical specifications, our approach is grounded in the real-world operational constraints faced by healthcare institutions. Specifically, we categorize the existing body of work into Joint Training, Federated Learning, Fine-tuning, and Domain Generalization, with each method tailored to distinct scenarios caused by Data Accessibility, Privacy Concerns, and Collaborative Protocols. This perspective equips researchers with a nuanced understanding of how DL can be strategically deployed to address distribution shifts in MedIA, ensuring diverse and robust medical applications. By delving deeper into these topics, we highlight potential pathways for future research that not only address existing limitations but also push the boundaries of deployable MedIA technologies.</description>

      <title>Generating Novel Brain Morphology by Deforming Learned Templates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing generative models for 3D structural brain MRI that synthesize morphologically-plausible and attribute-specific (e.g., age, sex, disease state) samples is an active area of research. Existing approaches based on frameworks like GANs or diffusion models synthesize the image directly, which may limit their ability to capture intricate morphological details. In this work, we propose a 3D brain MRI generation method based on state-of-the-art latent diffusion models (LDMs), called MorphLDM, that generates novel images by applying synthesized deformation fields to a learned template. Instead of using a reconstruction-based autoencoder (as in a typical LDM), our encoder outputs a latent embedding derived from both an image and a learned template that is itself the output of a template decoder; this latent is passed to a deformation field decoder, whose output is applied to the learned template. A registration loss is minimized between the original image and the deformed template with respect to the encoder and both decoders. Empirically, our approach outperforms generative baselines on metrics spanning image diversity, adherence with respect to input conditions, and voxel-based morphometry.

      <title>Optimizing Federated Learning Configurations for MRI Prostate Segmentation and Cancer Detection: A Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22790</link>

Abstract: Purpose: To develop and optimize a federated learning (FL) framework across multiple clients for biparametric MRI prostate segmentation and clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted using Flower FL to train a nnU-Net-based architecture for MRI prostate segmentation and csPCa detection, using data collected from January 2010 to August 2021. Model development included training and optimizing local epochs, federated rounds, and aggregation strategies for FL-based prostate segmentation on T2-weighted MRIs (four clients, 1294 patients) and csPCa detection using biparametric MRIs (three clients, 1440 patients). Performance was evaluated on independent test sets using the Dice score for segmentation and the Prostate Imaging: Cancer Artificial Intelligence (PI-CAI) score, defined as the average of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and average precision, for csPCa detection. P-values for performance differences were calculated using permutation testing. Results: The FL configurations were independently optimized for both tasks, showing improved performance at 1 epoch 300 rounds using FedMedian for prostate segmentation and 5 epochs 200 rounds using FedAdagrad, for csPCa detection. Compared with the average performance of the clients, the optimized FL model significantly improved performance in prostate segmentation and csPCa detection on the independent test set. The optimized FL model showed higher lesion detection performance compared to the FL-baseline model, but no evidence of a difference was observed for prostate segmentation. Conclusions: FL enhanced the performance and generalizability of MRI prostate segmentation and csPCa detection compared with local models, and optimizing its configuration further improved lesion detection performance.</description>

      <title>Accurate Cross-modal Reconstruction of Vehicle Target from Sparse-aspect Multi-baseline SAR data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04158v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-aspect multi-baseline SAR 3D imaging is a critical remote sensing technique, promising in urban mapping and monitoring. However, sparse observation due to constrained flight trajectories degrade imaging quality, particularly for anisotropic small targets like vehicles and aircraft. In the past, compressive sensing (CS) was the mainstream approach for sparse 3D SAR reconstruction. More recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful alternative, markedly boosting reconstruction quality and efficiency through strong data-driven representations capabilities and fast inference characteristics. However, existing DL methods typically train deep neural networks (DNNs) using only high-resolution radar images. This unimodal learning paradigm precludes the incorporation of complementary information from other data sources, thereby limiting potential improvements in reconstruction performance. In this paper, we introduce cross-modal learning and propose a Cross-Modal 3D-SAR Reconstruction Network (CMAR-Net) that enhances sparse 3D SAR reconstruction by fusing heterogeneous information. Leveraging cross-modal supervision from 2D optical images and error propagation guaranteed by differentiable rendering, CMAR-Net achieves efficient training and reconstructs highly sparse-aspect multi-baseline SAR image into visually structured and accurate 3D images, particularly for vehicle targets. Trained solely on simulated data, CMAR-Net exhibits strong generalization across extensive real-world evaluations on parking lot measurements containing numerous civilian vehicles, outperforming state-of-the-art CS and DL methods in structural accuracy. Our work highlights the potential of cross-modal learning for 3D SAR reconstruction and introduces a novel framework for radar imaging research.</description>

      <title>FLOAT: Generative Motion Latent Flow Matching for Audio-driven Talking Portrait</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01064v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Adaptive Video Streaming Using Latent Diffusion Models for Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Semantic Communication (SemCom) framework for real-time adaptive-bitrate video streaming by integrating Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) within the FFmpeg techniques. This solution addresses the challenges of high bandwidth usage, storage inefficiencies, and quality of experience (QoE) degradation associated with traditional Constant Bitrate Streaming (CBS) and Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS). The proposed approach leverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant storage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual quality. While retaining B-frames and P-frames as adjustment metadata to support efficient refinement of video reconstruction at the user side, the proposed framework further incorporates state-of-the-art denoising and Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) techniques. These techniques mitigate semantic ambiguity and restore temporal coherence between frames, even in noisy wireless communication environments. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves high-quality video streaming with optimized bandwidth usage, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in terms of QoE and resource efficiency. This work opens new possibilities for scalable real-time video streaming in 5G and future post-5G networks.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Motion And Noise Estimation with Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event cameras are emerging vision sensors whose noise is challenging to characterize. Existing denoising methods for event cameras are often designed in isolation and thus consider other tasks, such as motion estimation, separately (i.e., sequentially after denoising). However, motion is an intrinsic part of event data, since scene edges cannot be sensed without motion. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first method that simultaneously estimates motion in its various forms (e.g., ego-motion, optical flow) and noise. The method is flexible, as it allows replacing the one-step motion estimation of the widely-used Contrast Maximization framework with any other motion estimator, such as deep neural networks. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the E-MLB denoising benchmark and competitive results on the DND21 benchmark, while demonstrating effectiveness across motion estimation and intensity reconstruction tasks. Our approach advances event-data denoising theory and expands practical denoising use-cases via open-source code. Project page: https://github.com/tub-rip/ESMD</description>
