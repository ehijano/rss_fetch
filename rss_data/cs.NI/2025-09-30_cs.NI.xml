      <title>Bridging Language Models and Formal Methods for Intent-Driven Optical Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intent-Based Networking (IBN) aims to simplify network management by enabling users to specify high-level goals that drive automated network design and configuration. However, translating informal natural-language intents into formally correct optical network topologies remains challenging due to inherent ambiguity and lack of rigor in Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose a novel hybrid pipeline that integrates LLM-based intent parsing, formal methods, and Optical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). By enriching design decisions with domain-specific optical standards and systematically incorporating symbolic reasoning and verification techniques, our pipeline generates explainable, verifiable, and trustworthy optical network designs. This approach significantly advances IBN by ensuring reliability and correctness, essential for mission-critical networking tasks.</description>

      <title>Impact of Environmental Factors on LoRa 2.4 GHz Time of Flight Ranging Outdoors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In WSN/IoT, node localization is essential to long-running applications for accurate environment monitoring and event detection, often covering a large area in the field. Due to the lower time resolution of typical WSN/IoT platforms (e.g., 1 microsecond on ESP32 platforms) and the jitters in timestamping, packet-level localization techniques cannot provide meter-level resolution. For high-precision localization as well as world-wide interoperability via 2.4-GHz ISM band, a new variant of LoRa, called LoRa 2.4 GHz, was proposed by semtech, which provides a radio frequency (RF) time of flight (ToF) ranging method for meter-level localization. However, the existing datasets reported in the literature are limited in their coverages and do not take into account varying environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. To address these issues, LoRa 2.4 GHz RF ToF ranging data was collected on a sports field at the XJTLU south campus, where three LoRa nodes logged samples of ranging with a LoRa base station, together with temperature and humidity, at reference points arranged as a 3x3 grid covering 400 square meter over three weeks and uploaded all measurement records to the base station equipped with an ESP32-based transceiver for machine and user communications. The results of a preliminary investigation based on a simple deep neural network (DNN) model demonstrate that the environmental factors, including the temperature and humidity, significantly affect the accuracy of ranging, which calls for advanced methods of compensating for the effects of environmental factors on LoRa RF ToF ranging outdoors.</description>

      <title>Unlicensed Band Allocation for Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the License-Assisted Access (LAA) small cell architecture, the LAA coexisting with Wi-Fi heterogeneous networks provides LTE mobile users with high bandwidth efficiency as the unlicensed channels are shared among LAA and Wi-Fi. However, LAA and Wi-Fi interfere with each other when both systems use the same unlicensed channel in heterogeneous networks. In such a network, unlicensed band allocation for LAA and Wi-Fi is an important issue that may affect the quality of service (QoS) of both systems significantly. In this paper, we propose an analytical model and conduct simulation experiments to study four allocations for the unlicensed band: unlicensed full allocation (UFA), unlicensed time-division allocation (UTA), and UFA/UTA with buffering mechanism (UFAB and UTAB) for the LAA data packets. We evaluate the performance of these unlicensed band allocation schemes in terms of the acceptance rate of both LAA and Wi-Fi packet data in the LAA buffer queue. Our study provides guidelines for designing the channel occupation phase and the buffer size of the LAA small cell.</description>

      <title>Markov Modeling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Underlay and Overlay D2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel analytical model for resource allocation is proposed for a device-to-device (D2D) assisted cellular network. The proposed model can be applied to underlay and overlay D2D systems for sharing licensed bands and offloading cellular traffic. The developed model also takes into account the problem of unlicensed band sharing with Wi-Fi systems. In the proposed model, a global system state reflects the interaction among D2D, conventional cellular, and Wi-Fi packets. Under the standard traffic model assumptions, a threshold-based flow control is proposed for guaranteeing the quality-of-service (QoS) of Wi-Fi. The packet blockage probability is then derived. Simulation results show the proposed scheme sacrifices conventional cellular performance slightly to improve overlay D2D performance significantly while maintaining the performance for Wi-Fi users. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme has more flexible adjustments between D2D and Wi-Fi than the underlay scheme.</description>

      <title>A Modular KDN-Based Framework for IT/OT Autonomy in Industrial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) is a critical enabler for achieving autonomous and intelligent industrial systems. However, the increasing complexity, heterogeneity, and real-time demands of industrial environments render traditional rule-based or static management approaches insufficient. In this paper, we present a modular framework based on the Knowledge-Defined Networking (KDN) paradigm, enabling adaptive and autonomous control across IT-OT infrastructures. The proposed architecture is composed of four core modules: Telemetry Collector, Knowledge Builder, Decision Engine, and Control Enforcer. These modules operate in a closed control loop to continuously observe system behavior, extract contextual knowledge, evaluate control actions, and apply policy decisions across programmable industrial endpoints. A graph-based abstraction is used to represent system state, and a utility-optimization mechanism guides control decisions under dynamic conditions. The framework's performance is evaluated using three key metrics: decision latency, control effectiveness, and system stability, demonstrating its capability to enhance resilience, responsiveness, and operational efficiency in smart industrial networks.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Defined and Twin-Assisted Network Management for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity, dynamism, and heterogeneity of 6G networks demand management systems that can reason proactively and generalize beyond pre-defined cases. In this paper, we propose a modular, knowledge-defined architecture that integrates Digital Twin models with semantic reasoning and zero-shot learning to enable autonomous decision-making for previously unseen network scenarios. Real-time data streams are used to maintain synchronized virtual replicas of the physical network, which also forecast short-term state transitions. These predictions feed into a knowledge plane that constructs and updates a graph-based abstraction of the network, enabling context-aware intent generation via graph neural reasoning. To ensure adaptability without retraining, the management plane performs zero-shot policy matching by semantically embedding candidate intents and selecting suitable pre-learned actions. The selected decisions are translated and enforced through the control plane, while a closed-loop feedback mechanism continuously refines predictions, knowledge, and policies over time. Simulation results confirm that the proposed framework observes notable improvements in policy response time, SLA compliance rate, and intent matching accuracy.</description>

      <title>AUV-Assisted Underwater 6G: Environmental Modeling and Multi-Stage Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a simulation model for underwater 6G networks, focusing on the optimized placement of sensors, AUVs, and hubs. The network architecture consists of fixed hub stations, mobile autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and numerous sensor nodes. Environmental parameters such as temperature, salinity, and conductivity are considered in the transmission of electromagnetic signals; signal attenuation and transmission delays are calculated based on physical models. The optimization process begins with K-Means clustering, followed by sequential application of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to refine the cluster configurations. The simulation includes key network dynamics such as multi-hop data transmission, cluster leader selection, queue management, and traffic load balancing. To compare performance, two distinct scenarios -- one with cluster leaders and one without -- are modeled and visualized through a PyQt5-based real-time graphical interface. The results demonstrate that 6G network architectures in underwater environments can be effectively modeled and optimized by incorporating environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Network Traffic Classification Using Self-Supervised Learning and Confident Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network traffic classification (NTC) is vital for efficient network management, security, and performance optimization, particularly with 5G/6G technologies. Traditional methods, such as deep packet inspection (DPI) and port-based identification, struggle with the rise of encrypted traffic and dynamic port allocations. Supervised learning methods provide viable alternatives but rely on large labeled datasets, which are difficult to acquire given the diversity and volume of network traffic. Meanwhile, unsupervised learning methods, while less reliant on labeled data, often exhibit lower accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that first leverages Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) with techniques such as autoencoders or Tabular Contrastive Learning (TabCL) to generate pseudo-labels from extensive unlabeled datasets, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data. We then apply traffic-adopted Confident Learning (CL) to refine these pseudo-labels, enhancing classification precision by mitigating the impact of noise. Our proposed framework offers a generalizable solution that minimizes the need for extensive labeled data while delivering high accuracy. Extensive simulations and evaluations, conducted using three datasets (ISCX VPN-nonVPN, self-generated dataset, and UCDavis--QUIC), and demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques in classifying network traffic.</description>

      <title>Sim2Field: End-to-End Development of AI RANs for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following state-of-the-art research results, which showed the potential for significant performance gains by applying AI/ML techniques in the cellular Radio Access Network (RAN), the wireless industry is now broadly pushing for the adoption of AI in 5G and future 6G technology. Despite this enthusiasm, AI-based wireless systems still remain largely untested in the field. Common simulation methods for generating datasets for AI model training suffer from "reality gap" and, as a result, the performance of these simulation-trained models may not carry over to practical cellular systems. Additionally, the cost and complexity of developing high-performance proof-of-concept implementations present major hurdles for evaluating AI wireless systems in the field. In this work, we introduce a methodology which aims to address the challenges of bringing AI to real networks. We discuss how detailed Digital Twin simulations may be employed for training site-specific AI Physical (PHY) layer functions. We further present a powerful testbed for AI-RAN research and demonstrate how it enables rapid prototyping, field testing and data collection. Finally, we evaluate an AI channel estimation algorithm over-the-air with a commercial UE, demonstrating that real-world throughput gains of up to 40% are achievable by incorporating AI in the physical layer.</description>

      <title>Short-Term Guidance Algorithm on a Drone Road System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, have experienced expanding use in urban environments in recent years. However, the growing density of drones raises significant challenges, such as avoiding collisions and managing air traffic efficiently, especially in congested areas. To address these issues, a structured road system and an effective guidance algorithm are essential. In this paper, we introduce a markup language allowing to describe drone road systems (DRS), in which a road system is given by a set of individual roads, each of which can have a varying number of lanes. Roads can be linked through connecting lanes. Furthermore, we propose a novel short-term decentralized greedy (STDG) guidance algorithm that uses only the position and speed information of nearby drones -- communicated via periodically transmitted beacons -- to make real-time decisions such as stopping, changing lanes, or adjusting speed for the next few seconds. Unlike existing methods that rely on centralized coordination, our algorithm enables drones to operate independently while ensuring safety and efficiency. We present simulation results showing the impact of key wireless and algorithm parameters on performance metrics like the drone collision rate, average speed and throughput of the drone road system.</description>

      <title>A Synergy of Computing Power Networks and Low-Altitude Economy Intelligent Communications: Challenges, Design Principles, and Research Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of the Low-Altitude Economy (LAE) has created opportunities for emerging services such as autonomous aerial transportation, aerial sensing, and emergency response, all of which rely on efficient and intelligent communications. However, LAE intelligent communications face several challenges, including the limited computational capacity of aerial nodes, the lack of cross-scenario generalization, and the complexity of heterogeneous demands. Meanwhile, Computing Power Networks (CPNs) have emerged as a new paradigm for integrating distributed computing, networking, and storage resources, but they are also constrained by static deployment and limited adaptability. In this survey, we explore the synergy between LAE intelligent communications and CPNs. We first analyze how CPNs can support LAE intelligent communications in areas such as air-ground collaborative control, AI training, communication-computation co-ptimization, and ubiquitous low-altitude information processing. Conversely, we discuss how LAE intelligent communications can enhance CPNs through mobility-assisted control, distributed intelligent training, dynamic routing, and in-network aerial computing. Finally, based on these insights, we outline design principles and future research directions for integrated CPN-LAE systems. This work provides a comprehensive foundation for building flexible, adaptive, and resilient architectures that leverage the synergy between CPNs and LAE to deliver high-quality and sustainable low-altitude services.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning to Generalize Forwarding Strategies for Diverse Mobile Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been successfully used to design forwarding strategies for multi-hop mobile wireless networks. While such strategies can be used directly for networks with varied connectivity and dynamic conditions, developing generalizable approaches that are effective on scenarios significantly different from the training environment remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a framework to address the challenge of generalizability by (i) developing a generalizable base model considering diverse mobile network scenarios, and (ii) using the generalizable base model for new scenarios, and when needed, fine-tuning the base model using a small amount of data from the new scenarios. To support this framework, we first design new features to characterize network variation and feature quality, thereby improving the information used in DRL-based forwarding decisions. We then develop a continual learning (CL) approach able to train DRL models across diverse network scenarios without ``catastrophic forgetting.'' Using extensive evaluation, including real-world scenarios in two cities, we show that our approach is generalizable to unseen mobility scenarios. Compared to a state-of-the-art heuristic forwarding strategy, it leads to up to 78% reduction in delay, 24% improvement in delivery rate, and comparable or slightly higher number of forwards.</description>

Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the uplink of OFDMA-based MU-MIMO systems with multi-antenna users, for three Zero-Forcing (ZF) Beamforming (BF) strategies: Coordinated-Transmit-Receive-1 (CTR1), where only the strongest data stream is enabled per scheduled user; Block Diagonalization (BD), where all possible streams are enabled per scheduled user; Coordinated-Transmit-Receive-Flexible (CTRF), which allows a flexible stream allocation per user. The Radio Resource Management (RRM) of the uplink of all OFDMA-based systems must be done over an entire Time-Slot (TS) due to power management, making it challenging. To enable this study, we propose an efficient heuristic based on greedy-up searches for stream-sets that provides feasible solutions. It operates over the TS and considers fairness, practical Modulation and Coding Schemes and all RRM processes. The results show that, for Rural Macro scenarios, BD (resp. CTR1) could replace the more complex CTRF if the number of users is small (resp. large), while for Urban Macro scenarios, CTR1 emerges as an alternative to CTRF due to its similar performance. We also show that the system parameters can substantially impact the performance of the ZF strategies and that BD performance is more impaired with a simpler power management scheme than CTR1 and CTRF.</description>

      <title>Beyond Redundancy: Toward Agile Resilience in Optical Networks to Overcome Unpredictable Disasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilience in optical networks has traditionally relied on redundancy and pre-planned recovery strategies, both of which assume a certain level of disaster predictability. However, recent environmental changes such as climate shifts, the evolution of communication services, and rising geopolitical risks have increased the unpredictability of disasters, reducing the effectiveness of conventional resilience approaches. To address this unpredictability, this paper introduces the concept of agile resilience, which emphasizes dynamic adaptability across multiple operators and layers. We identify key requirements and challenges, and present enabling technologies for the realization of agile resilience. Using a field-deployed transmission system, we demonstrate rapid system characterization, optical path provisioning, and database migration within six hours. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed enabling technologies and confirm the feasibility of agile resilience.</description>

      <title>Flexible and High-Performance Radio Access Networks for upcoming Sixth-Generation (6G) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collaborative research project 6G-ANNA develops concepts for the 6G radio access network (RAN) architecture and technology components. Previous RAN generations have become inherently more complex and reach their limits in handling foreseen future traffic demands with their diverse characteristics in an efficient manner, e.g., for the use-case of mobile eXtended Reality (XR) on a massive scale. One main objective of 6G is to regain both operational and energy efficiency, i.e., by simplification and automation. To achieve this, in this paper a flexible 6G RAN functional architecture and protocol stack as well as implementation and deployment options are described. We outline how performance is optimized by distributed Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) and distributed Carrier Aggregation (CA), and furthermore, how adaptiveness and scalability is enabled by Cloud RAN and service orchestration. Finally, the proposed zero-trust framework mitigates security risks in the described 6G RAN architecture.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning for Correlating Network Incidents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet service providers monitor their networks to detect, triage, and remediate service impairments. When an incident is detected, it is important to determine whether similar incidents have occurred in the past or are happening concurrently elsewhere in the network. Manual correlation of such incidents is infeasible due to the scale of the networks under observation, making automated correlation a necessity. This paper presents a self-supervised learning method for similarity-based correlation of network situations. Using this method, a deep neural network is trained on a large unlabeled dataset of network situations using contrastive learning. High precision achieved in experiments on real-world network monitoring data suggests that contrastive learning is a promising approach to network incident correlation.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-Driven Federation for Distributed Edge Systems: Design and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge computing brings computation near end users, enabling the provisioning of novel use cases. To satisfy end-user requirements, the concept of edge federation has recently emerged as a key mechanism for dynamic resources and services sharing across edge systems managed by different administrative domains. However, existing federation solutions often rely on pre-established agreements and face significant limitations, including operational complexity, delays caused by manual operations, high overhead costs, and dependence on trusted third parties. In this context, blockchain can create dynamic federation agreements that enable service providers to securely interact and share services without prior trust.
  This article first describes the problem of edge federation, using the standardized ETSI multi-access edge computing framework as a reference architecture, and how it is being addressed. Then, it proposes a novel solution using blockchain and smart contracts to enable distributed MEC systems to dynamically negotiate and execute federation in a secure, automated, and scalable manner. We validate our framework's feasibility through a performance evaluation using a private Ethereum blockchain, built on the open-source Hyperledger Besu platform. The testbed includes a large number of MEC systems and compares two blockchain consensus algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution automates the entire federation lifecycle-from negotiation to deployment-with a quantifiable overhead, achieving federation in approximately 18 seconds in a baseline scenario. The framework scales efficiently in concurrent request scenarios, where multiple MEC systems initiate federation requests simultaneously. This approach provides a promising direction for addressing the complexities of dynamic, multi-domain federations across the edge-to-cloud continuum.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study of Magnetic Near-Field Microstrip Electronic Probe for PCB EMC Emission Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experimental study on magnetic near-field (NF) scanning of printed circuit board (PCB) emission radiation is developed in this paper. The design and installation of the electromagnetic (EM) NF scanner is introduced. The test bed of magnetic NF emission in the microwave frequency range is described. The methodology of the microstrip magnetic NF probe is discussed. The probe calibration process was performed following the IEC 61967-1 NF scanning standard. The NF scanner functioning is tested with passive microstrip circuit square loop probe and device under test (DUT) PCB radiation in the test plan positioned at 1-mm above the ground plane. Based on the standard test with I-shape 50-$\Omega$ transmission line (TL), the calibration process of radiated magnetic field was validated by comparison between HFSS__ simulation and experimentation in very wideband frequency from 0.1-GHz to 3-GHz. Then, a nonstandard TL based DUT was experimented. Accordingly, the cartographies of scanned magnetic NF at two different test frequencies, 2 GHz and 3 GHz, are discussed. The NF scanner is under development for targeting the EMC radiated emission of PCB dedicated to operate in 6G wireless communication.</description>

      <title>DNN-Based Precoding in RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems With Practical Phase Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02824v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.</description>

      <title>Green Learning for STAR-RIS mmWave Systems with Implicit CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework is proposed for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO broadcasting systems. Motivated by the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability in future 6G networks, this work adopts a broadcasting transmission architecture for scenarios where multiple users share identical information, improving spectral efficiency and reducing redundant transmissions and power consumption. Different from conventional optimization methods, such as block coordinate descent (BCD) that require perfect channel state information (CSI) and iterative computation, the proposed GL framework operates directly on received uplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. Unlike deep learning (DL) approaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach also avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more lightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with supervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully CSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with adjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature selection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to jointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation results show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral efficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point operations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the proposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and hardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sustainable LSTM-Based Precoding for RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems with Implicit CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sustainable long short-term memory (LSTM)-based precoding framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Instead of explicit channel state information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES) with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Edge Intelligence for UAV Handover in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 6G wireless networks aim to exploit semantic awareness to optimize radio resources. By optimizing the transmission through the lens of the desired goal, the energy consumption of transmissions can also be reduced, and the latency can be improved. To that end, this paper investigates a paradigm in which the capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) on the edge are harnessed for network optimization. In particular, we investigate an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) handover framework that takes advantage of GenAI and semantic communication to maintain reliable connectivity. To that end, we propose a framework in which a lightweight MobileBERT language model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), is deployed on the UAV. This model processes multi-attribute flight and radio measurements and performs multi-label classification to determine appropriate handover action. Concurrently, the model identifies an appropriate set of contextual "Reason Tags" that elucidate the decision's rationale. Our model, evaluated on a rule-based synthetic dataset of UAV handover scenarios, demonstrates the model's high efficacy in learning these rules, achieving high accuracy in predicting the primary handover decision. The model also shows strong performance in identifying supporting reasons, with an F1 micro-score of approximately 0.9 for reason tags.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a structured approach to evaluating vulnerabilities within quantum cryptographic protocols, focusing on the BB84 quantum key distribution method and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) approved quantum-resistant algorithms. By integrating AI-driven red teaming, automated penetration testing, and real-time anomaly detection, the research develops a framework for assessing and mitigating security risks in quantum networks. The findings demonstrate that AI can be effectively used to simulate adversarial attacks, probe weaknesses in cryptographic implementations, and refine security mechanisms through iterative feedback. The use of automated exploit simulations and protocol fuzzing provides a scalable means of identifying latent vulnerabilities, while adversarial machine learning techniques highlight novel attack surfaces within AI-enhanced cryptographic processes. This study offers a comprehensive methodology for strengthening quantum security and provides a foundation for integrating AI-driven cybersecurity practices into the evolving quantum landscape.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance. Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs, revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural changes).</description>

      <title>EKF-Based Fusion of Wi-Fi/LiDAR/IMU for Indoor Localization and Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting cannot meet the growing demand for accurate indoor localization and navigation due to its lower accuracy, while solutions based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can provide better localization performance but is limited by their higher deployment cost and complexity. To address these issues, we propose a novel indoor localization and navigation framework integrating Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting, LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) navigation based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Specifically, coarse localization by deep neural network (DNN)-based Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting is refined by IMU-based dynamic positioning using a Gmapping-based SLAM to generate an occupancy grid map and output high-frequency attitude estimates, which is followed by EKF prediction-update integrating sensor information while effectively suppressing Wi-Fi-induced noise and IMU drift errors. Multi-group real-world experiments conducted on the IR building at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University demonstrates that the proposed multi-sensor fusion framework suppresses the instability caused by individual approaches and thereby provides stable accuracy across all path configurations with mean two-dimensional (2D) errors ranging from 0.2449 m to 0.3781 m. In contrast, the mean 2D errors of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting reach up to 1.3404 m in areas with severe signal interference, and those of LiDAR/IMU localization are between 0.6233 m and 2.8803 m due to cumulative drift.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Distributed Channel Access for Collision Avoidance in Future Wi-Fi 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous scenarios.</description>

      <title>ZeroSiam: An Efficient Siamese for Test-Time Entropy Optimization without Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time entropy minimization helps adapt a model to novel environments and incentivize its reasoning capability, unleashing the model's potential during inference by allowing it to evolve and improve in real-time using its own predictions, achieving promising performance. However, pure entropy minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models, including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI Reasoning for Mobile Edge General Intelligence: Fundamentals, Approaches, and Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However, deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First, we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency, validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.</description>

      <title>StarveSpam: Mitigating Spam with Local Reputation in Permissionless Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spam poses a growing threat to blockchain networks. Adversaries can easily create multiple accounts to flood transaction pools, inflating fees and degrading service quality. Existing defenses against spam, such as fee markets and staking requirements, primarily rely on economic deterrence, which fails to distinguish between malicious and legitimate users and often exclude low-value but honest activity. To address these shortcomings, we present StarveSpam, a decentralized reputation-based protocol that mitigates spam by operating at the transaction relay layer. StarveSpam combines local behavior tracking, peer scoring, and adaptive rate-limiting to suppress abusive actors, without requiring global consensus, protocol changes, or trusted infrastructure. We evaluate StarveSpam using real Ethereum data from a major NFT spam event and show that it outperforms existing fee-based and rule-based defenses, allowing each node to block over 95% of spam while dropping just 3% of honest traffic, and reducing the fraction of the network exposed to spam by 85% compared to existing rule-based methods. StarveSpam offers a scalable and deployable alternative to traditional spam defenses, paving the way toward more resilient and equitable blockchain infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Network-Optimised Spiking Neural Network for Event-Driven Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer event-driven computation suited to time-critical networking tasks such as anomaly detection, local routing control, and congestion management at the edge. Classical units, including Hodgkin-Huxley, Izhikevich, and the Random Neural Network, map poorly to these needs. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a compact two-variable unit whose state encodes normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource. The model uses a saturating nonlinearity to enforce finite buffers, a service-rate leak, and graph-local inputs with delays and optional per link gates. It supports two differentiable reset schemes for training and deployment. We give conditions for equilibrium existence and uniqueness, local stability tests from the Jacobian trace and determinant, and a network threshold that scales with the Perron eigenvalue of the coupling matrix. The analysis yields an operational rule g* ~ k* rho(W) linking damping and offered load, shows how saturation enlarges the stable region, and explains finite-size smoothing of synchrony onsets. Stochastic arrivals follow a Poisson shot-noise model aligned with telemetry smoothing. Against queueing baselines, NOS matches M/M/1 mean by calibration while truncating deep tails under bursty input. In closed loop it gives, low-jitte with short settling. In zero-shot, label-free forecasting NOS is calibrated per node from arrival statistics. Its NOS dynamics yield high AUROC/AUPRC, enabling timely detection of congestion onsets with few false positives. Under a train-calibrated residual protocol across chain, star, and scale-free topologies, NOS improves early-warning F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and tGNN. We provide guidance for data-driven initialisation, surrogate-gradient training with a homotopy on reset sharpness, and explicit stability checks with topology-aware bounds for resource constrained deployments.</description>

      <title>PEARL: Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D) communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs, PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context, reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for always-on, on-device cross-layer control.</description>

      <title>Markov Decision Processing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Markov Decision Processing Networks (MDPNs) as a multiclass queueing network model where service is a controlled, finite-state Markov process. The model exhibits a decision-dependent service process where actions taken influence future service availability. Viewed as a two-sided queueing model, this captures settings such as assemble-to-order systems, ride-hailing platforms, cross-skilled call centers, and quantum switches.
  We first characterize the capacity region of MDPNs. Unlike classical switched networks, the MDPN capacity region depends on the long-run mix of service states induced by the control of the underlying service process. We show, via a counterexample, that MaxWeight is not throughput-optimal in this class, demonstrating the distinction between MDPNs and classical queueing models.
  To bridge this gap, we design a weighted average reward policy, a multiobjective MDP that leverages a two-timescale separation at the fluid scale. We prove throughput-optimality of the resulting policy. The techniques yield a clear capacity region description and apply to a broad family of two-sided matching systems.</description>

      <title>Graph Theory Meets Federated Learning over Satellite Constellations: Spanning Aggregations, Network Formation, and Performance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Fed-Span, a novel federated/distributed learning framework designed for low Earth orbit satellite constellations. By leveraging graph-theoretic principles, Fed-Span addresses critical challenges inherent to distributed learning in dynamic satellite networks, including intermittent satellite connectivity, heterogeneous computational capabilities of satellites, and time-varying satellites' datasets. At its core, Fed-Span builds upon minimum spanning tree (MST) and minimum spanning forest (MSF) topologies, enabling spanning model aggregation and dispatching processes for distributed learning. To formalize Fed-Span, we offer a fresh perspective on MST/MSF topologies by formulating them through a set of continuous constraint representations (CCRs), thereby devising graph-theoretical abstractions into an optimizable framework for satellite networks. Using these CCRs, we obtain the energy consumption and latency of operations in Fed-Span. Moreover, we derive novel convergence bounds for non-convex machine learning loss functions, accommodating the key system characteristics and degrees of freedom of Fed-Span. Finally, we propose a comprehensive optimization problem that jointly minimizes model prediction loss, energy consumption, and latency of Fed-Span. We unveil that this problem is NP-hard and develop a systematic approach to transform it into a geometric programming formulation, solved via successive convex optimization with performance guarantees. Through evaluations on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Fed-Span outperforms existing methods, with faster model convergence, greater energy efficiency, and reduced latency. These results highlight Fed-Span as a novel solution for efficient distributed learning in satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Learning to Speak on Behalf of a Group: Medium Access Control for Sending a Shared Message</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.00401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has not only enabled new applications, but also presented new challenges for reliable communication with limited resources. In this work, we define a novel problem that can arise in these scenarios, in which a set of sensors need to communicate a joint observation. This observation is shared by a random subset of the nodes, which need to propagate it to the rest of the network, but coordination is complex: as signaling constraints require the use of random access schemes over shared channels, sensors need to implicitly coordinate, so that at least one transmission gets through without collisions. Unlike the majority of existing medium access schemes, the goal is to make sure that the shared message gets through, regardless of the sender. We analyze this coordination problem theoretically and provide low-complexity solutions. While a clustering-based approach is near-optimal if the sensors have prior knowledge, we provide a distributed multi-armed bandit (MAB) solution for the more general case and validate it by simulation.</description>

Abstract: Cellular Radio Access Networks (RANs) are rapidly evolving towards 6G, driven by the need to reduce costs and introduce new revenue streams for operators and enterprises. In this context, AI emerges as a key enabler in solving complex RAN problems spanning both the management and application domains. Unfortunately, and despite the undeniable promise of AI, several practical challenges still remain, hindering the widespread adoption of AI applications in the RAN space. In this work, we attempt to shed light to these challenges and argue that existing approaches in addressing them are inadequate for realizing the vision of a truly AI-native 6G network. We propose a distributed AI platform architecture, tailored to the needs of an AI-native RAN.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for O-RAN Mobility Management: A Link Prediction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobility performance has been a key focus in cellular networks up to 5G. To enhance handover (HO) performance, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handover (CHO) and Layer 1/Layer 2 Triggered Mobility (LTM) mechanisms in 5G. While these reactive HO strategies address the trade-off between HO failures (HOF) and ping-pong effects, they often result in inefficient radio resource utilization due to additional HO preparations. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a proactive HO framework for mobility management in O-RAN, leveraging user-cell link predictions to identify the optimal target cell for HO. We explore various categories of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for link prediction and analyze the complexity of applying them to the mobility management domain. Two GNN models are compared using a real-world dataset, with experimental results demonstrating their ability to capture the dynamic and graph-structured nature of cellular networks. Finally, we present key insights from our study and outline future steps to enable the integration of GNN-based link prediction for mobility management in O-RAN networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel multiband passive sensing system that leverages IEEE 802.11bf Wi-Fi signals for environmental sensing, focusing on both sub-7 GHz and millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. By combining Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple bands, the system enhances accuracy and reliability in detecting human presence, movement, and activities in indoor environments. Utilizing a novel model, called MILAGRO, the system demonstrates robust performance across different scenarios, including monitoring human presence in workspaces and tracking movement in corridors. Experimental results show high accuracy (95-100%), with improved performance by integrating multiband data. The system also addresses key security concerns associated with passive sensing, proposing measures to mitigate potential risks. This work advances the use of Wi-Fi for passive sensing by reducing reliance on active sensing infrastructure and extending the capabilities of low-cost, non-intrusive environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Better Together: Leveraging Multiple Digital Twins for Deployment Optimization of Airborne Base Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Airborne Base Stations (ABSs) allow for flexible geographical allocation of network resources with dynamically changing load as well as rapid deployment of alternate connectivity solutions during natural disasters. Since the radio infrastructure is carried by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited flight time, it is important to establish the best location for the ABS without exhaustive field trials. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-guided approach to achieve this through the following key contributions: (i) Implementation of an interactive software bridge between two open-source DTs such that the same scene is evaluated with high fidelity across NVIDIA's Sionna and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin (AODT), highlighting the unique features of each of these platforms for this allocation problem, (ii) Design of a back-propagation-based algorithm in Sionna for rapidly converging on the physical location of the UAVs, orientation of the antennas and transmit power to ensure efficient coverage across the swarm of the UAVs, and (iii) numerical evaluation in AODT for large network scenarios (50 UEs, 10 ABS) that identifies the environmental conditions in which there is agreement or divergence of performance results between these twins. Finally, (iv) we propose a resilience mechanism to provide consistent coverage to mission-critical devices and demonstrate a use case for bi-directional flow of information between the two DTs.</description>

      <title>Bridging Technical Capability and User Accessibility: Off-grid Civilian Emergency Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During large-scale crises disrupting cellular and Internet infrastructure, civilians lack reliable methods for communication, aid coordination, and access to trustworthy information. This paper presents a unified emergency communication system integrating a low-power, long-range network with a crisis-oriented smartphone application, enabling decentralized and off-grid civilian communication. Unlike previous solutions separating physical layer resilience from user layer usability, our design merges these aspects into a cohesive crisis-tailored framework.
  The system is evaluated in two dimensions: communication performance and application functionality. Field experiments in urban Z\"urich demonstrate that the 868 MHz band, using the LongFast configuration, achieves a communication range of up to 1.2 km with 92% Packet Delivery Ratio, validating network robustness under real-world infrastructure degraded conditions. In parallel, a purpose-built mobile application featuring peer-to-peer messaging, identity verification, and community moderation was evaluated through a requirements-based analysis.</description>
