      <title>Embodied Intelligence for Flexible Manufacturing: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by breakthroughs in next-generation artificial intelligence, embodied intelligence is rapidly advancing into industrial manufacturing. In flexible manufacturing, industrial embodied intelligence faces three core challenges: accurate process modeling and monitoring under limited perception, dynamic balancing between flexible adaptation and high-precision control, and the integration of general-purpose skills with specialized industrial operations. Accordingly, this survey reviews existing work from three viewpoints: Industrial Eye, Industrial Hand, and Industrial Brain. At the perception level (Industrial Eye), multimodal data fusion and real-time modeling in complex dynamic settings are examined. At the control level (Industrial Hand), flexible, adaptive, and precise manipulation for complex manufacturing processes is analyzed. At the decision level (Industrial Brain), intelligent optimization methods for process planning and line scheduling are summarized. By considering multi-level collaboration and interdisciplinary integration, this work reveals the key technological pathways of embodied intelligence for closed-loop optimization of perception-decision-execution in manufacturing systems. A three-stage evolution model for the development of embodied intelligence in flexible manufacturing scenarios, comprising cognition enhancement, skill transition, and system evolution, is proposed, and future development trends are examined, to offer both a theoretical framework and practical guidance for the interdisciplinary advancement of industrial embodied intelligence in the context of flexible manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Adaptive Group Negotiation for Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Collaboration with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-robot collaboration tasks often require heterogeneous robots to work together over long horizons under spatial constraints and environmental uncertainties. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning, their potential for coordinated control has not been fully explored. Inspired by human teamwork, we present CLiMRS (Cooperative Large-Language-Model-Driven Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System), an adaptive group negotiation framework among LLMs for multi-robot collaboration. This framework pairs each robot with an LLM agent and dynamically forms subgroups through a general proposal planner. Within each subgroup, a subgroup manager leads perception-driven multi-LLM discussions to get commands for actions. Feedback is provided by both robot execution outcomes and environment changes. This grouping-planning-execution-feedback loop enables efficient planning and robust execution. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CLiMBench, a heterogeneous multi-robot benchmark of challenging assembly tasks. Our experiments show that CLiMRS surpasses the best baseline, achieving over 40% higher efficiency on complex tasks without sacrificing success on simpler ones. Overall, our results demonstrate that leveraging human-inspired group formation and negotiation principles significantly enhances the efficiency of heterogeneous multi-robot collaboration.

      <title>Learning to Anchor Visual Odometry: KAN-Based Pose Regression for Planetary Landing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and real-time 6-DoF localization is mission-critical for autonomous lunar landing, yet existing approaches remain limited: visual odometry (VO) drifts unboundedly, while map-based absolute localization fails in texture-sparse or low-light terrain. We introduce KANLoc, a monocular localization framework that tightly couples VO with a lightweight but robust absolute pose regressor. At its core is a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that learns the complex mapping from image features to map coordinates, producing sparse but highly reliable global pose anchors. These anchors are fused into a bundle adjustment framework, effectively canceling drift while retaining local motion precision. KANLoc delivers three key advances: (i) a KAN-based pose regressor that achieves high accuracy with remarkable parameter efficiency, (ii) a hybrid VO-absolute localization scheme that yields globally consistent real-time trajectories (&gt;=15 FPS), and (iii) a tailored data augmentation strategy that improves robustness to sensor occlusion. On both realistic synthetic and real lunar landing datasets, KANLoc reduces average translation and rotation error by 32% and 45%, respectively, with per-trajectory gains of up to 45%/48%, outperforming strong baselines.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Medical Drones from Flight Dynamics, Guidance, Navigation, and Control Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of drones into the medical field has revolutionized healthcare delivery by enabling rapid transportation of medical supplies, organs, and even emergency assistance in remote or disaster-stricken areas. While other survey papers focus on the healthcare supply chain, operations, and medical emergency response aspects, this paper provides a comprehensive review of medical drones from the perspectives of flight dynamics and guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems. We first discuss the medical aerial delivery mission requirements and suitable uncrewed aerial system (UAS) configurations. We then address payload container design and optimization, and its effect on supplies and overall flight dynamics. We also explore the fundamental principles of GNC in the context of medical drone operations, highlighting key challenges arising from vibration, air temperature, pressure, and humidity, which affect the quality of medical supplies. The paper examines various GNC algorithms that can mitigate these challenges, as well as the algorithms' limitations. With these considerations, this survey aims to provide insights into optimizing GNC frameworks for medical drones, emphasizing research gaps and directions to improve real-world healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Formal Methods in Robot Policy Learning and Verification: A Survey on Current Techniques and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As hardware and software systems have grown in complexity, formal methods have been indispensable tools for rigorously specifying acceptable behaviors, synthesizing programs to meet these specifications, and validating the correctness of existing programs. In the field of robotics, a similar trend of rising complexity has emerged, driven in large part by the adoption of deep learning. While this shift has enabled the development of highly performant robot policies, their implementation as deep neural networks has posed challenges to traditional formal analysis, leading to models that are inflexible, fragile, and difficult to interpret. In response, the robotics community has introduced new formal and semi-formal methods to support the precise specification of complex objectives, guide the learning process to achieve them, and enable the verification of learned policies against them. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of how formal methods have been used in recent robot learning research. We organize our discussion around two pillars: policy learning and policy verification. For both, we highlight representative techniques, compare their scalability and expressiveness, and summarize how they contribute to meaningfully improving realistic robot safety and correctness. We conclude with a discussion of remaining obstacles for achieving that goal and promising directions for advancing formal methods in robot learning.</description>

      <title>FeudalNav: A Simple Framework for Visual Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual navigation for robotics is inspired by the human ability to navigate environments using visual cues and memory, eliminating the need for detailed maps. In unseen, unmapped, or GPS-denied settings, traditional metric map-based methods fall short, prompting a shift toward learning-based approaches with minimal exploration. In this work, we develop a hierarchical framework that decomposes the navigation decision-making process into multiple levels. Our method learns to select subgoals through a simple, transferable waypoint selection network. A key component of the approach is a latent-space memory module organized solely by visual similarity, as a proxy for distance. This alternative to graph-based topological representations proves sufficient for navigation tasks, providing a compact, light-weight, simple-to-train navigator that can find its way to the goal in novel locations. We show competitive results with a suite of SOTA methods in Habitat AI environments without using any odometry in training or inference. An additional contribution leverages the interpretablility of the framework for interactive navigation. We consider the question: how much direction intervention/interaction is needed to achieve success in all trials? We demonstrate that even minimal human involvement can significantly enhance overall navigation performance.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Manipulation of Hazardous Chemicals and Delicate Objects in a Self-Driving Laboratory: A Sliding Mode Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise handling of chemical instruments and materials within a self-driving laboratory environment using robotic systems demands advanced and reliable control strategies. Sliding Mode Control (SMC) has emerged as a robust approach for managing uncertainties and disturbances in manipulator dynamics, providing superior control performance compared to traditional methods. This study implements a model-based SMC (MBSMC) utilizing a hyperbolic tangent function to regulate the motion of a manipulator mounted on a mobile platform operating inside a self-driving chemical laboratory. Given the manipulator's role in transporting fragile glass vessels filled with hazardous chemicals, the controller is specifically designed to minimize abrupt transitions and achieve gentle, accurate trajectory tracking. The proposed controller is benchmarked against a non-model-based SMC (NMBSMC) and a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller using a comprehensive set of joint and Cartesian metrics. Compared to PID and NMBSMC, MBSMC achieved significantly smoother motion and up to 90% lower control effort, validating its robustness and precision for autonomous laboratory operations. Experimental trials confirmed successful execution of tasks such as vessel grasping and window operation, which failed under PID control due to its limited ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances, resulting in substantial trajectory tracking errors. The results validate the controller's effectiveness in achieving smooth, precise, and safe manipulator motions, supporting the advancement of intelligent mobile manipulators in autonomous laboratory environments.</description>

      <title>LangGS-SLAM: Real-Time Language-Feature Gaussian Splatting SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a RGB-D SLAM system that reconstructs a language-aligned dense feature field while sustaining low-latency tracking and mapping. First, we introduce a Top-K Rendering pipeline, a high-throughput and semantic-distortion-free method for efficiently rendering high-dimensional feature maps. To address the resulting semantic-geometric discrepancy and mitigate the memory consumption, we further design a multi-criteria map management strategy that prunes redundant or inconsistent Gaussians while preserving scene integrity. Finally, a hybrid field optimization framework jointly refines the geometric and semantic fields under real-time constraints by decoupling their optimization frequencies according to field characteristics. The proposed system achieves superior geometric fidelity compared to geometric-only baselines and comparable semantic fidelity to offline approaches while operating at 15 FPS. Our results demonstrate that online SLAM with dense, uncompressed language-aligned feature fields is both feasible and effective, bridging the gap between 3D perception and language-based reasoning.</description>

      <title>When Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Meets Wireless Communications: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of commercial wireless communication and sensing equipment combined with the advancements in intelligent autonomous systems paves the way towards robust joint communications and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in the nexus of SLAM and Wireless Communications, attributing the bidirectional impact of each with a focus on visual SLAM (V-SLAM) integration. We provide an overview of key concepts related to wireless signal propagation, geometric channel modeling, and radio frequency (RF)-based localization and sensing. In addition to this, we show image processing techniques that can detect landmarks, proactively predicting optimal paths for wireless channels. Several dimensions are considered, including the prerequisites, techniques, background, and future directions and challenges of the intersection between SLAM and wireless communications. We analyze mathematical approaches such as probabilistic models, and spatial methods for signal processing, as well as key technological aspects. We expose techniques and items towards enabling a highly effective retrieval of the autonomous robot state. Among other interesting findings, we observe that monocular V-SLAM would benefit from RF relevant information, as the latter can serve as a proxy for the scale ambiguity resolution. Conversely, we find that wireless communications in the context of 5G and beyond can potentially benefit from visual odometry that is central in SLAM. Moreover, we examine other sources besides the camera for SLAM and describe the twofold relation with wireless communications. Finally, integrated solutions performing joint communications and SLAM are still in their infancy: theoretical and practical advancements are required to add higher-level localization and semantic perception capabilities to RF and multi-antenna technologies.</description>

      <title>Admittance-Based Motion Planning with Vision-Guided Initialization for Robotic Manipulators in Self-Driving Laboratories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self driving laboratories (SDLs) are highly automated research environments that leverage advanced technologies to conduct experiments and analyze data with minimal human involvement. These environments often involve delicate laboratory equipment, unpredictable environmental interactions, and occasional human intervention, making compliant and force aware control essential for ensuring safety, adaptability, and reliability. This paper introduces a motion-planning framework centered on admittance control to enable adaptive and compliant robotic manipulation. Unlike conventional schemes, the proposed approach integrates an admittance controller directly into trajectory execution, allowing the manipulator to dynamically respond to external forces during interaction. This capability enables human operators to override or redirect the robot's motion in real time. A vision algorithm based on structured planar pose estimation is employed to detect and localize textured planar objects through feature extraction, homography estimation, and depth fusion, thereby providing an initial target configuration for motion planning. The vision based initialization establishes the reference trajectory, while the embedded admittance controller ensures that trajectory execution remains safe, adaptive, and responsive to external forces or human intervention. The proposed strategy is validated using textured image detection as a proof of concept. Future work will extend the framework to SDL environments involving transparent laboratory objects where compliant motion planning can further enhance autonomy, safety, and human-robot collaboration.</description>

      <title>ARGOS: Automated Functional Safety Requirement Synthesis for Embodied AI via Attribute-Guided Combinatorial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring functional safety is essential for the deployment of Embodied AI in complex open-world environments. However, traditional Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) methods struggle to scale in this domain. While HARA relies on enumerating risks for finite and pre-defined function lists, Embodied AI operates on open-ended natural language instructions, creating a challenge of combinatorial interaction risks. Whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this scalability challenge, they often lack physical grounding, yielding semantically superficial and incoherent hazard descriptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework ARGOS (AttRibute-Guided cOmbinatorial reaSoning), which bridges the gap between open-ended user instructions and concrete physical attributes. By dynamically decomposing entities from instructions into these fine-grained properties, ARGOS grounds LLM reasoning in causal risk factors to generate physically plausible hazard scenarios. It then instantiates abstract safety standards, such as ISO 13482, into context-specific Functional Safety Requirements (FSRs) by integrating these scenarios with robot capabilities. Extensive experiments validate that ARGOS produces high-quality FSRs and outperforms baselines in identifying long-tail risks. Overall, this work paves the way for systematic and grounded functional safety requirement generation, a critical step toward the safe industrial deployment of Embodied AI.</description>

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is fundamental in human-robot collaboration (HRC), enabling robots to respond to and dynamically adapt to human intentions. This paper introduces a HAR system combining a modular data glove equipped with Inertial Measurement Units and a vision-based tactile sensor to capture hand activities in contact with a robot. We tested our activity recognition approach under different conditions, including offline classification of segmented sequences, real-time classification under static conditions, and a realistic HRC scenario. The experimental results show a high accuracy for all the tasks, suggesting that multiple collaborative settings could benefit from this multi-modal approach.</description>

      <title>Airspace-aware Contingency Landing Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a real-time, search-based aircraft contingency landing planner that minimizes traffic disruptions while accounting for ground risk. The airspace model captures dense air traffic departure and arrival flows, helicopter corridors, and prohibited zones and is demonstrated with a Washington, D.C., area case study. Historical Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data are processed to estimate air traffic density. A low-latency computational geometry algorithm generates proximity-based heatmaps around high-risk corridors and restricted regions. Airspace risk is quantified as the cumulative exposure time of a landing trajectory within congested regions, while ground risk is assessed from overflown population density to jointly guide trajectory selection. A landing site selection module further mitigates disruption to nominal air traffic operations. Benchmarking against minimum-risk Dubins solutions demonstrates that the proposed planner achieves lower joint risk and reduced airspace disruption while maintaining real-time performance. Under airspace-risk-only conditions, the planner generates trajectories within an average of 2.9 seconds on a laptop computer. Future work will incorporate dynamic air traffic updates to enable spatiotemporal contingency landing planning that minimizes the need for real-time traffic rerouting.</description>

      <title>A compliant ankle-actuated compass walker with triggering timing control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive dynamic walkers are widely adopted as a mathematical model to represent biped walking. The stable locomotion of these models is limited to tilted surfaces, requiring gravitational energy. Various techniques, such as actuation through the ankle and hip joints, have been proposed to extend the applicability of these models to level ground and rough terrain with improved locomotion efficiency. However, most of these techniques rely on impulsive energy injection schemes and torsional springs, which are quite challenging to implement in a physical platform. Here, a new model is proposed, named triggering controlled ankle actuated compass gait (TC-AACG), which allows non-instantaneous compliant ankle pushoff. The proposed technique can be implemented in physical platforms via series elastic actuators (SEAs). Our systematic examination shows that the proposed approach extends the locomotion capabilities of a biped model compared to impulsive ankle pushoff approach. We provide extensive simulation analysis investigating the locomotion speed, mechanical cost of transport, and basin of attraction of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Continuum Robot Localization using Distributed Time-of-Flight Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization and mapping of an environment are crucial tasks for any robot operating in unstructured environments. Time-of-flight (ToF) sensors (e.g.,~lidar) have proven useful in mobile robotics, where high-resolution sensors can be used for simultaneous localization and mapping. In soft and continuum robotics, however, these high-resolution sensors are too large for practical use. This, combined with the deformable nature of such robots, has resulted in continuum robot (CR) localization and mapping in unstructured environments being a largely untouched area. In this work, we present a localization technique for CRs that relies on small, low-resolution ToF sensors distributed along the length of the robot. By fusing measurement information with a robot shape prior, we show that accurate localization is possible despite each sensor experiencing frequent degenerate scenarios. We achieve an average localization error of 2.5cm in position and 7.2{\deg} in rotation across all experimental conditions with a 53cm long robot. We demonstrate that the results are repeated across multiple environments, in both simulation and real-world experiments, and study robustness in the estimation to deviations in the prior map.</description>

      <title>Realistic Synthetic Household Data Generation at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have catalyzed research in Embodied AI to develop interactive agents capable of environmental reasoning and interaction. Developing such agents requires diverse, large-scale datasets. Prior frameworks generate synthetic data for long-term human-robot interactions but fail to model the bidirectional influence between human behavior and household environments. Our proposed generative framework creates household datasets at scale through loosely coupled generation of long-term human-robot interactions and environments. Human personas influence environment generation, while environment schematics and semantics shape human-robot interactions.
  The generated 3D data includes rich static context such as object and environment semantics, and temporal context capturing human and agent behaviors over extended periods. Our flexible tool allows users to define dataset characteristics via natural language prompts, enabling configuration of environment and human activity data through natural language specifications. The tool creates variations of user-defined configurations, enabling scalable data generation.
  We validate our framework through statistical evaluation using multi-modal embeddings and key metrics: cosine similarity, mutual information gain, intervention analysis, and iterative improvement validation. Statistical comparisons show good alignment with real-world datasets (HOMER) with cosine similarity (0.60), while synthetic datasets (Wang et al.) show moderate alignment (0.27). Intervention analysis across age, organization, and sleep pattern changes shows statistically significant effects (p &lt; 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.51-1.12), confirming bidirectional coupling translates persona traits into measurable environmental and behavioral differences. These contributions enable development and testing of household smart devices at scale.</description>

      <title>aerial-autonomy-stack -- a Faster-than-real-time, Autopilot-agnostic, ROS2 Framework to Simulate and Deploy Perception-based Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles are rapidly transforming multiple applications, from agricultural and infrastructure monitoring to logistics and defense. Introducing greater autonomy to these systems can simultaneously make them more effective as well as reliable. Thus, the ability to rapidly engineer and deploy autonomous aerial systems has become of strategic importance. In the 2010s, a combination of high-performance compute, data, and open-source software led to the current deep learning and AI boom, unlocking decades of prior theoretical work. Robotics is on the cusp of a similar transformation. However, physical AI faces unique hurdles, often combined under the umbrella term "simulation-to-reality gap". These span from modeling shortcomings to the complexity of vertically integrating the highly heterogeneous hardware and software systems typically found in field robots. To address the latter, we introduce aerial-autonomy-stack, an open-source, end-to-end framework designed to streamline the pipeline from (GPU-accelerated) perception to (flight controller-based) action. Our stack allows the development of aerial autonomy using ROS2 and provides a common interface for two of the most popular autopilots: PX4 and ArduPilot. We show that it supports over 20x faster-than-real-time, end-to-end simulation of a complete development and deployment stack -- including edge compute and networking -- significantly compressing the build-test-release cycle of perception-based autonomy.</description>

      <title>Action-to-Action Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based policies have recently achieved remarkable success in robotics by formulating action prediction as a conditional denoising process. However, the standard practice of sampling from random Gaussian noise often requires multiple iterative steps to produce clean actions, leading to high inference latency that incurs a major bottleneck for real-time control. In this paper, we challenge the necessity of uninformed noise sampling and propose Action-to-Action flow matching (A2A), a novel policy paradigm that shifts from random sampling to initialization informed by the previous action. Unlike existing methods that treat proprioceptive action feedback as static conditions, A2A leverages historical proprioceptive sequences, embedding them into a high-dimensional latent space as the starting point for action generation. This design bypasses costly iterative denoising while effectively capturing the robot's physical dynamics and temporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A2A exhibits high training efficiency, fast inference speed, and improved generalization. Notably, A2A enables high-quality action generation in as few as a single inference step (0.56 ms latency), and exhibits superior robustness to visual perturbations and enhanced generalization to unseen configurations. Lastly, we also extend A2A to video generation, demonstrating its broader versatility in temporal modeling. Project site: https://lorenzo-0-0.github.io/A2A_Flow_Matching.</description>

      <title>Why Look at It at All?: Vision-Free Multifingered Blind Grasping Using Uniaxial Fingertip Force Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grasping under limited sensing remains a fundamental challenge for real-world robotic manipulation, as vision and high-resolution tactile sensors often introduce cost, fragility, and integration complexity. This work demonstrates that reliable multifingered grasping can be achieved under extremely minimal sensing by relying solely on uniaxial fingertip force feedback and joint proprioception, without vision or multi-axis/tactile sensing. To enable such blind grasping, we employ an efficient teacher-student training pipeline in which a reinforcement-learned teacher exploits privileged simulation-only observations to generate demonstrations for distilling a transformer-based student policy operating under partial observation. The student policy is trained to act using only sensing modalities available at real-world deployment. We validate the proposed approach on real hardware across 18 objects, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cases, achieving a 98.3~$\%$ overall grasp success rate. These results demonstrate strong robustness and generalization beyond the simulation training distribution, while significantly reducing sensing requirements for real-world grasping systems.</description>

      <title>UEREBot: Learning Safe Quadrupedal Locomotion under Unstructured Environments and High-Speed Dynamic Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadruped robots are increasingly deployed in unstructured environments. Safe locomotion in these settings requires long-horizon goal progress, passability over uneven terrain and static constraints, and collision avoidance against high-speed dynamic obstacles. A single system cannot fully satisfy all three objectives simultaneously: planning-based decisions can be too slow, while purely reactive decisions can sacrifice goal progress and passability. To resolve this conflict, we propose UEREBot (Unstructured-Environment Reflexive Evasion Robot), a hierarchical framework that separates slow planning from instantaneous reflexive evasion and coordinates them during execution. UEREBot formulates the task as a constrained optimal control problem blueprint. It adopts a spatial--temporal planner that provides reference guidance toward the goal and threat signals. It then uses a threat-aware handoff to fuse navigation and reflex actions into a nominal command, and a control barrier function shield as a final execution safeguard. We evaluate UEREBot in Isaac Lab simulation and deploy it on a Unitree Go2 quadruped equipped with onboard perception. Across diverse environments with complex static structure and high-speed dynamic obstacles, UEREBot achieves higher avoidance success and more stable locomotion while maintaining goal progress than representative baselines, demonstrating improved safety--progress trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Trace-Focused Diffusion Policy for Multi-Modal Action Disambiguation in Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative model-based policies have shown strong performance in imitation-based robotic manipulation by learning action distributions from demonstrations. However, in long-horizon tasks, visually similar observations often recur across execution stages while requiring distinct actions, which leads to ambiguous predictions when policies are conditioned only on instantaneous observations, termed multi-modal action ambiguity (MA2). To address this challenge, we propose the Trace-Focused Diffusion Policy (TF-DP), a simple yet effective diffusion-based framework that explicitly conditions action generation on the robot's execution history. TF-DP represents historical motion as an explicit execution trace and projects it into the visual observation space, providing stage-aware context when current observations alone are insufficient. In addition, the induced trace-focused field emphasizes task-relevant regions associated with historical motion, improving robustness to background visual disturbances. We evaluate TF-DP on real-world robotic manipulation tasks exhibiting pronounced multi-modal action ambiguity and visually cluttered conditions. Experimental results show that TF-DP improves temporal consistency and robustness, outperforming the vanilla diffusion policy by 80.56 percent on tasks with multi-modal action ambiguity and by 86.11 percent under visual disturbances, while maintaining inference efficiency with only a 6.4 percent runtime increase. These results demonstrate that execution-trace conditioning offers a scalable and principled approach for robust long-horizon robotic manipulation within a single policy.</description>

      <title>Going with the Flow: Koopman Behavioral Models as Implicit Planners for Visuo-Motor Dexterity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been rapid and dramatic progress in robots' ability to learn complex visuo-motor manipulation skills from demonstrations, thanks in part to expressive policy classes that employ diffusion- and transformer-based backbones. However, these design choices require significant data and computational resources and remain far from reliable, particularly within the context of multi-fingered dexterous manipulation. Fundamentally, they model skills as reactive mappings and rely on fixed-horizon action chunking to mitigate jitter, creating a rigid trade-off between temporal coherence and reactivity. In this work, we introduce Unified Behavioral Models (UBMs), a framework that learns to represent dexterous skills as coupled dynamical systems that capture how visual features of the environment (visual flow) and proprioceptive states of the robot (action flow) co-evolve. By capturing such behavioral dynamics, UBMs can ensure temporal coherence by construction rather than by heuristic averaging. To operationalize these models, we propose Koopman-UBM, a first instantiation of UBMs that leverages Koopman Operator theory to effectively learn a unified representation in which the joint flow of latent visual and proprioceptive features is governed by a structured linear system. We demonstrate that Koopman-UBM can be viewed as an implicit planner: given an initial condition, it analytically computes the desired robot behavior while simultaneously ''imagining'' the resulting flow of visual features over the entire skill horizon. To enable reactivity and adaptation, we introduce an online replanning strategy in which the model acts as its own runtime monitor that automatically triggers replanning when predicted and observed visual flow diverge beyond a threshold. Across seven simulated tasks and two real-world tasks, we demonstrate that K-UBM matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, while offering considerably faster inference, smooth execution, robustness to occlusions, and flexible replanning.</description>

      <title>Bridging Speech, Emotion, and Motion: a VLM-based Multimodal Edge-deployable Framework for Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective human-robot interaction requires emotionally rich multimodal expressions, yet most humanoid robots lack coordinated speech, facial expressions, and gestures. Meanwhile, real-world deployment demands on-device solutions that can operate autonomously without continuous cloud connectivity. To bridging \underline{\textit{S}}peech, \underline{\textit{E}}motion, and \underline{\textit{M}}otion, we present \textit{SeM$^2$}, a Vision Language Model-based framework that orchestrates emotionally coherent multimodal interactions through three key components: a multimodal perception module capturing user contextual cues, a Chain-of-Thought reasoning for response planning, and a novel Semantic-Sequence Aligning Mechanism (SSAM) that ensures precise temporal coordination between verbal content and physical expressions. We implement both cloud-based and \underline{\textit{e}}dge-deployed versions (\textit{SeM$^2_e$}), with the latter knowledge distilled to operate efficiently on edge hardware while maintaining 95\% of the relative performance. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms unimodal baselines in naturalness, emotional clarity, and modal coherence, advancing socially expressive humanoid robotics for diverse real-world environments.</description>

      <title>TextOp: Real-time Interactive Text-Driven Humanoid Robot Motion Generation and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in humanoid whole-body motion tracking have enabled the execution of diverse and highly coordinated motions on real hardware. However, existing controllers are commonly driven either by predefined motion trajectories, which offer limited flexibility when user intent changes, or by continuous human teleoperation, which requires constant human involvement and limits autonomy. This work addresses the problem of how to drive a universal humanoid controller in a real-time and interactive manner. We present TextOp, a real-time text-driven humanoid motion generation and control framework that supports streaming language commands and on-the-fly instruction modification during execution. TextOp adopts a two-level architecture in which a high-level autoregressive motion diffusion model continuously generates short-horizon kinematic trajectories conditioned on the current text input, while a low-level motion tracking policy executes these trajectories on a physical humanoid robot. By bridging interactive motion generation with robust whole-body control, TextOp unlocks free-form intent expression and enables smooth transitions across multiple challenging behaviors such as dancing and jumping, within a single continuous motion execution. Extensive real-robot experiments and offline evaluations demonstrate instant responsiveness, smooth whole-body motion, and precise control.

      <title>VividFace: Real-Time and Realistic Facial Expression Shadowing for Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid facial expression shadowing enables robots to realistically imitate human facial expressions in real time, which is critical for lifelike, facially expressive humanoid robots and affective human-robot interaction. Existing progress in humanoid facial expression imitation remains limited, often failing to achieve either real-time performance or realistic expressiveness due to offline video-based inference designs and insufficient ability to capture and transfer subtle expression details. To address these limitations, we present VividFace, a real-time and realistic facial expression shadowing system for humanoid robots. An optimized imitation framework X2CNet++ enhances expressiveness by fine-tuning the human-to-humanoid facial motion transfer module and introducing a feature-adaptation training strategy for better alignment across different image sources. Real-time shadowing is further enabled by a video-stream-compatible inference pipeline and a streamlined workflow based on asynchronous I/O for efficient communication across devices. VividFace produces vivid humanoid faces by mimicking human facial expressions within 0.05 seconds, while generalizing across diverse facial configurations. Extensive real-world demonstrations validate its practical utility. Videos are available at: https://lipzh5.github.io/VividFace/.</description>

      <title>Differentiate-and-Inject: Enhancing VLAs via Functional Differentiation Induced by In-Parameter Structural Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As robots are expected to perform increasingly diverse tasks, they must understand not only low-level actions but also the higher-level structure that determines how a task should unfold. Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with this form of task-level reasoning. They either depend on prompt-based in-context decomposition, which is unstable and sensitive to linguistic variations, or end-to-end long-horizon training, which requires large-scale demonstrations and entangles task-level reasoning with low-level control. We present in-parameter structured task reasoning (iSTAR), a framework for enhancing VLA models via functional differentiation induced by in-parameter structural reasoning. Instead of treating VLAs as monolithic policies, iSTAR embeds task-level semantic structure directly into model parameters, enabling differentiated task-level inference without external planners or handcrafted prompt inputs. This injected structure takes the form of implicit dynamic scene-graph knowledge that captures object relations, subtask semantics, and task-level dependencies in parameter space. Across diverse manipulation benchmarks, iSTAR achieves more reliable task decompositions and higher success rates than both in-context and end-to-end VLA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of parameter-space structural reasoning for functional differentiation and improved generalization across task variations.</description>

      <title>"Meet My Sidekick!": Effects of Separate Identities and Control of a Single Robot in HRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presentation of a robot's capability and identity directly influences a human collaborator's perception and implicit trust in the robot. Unlike humans, a physical robot can simultaneously present different identities and have them reside and control different parts of the robot. This paper presents a novel study that investigates how users perceive a robot where different robot control domains (head and gripper) are presented as independent robots. We conducted a mixed design study where participants experienced one of three presentations: a single robot, two agents with shared full control (co-embodiment), or two agents with split control across robot control domains (split-embodiment). Participants underwent three distinct tasks -- a mundane data entry task where the robot provides motivational support, an individual sorting task with isolated robot failures, and a collaborative arrangement task where the robot causes a failure that directly affects the human participant. Participants perceived the robot as residing in the different control domains and were able to associate robot failure with different identities. This work signals how future robots can leverage different embodiment configurations to obtain the benefit of multiple robots within a single body.</description>

      <title>LCLA: Language-Conditioned Latent Alignment for Vision-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose LCLA (Language-Conditioned Latent Alignment), a framework for vision-language navigation that learns modular perception-action interfaces by aligning sensory observations to a latent representation of an expert policy. The expert is first trained with privileged state information, inducing a latent space sufficient for control, after which its latent interface and action head are frozen. A lightweight adapter is then trained to map raw visual-language observations, via a frozen vision-language model, into the expert's latent space, reducing the problem of visuomotor learning to supervised latent alignment rather than end-to-end policy optimization. This decoupling enforces a stable contract between perception and control, enabling expert behavior to be reused across sensing modalities and environmental variations. We instantiate LCLA and evaluate it on a vision-language indoor navigation task, where aligned latent spaces yield strong in-distribution performance and robust zero-shot generalization to unseen environments, lighting conditions, and viewpoints while remaining lightweight at inference time.</description>

      <title>Affine Transformable Unmanned Ground Vehicle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the proof of concept for a novel affine transformable unmanned ground vehicle (ATUGV) with the capability of safe and aggressive deformation while carrying multiple payloads. The ATUGV is a multi-body system with mobile robots that can be used to power the ATUGV morphable motion, powered cells to enclose the mobile robots, unpowered cells to contain payloads, and a deformable structure to integrate cells through bars and joints. The objective is that all powered and unpowered cells motion can safely track a desired affine transformation, where an affine transformation can be decomposed into translation, rigid body rotation, and deformation. To this end, the paper first uses a deep neural network to structure cell interconnection in such a way that every cell can freely move over the deformation plane, and the entire structure can reconfigurably deform to track a desired affine transformation. Then, the mobile robots, contained by the powered cells and stepper motors, regulating the connections of the powered and unpowered cells, design the proper controls so that all cells safely track the desired affine transformation. The functionality of the proposed ATUGV is validated through hardware experimentation and simulation.</description>

      <title>Global Symmetry and Orthogonal Transformations from Geometrical Moment $n$-tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting symmetry is crucial for effective object grasping for several reasons. Recognizing symmetrical features or axes within an object helps in developing efficient grasp strategies, as grasping along these axes typically results in a more stable and balanced grip, thereby facilitating successful manipulation. This paper employs geometrical moments to identify symmetries and estimate orthogonal transformations, including rotations and mirror transformations, for objects centered at the frame origin. It provides distinctive metrics for detecting symmetries and estimating orthogonal transformations, encompassing rotations, reflections, and their combinations. A comprehensive methodology is developed to obtain these functions in n-dimensional space, specifically moment \( n \)-tuples. Extensive validation tests are conducted on both 2D and 3D objects to ensure the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach. The proposed method is also compared to state-of-the-art work using iterative optimization for detecting multiple planes of symmetry. The results indicate that combining our method with the iterative one yields satisfactory outcomes in terms of the number of symmetry planes detected and computation time.</description>

      <title>CoLF: Learning Consistent Leader-Follower Policies for Vision-Language-Guided Multi-Robot Cooperative Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we address vision-language-guided multi-robot cooperative transport, where each robot grounds natural-language instructions from onboard camera observations. A key challenge in this decentralized setting is perceptual misalignment across robots, where viewpoint differences and language ambiguity can yield inconsistent interpretations and degrade cooperative transport. To mitigate this problem, we adopt a dependent leader-follower design, where one robot serves as the leader and the other as the follower. Although such a leader-follower structure appears straightforward, learning with independent and symmetric agents often yields symmetric or unstable behaviors without explicit inductive biases. To address this challenge, we propose Consistent Leader-Follower (CoLF), a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for stable leader-follower role differentiation. CoLF consists of two key components: (1) an asymmetric policy design that induces leader-follower role differentiation, and (2) a mutual-information-based training objective that maximizes a variational lower bound, encouraging the follower to predict the leader's action from its local observation. The leader and follower policies are jointly optimized under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework to balance task execution and consistent cooperative behaviors. We validate CoLF in both simulation and real-robot experiments using two quadruped robots. The demonstration video is available at https://sites.google.com/view/colf/.</description>

      <title>RLinf-USER: A Unified and Extensible System for Real-World Online Policy Learning in Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online policy learning directly in the physical world is a promising yet challenging direction for embodied intelligence. Unlike simulation, real-world systems cannot be arbitrarily accelerated, cheaply reset, or massively replicated, which makes scalable data collection, heterogeneous deployment, and long-horizon effective training difficult. These challenges suggest that real-world policy learning is not only an algorithmic issue but fundamentally a systems problem. We present USER, a Unified and extensible SystEm for Real-world online policy learning. USER treats physical robots as first-class hardware resources alongside GPUs through a unified hardware abstraction layer, enabling automatic discovery, management, and scheduling of heterogeneous robots. To address cloud-edge communication, USER introduces an adaptive communication plane with tunneling-based networking, distributed data channels for traffic localization, and streaming-multiprocessor-aware weight synchronization to regulate GPU-side overhead. On top of this infrastructure, USER organizes learning as a fully asynchronous framework with a persistent, cache-aware buffer, enabling efficient long-horizon experiments with robust crash recovery and reuse of historical data. In addition, USER provides extensible abstractions for rewards, algorithms, and policies, supporting online imitation or reinforcement learning of CNN/MLP, generative policies, and large vision-language-action (VLA) models within a unified pipeline. Results in both simulation and the real world show that USER enables multi-robot coordination, heterogeneous manipulators, edge-cloud collaboration with large models, and long-running asynchronous training, offering a unified and extensible systems foundation for real-world online policy learning.</description>

      <title>Recurrent-Depth VLA: Implicit Test-Time Compute Scaling of Vision-Language-Action Models via Latent Iterative Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on fixed computational depth, expending the same amount of compute on simple adjustments and complex multi-step manipulation. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables variable computation, it scales memory linearly and is ill-suited for continuous action spaces. We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs a recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with a constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process. At inference, RD-VLA dynamically allocates compute using an adaptive stopping criterion based on latent convergence. Experiments on challenging manipulation tasks show that recurrent depth is critical: tasks that fail entirely (0 percent success) with single-iteration inference exceed 90 percent success with four iterations, while simpler tasks saturate rapidly. RD-VLA provides a scalable path to test-time compute in robotics, replacing token-based reasoning with latent reasoning to achieve constant memory usage and up to 80x inference speedup over prior reasoning-based VLA models.

      <title>System-Level Error Propagation and Tail-Risk Amplification in Reference-Based Robotic Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image guided robotic navigation systems often rely on reference based geometric perception pipelines, where accurate spatial mapping is established through multi stage estimation processes. In biplanar X ray guided navigation, such pipelines are widely used due to their real time capability and geometric interpretability. However, navigation reliability can be constrained by an overlooked system level failure mechanism in which installation induced structural perturbations introduced at the perception stage are progressively amplified along the perception reconstruction execution chain and dominate execution level error and tail risk behavior. This paper investigates this mechanism from a system level perspective and presents a unified error propagation modeling framework that characterizes how installation induced structural perturbations propagate and couple with pixel level observation noise through biplanar imaging, projection matrix estimation, triangulation, and coordinate mapping. Using first order analytic uncertainty propagation and Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze dominant sensitivity channels and quantify worst case error behavior beyond mean accuracy metrics. The results show that rotational installation error is a primary driver of system level error amplification, while translational misalignment of comparable magnitude plays a secondary role under typical biplanar geometries. Real biplanar X ray bench top experiments further confirm that the predicted amplification trends persist under realistic imaging conditions. These findings reveal a broader structural limitation of reference based multi stage geometric perception pipelines and provide a framework for system level reliability analysis and risk aware design in safety critical robotic navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Research on a Camera Position Measurement Method based on a Parallel Perspective Error Transfer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera pose estimation from sparse correspondences is a fundamental problem in geometric computer vision and remains particularly challenging in near-field scenarios, where strong perspective effects and heterogeneous measurement noise can significantly degrade the stability of analytic PnP solutions. In this paper, we present a geometric error propagation framework for camera pose estimation based on a parallel perspective approximation. By explicitly modeling how image measurement errors propagate through perspective geometry, we derive an error transfer model that characterizes the relationship between feature point distribution, camera depth, and pose estimation uncertainty. Building on this analysis, we develop a pose estimation method that leverages parallel perspective initialization and error-aware weighting within a Gauss-Newton optimization scheme, leading to improved robustness in proximity operations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world images, covering diverse conditions such as strong illumination, surgical lighting, and underwater low-light environments, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accuracy and robustness comparable to state-of-the-art analytic and iterative PnP methods, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These results highlight the importance of explicit geometric error modeling for reliable camera pose estimation in challenging near-field settings.</description>

      <title>Incremental Mapping with Measurement Synchronization &amp; Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern autonomous vehicles and robots utilize versatile sensors for localization and mapping. The fidelity of these maps is paramount, as an accurate environmental representation is a prerequisite for stable and precise localization. Factor graphs provide a powerful approach for sensor fusion, enabling the estimation of the maximum a posteriori solution. However, the discrete nature of graph-based representations, combined with asynchronous sensor measurements, complicates consistent state estimation. The design of an optimal factor graph topology remains an open challenge, especially in multi-sensor systems with asynchronous data. Conventional approaches rely on a rigid graph structure, which becomes inefficient with sensors of disparate rates. Although preintegration techniques can mitigate this for high-rate sensors, their applicability is limited. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel approach that incrementally constructs connected factor graphs, ensuring the incorporation of all available sensor data by choosing the optimal graph topology based on the external evaluation criteria. The proposed methodology facilitates graph compression, reducing the number of nodes (optimized variables) by ~30% on average while maintaining map quality at a level comparable to conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Route Planning as a QUBO Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Route Planning considers selecting vehicles, each associated with a single predefined route, such that the spatial coverage of a road network is increased while redundant overlaps are limited. This paper gives a formal problem definition, proves NP-hardness by reduction from the Weighted Set Packing problem, and derives a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation whose coefficients directly encode unique coverage rewards and pairwise overlap penalties. A single penalty parameter controls the coverage-overlap trade-off. We distinguish between a soft regime, which supports multi-objective exploration, and a hard regime, in which the penalty is strong enough to effectively enforce near-disjoint routes. We describe a practical pipeline for generating city instances, constructing candidate routes, building the QUBO matrix, and solving it with an exact mixed-integer solver (Gurobi), simulated annealing, and D-Wave hybrid quantum annealing. Experiments on Barcelona instances with up to 10 000 vehicles reveal a clear coverage-overlap knee and show that Pareto-optimal solutions are mainly obtained under the hard-penalty regime, while D-Wave hybrid solvers and Gurobi achieve essentially identical objective values with only minor differences in runtime as problem size grows.</description>

      <title>Optimized Human-Robot Co-Dispatch Planning for Petro-Site Surveillance under Varying Criticalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Securing petroleum infrastructure requires balancing autonomous system efficiency with human judgment for threat escalation, a challenge unaddressed by classical facility location models assuming homogeneous resources. This paper formulates the Human-Robot Co-Dispatch Facility Location Problem (HRCD-FLP), a capacitated facility location variant incorporating tiered infrastructure criticality, human-robot supervision ratio constraints, and minimum utilization requirements. We evaluate command center selection across three technology maturity scenarios. Results show transitioning from conservative (1:3 human-robot supervision) to future autonomous operations (1:10) yields significant cost reduction while maintaining complete critical infrastructure coverage. For small problems, exact methods dominate in both cost and computation time; for larger problems, the proposed heuristic achieves feasible solutions in under 3 minutes with approximately 14% optimality gap where comparison is possible. From systems perspective, our work demonstrate that optimized planning for human-robot teaming is key to achieve both cost-effective and mission-reliable deployments.</description>

      <title>Feasibility-Guided Planning over Multi-Specialized Locomotion Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning over unstructured terrain presents a significant challenge in the field of legged robotics. Although recent works in reinforcement learning have yielded various locomotion strategies, planning over multiple experts remains a complex issue. Existing approaches encounter several constraints: traditional planners are unable to integrate skill-specific policies, whereas hierarchical learning frameworks often lose interpretability and require retraining whenever new policies are added. In this paper, we propose a feasibility-guided planning framework that successfully incorporates multiple terrain-specific policies. Each policy is paired with a Feasibility-Net, which learned to predict feasibility tensors based on the local elevation maps and task vectors. This integration allows classical planning algorithms to derive optimal paths. Through both simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our method efficiently generates reliable plans across diverse and challenging terrains, while consistently aligning with the capabilities of the underlying policies.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of Simulation Fidelity on the Evaluation of Autonomous Driving Motion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation is crucial in the development of autonomous driving software. In particular, assessing control algorithms requires an accurate vehicle dynamics simulation. However, recent publications use models with varying levels of detail. This disparity makes it difficult to compare individual control algorithms. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the influence of the fidelity of vehicle dynamics modeling on the closed-loop behavior of trajectory-following controllers. For this purpose, we introduce a comprehensive Autoware-compatible vehicle model. By simplifying this, we derive models with varying fidelity. Evaluating over 550 simulation runs allows us to quantify each model's approximation quality compared to real-world data. Furthermore, we investigate whether the influence of model simplifications changes with varying margins to the acceleration limit of the vehicle. From this, we deduce to which degree a vehicle model can be simplified to evaluate control algorithms depending on the specific application. The real-world data used to validate the simulation environment originate from the Indy Autonomous Challenge race at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in June 2023. They show the fastest fully autonomous lap of TUM Autonomous Motorsport, with vehicle speeds reaching 267 kph and lateral accelerations of up to 15 mps2.</description>

      <title>From Ellipsoids to Midair Control of Dynamic Hitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to dynamically manipulate interaction between cables, carried by pairs of aerial vehicles attached to the ends of each cable, can greatly improve the versatility and agility of cable-assisted aerial manipulation. Such interlacing cables create hitches by winding two or more cables around each other, which can enclose payloads or can further develop into knots. Dynamic modeling and control of such hitches is key to mastering the inter-cable manipulation in context of cable-suspended aerial manipulation. This paper introduces an ellipsoid-based kinematic model to connect the geometric nature of a hitch created by two cables and the dynamics of the hitch driven by four aerial vehicles, which reveals the control-affine form of the system. As the constraint for maintaining tension of a cable is also control-affine, we design a quadratic programming-based controller that combines Control Lyapunov and High-Order Control Barrier Functions (CLF-HOCBF-QP) to precisely track a desired hitch position and system shape while enforcing safety constraints like cable tautness. We convert desired geometric reference configurations into target robot positions and introduce a composite error into the Lyapunov function to ensure a relative degree of one to the input. Numerical simulations validate our approach, demonstrating stable, high-speed tracking of dynamic references.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Bootstrapping of Action-Predictive Embodied Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, yet current methods rely on rigid templates to specify reasoning primitives (e.g., objects in the scene, high-level plans, structural affordances). These templates can force policies to process irrelevant information that distracts from critical action-prediction signals. This creates a bottleneck: without successful policies, we cannot verify reasoning quality; without quality reasoning, we cannot build robust policies. We introduce R&amp;B-EnCoRe, which enables models to bootstrap embodied reasoning from internet-scale knowledge through self-supervised refinement. By treating reasoning as a latent variable within importance-weighted variational inference, models can generate and distill a refined reasoning training dataset of embodiment-specific strategies without external rewards, verifiers, or human annotation. We validate R&amp;B-EnCoRe across manipulation (Franka Panda in simulation, WidowX in hardware), legged navigation (bipedal, wheeled, bicycle, quadruped), and autonomous driving embodiments using various VLA architectures with 1B, 4B, 7B, and 30B parameters. Our approach achieves 28% gains in manipulation success, 101% improvement in navigation scores, and 21% reduction in collision-rate metric over models that indiscriminately reason about all available primitives.

      <title>Chamelion: Reliable Change Detection for Long-Term LiDAR Mapping in Transient Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online change detection is crucial for mobile robots to efficiently navigate through dynamic environments. Detecting changes in transient settings, such as active construction sites or frequently reconfigured indoor spaces, is particularly challenging due to frequent occlusions and spatiotemporal variations. Existing approaches often struggle to detect changes and fail to update the map across different observations. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-head network designed for online change detection and long-term map maintenance. A key difficulty in this task is the collection and alignment of real-world data, as manually registering structural differences over time is both labor-intensive and often impractical. To overcome this, we develop a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes structural changes by importing elements from different scenes, enabling effective model training without the need for extensive ground-truth annotations. Experiments conducted at real-world construction sites and in indoor office environments demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse scenarios, achieving efficient and accurate map updates.\resubmit{Our source code and additional material are available at: https://chamelion-pages.github.io/.</description>

      <title>STEP: Warm-Started Visuomotor Policies with Spatiotemporal Consistency Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion policies have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for visuomotor control in robotic manipulation due to their ability to model the distribution of action sequences and capture multimodality. However, iterative denoising leads to substantial inference latency, limiting control frequency in real-time closed-loop systems. Existing acceleration methods either reduce sampling steps, bypass diffusion through direct prediction, or reuse past actions, but often struggle to jointly preserve action quality and achieve consistently low latency. In this work, we propose STEP, a lightweight spatiotemporal consistency prediction mechanism to construct high-quality warm-start actions that are both distributionally close to the target action and temporally consistent, without compromising the generative capability of the original diffusion policy. Then, we propose a velocity-aware perturbation injection mechanism that adaptively modulates actuation excitation based on temporal action variation to prevent execution stall especially for real-world tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed prediction induces a locally contractive mapping, ensuring convergence of action errors during diffusion refinement. We conduct extensive evaluations on nine simulated benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Notably, STEP with 2 steps can achieve an average 21.6% and 27.5% higher success rate than BRIDGER and DDIM on the RoboMimic benchmark and real-world tasks, respectively. These results demonstrate that STEP consistently advances the Pareto frontier of inference latency and success rate over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Aerial Manipulation with Contact-Aware Onboard Perception and Hybrid Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerial manipulation (AM) promises to move Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) beyond passive inspection to contact-rich tasks such as grasping, assembly, and in-situ maintenance. Most prior AM demonstrations rely on external motion capture (MoCap) and emphasize position control for coarse interactions, limiting deployability. We present a fully onboard perception-control pipeline for contact-rich AM that achieves accurate motion tracking and regulated contact wrenches without MoCap. The main components are (1) an augmented visual-inertial odometry (VIO) estimator with contact-consistency factors that activate only during interaction, tightening uncertainty around the contact frame and reducing drift, and (2) image-based visual servoing (IBVS) to mitigate perception-control coupling, together with a hybrid force-motion controller that regulates contact wrenches and lateral motion for stable contact. Experiments show that our approach closes the perception-to-wrench loop using only onboard sensing, yielding an velocity estimation improvement of 66.01% at contact, reliable target approach, and stable force holding-pointing toward deployable, in-the-wild aerial manipulation.</description>

      <title>Informative Object-centric Next Best View for Object-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting in Cluttered Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cluttered scenes with inevitable occlusions and incomplete observations, selecting informative viewpoints is essential for building a reliable representation. In this context, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a distinct advantage, as it can explicitly guide the selection of subsequent viewpoints and then refine the representation with new observations. However, existing approaches rely solely on geometric cues, neglect manipulation-relevant semantics, and tend to prioritize exploitation over exploration. To tackle these limitations, we introduce an instance-aware Next Best View (NBV) policy that prioritizes underexplored regions by leveraging object features. Specifically, our object-aware 3DGS distills instancelevel information into one-hot object vectors, which are used to compute confidence-weighted information gain that guides the identification of regions associated with erroneous and uncertain Gaussians. Furthermore, our method can be easily adapted to an object-centric NBV, which focuses view selection on a target object, thereby improving reconstruction robustness to object placement. Experiments demonstrate that our NBV policy reduces depth error by up to 77.14% on the synthetic dataset and 34.10% on the real-world GraspNet dataset compared to baselines. Moreover, compared to targeting the entire scene, performing NBV on a specific object yields an additional reduction of 25.60% in depth error for that object. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach through real-world robotic manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>DexFormer: Cross-Embodied Dexterous Manipulation via History-Conditioned Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dexterous manipulation remains one of the most challenging problems in robotics, requiring coherent control of high-DoF hands and arms under complex, contact-rich dynamics. A major barrier is embodiment variability: different dexterous hands exhibit distinct kinematics and dynamics, forcing prior methods to train separate policies or rely on shared action spaces with per-embodiment decoder heads. We present DexFormer, an end-to-end, dynamics-aware cross-embodiment policy built on a modified transformer backbone that conditions on historical observations. By using temporal context to infer morphology and dynamics on the fly, DexFormer adapts to diverse hand configurations and produces embodiment-appropriate control actions. Trained over a variety of procedurally generated dexterous-hand assets, DexFormer acquires a generalizable manipulation prior and exhibits strong zero-shot transfer to Leap Hand, Allegro Hand, and Rapid Hand. Our results show that a single policy can generalize across heterogeneous hand embodiments, establishing a scalable foundation for cross-embodiment dexterous manipulation.

      <title>ReefFlex: A Generative Design Framework for Soft Robotic Grasping of Organic and Fragile objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change, invasive species and human activities are currently damaging the world's coral reefs at unprecedented rates, threatening their vast biodiversity and fisheries, and reducing coastal protection. Solving this vast challenge requires scalable coral regeneration technologies that can breed climate-resilient species and accelerate the natural regrowth processes; actions that are impeded by the absence of safe and robust tools to handle the fragile coral. We investigate ReefFlex, a generative soft finger design methodology that explores a diverse space of soft fingers to produce a set of candidates capable of safely grasping fragile and geometrically heterogeneous coral in a cluttered environment. Our key insight is encoding heterogeneous grasping into a reduced set of motion primitives, creating a simplified, tractable multi-objective optimisation problem. To evaluate the method, we design a soft robot for reef rehabilitation, which grows and manipulates coral in onshore aquaculture facilities for future reef out-planting. We demonstrate ReefFlex increases both grasp success and grasp quality (disturbance resistance, positioning accuracy) and reduces in adverse events encountered during coral manipulation compared to reference designs. ReefFlex, offers a generalisable method to design soft end-effectors for complex handling and paves a pathway towards automation in previously unachievable domains like coral handling for restoration.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Autonomous Vehicles: A Driver Foundation Model Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize global transportation systems. However, its widespread acceptance and market penetration remain significantly below expectations. This gap is primarily driven by persistent challenges in safety, comfort, commuting efficiency and energy economy when compared to the performance of experienced human drivers. We hypothesize that these challenges can be addressed through the development of a driver foundation model (DFM). Accordingly, we propose a framework for establishing DFMs to comprehensively benchmark AVs. Specifically, we describe a large-scale dataset collection strategy for training a DFM, discuss the core functionalities such a model should possess, and explore potential technical solutions to realize these functionalities. We further present the utility of the DFM across the operational spectrum, from defining human-centric safety envelopes to establishing benchmarks for energy economy. Overall, We aim to formalize the DFM concept and introduce a new paradigm for the systematic specification, verification and validation of AVs.</description>

      <title>Personalized Autonomous Driving via Optimal Control with Clearance Constraints from Questionnaires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving without considering the preferred separation distance from surrounding vehicles may cause discomfort for users. To address this limitation, we propose a planning framework that explicitly incorporates user preferences regarding the desired level of safe clearance from surrounding vehicles. We design a questionnaire purposefully tailored to capture user preferences relevant to our framework, while minimizing unnecessary questions. Specifically, the questionnaire considers various interaction-relevant factors, including the surrounding vehicle's size, speed, position, and maneuvers of surrounding vehicles, as well as the maneuvers of the ego vehicle. The response indicates the user-preferred clearance for the scenario defined by the question and is incorporated as constraints in the optimal control problem. However, it is impractical to account for all possible scenarios that may arise in a driving environment within a single optimal control problem, as the resulting computational complexity renders real-time implementation infeasible. To overcome this limitation, we approximate the original problem by decomposing it into multiple subproblems, each dealing with one fixed scenario. We then solve these subproblems in parallel and select one using the cost function from the original problem. To validate our work, we conduct simulations using different user responses to the questionnaire. We assess how effectively our planner reflects user preferences compared to preference-agnostic baseline planners by measuring preference alignment.</description>

      <title>Controlled Flight of an Insect-Scale Flapping-Wing Robot via Integrated Onboard Sensing and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerial insects can effortlessly navigate dense vegetation, whereas similarly sized aerial robots typically depend on offboard sensors and computation to maintain stable flight. This disparity restricts insect-scale robots to operation within motion capture environments, substantially limiting their applicability to tasks such as search-and-rescue and precision agriculture. In this work, we present a 1.29-gram aerial robot capable of hovering and tracking trajectories with solely onboard sensing and computation. The combination of a sensor suite, estimators, and a low-level controller achieved centimeter-scale positional flight accuracy. Additionally, we developed a hierarchical controller in which a human operator provides high-level commands to direct the robot's motion. In a 30-second flight experiment conducted outside a motion capture system, the robot avoided obstacles and ultimately landed on a sunflower. This level of sensing and computational autonomy represents a significant advancement for the aerial microrobotics community, further opening opportunities to explore onboard planning and power autonomy.</description>

      <title>Vec-QMDP: Vectorized POMDP Planning on CPUs for Real-Time Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning under uncertainty for real-world robotics tasks, such as autonomous driving, requires reasoning in enormous high-dimensional belief spaces, rendering the problem computationally intensive. While parallelization offers scalability, existing hybrid CPU-GPU solvers face critical bottlenecks due to host-device synchronization latency and branch divergence on SIMT architectures, limiting their utility for real-time planning and hindering real-robot deployment. We present Vec-QMDP, a CPU-native parallel planner that aligns POMDP search with modern CPUs' SIMD architecture, achieving $227\times$--$1073\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art serial planners. Vec-QMDP adopts a Data-Oriented Design (DOD), refactoring scattered, pointer-based data structures into contiguous, cache-efficient memory layouts. We further introduce a hierarchical parallelism scheme: distributing sub-trees across independent CPU cores and SIMD lanes, enabling fully vectorized tree expansion and collision checking. Efficiency is maximized with the help of UCB load balancing across trees and a vectorized STR-tree for coarse-level collision checking. Evaluated on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks, Vec-QMDP achieves state-of-the-art planning performance with millisecond-level latency, establishing CPUs as a high-performance computing platform for large-scale planning under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Learning Human-Like Badminton Skills for Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing versatile and human-like performance in high-demand sports like badminton remains a formidable challenge for humanoid robotics. Unlike standard locomotion or static manipulation, this task demands a seamless integration of explosive whole-body coordination and precise, timing-critical interception. While recent advances have achieved lifelike motion mimicry, bridging the gap between kinematic imitation and functional, physics-aware striking without compromising stylistic naturalness is non-trivial. To address this, we propose Imitation-to-Interaction, a progressive reinforcement learning framework designed to evolve a robot from a "mimic" to a capable "striker." Our approach establishes a robust motor prior from human data, distills it into a compact, model-based state representation, and stabilizes dynamics via adversarial priors. Crucially, to overcome the sparsity of expert demonstrations, we introduce a manifold expansion strategy that generalizes discrete strike points into a dense interaction volume. We validate our framework through the mastery of diverse skills, including lifts and drop shots, in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of anthropomorphic badminton skills to a humanoid robot, successfully replicating the kinetic elegance and functional precision of human athletes in the physical world.</description>

      <title>BiManiBench: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Evaluating Bimanual Coordination of Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced embodied AI, and using them to benchmark robotic intelligence has become a pivotal trend. However, existing frameworks remain predominantly confined to single-arm manipulation, failing to capture the spatio-temporal coordination required for bimanual tasks like lifting a heavy pot. To address this, we introduce BiManiBench, a hierarchical benchmark evaluating MLLMs across three tiers: fundamental spatial reasoning, high-level action planning, and low-level end-effector control. Our framework isolates unique bimanual challenges, such as arm reachability and kinematic constraints, thereby distinguishing perceptual hallucinations from planning failures. Analysis of over 30 state-of-the-art models reveals that despite high-level reasoning proficiency, MLLMs struggle with dual-arm spatial grounding and control, frequently resulting in mutual interference and sequencing errors. These findings suggest the current paradigm lacks a deep understanding of mutual kinematic constraints, highlighting the need for future research to focus on inter-arm collision-avoidance and fine-grained temporal sequencing.</description>

      <title>Graph-Loc: Robust Graph-Based LiDAR Pose Tracking with Compact Structural Map Priors under Low Observability and Occlusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Map-based LiDAR pose tracking is essential for long-term autonomous operation, where onboard map priors need be compact for scalable storage and fast retrieval, while online observations are often partial, repetitive, and heavily occluded. We propose Graph-Loc, a graph-based localization framework that tracks the platform pose against compact structural map priors represented as a lightweight point-line graph. Such priors can be constructed from heterogeneous sources commonly available in practice, including polygon outlines vectorized from occupancy/grid maps and CAD/model/floor-plan layouts. For each incoming LiDAR scan, Graph-Loc extracts sparse point and line primitives to form an observation graph, retrieves a pose-conditioned visible subgraph via LiDAR ray simulation, and performs scan-to-map association through unbalanced optimal transport with a local graph-context regularizer. The unbalanced formulation relaxes mass conservation, improving robustness to missing, spurious, and fragmented structures under occlusion. To enhance stability in low-observability segments, we estimate information anisotropy from the refinement normal matrix and defer updates along weakly constrained directions until sufficient constraints reappear. Experiments on public benchmarks, controlled stress tests, and real-world deployments demonstrate accurate and stable tracking with KB-level priors from heterogeneous map sources, including under geometrically degenerate and sustained occlusion and in the presence of gradual scene changes.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Intent-Based Multi-Robot Task Planner with LLM Oracles on Hyperledger Fabric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for transforming natural language user intents into executable actions. This capability enables embodied AI agents to perform complex tasks, without involvement of an expert, making human-robot interaction (HRI) more convenient. However these developments raise significant security and privacy challenges such as self-preferencing, where a single LLM service provider dominates the market and uses this power to promote their own preferences. LLM oracles have been recently proposed as a mechanism to decentralize LLMs by executing multiple LLMs from different vendors and aggregating their outputs to obtain a more reliable and trustworthy final result. However, the accuracy of these approaches highly depends on the aggregation method. The current aggregation methods mostly use semantic similarity between various LLM outputs, not suitable for robotic task planning, where the temporal order of tasks is important. To fill the gap, we propose an LLM oracle with a new aggregation method for robotic task planning. In addition, we propose a decentralized multi-robot infrastructure based on Hyperledger Fabric that can host the proposed oracle. The proposed infrastructure enables users to express their natural language intent to the system, which then can be decomposed into subtasks. These subtasks require coordinating different robots from different vendors, while enforcing fine-grained access control management on the data. To evaluate our methodology, we created the SkillChain-RTD benchmark made it publicly available. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, and the proposed aggregation method outperforms other aggregation methods currently in use.</description>

      <title>Bi-Adapt: Few-shot Bimanual Adaptation for Novel Categories of 3D Objects via Semantic Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is imperative yet challenging for robots to execute complex tasks, requiring coordinated collaboration between two arms. However, existing methods for bimanual manipulation often rely on costly data collection and training, struggling to generalize to unseen objects in novel categories efficiently. In this paper, we present Bi-Adapt, a novel framework designed for efficient generalization for bimanual manipulation via semantic correspondence. Bi-Adapt achieves cross-category affordance mapping by leveraging the strong capability of vision foundation models. Fine-tuning with restricted data on novel categories, Bi-Adapt exhibits notable generalization to out-of-category objects in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its high efficiency, achieving a high success rate on different benchmark tasks across novel categories with limited data.

      <title>SteerVLA: Steering Vision-Language-Action Models in Long-Tail Driving Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in autonomous driving is the integration of high-level, semantic reasoning for long-tail events with low-level, reactive control for robust driving. While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

      <title>Post-Collision Trajectory Restoration for a Single-track Ackermann Vehicle using Heuristic Steering and Tractive Force Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-collision trajectory restoration is a safety-critical capability for autonomous vehicles, as impact-induced lateral motion and yaw transients can rapidly drive the vehicle away from the intended path. This paper proposes a structured heuristic recovery control law that jointly commands steering and tractive force for a generalized single-track Ackermann vehicle model. The formulation explicitly accounts for time-varying longitudinal velocity in the lateral-yaw dynamics and retains nonlinear steering-coupled interaction terms that are commonly simplified in the literature. Unlike approaches that assume constant longitudinal speed, the proposed design targets the transient post-impact regime where speed variations and nonlinear coupling significantly influence recovery. The method is evaluated in simulation on the proposed generalized single-track model and a standard 3DOF single-track reference model in MATLAB, demonstrating consistent post-collision restoration behaviour across representative initial post-impact conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the integration of flow field reconstruction, dynamic probabilistic modeling, search control, and machine vision detection in a system for autonomous maritime search operations. Field experiments conducted in Valun Bay (Cres Island, Croatia) involved real-time drifter data acquisition, surrogate flow model fitting based on computational fluid dynamics and numerical optimization, advanced multi-UAV search control and vision sensing, as well as deep learning-based object detection. The results demonstrate that a tightly coupled approach enables reliable detection of floating targets under realistic uncertainties and complex environmental conditions, providing concrete insights for future autonomous maritime search and rescue applications.</description>

      <title>Reliability-aware Execution Gating for Near-field and Off-axis Vision-guided Robotic Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-guided robotic systems are increasingly deployed in precision alignment tasks that require reliable execution under near-field and off-axis configurations. While recent advances in pose estimation have significantly improved numerical accuracy, practical robotic systems still suffer from frequent execution failures even when pose estimates appear accurate. This gap suggests that pose accuracy alone is insufficient to guarantee execution-level reliability. In this paper, we reveal that such failures arise from a deterministic geometric error amplification mechanism, in which small pose estimation errors are magnified through system structure and motion execution, leading to unstable or failed alignment. Rather than modifying pose estimation algorithms, we propose a Reliability-aware Execution Gating mechanism that operates at the execution level. The proposed approach evaluates geometric consistency and configuration risk before execution, and selectively rejects or scales high-risk pose updates. We validate the proposed method on a real UR5 robotic platform performing single-step visual alignment tasks under varying camera-target distances and off-axis configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed execution gating significantly improves task success rates, reduces execution variance, and suppresses tail-risk behavior, while leaving average pose accuracy largely unchanged. Importantly, the proposed mechanism is estimator-agnostic and can be readily integrated with both classical geometry-based and learning-based pose estimation pipelines. These results highlight the importance of execution-level reliability modeling and provide a practical solution for improving robustness in near-field vision-guided robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Characteristics, Management, and Utilization of Muscles in Musculoskeletal Humanoids: Empirical Study on Kengoro and Musashi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various musculoskeletal humanoids have been developed so far, and numerous studies on control mechanisms have been conducted to leverage the advantages of their biomimetic bodies. However, there has not been sufficient and unified discussion on the diverse properties inherent in these musculoskeletal structures, nor on how to manage and utilize them. Therefore, this study categorizes and analyzes the characteristics of muscles, as well as their management and utilization methods, based on the various research conducted on the musculoskeletal humanoids we have developed, Kengoro and Musashi. We classify the features of the musculoskeletal structure into five properties: Redundancy, Independency, Anisotropy, Variable Moment Arm, and Nonlinear Elasticity. We then organize the diverse advantages and disadvantages of musculoskeletal humanoids that arise from the combination of these properties. In particular, we discuss body schema learning and reflex control, along with muscle grouping and body schema adaptation. Also, we describe the implementation of movements through an integrated system and discuss future challenges and prospects.</description>

      <title>UniPlan: Vision-Language Task Planning for Mobile Manipulation with Unified PDDL Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration of VLM reasoning with symbolic planning has proven to be a promising approach to real-world robot task planning. Existing work like UniDomain effectively learns symbolic manipulation domains from real-world demonstrations, described in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and has successfully applied them to real-world tasks. These domains, however, are restricted to tabletop manipulation. We propose UniPlan, a vision-language task planning system for long-horizon mobile-manipulation in large-scale indoor environments, that unifies scene topology, visuals, and robot capabilities into a holistic PDDL representation. UniPlan programmatically extends learned tabletop domains from UniDomain to support navigation, door traversal, and bimanual coordination. It operates on a visual-topological map, comprising navigation landmarks anchored with scene images. Given a language instruction, UniPlan retrieves task-relevant nodes from the map and uses a VLM to ground the anchored image into task-relevant objects and their PDDL states; next, it reconnects these nodes to a compressed, densely-connected topological map, also represented in PDDL, with connectivity and costs derived from the original map; Finally, a mobile-manipulation plan is generated using off-the-shelf PDDL solvers. Evaluated on human-raised tasks in a large-scale map with real-world imagery, UniPlan significantly outperforms VLM and LLM+PDDL planning in success rate, plan quality, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Constrained Sampling to Guide Universal Manipulation RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider how model-based solvers can be leveraged to guide training of a universal policy to control from any feasible start state to any feasible goal in a contact-rich manipulation setting. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its strength in such settings, it may struggle to sufficiently explore and discover complex manipulation strategies, especially in sparse-reward settings. Our approach is based on the idea of a lower-dimensional manifold of feasible, likely-visited states during such manipulation and to guide RL with a sampler from this manifold. We propose Sample-Guided RL, which uses model-based constraint solvers to efficiently sample feasible configurations (satisfying differentiable collision, contact, and force constraints) and leverage them to guide RL for universal (goal-conditioned) manipulation policies. We study using this data directly to bias state visitation, as well as using black-box optimization of open-loop trajectories between random configurations to impose a state bias and optionally add a behavior cloning loss. In a minimalistic double sphere manipulation setting, Sample-Guided RL discovers complex manipulation strategies and achieves high success rates in reaching any statically stable state. In a more challenging panda arm setting, our approach achieves a significant success rate over a near-zero baseline, and demonstrates a breadth of complex whole-body-contact manipulation strategies.</description>

      <title>MOSAIC: Bridging the Sim-to-Real Gap in Generalist Humanoid Motion Tracking and Teleoperation with Rapid Residual Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalist humanoid motion trackers have recently achieved strong simulation metrics by scaling data and training, yet often remain brittle on hardware during sustained teleoperation due to interface- and dynamics-induced errors. We present MOSAIC, an open-source, full-stack system for humanoid motion tracking and whole-body teleoperation across multiple interfaces. MOSAIC first learns a teleoperation-oriented general motion tracker via RL on a multi-source motion bank with adaptive resampling and rewards that emphasize world-frame motion consistency, which is critical for mobile teleoperation. To bridge the sim-to-real interface gap without sacrificing generality, MOSAIC then performs rapid residual adaptation: an interface-specific policy is trained using minimal interface-specific data, and then distilled into the general tracker through an additive residual module, outperforming naive fine-tuning or continual learning. We validate MOSAIC with systematic ablations, out-of-distribution benchmarking, and real-robot experiments demonstrating robust offline motion replay and online long-horizon teleoperation under realistic latency and noise.</description>

      <title>A Precise Real-Time Force-Aware Grasping System for Robust Aerial Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerial manipulation requires force-aware capabilities to enable safe and effective grasping and physical interaction. Previous works often rely on heavy, expensive force sensors unsuitable for typical quadrotor platforms, or perform grasping without force feedback, risking damage to fragile objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel force-aware grasping framework incorporating six low-cost, sensitive skin-like tactile sensors. We introduce a magnetic-based tactile sensing module that provides high-precision three-dimensional force measurements. We eliminate geomagnetic interference through a reference Hall sensor and simplify the calibration process compared to previous work. The proposed framework enables precise force-aware grasping control, allowing safe manipulation of fragile objects and real-time weight measurement of grasped items. The system is validated through comprehensive real-world experiments, including balloon grasping, dynamic load variation tests, and ablation studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in various aerial manipulation scenarios. Our approach achieves fully onboard operation without external motion capture systems, significantly enhancing the practicality of force-sensitive aerial manipulation.

      <title>Mimic Intent, Not Just Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While imitation learning (IL) has achieved impressive success in dexterous manipulation through generative modeling and pretraining, state-of-the-art approaches like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models still struggle with adaptation to environmental changes and skill transfer. We argue this stems from mimicking raw trajectories without understanding the underlying intent. To address this, we propose explicitly disentangling behavior intent from execution details in end-2-end IL: \textit{``Mimic Intent, Not just Trajectories'' (MINT)}. We achieve this via \textit{multi-scale frequency-space tokenization}, which enforces a spectral decomposition of action chunk representation. We learn action tokens with a multi-scale coarse-to-fine structure, and force the coarsest token to capture low-frequency global structure and finer tokens to encode high-frequency details. This yields an abstract \textit{Intent token} that facilitates planning and transfer, and multi-scale \textit{Execution tokens} that enable precise adaptation to environmental dynamics. Building on this hierarchy, our policy generates trajectories through \textit{next-scale autoregression}, performing progressive \textit{intent-to-execution reasoning}, thus boosting learning efficiency and generalization. Crucially, this disentanglement enables \textit{one-shot transfer} of skills, by simply injecting the Intent token from a demonstration into the autoregressive generation process. Experiments on several manipulation benchmarks and on a real robot demonstrate state-of-the-art success rates, superior inference efficiency, robust generalization against disturbances, and effective one-shot transfer.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Vision-Based Flight in Clutter with Safety-Shielded Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in complex missions that demand reliable autonomous navigation and robust obstacle avoidance. However, traditional modular pipelines often incur cumulative latency, whereas purely reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically provide limited formal safety guarantees. To bridge this gap, we propose an end-to-end RL framework augmented with model-based safety mechanisms. We incorporate physical priors in both training and deployment. During training, we design a physics-informed reward structure that provides global navigational guidance. During deployment, we integrate a real-time safety filter that projects the policy outputs onto a provably safe set to enforce strict collision-avoidance constraints. This hybrid architecture reconciles high-speed flight with robust safety assurances. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms both traditional planners and recent end-to-end obstacle avoidance approaches based on differentiable physics. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization, enabling reliable high-speed navigation in dense clutter and challenging outdoor forest environments at velocities up to 7.5m/s.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: Learning Implicit Impedance in Visuomotor Policies via Intent-Execution Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleoperation inherently relies on the human operator acting as a closed-loop controller to actively compensate for hardware imperfections, including latency, mechanical friction, and lack of explicit force feedback. Standard Behavior Cloning (BC), by mimicking the robot's executed trajectory, fundamentally ignores this compensatory mechanism. In this work, we propose a Dual-State Conditioning framework that shifts the learning objective to "Intent Cloning" (master command). We posit that the Intent-Execution Mismatch, the discrepancy between master command and slave response, is not noise, but a critical signal that physically encodes implicit interaction forces and algorithmically reveals the operator's strategy for overcoming system dynamics. By predicting the master intent, our policy learns to generate a "virtual equilibrium point", effectively realizing implicit impedance control. Furthermore, by explicitly conditioning on the history of this mismatch, the model performs implicit system identification, perceiving tracking errors as external forces to close the control loop. To bridge the temporal gap caused by inference latency, we further formulate the policy as a trajectory inpainter to ensure continuous control. We validate our approach on a sensorless, low-cost bi-manual setup. Empirical results across tasks requiring contact-rich manipulation and dynamic tracking reveal a decisive gap: while standard execution-cloning fails due to the inability to overcome contact stiffness and tracking lag, our mismatch-aware approach achieves robust success. This presents a minimalist behavior cloning framework for low-cost hardware, enabling force perception and dynamic compensation without relying on explicit force sensing.

      <title>GaussianCaR: Gaussian Splatting for Efficient Camera-Radar Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust and accurate perception of dynamic objects and map elements is crucial for autonomous vehicles performing safe navigation in complex traffic scenarios. While vision-only methods have become the de facto standard due to their technical advances, they can benefit from effective and cost-efficient fusion with radar measurements. In this work, we advance fusion methods by repurposing Gaussian Splatting as an efficient universal view transformer that bridges the view disparity gap, mapping both image pixels and radar points into a common Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation. Our main contribution is GaussianCaR, an end-to-end network for BEV segmentation that, unlike prior BEV fusion methods, leverages Gaussian Splatting to map raw sensor information into latent features for efficient camera-radar fusion. Our architecture combines multi-scale fusion with a transformer decoder to efficiently extract BEV features. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance on par with, or even surpassing, the state of the art on BEV segmentation tasks (57.3%, 82.9%, and 50.1% IoU for vehicles, roads, and lane dividers) on the nuScenes dataset, while maintaining a 3.2x faster inference runtime.

      <title>A Generic Service-Oriented Function Offloading Framework for Connected Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Function offloading is a promising solution to address limitations concerning computational capacity and available energy of Connected Automated Vehicles~(CAVs) or other autonomous robots by distributing computational tasks between local and remote computing devices in form of distributed services. This paper presents a generic function offloading framework that can be used to offload an arbitrary set of computational tasks with a focus on autonomous driving. To provide flexibility, the function offloading framework is designed to incorporate different offloading decision making algorithms and quality of service~(QoS) requirements that can be adjusted to different scenarios or the objectives of the CAVs. With a focus on the applicability, we propose an efficient location-based approach, where the decision whether tasks are processed locally or remotely depends on the location of the CAV. We apply the proposed framework on the use case of service-oriented trajectory planning, where we offload the trajectory planning task of CAVs to a Multi-Access Edge Computing~(MEC) server. The evaluation is conducted in both simulation and real-world application. It demonstrates the potential of the function offloading framework to guarantee the QoS for trajectory planning while improving the computational efficiency of the CAVs. Moreover, the simulation results also show the adaptability of the framework to diverse scenarios involving simultaneous offloading requests from multiple CAVs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Staged Framework for Safety Analysis of Offloaded Services in Distributed Intelligent Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of service-oriented architectures (SOA) with function offloading for distributed, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) offers the opportunity for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to extend their locally available services. One major goal of offloading a subset of functions in the processing chain of a CAV to remote devices is to reduce the overall computational complexity on the CAV. The extension of using remote services, however, requires careful safety analysis, since the remotely created data are corrupted more easily, e.g., through an attacker on the remote device or by intercepting the wireless transmission. To tackle this problem, we first analyze the concept of SOA for distributed environments. From this, we derive a safety framework that validates the reliability of remote services and the data received locally. Since it is possible for the autonomous driving task to offload multiple different services, we propose a specific multi-staged framework for safety analysis dependent on the service composition of local and remote services. For efficiency reasons, we directly include the multi-staged framework for safety analysis in our service-oriented function offloading framework (SOFOF) that we have proposed in earlier work. The evaluation compares the performance of the extended framework considering computational complexity, with energy savings being a major motivation for function offloading, and its capability to detect data from corrupted remote services.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Teleoperation of Euler-Lagrange Systems via Energy-Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a family of finite-time controllers for the bilateral teleoperation of fully actuated nonlinear Euler-Lagrange systems. Based on the energy-shaping framework and under the standard assumption of passive interactions with the human and the environment, the controllers ensure that the position error and velocities globally converge to zero in the absence of time delays. In this case, the closed-loop system admits a homogeneous approximation of negative degree, and thus the control objective is achieved in finite-time. The proposed controllers are simple, continuous-time proportional-plus-damping-injection schemes, validated through both simulation and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order Control and Geometric Structure of Learned Lagrangian Latent Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based controllers can offer strong guarantees on stability and convergence by relying on physically accurate dynamic models. However, these are rarely available for high-dimensional mechanical systems such as deformable objects or soft robots. While neural architectures can learn to approximate complex dynamics, they are either limited to low-dimensional systems or provide only limited formal control guarantees due to a lack of embedded physical structure. This paper introduces a latent control framework based on learned structure-preserving reduced-order dynamics for high-dimensional Lagrangian systems. We derive a reduced tracking law for fully actuated systems and adopt a Riemannian perspective on projection-based model-order reduction to study the resulting latent and projected closed-loop dynamics. By quantifying the sources of modeling error, we derive interpretable conditions for stability and convergence. We extend the proposed controller and analysis to underactuated systems by introducing learned actuation patterns. Experimental results on simulated and real-world systems validate our theoretical investigation and the accuracy of our controllers.</description>

      <title>CLUE: Crossmodal disambiguation via Language-vision Understanding with attEntion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing integration of robots into daily life, human-robot interaction has become more complex and multifaceted. A critical component of this interaction is Interactive Visual Grounding (IVG), through which robots must interpret human intentions and resolve ambiguity. Existing IVG models generally lack a mechanism to determine when to ask clarification questions, as they implicitly rely on their learned representations. CLUE addresses this gap by converting the VLM's cross-modal attention into an explicit, spatially grounded signal for deciding when to ask. We extract text to image attention maps and pass them to a lightweight CNN to detect referential ambiguity, while a LoRA fine-tuned decoder conducts the dialog and emits grounding location tokens. We train on a real-world interactive dataset for IVG, and a mixed ambiguity set for the detector. With InViG-only supervision, our model surpasses a state-of-the-art method while using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Similarly, the ambiguity detector outperforms prior baselines. Overall, CLUE turns the internal cross-modal attention of a VLM into an explicit, spatially grounded signal for deciding when to ask.

      <title>From Obstacles to Etiquette: Robot Social Navigation with VLM-Informed Path Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating socially in human environments requires more than satisfying geometric constraints, as collision-free paths may still interfere with ongoing activities or conflict with social norms. Addressing this challenge calls for analyzing interactions between agents and incorporating common-sense reasoning into planning. This paper presents a social robot navigation framework that integrates geometric planning with contextual social reasoning. The system first extracts obstacles and human dynamics to generate geometrically feasible candidate paths, then leverages a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) to evaluate these paths, informed by contextually grounded social expectations, selecting a socially optimized path for the controller. This task-specific VLM distills social reasoning from large foundation models into a smaller and efficient model, allowing the framework to perform real-time adaptation in diverse human-robot interaction contexts. Experiments in four social navigation contexts demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall performance with the lowest personal space violation duration, the minimal pedestrian-facing time, and no social zone intrusions.

      <title>Dexterous Manipulation Policies from RGB Human Videos via 4D Hand-Object Trajectory Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-finger robotic hand manipulation and grasping are challenging due to the high-dimensional action space and the difficulty of acquiring large-scale training data. Existing approaches largely rely on human teleoperation with wearable devices or specialized sensing equipment to capture hand-object interactions, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose VIDEOMANIP, a device-free framework that learns dexterous manipulation directly from RGB human videos. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, VIDEOMANIP reconstructs explicit 4D robot-object trajectories from monocular videos by estimating human hand poses, object meshes, and retargets the reconstructed human motions to robotic hands for manipulation learning. To make the reconstructed robot data suitable for dexterous manipulation training, we introduce hand-object contact optimization with interaction-centric grasp modeling, as well as a demonstration synthesis strategy that generates diverse training trajectories from a single video, enabling generalizable policy learning without additional robot demonstrations. In simulation, the learned grasping model achieves a 70.25% success rate across 20 diverse objects using the Inspire Hand. In the real world, manipulation policies trained from RGB videos achieve an average 62.86% success rate across seven tasks using the LEAP Hand, outperforming retargeting-based methods by 15.87%.

      <title>Contact-Anchored Policies: Contact Conditioning Creates Strong Robot Utility Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevalent paradigm in robot learning attempts to generalize across environments, embodiments, and tasks with language prompts at runtime. A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement a real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced. Project page: https://cap-policy.github.io/</description>

      <title>Robustness Is a Function, Not a Number: A Factorized Comprehensive Study of OOD Robustness in Vision-Based Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out of distribution (OOD) robustness in autonomous driving is often reduced to a single number, hiding what breaks a policy. We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \in \{0,1,2,3\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost. (2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\rightarrow$ urban and day $\rightarrow$ night ($\sim 31\%$ each); actor swaps $\sim 10\%$, moderate rain $\sim 7\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance. (7) Scaling traces/views improves robustness ($+11.8$ points from $5$ to $14$ traces), yet targeted exposure to hard conditions can substitute for scale. (8) Using multiple ID environments broadens coverage and strengthens weak cases (urban OOD $60.6\% \rightarrow 70.1\%$) with a small ID drop; single-ID preserves peak performance but in a narrow domain. These results yield actionable design rules for OOD-robust driving policies.</description>

      <title>$\chi_{0}$: Resource-Aware Robust Manipulation via Taming Distributional Inconsistencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-reliability long-horizon robotic manipulation has traditionally relied on large-scale data and compute to understand complex real-world dynamics. However, we identify that the primary bottleneck to real-world robustness is not resource scale alone, but the distributional shift among the human demonstration distribution, the inductive bias learned by the policy, and the test-time execution distribution -- a systematic inconsistency that causes compounding errors in multi-stage tasks. To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose $\chi_{0}$, a resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation. Our approach builds off three technical pillars: (i) Model Arithmetic, a weight-space merging strategy that efficiently soaks up diverse distributions of different demonstrations, varying from object appearance to state variations; (ii) Stage Advantage, a stage-aware advantage estimator that provides stable, dense progress signals, overcoming the numerical instability of prior non-stage approaches; and (iii) Train-Deploy Alignment, which bridges the distribution gap via spatio-temporal augmentation, heuristic DAgger corrections, and temporal chunk-wise smoothing. $\chi_{0}$ enables two sets of dual-arm robots to collaboratively orchestrate long-horizon garment manipulation, spanning tasks from flattening, folding, to hanging different clothes. Our method exhibits high-reliability autonomy; we are able to run the system from arbitrary initial state for consecutive 24 hours non-stop. Experiments validate that $\chi_{0}$ surpasses the state-of-the-art $\pi_{0.5}$ in success rate by nearly 250%, with only 20-hour data and 8 A100 GPUs. Code, data and models will be released to facilitate the community.</description>

      <title>TwinRL-VLA: Digital Twin-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite strong generalization capabilities, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain constrained by the high cost of expert demonstrations and insufficient real-world interaction. While online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving general foundation models, applying RL to VLA manipulation in real-world settings is still hindered by low exploration efficiency and a restricted exploration space. Through systematic real-world experiments, we observe that the effective exploration space of online RL is closely tied to the data distribution of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose TwinRL, a digital twin-real-world collaborative RL framework designed to scale and guide exploration for VLA models. First, a high-fidelity digital twin is efficiently reconstructed from smartphone-captured scenes, enabling realistic bidirectional transfer between real and simulated environments. During the SFT warm-up stage, we introduce an exploration space expansion strategy using digital twins to broaden the support of the data trajectory distribution. Building on this enhanced initialization, we propose a sim-to-real guided exploration strategy to further accelerate online RL. Specifically, TwinRL performs efficient and parallel online RL in the digital twin prior to deployment, effectively bridging the gap between offline and online training stages. Subsequently, we exploit efficient digital twin sampling to identify failure-prone yet informative configurations, which are used to guide targeted human-in-the-loop rollouts on the real robot. In our experiments, TwinRL approaches 100% success in both in-distribution regions covered by real-world demonstrations and out-of-distribution regions, delivering at least a 30% speedup over prior real-world RL methods and requiring only about 20 minutes on average across four tasks.</description>

      <title>Automating the Refinement of Reinforcement Learning Specifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logical specifications have been shown to help reinforcement learning algorithms in achieving complex tasks. However, when a task is under-specified, agents might fail to learn useful policies. In this work, we explore the possibility of improving coarse-grained logical specifications via an exploration-guided strategy. We propose \textsc{AutoSpec}, a framework that searches for a logical specification refinement whose satisfaction implies satisfaction of the original specification, but which provides additional guidance therefore making it easier for reinforcement learning algorithms to learn useful policies. \textsc{AutoSpec} is applicable to reinforcement learning tasks specified via the SpectRL specification logic. We exploit the compositional nature of specifications written in SpectRL, and design four refinement procedures that modify the abstract graph of the specification by either refining its existing edge specifications or by introducing new edge specifications. We prove that all four procedures maintain specification soundness, i.e. any trajectory satisfying the refined specification also satisfies the original. We then show how \textsc{AutoSpec} can be integrated with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for learning policies from logical specifications. Our experiments demonstrate that \textsc{AutoSpec} yields promising improvements in terms of the complexity of control tasks that can be solved, when refined logical specifications produced by \textsc{AutoSpec} are utilized.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical JEPA Meets Predictive Remote Control in Beyond 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In wireless networked control systems, ensuring timely and reliable state updates from distributed devices to remote controllers is essential for robust control performance. However, when multiple devices transmit high-dimensional states (e.g., images or video frames) over bandwidth-limited wireless networks, a critical trade-off emerges between communication efficiency and control performance. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (H-JEPA) for scalable predictive control. Instead of transmitting states, device observations are encoded into low-dimensional embeddings that preserve essential dynamics. The proposed architecture employs a three-level hierarchical prediction, with high-level, medium-level, and low-level predictors operating across different temporal resolutions, to achieve long-term prediction stability, intermediate interpolation, and fine-grained refinement, respectively. Control actions are derived within the embedding space, removing the need for state reconstruction. Simulation results on inverted cart-pole systems demonstrate that H-JEPA enables up to 42.83 % more devices to be supported under limited wireless capacity without compromising control performance.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot UAV Navigation in Forests via Relightable 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: UAV navigation in unstructured outdoor environments using passive monocular vision is hindered by the substantial visual domain gap between simulation and reality. While 3D Gaussian Splatting enables photorealistic scene reconstruction from real-world data, existing methods inherently couple static lighting with geometry, severely limiting policy generalization to dynamic real-world illumination. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end reinforcement learning framework designed for effective zero-shot transfer to unstructured outdoors. Within a high-fidelity simulation grounded in real-world data, our policy is trained to map raw monocular RGB observations directly to continuous control commands. To overcome photometric limitations, we introduce Relightable 3D Gaussian Splatting, which decomposes scene components to enable explicit, physically grounded editing of environmental lighting within the neural representation. By augmenting training with diverse synthesized lighting conditions ranging from strong directional sunlight to diffuse overcast skies, we compel the policy to learn robust, illumination-invariant visual features. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that a lightweight quadrotor achieves robust, collision-free navigation in complex forest environments at speeds up to 10 m/s, exhibiting significant resilience to drastic lighting variations without fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Cerebellar-Inspired Residual Control for Fault Recovery: From Inference-Time Adaptation to Structural Consolidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic policies deployed in real-world environments often encounter post-training faults, where retraining, exploration, or system identification are impractical. We introduce an inference-time, cerebellar-inspired residual control framework that augments a frozen reinforcement learning policy with online corrective actions, enabling fault recovery without modifying base policy parameters. The framework instantiates core cerebellar principles, including high-dimensional pattern separation via fixed feature expansion, parallel microzone-style residual pathways, and local error-driven plasticity with excitatory and inhibitory eligibility traces operating at distinct time scales. These mechanisms enable fast, localized correction under post-training disturbances while avoiding destabilizing global policy updates. A conservative, performance-driven meta-adaptation regulates residual authority and plasticity, preserving nominal behavior and suppressing unnecessary intervention. Experiments on MuJoCo benchmarks under actuator, dynamic, and environmental perturbations show improvements of up to $+66\%$ on \texttt{HalfCheetah-v5} and $+53\%$ on \texttt{Humanoid-v5} under moderate faults, with graceful degradation under severe shifts and complementary robustness from consolidating persistent residual corrections into policy parameters.</description>

      <title>RAPiD: Real-time Deterministic Trajectory Planning via Diffusion Behavior Priors for Safe and Efficient Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based trajectory planners have demonstrated strong capability for modeling the multimodal nature of human driving behavior, but their reliance on iterative stochastic sampling poses critical challenges for real-time, safety-critical deployment. In this work, we present RAPiD, a deterministic policy extraction framework that distills a pretrained diffusion-based planner into an efficient policy while eliminating diffusion sampling. Using score-regularized policy optimization, we leverage the score function of a pre-trained diffusion planner as a behavior prior to regularize policy learning. To promote safety and passenger comfort, the policy is optimized using a critic trained to imitate a predictive driver controller, providing dense, safety-focused supervision beyond conventional imitation learning. Evaluations demonstrate that RAPiD achieves competitive performance on closed-loop nuPlan scenarios with an 8x speedup over diffusion baselines, while achieving state-of-the-art generalization among learning-based planners on the interPlan benchmark.

      <title>Scalable Dexterous Robot Learning with AR-based Remote Human-Robot Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the scalable robot learning for manipulation in the dexterous robot arm-hand systems, where the remote human-robot interactions via augmented reality (AR) are established to collect the expert demonstration data for improving efficiency. In such a system, we present a unified framework to address the general manipulation task problem. Specifically, the proposed method consists of two phases: i) In the first phase for pretraining, the policy is created in a behavior cloning (BC) manner, through leveraging the learning data from our AR-based remote human-robot interaction system; ii) In the second phase, a contrastive learning empowered reinforcement learning (RL) method is developed to obtain more efficient and robust policy than the BC, and thus a projection head is designed to accelerate the learning progress. An event-driven augmented reward is adopted for enhancing the safety. To validate the proposed method, both the physics simulations via PyBullet and real-world experiments are carried out. The results demonstrate that compared to the classic proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic policies, our method not only significantly speeds up the inference, but also achieves much better performance in terms of the success rate for fulfilling the manipulation tasks. By conducting the ablation study, it is confirmed that the proposed RL with contrastive learning overcomes policy collapse.

      <title>Seeing Roads Through Words: A Language-Guided Framework for RGB-T Driving Scene Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust semantic segmentation of road scenes under adverse illumination, lighting, and shadow conditions remain a core challenge for autonomous driving applications. RGB-Thermal fusion is a standard approach, yet existing methods apply static fusion strategies uniformly across all conditions, allowing modality-specific noise to propagate throughout the network. Hence, we propose CLARITY that dynamically adapts its fusion strategy to the detected scene condition. Guided by vision-language model (VLM) priors, the network learns to modulate each modality's contribution based on the illumination state while leveraging object embeddings for segmentation, rather than applying a fixed fusion policy. We further introduce two mechanisms, i.e., one which preserves valid dark-object semantics that prior noise-suppression methods incorrectly discard, and a hierarchical decoder that enforces structural consistency across scales to sharpen boundaries on thin objects. Experiments on the MFNet dataset demonstrate that CLARITY establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), achieving 62.3% mIoU and 77.5% mAcc.</description>

      <title>Haptically Experienced Animacy Facilitates Emotion Regulation: A Theory-Driven Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion regulation (ER) is essential to mental well-being but often difficult to access, especially in high-intensity moments or for individuals with clinical vulnerabilities. While existing technology-based ER tools offer value, they typically rely on self-reflection (e.g., emotion tracking, journaling) or co-regulation through verbal modalities (reminders, text-based conversational tools), which may not be accessible or effective when most needed. The biological role of the touch modality makes it an intriguing alternate pathway, but empirical evidence is limited and under-theorized. Building on our prior theoretical framework describing how a comforting haptic co-regulating adjunct (CHORA) can support ER, we developed a zoomorphic robot CHORA with looped biomimetic breathing and heartbeat behaviors. We evaluated its effects in a mixed-methods in-lab study (N=30), providing physiological, self-report, custom questionnaire, and retrospective interview data. Our findings demonstrate the regulatory effects of haptically experienced animacy, corroborate prior work, and validate CHORA's {theoretically grounded} potential to facilitate four ER strategies.</description>

      <title>Looking and Listening Inside and Outside: Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems for Driver Safety Assessment and Intelligent Vehicle Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The looking-in-looking-out (LILO) framework has enabled intelligent vehicle applications that understand both the outside scene and the driver state to improve safety outcomes, with examples in smart airbag deployment, takeover time prediction in autonomous control transitions, and driver attention monitoring. In this research, we propose an augmentation to this framework, making a case for the audio modality as an additional source of information to understand the driver, and in the evolving autonomy landscape, also the passengers and those outside the vehicle. We expand LILO by incorporating audio signals, forming the looking-and-listening inside-and-outside (L-LIO) framework to enhance driver state assessment and environment understanding through multimodal sensor fusion. We evaluate three example cases where audio enhances vehicle safety: supervised learning on driver speech audio to classify potential impairment states (e.g., intoxication), collection and analysis of passenger natural language instructions (e.g., "turn after that red building") to motivate how spoken language can interface with planning systems through audio-aligned instruction data, and limitations of vision-only systems where audio may disambiguate the guidance and gestures of external agents. Datasets include custom-collected in-vehicle and external audio samples in real-world environments. Pilot findings show that audio yields safety-relevant insights, particularly in nuanced or context-rich scenarios where sound is critical to safe decision-making or visual signals alone are insufficient. Challenges include ambient noise interference, privacy considerations, and robustness across human subjects, motivating further work on reliability in dynamic real-world contexts. L-LIO augments driver and scene understanding through multimodal fusion of audio and visual sensing, offering new paths for safety intervention.</description>

      <title>Vision and language: Novel Representations and Artificial intelligence for Driving Scene Safety Assessment and Autonomous Vehicle Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently emerged as powerful representation learning systems that align visual observations with natural language concepts, offering new opportunities for semantic reasoning in safety-critical autonomous driving. This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.</description>

      <title>Integrating Specialized and Generic Agent Motion Prediction with Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving scene is a challenging task due to uncertainty in sensor data, the complex behaviors of agents, and the possibility of multiple feasible futures. Existing prediction methods using occupancy grid maps primarily focus on agent-agnostic scene predictions, while agent-specific predictions provide specialized behavior insights with the help of semantic information. However, both paradigms face distinct limitations: agent-agnostic models struggle to capture the behavioral complexities of dynamic actors, whereas agent-specific approaches fail to generalize to poorly perceived or unrecognized agents; combining both enables robust and safer motion forecasting. To address this, we propose a unified framework by leveraging Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps within a streamlined temporal decoding pipeline to simultaneously predict future occupancy state grids, vehicle grids, and scene flow grids. Relying on a lightweight spatiotemporal backbone, our approach is centered on a tailored, interdependent loss function that captures inter-grid dependencies and enables diverse future predictions. By using occupancy state information to enforce flow-guided transitions, the loss function acts as a regularizer that directs occupancy evolution while accounting for obstacles and occlusions. Consequently, the model not only predicts the specific behaviors of vehicle agents, but also identifies other dynamic entities and anticipates their evolution within the complex scene. Evaluations on real-world nuScenes and Woven Planet datasets demonstrate superior prediction performances for dynamic vehicles and generic dynamic scene elements compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>ForecastOcc: Vision-based Semantic Occupancy Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving requires forecasting both geometry and semantics over time to effectively reason about future environment states. Existing vision-based occupancy forecasting methods focus on motion-related categories such as static and dynamic objects, while semantic information remains largely absent. Recent semantic occupancy forecasting approaches address this gap but rely on past occupancy predictions obtained from separate networks. This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons. Extensive experiments on both datasets show that ForecastOcc consistently outperforms baselines, yielding semantically rich, future-aware predictions that capture scene dynamics and semantics critical for autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Picasso: Holistic Scene Reconstruction with Physics-Constrained Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of occlusions and measurement noise, geometrically accurate scene reconstructions -- which fit the sensor data -- can still be physically incorrect. For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition.</description>

Abstract: While social robots have demonstrated effectiveness in supporting students' intercultural competence development, it is unclear how they can effectively be adopted for integrated use in K-12 schools. We conducted two phases of design workshops with teachers, where they co-designed robot-mediated intercultural activities while considering student needs and school integration concerns. Using thematic analysis, we identify appropriate scenarios and roles for classroom robots, explore how robots could complement rather than replace teachers, and consider how to address ethical and compliance considerations. Our findings provide practical design guidelines for the HRI community to develop social robots that can effectively support intercultural education in K-12 schools.</description>

Abstract: As highly automated driving is transitioning from single-vehicle closed-access testing to commercial deployments of public ride-hailing in selected areas (e.g., Waymo), automated driving and connected cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) remain active fields of research. Even though simulation is omnipresent in the development and validation life cycle of automated and connected driving technology, the complex nature of public road traffic and software that masters it still requires real-world integration and testing with actual vehicles. Dedicated vehicles for research and development allow testing and validation of software and hardware components under real-world conditions early on. They also enable collecting and publishing real-world datasets that let others conduct research without vehicle access, and support early demonstration of futuristic use cases. In this paper, we present karl., our new research vehicle for automated and connected driving. Apart from major corporations, few institutions worldwide have access to their own L4-capable research vehicles, restricting their ability to carry out independent research. This paper aims to help bridge that gap by sharing the reasoning, design choices, and technical details that went into making karl. a flexible and powerful platform for research, engineering, and validation in the context of automated and connected driving.

Abstract: Accurately predicting pedestrian motion is crucial for safe and reliable autonomous driving in complex urban environments. In this work, we present a 3D vehicle-conditioned pedestrian pose forecasting framework that explicitly incorporates surrounding vehicle information. To support this, we enhance the Waymo-3DSkelMo dataset with aligned 3D vehicle bounding boxes, enabling realistic modeling of multi-agent pedestrian-vehicle interactions. We introduce a sampling scheme to categorize scenes by pedestrian and vehicle count, facilitating training across varying interaction complexities. Our proposed network adapts the TBIFormer architecture with a dedicated vehicle encoder and pedestrian-vehicle interaction cross-attention module to fuse pedestrian and vehicle features, allowing predictions to be conditioned on both historical pedestrian motion and surrounding vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in forecasting accuracy and validate different approaches for modeling pedestrian-vehicle interactions, highlighting the importance of vehicle-aware 3D pose prediction for autonomous driving.

      <title>WorldArena: A Unified Benchmark for Evaluating Perception and Functional Utility of Embodied World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While world models have emerged as a cornerstone of embodied intelligence by enabling agents to reason about environmental dynamics through action-conditioned prediction, their evaluation remains fragmented. Current evaluation of embodied world models has largely focused on perceptual fidelity (e.g., video generation quality), overlooking the functional utility of these models in downstream decision-making tasks. In this work, we introduce WorldArena, a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both perceptual and functional dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability. WorldArena benchmark with the public leaderboard is released at https://worldarena.ai, providing a framework for tracking progress toward truly functional world models in embodied AI.</description>

      <title>Lan-grasp: Using Large Language Models for Semantic Object Grasping and Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Lan-grasp, a novel approach towards more appropriate semantic grasping and placing. We leverage foundation models to equip the robot with a semantic understanding of object geometry, enabling it to identify the right place to grasp, which parts to avoid, and the natural pose for placement. This is an important contribution to grasping and utilizing objects in a more meaningful and safe manner. We leverage a combination of a Large Language Model, a Vision-Language Model, and a traditional grasp planner to generate grasps that demonstrate a deeper semantic understanding of the objects. Building on foundation models provides us with a zero-shot grasp method that can handle a wide range of objects without requiring further training or fine-tuning. We also propose a method for safely putting down a grasped object. The core idea is to rotate the object upright utilizing a pretrained generative model and the reasoning capabilities of a VLM. We evaluate our method in real-world experiments on a custom object dataset and present the results of a survey that asks participants to choose an object part appropriate for grasping. The results show that the grasps generated by our method are consistently ranked higher by the participants than those generated by a conventional grasping planner and a recent semantic grasping approach. In addition, we propose a Visual Chain-of-Thought feedback loop to assess grasp feasibility in complex scenarios. This mechanism enables dynamic reasoning and generates alternative grasp strategies when needed, ensuring safer and more effective grasping outcomes.</description>

      <title>Delay-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Highway On-Ramp Merging under Stochastic Communication Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11852v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Delayed and partially observable state information poses significant challenges for reinforcement learning (RL)-based control in real-world autonomous driving. In highway on-ramp merging, a roadside unit (RSU) can sense nearby traffic, perform edge perception, and transmit state estimates to the ego vehicle over vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. With recent advancements in intelligent transportation infrastructure and edge computing, such RSU-assisted perception is increasingly realistic and already deployed in modern connected roadway systems. However, edge processing time and wireless transmission can introduce stochastic V2I communication delays, violating the Markov assumption and substantially degrading control performance. In this work, we propose DAROM, a Delay-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework for On-ramp Merging that is robust to stochastic delays. We model the problem as a random delay Markov decision process (RDMDP) and develop a unified RL agent for joint longitudinal and lateral control. To recover a Markovian representation under delayed observations, we introduce a Delay-Aware Encoder that conditions on delayed observations, masked action histories, and observed delay magnitude to infer the current latent state. We further integrate a physics-based safety controller to reduce collision risk during merging. Experiments in the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) simulator using real-world traffic data from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset demonstrate that DAROM consistently outperforms standard RL baselines across traffic densities. In particular, the gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based encoder achieves over 99% success in high-density traffic with random V2I delays of up to 2.0 seconds.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid growth of global e-commerce, the demand for automation in the logistics industry is increasing. This study focuses on automated picking systems in warehouses, utilizing deep learning and reinforcement learning technologies to enhance picking efficiency and accuracy while reducing system failure rates. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these technologies in improving robot picking performance and adaptability to complex environments. The results show that the integrated machine learning model significantly outperforms traditional methods, effectively addressing the challenges of peak order processing, reducing operational errors, and improving overall logistics efficiency. Additionally, by analyzing environmental factors, this study further optimizes system design to ensure efficient and stable operation under variable conditions. This research not only provides innovative solutions for logistics automation but also offers a theoretical and empirical foundation for future technological development and application.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Data-Free Continual Communicative Learning (CCL) from Black-Box Visual Place Recognition Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In emerging multi-robot societies, heterogeneous agents must continually extract and integrate local knowledge from one another through communication, even when their internal models are completely opaque. Existing approaches to continual or collaborative learning for visual place recognition (VPR) largely assume white-box access to model parameters or shared training datasets, which is unrealistic when robots encounter unknown peers in the wild. This paper introduces \emph{Continual Communicative Learning (CCL)}, a data-free multi-robot framework in which a traveler robot (student) continually improves its VPR capability by communicating with black-box teacher models via a constrained query--response channel. We repurpose Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), originally developed as privacy attacks on machine learning models, as a constructive communication primitive to reconstruct pseudo-training sets from black-box VPR teachers without accessing their parameters or raw data. To overcome the intrinsic communication bottleneck caused by the low sampling efficiency of black-box MIA, we propose a prior-based query strategy that leverages the student's own VPR prior to focus queries on informative regions of the embedding space, thereby reducing the knowledge transfer (KT) cost. Experimental results on a standard multi-session VPR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed CCL framework yields substantial performance gains for low-performing robots under modest communication budgets, highlighting CCL as a promising building block for scalable and fault-tolerant multi-robot systems. Furthermore, we propose a Distributed Statistic Integration (DSI) framework that theoretically eliminates catastrophic forgetting by efficiently aggregating sufficient statistics from black-box VPR models while maintaining data privacy and reducing communication overhead to a sample-invariant constant complexity.</description>

      <title>Collision Risk Estimation via Loss Prediction in End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collision risk estimation and avoidance play central roles in the safety of autonomous driving (AD) systems. Recently emerged end-to-end AD systems gain collision avoidance ability by minimizing losses to penalize planning trajectories that are too close to other objects. Despite a significant collision rate during testing, most end-to-end planners do not explicitly quantify the collision risk in their outputs. To address this, we introduce RiskMonitor, an efficient plug-and-play module that interprets planning and motion tokens from state-of-the-art end-to-end planners to estimate collision risk. Inspired by loss prediction based uncertainty quantification, RiskMonitor predicts whether the collision loss -- commonly adopted to train end-to-end planners -- is positive along planned waypoints, framing collision risk estimation as a binary classification task. We evaluate RiskMonitor on the real-world nuScenes dataset (open-loop) and the neural-rendering based simulator, NeuroNCAP (closed-loop). Our token-driven method outperforms prediction-driven approaches, including deterministic rules, Gaussian mixture models, and Monte Carlo Dropout. When integrated with a simple braking policy, RiskMonitor improves collision avoidance ability by $66.5\%$ in a closed-loop test on safety-critical scenarios. These results demonstrate that monitoring collision risk using plan and motion tokens enhances the safety of end-to-end AD without retraining it.</description>

      <title>SafeLink: Safety-Critical Control Under Dynamic and Irregular Unsafe Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) provide a theoretical foundation for safety-critical control in robotic systems. However, most existing methods rely on explicit analytical expressions of unsafe state regions, which are often impractical for irregular and dynamic unsafe regions. This paper introduces SafeLink, a novel CBF construction method based on cost-sensitive incremental random vector functional-link (RVFL) neural networks. By designing a valid cost function, SafeLink assigns different sensitivities to safe and unsafe state points, thereby eliminating false negatives in classification of unsafe state points. Under the constructed CBF, theoretical guarantees are established regarding system safety and the Lipschitz continuity of the control inputs. Furthermore, incremental update theorems are provided, enabling precise real-time adaptation to changes in unsafe regions. An analytical expression for the gradient of SafeLink is also derived to facilitate control input computation. The proposed method is validated on the endpoint position control task of a nonlinear two-link manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the method effectively learns the unsafe regions and rapidly adapts as these regions change, achieving computational speeds significantly faster than baseline methods while ensuring the system safely reaches its target position.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20487v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanoid robots are drawing significant attention as versatile platforms for complex motor control, human-robot interaction, and general-purpose physical intelligence. However, achieving efficient whole-body control (WBC) in humanoids remains a fundamental challenge due to sophisticated dynamics, underactuation, and diverse task requirements. While learning-based controllers have shown promise for complex tasks, their reliance on labor-intensive and costly retraining for new scenarios limits real-world applicability. To address these limitations, behavior(al) foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a new paradigm that leverages large-scale pre-training to learn reusable primitive skills and broad behavioral priors, enabling zero-shot or rapid adaptation to a wide range of downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of BFMs for humanoid WBC, tracing their development across diverse pre-training pipelines. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications, current limitations, urgent challenges, and future opportunities, positioning BFMs as a key approach toward scalable and general-purpose humanoid intelligence. Finally, we provide a curated and regularly updated collection of BFM papers and projects to facilitate more subsequent research, which is available at https://github.com/yuanmingqi/awesome-bfm-papers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring high-latitude lunar regions presents an extremely challenging visual environment for robots. The low sunlight elevation angle and minimal light scattering result in a visual field dominated by a high dynamic range featuring long, dynamic shadows. Reproducing these conditions on Earth requires sophisticated simulators and specialized facilities. We introduce a unique dataset recorded at the LunaLab from the SnT - University of Luxembourg, an indoor test facility designed to replicate the optical characteristics of multiple lunar latitudes. Our dataset includes images, inertial measurements, and wheel odometry data from robots navigating seven distinct trajectories under multiple illumination scenarios, simulating high-latitude lunar conditions from dawn to nighttime with and without the aid of headlights, resulting in 88 distinct sequences containing a total of 1.3M images. Data was captured using a stereo RGB-inertial sensor, a monocular monochrome camera, and for the first time, a novel single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) camera. We recorded both static and dynamic image sequences, with robots navigating at slow (5 cm/s) and fast (50 cm/s) speeds. All data is calibrated, synchronized, and timestamped, providing a valuable resource for validating perception tasks from vision-based autonomous navigation to scientific imaging for future lunar missions targeting high-latitude regions or those intended for robots operating across perceptually degraded environments. The dataset and all supplementary material can be accessed from and found at https://github.com/spaceuma/spice-hl3.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Graph Fusion with Vision-Language-Action Model for Policy Reasoning and Dual Robotic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous skills from human videos remains challenging due to the reliance on low-level trajectory imitation, which fails to generalize across object types, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. We propose Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a framework that enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly from RGB and Depth human demonstrations. GF-VLA first extracts Shannon-information-based cues to identify hands and objects with the highest task relevance, then encodes these cues into temporally ordered scene graphs that capture both hand-object and object-object interactions. These graphs are fused with a language-conditioned transformer that generates hierarchical behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion commands. To improve execution efficiency in bimanual settings, we further introduce a cross-hand selection policy that infers optimal gripper assignment without explicit geometric reasoning. We evaluate GF-VLA on four structured dual-arm block assembly tasks involving symbolic shape construction and spatial generalization. Experimental results show that the information-theoretic scene representation achieves over 95 percent graph accuracy and 93 percent subtask segmentation, supporting the LLM planner in generating reliable and human-readable task policies. When executed by the dual-arm robot, these policies yield 94 percent grasp success, 89 percent placement accuracy, and 90 percent overall task success across stacking, letter-building, and geometric reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness across diverse spatial and semantic variations.</description>

      <title>Sim-to-Real Dynamic Object Manipulation on Conveyor Systems via Optimization Path Shaping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing generalizable dynamic object manipulation on conveyor systems is important for enhancing manufacturing efficiency, as it eliminates specialized engineering for different scenarios. To this end, imitation learning emerges as a promising paradigm, leveraging expert demonstrations to teach a policy manipulation skills. Although the generalization of an imitation learning policy can be improved by increasing demonstrations, demonstration collection is labor-intensive. Besides, public dynamic object manipulation data is scarce. In this work, we address this data scarcity problem via generating demonstrations in a simulator. A significant challenge of using simulated data lies in the appearance gap between simulated and real-world observations. To tackle this challenge, we propose Geometry-Enhanced Model (GEM), which employs our designed appearance noise annealing strategy to shape the policy optimization path, thereby prioritizing the geometry information in observations. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that GEM can generalize across environment backgrounds, robot embodiments, motion dynamics, and object geometries. Notably, GEM is deployed in a real canteen for tableware collection. Without test-scene data, GEM achieves a success rate of over 97% across more than 10,000 operations.</description>

      <title>CTBC: Contact-Triggered Blind Climbing for Wheeled Bipedal Robots with Instruction Learning and Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, wheeled bipedal robots have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional mobility on flat terrain. However, while stair climbing has been achieved in prior studies, these existing methods often suffer from a severe lack of versatility, making them difficult to adapt to varying hardware specifications or diverse complex terrains. To overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized Contact-Triggered Blind Climbing (CTBC) framework. Upon detecting wheel-obstacle contact, the framework triggers a leg-lifting motion integrated with a strongly-guided feedforward trajectory. This allows the robot to rapidly acquire agile climbing skills, significantly enhancing its capability to traverse unstructured environments. Distinct from previous approaches, CTBC demonstrates superior robustness and adaptability, having been validated across multiple wheeled bipedal platforms with different wheel radii and tire materials. Real-world experiments demonstrate that, relying solely on proprioceptive feedback, the proposed framework enables robots to achieve reliable and continuous climbing over obstacles well beyond their wheel radius.</description>

      <title>ManiVID-3D: Generalizable View-Invariant Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation via Disentangled 3D Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deploying visual reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world manipulation is often hindered by camera viewpoint changes. A policy trained from a fixed front-facing camera may fail when the camera is shifted -- an unavoidable situation in real-world settings where sensor placement is hard to manage appropriately. Existing methods often rely on precise camera calibration or struggle with large perspective changes. To address these limitations, we propose ManiVID-3D, a novel 3D RL architecture designed for robotic manipulation, which learns view-invariant representations through self-supervised disentangled feature learning. The framework incorporates ViewNet, a lightweight yet effective module that automatically aligns point cloud observations from arbitrary viewpoints into a unified spatial coordinate system without the need for extrinsic calibration. Additionally, we develop an efficient GPU-accelerated batch rendering module capable of processing over 5000 frames per second, enabling large-scale training for 3D visual RL at unprecedented speeds. Extensive evaluation across 10 simulated and 5 real-world tasks demonstrates that our approach achieves a 40.6% higher success rate than state-of-the-art methods under viewpoint variations while using 80% fewer parameters. The system's robustness to severe perspective changes and strong sim-to-real performance highlight the effectiveness of learning geometrically consistent representations for scalable robotic manipulation in unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>A Software-Only Post-Processor for Indexed Rotary Machining on GRBL-Based CNCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affordable desktop CNC routers are common in education, prototyping, and makerspaces, but most lack a rotary axis, limiting fabrication of rotationally symmetric or multi-sided parts. Existing solutions often require hardware retrofits, alternative controllers, or commercial CAM software, raising cost and complexity. This work presents a software-only framework for indexed rotary machining on GRBL-based CNCs. A custom post-processor converts planar toolpaths into discrete rotary steps, executed through a browser-based interface. While not equivalent to continuous 4-axis machining, the method enables practical rotary-axis fabrication using only standard, off-the-shelf mechanics, without firmware modification. By reducing technical and financial barriers, the framework expands access to multi-axis machining in classrooms, makerspaces, and small workshops, supporting hands-on learning and rapid prototyping.</description>

      <title>Parallel Simulation of Contact and Actuation for Soft Growing Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth, bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts. We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.</description>

      <title>Omni-LIVO: Robust RGB-Colored Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial-LiDAR Odometry via Photometric Migration and ESIKF Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15673v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wide field-of-view (FoV) LiDAR sensors provide dense geometry across large environments, but existing LiDAR-inertial-visual odometry (LIVO) systems generally rely on a single camera, limiting their ability to fully exploit LiDAR-derived depth for photometric alignment and scene colorization. We present Omni-LIVO, a tightly coupled multi-camera LIVO system that leverages multi-view observations to comprehensively utilize LiDAR geometric information across extended spatial regions. Omni-LIVO introduces a Cross-View direct alignment strategy that maintains photometric consistency across non-overlapping views, and extends the Error-State Iterated Kalman Filter (ESIKF) with multi-view updates and adaptive covariance. The system is evaluated on public benchmarks and our custom dataset, showing improved accuracy and robustness over state-of-the-art LIVO, LIO, and visual-inertial SLAM baselines. Code and dataset will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>OpenGVL -- Benchmarking Visual Temporal Progress for Data Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17321v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data scarcity remains one of the most limiting factors in driving progress in robotics. However, the amount of available robotics data in the wild is growing exponentially, creating new opportunities for large-scale data utilization. Reliable temporal task completion prediction could help automatically annotate and curate this data at scale. The Generative Value Learning (GVL) approach was recently proposed, leveraging the knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) to predict task progress from visual observations. Building upon GVL, we propose OpenGVL, a comprehensive benchmark for estimating task progress across diverse challenging manipulation tasks involving both robotic and human embodiments. We evaluate the capabilities of publicly available open-source foundation models, showing that open-source model families significantly underperform closed-source counterparts, achieving only approximately $70\%$ of their performance on temporal progress prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate how OpenGVL can serve as a practical tool for automated data curation and filtering, enabling efficient quality assessment of large-scale robotics datasets. We release the benchmark along with the complete codebase at \href{github.com/budzianowski/opengvl}{OpenGVL}.</description>

      <title>RLinf-VLA: A Unified and Efficient Framework for Reinforcement Learning of Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have motivated the extension of their capabilities to embodied settings, where reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled way to optimize task success through interaction. However, existing methods remain fragmented, lacking both a unified platform for fair comparison across architectures and algorithms and an efficient system design for scalable training. To address these challenges, we introduce RLinf-VLA, a unified and efficient framework for scalable RL training of VLA models. RLinf-VLA achieves unification by providing a unified interface that standardizes the integration of diverse VLA architectures, multiple RL algorithms, and heterogeneous simulators, enabling extensibility. To ensure efficiency, the system adopts a flexible resource allocation architecture for rendering, inference, and training workloads in RL pipelines. In particular, for GPU-parallelized simulators, RLinf-VLA introduces a hybrid fine-grained pipeline allocation strategy, yielding a 1.61x-1.88x training speedup. Using this unified system, models trained with RLinf-VLA demonstrate consistent performance improvements of approximately 20-85% across multiple simulation benchmarks, including LIBERO, ManiSkill, and RoboTwin. Furthermore, we distill a set of training practices for effective RL-based VLA training. We position RLinf-VLA as a foundational system to enable efficient, unified, and reproducible research in embodied intelligence.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Inspection Planning Approach Towards Routine Monitoring in Uncertain Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a hierarchical framework designed to support robotic inspection under environment uncertainty. By leveraging a known environment model, existing methods plan and safely track inspection routes to visit points of interest. However, discrepancies between the model and actual site conditions, caused by either natural or human activities, can alter the surface morphology or introduce path obstructions. To address this challenge, the proposed framework divides the inspection task into: (a) generating the initial global view-plan for region of interests based on a historical map and (b) local view replanning to adapt to the current morphology of the inspection scene. The proposed hierarchy preserves global coverage objectives while enabling reactive adaptation to the local surface morphology. This enables the local autonomy to remain robust against environment uncertainty and complete the inspection tasks. We validate the approach through deployments in real-world subterranean mines using quadrupedal robot. A supplementary media highlighting the proposed method can be found here https://youtu.be/6TxK8S_83Lw.</description>

      <title>Embodying Physical Computing into Soft Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Softening and onboarding computers and controllers is one of the final frontiers in soft robotics towards their robustness and intelligence for everyday use. In this regard, embodying soft and physical computing presents exciting potential. Physical computing seeks to encode inputs into a mechanical computing kernel and leverage the internal interactions among this kernel's constituent elements to compute the output. Moreover, such input-to-output evolution can be re-programmable. This perspective paper proposes a framework for embodying physical computing into soft robots and discusses three unique strategies in the literature: analog oscillators, physical reservoir computing, and physical algorithmic computing. These embodied computers enable the soft robot to perform complex behaviors that would otherwise require CMOS-based electronics -- including coordinated locomotion with obstacle avoidance, payload weight and orientation classification, and programmable operation based on logical rules. This paper will detail the working principles of these embodied physical computing methods, survey the current state-of-the-art, and present a perspective for future development.</description>

      <title>GRAND: Guidance, Rebalancing, and Assignment for Networked Dispatch in Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large robot fleets are now common in warehouses and other logistics settings, where small control gains translate into large operational impacts. In this article, we address task scheduling for lifelong Multi-Agent Pickup-and-Delivery (MAPD) and propose a hybrid method that couples learning-based global guidance with lightweight optimization. A graph neural network policy trained via reinforcement learning outputs a desired distribution of free agents over an aggregated warehouse graph. This signal is converted into region-to-region rebalancing through a minimum-cost flow, and finalized by small, local assignment problems, preserving accuracy while keeping per-step latency within a 1 s compute budget. On congested warehouse benchmarks from the League of Robot Runners (LoRR) with up to 500 agents, our approach improves throughput by up to 10% over the 2024 winning scheduler while maintaining real-time execution. The results indicate that coupling graph-structured learned guidance with tractable solvers reduces congestion and yields a practical, scalable blueprint for high-throughput scheduling in large fleets.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Tactile-Visual Perception for Learning Multimodal Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation requires both rich multimodal perception and effective learning frameworks to handle complex real-world tasks. See-through-skin (STS) sensors, which combine tactile and visual perception, offer promising sensing capabilities, while modern imitation learning provides powerful tools for policy acquisition. However, existing STS designs lack simultaneous multimodal perception and suffer from unreliable tactile tracking. Furthermore, integrating these rich multimodal signals into learning-based manipulation pipelines remains an open challenge. We introduce TacThru, an STS sensor enabling simultaneous visual perception and robust tactile signal extraction, and TacThru-UMI, an imitation learning framework that leverages these multimodal signals for manipulation. Our sensor features a fully transparent elastomer, persistent illumination, novel keyline markers, and efficient tracking, while our learning system integrates these signals through a Transformer-based Diffusion Policy. Experiments on five challenging real-world tasks show that TacThru-UMI achieves an average success rate of 85.5%, significantly outperforming the baselines of tactile policy(66.3%) and vision-only policy (55.4%). The system excels in critical scenarios, including contact detection with thin and soft objects and precision manipulation requiring multimodal coordination. This work demonstrates that combining simultaneous multimodal perception with modern learning frameworks enables more precise, adaptable robotic manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling data volume and diversity is critical for generalizing embodied intelligence. While synthetic data generation offers a scalable alternative to expensive physical data acquisition, existing pipelines remain fragmented and task-specific. This isolation leads to significant engineering inefficiency and system instability, failing to support the sustained, high-throughput data generation required for foundation model training. To address these challenges, we present Nimbus, a unified synthetic data generation framework designed to integrate heterogeneous navigation and manipulation pipelines. Nimbus introduces a modular four-layer architecture featuring a decoupled execution model that separates trajectory planning, rendering, and storage into asynchronous stages. By implementing dynamic pipeline scheduling, global load balancing, distributed fault tolerance, and backend-specific rendering optimizations, the system maximizes resource utilization across CPU, GPU, and I/O resources. Our evaluation demonstrates that Nimbus achieves a 2-3X improvement in end-to-end throughput compared to unoptimized baselines and ensuring robust, long-term operation in large-scale distributed environments. This framework serves as the production backbone for the InternData suite, enabling seamless cross-domain data synthesis.</description>

      <title>StreamVLA: Breaking the Reason-Act Cycle via Completion-State Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation requires bridging the gap between high-level planning (System 2) and low-level control (System 1). Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often entangle these processes, performing redundant multimodal reasoning at every timestep, which leads to high latency and goal instability. To address this, we present StreamVLA, a dual-system architecture that unifies textual task decomposition, visual goal imagination, and continuous action generation within a single parameter-efficient backbone. We introduce a "Lock-and-Gated" mechanism to intelligently modulate computation: only when a sub-task transition is detected, the model triggers slow thinking to generate a textual instruction and imagines the specific visual completion state, rather than generic future frames. Crucially, this completion state serves as a time-invariant goal anchor, making the policy robust to execution speed variations. During steady execution, these high-level intents are locked to condition a Flow Matching action head, allowing the model to bypass expensive autoregressive decoding for 72% of timesteps. This hierarchical abstraction ensures sub-goal focus while significantly reducing inference latency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that StreamVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 98.5% success rate on the LIBERO benchmark and robust recovery in real-world interference scenarios, achieving a 48% reduction in latency compared to full-reasoning baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of reactive motion planning for quadrotors operating in unknown environments with dynamic obstacles. Our approach leverages a 4-dimensional spatio-temporal planner, integrated with vision-based Safe Flight Corridor (SFC) generation and trajectory optimization. Unlike prior methods that rely on map fusion, our framework is mapless, enabling collision avoidance directly from perception while reducing computational overhead. Dynamic obstacles are detected and tracked using a vision-based object segmentation and tracking pipeline, allowing robust classification of static versus dynamic elements in the scene. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a backup planning module that reactively avoids dynamic obstacles when no direct path to the goal is available, mitigating the risk of collisions during deadlock situations. We validate our method extensively in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments, and benchmark it against state-of-the-art approaches, showing significant advantages for reactive UAV navigation in dynamic, unknown environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated generalizable open-vocabulary perception and reasoning, yet their real-robot manipulation capability remains unclear for long-horizon, closed-loop execution in unstructured, in-the-wild environments. Prior VLM-based manipulation pipelines are difficult to compare across different research groups' setups, and many evaluations rely on simulation, privileged state, or specially designed setups. We present AgenticLab, a model-agnostic robot agent platform and benchmark for open-world manipulation. AgenticLab provides a closed-loop agent pipeline for perception, task decomposition, online verification, and replanning. Using AgenticLab, we benchmark state-of-the-art VLM-based agents on real-robot tasks in unstructured environments. Our benchmark reveals several failure modes that offline vision-language tests (e.g., VQA and static image understanding) fail to capture, including breakdowns in multi-step grounding consistency, object grounding under occlusion and scene changes, and insufficient spatial reasoning for reliable manipulation. We will release the full hardware and software stack to support reproducible evaluation and accelerate research on general-purpose robot agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quadruped robot faces balancing challenges on a six-degrees-of-freedom moving platform, like subways, buses, airplanes, and yachts, due to independent platform motions and resultant diverse inertia forces on the robot. To alleviate these challenges, we present the Learning-based Active Stabilization on Moving Platforms (\textit{LAS-MP}), featuring a self-balancing policy and system state estimators. The policy adaptively adjusts the robot's posture in response to the platform's motion. The estimators infer robot and platform states based on proprioceptive sensor data. For a systematic training scheme across various platform motions, we introduce platform trajectory generation and scheduling methods. Our evaluation demonstrates superior balancing performance across multiple metrics compared to three baselines. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of the \textit{LAS-MP}, including ablation studies and evaluation of the estimators, to validate the effectiveness of each component.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Navigation Efficiency of Quadruped Robots via Leveraging Personal Transportation Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadruped robots face limitations in long-range navigation efficiency due to their reliance on legs. To ameliorate the limitations, we introduce a Reinforcement Learning-based Active Transporter Riding method (\textit{RL-ATR}), inspired by humans' utilization of personal transporters, including Segways. The \textit{RL-ATR} features a transporter riding policy and two state estimators. The policy devises adequate maneuvering strategies according to transporter-specific control dynamics, while the estimators resolve sensor ambiguities in non-inertial frames by inferring unobservable robot and transporter states. Comprehensive evaluations in simulation validate proficient command tracking abilities across various transporter-robot models and reduced energy consumption compared to legged locomotion. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to quantify individual component contributions within the \textit{RL-ATR}. This riding ability could broaden the locomotion modalities of quadruped robots, potentially expanding the operational range and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Initialization of Trajectory Optimization for Path-following Problems of Redundant Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectory optimization (TO) is an efficient tool to generate a redundant manipulator's joint trajectory following a 6-dimensional Cartesian path. The optimization performance largely depends on the quality of initial trajectories. However, the selection of a high-quality initial trajectory is non-trivial and requires a considerable time budget due to the extremely large space of the solution trajectories and the lack of prior knowledge about task constraints in configuration space. To alleviate the issue, we present a learning-based initial trajectory generation method that generates high-quality initial trajectories in a short time budget by adopting example-guided reinforcement learning. In addition, we suggest a null-space projected imitation reward to consider null-space constraints by efficiently learning kinematically feasible motion captured in expert demonstrations. Our statistical evaluation in simulation shows the improved optimality, efficiency, and applicability of TO when we plug in our method's output, compared with three other baselines. We also show the performance improvement and feasibility via real-world experiments with a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator.</description>

      <title>Multi-Player, Multi-Strategy Quantum Game Model for Interaction-Aware Decision-Making in Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although significant progress has been made in decision-making for automated driving, challenges remain for deployment in the real world. One challenge lies in addressing interaction-awareness. Most existing approaches oversimplify interactions between the ego vehicle and surrounding agents, and often neglect interactions among the agents themselves. A common solution is to model these interactions using classical game theory. However, its formulation assumes rational players, whereas human behavior is frequently uncertain or irrational. To address these challenges, we propose the Quantum Game Decision-Making (QGDM) model, a novel framework that combines classical game theory with quantum mechanics principles (such as superposition, entanglement, and interference) to tackle multi-player, multi-strategy decision-making problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to apply quantum game theory to decision-making for automated driving. QGDM runs in real time on a standard computer, without requiring quantum hardware. We evaluate QGDM in simulation across various scenarios, including roundabouts, merging, and highways, and compare its performance with multiple baseline methods. Results show that QGDM significantly improves success rates and reduces collision rates compared to classical approaches, particularly in scenarios with high interaction.</description>

      <title>Gust Estimation and Rejection with a Disturbance Observer for Proprioceptive Underwater Soft Morphing Wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned underwater vehicles are increasingly employed for maintenance and surveying tasks at sea, but their operation in shallow waters is often hindered by hydrodynamic disturbances such as waves, currents, and turbulence. These unsteady flows can induce rapid changes in direction and speed, compromising vehicle stability and manoeuvrability. Marine organisms contend with such conditions by combining proprioceptive feedback with flexible fins and tails to reject disturbances. Inspired by this strategy, we propose soft morphing wings endowed with proprioceptive sensing to mitigate environmental perturbations. The wing's continuous deformation provides a natural means to infer dynamic disturbances: sudden changes in camber directly reflect variations in the oncoming flow. By interpreting this proprioceptive signal, a disturbance observer can reconstruct flow parameters in real time. To enable this, we develop and experimentally validate a dynamic model of a hydraulically actuated soft wing with controllable camber. We then show that curvature-based sensing allows accurate estimation of disturbances in the angle of attack. Finally, we demonstrate that a controller leveraging these proprioceptive estimates can reject disturbances in the lift response of the soft wing. By combining proprioceptive sensing with a disturbance observer, this technique mirrors biological strategies and provides a pathway for soft underwater vehicles to maintain stability in hazardous environments.</description>

Abstract: Acquiring large-scale, high-fidelity robot demonstration data remains a critical bottleneck for scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in dexterous manipulation. We propose a Real-Sim-Real data collection and data editing pipeline that transforms human demonstrations into robot-executable, environment-specific training data without direct robot teleoperation. Standardized data collection rooms are built to capture multimodal human demonstrations (synchronized 3 RGB-D videos, 11 RGB videos, 29-DoF glove joint angles, and 14-channel tactile signals). Based on these human demonstrations, we introduce a tactile-aware retargeting method that maps human hand states to robot dex-hand states via geometry and force-guided optimization. Then the retargeted robot trajectories are rendered in a photorealistic Isaac Sim environment to build robot training data. Real world experiments have demonstrated: (1) The retargeted dex-hand trajectories achieve an 84\% success rate across 10 diverse object manipulation tasks. (2) VLA policies (Pi0.5) trained exclusively on our generated data achieve 80\% average success rate on three representative tasks, i.e., pick-and-place, pushing and pouring. To conclude, robot training data can be efficiently "painted" from human demonstrations using our real-sim-real data pipeline. We offer a scalable, cost-effective alternative to teleoperation with minimal performance loss for complex dexterous manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05346v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions are central to intelligent reasoning and learning abilities, with the interpretation of abstract knowledge guiding meaningful interaction with objects in the environment. While humans readily adapt to novel situations by leveraging abstract knowledge acquired over time, artificial intelligence systems lack principled mechanisms for incorporating abstract knowledge into learning, leading to fundamental challenges in the emergence of intelligent and adaptive behavior. To address this gap, we introduce knowledge-centric metacognitive learning based on three key principles: natural abstractions, knowledge-guided interactions through interpretation, and the composition of interactions for problem solving. Knowledge learning facilitates the acquisition of abstract knowledge and the association of interactions with knowledge, while object interactions guided by abstract knowledge enable the learning of transferable interaction concepts, abstract reasoning, and generalization. This metacognitive mechanism provides a principled approach for integrating knowledge into reinforcement learning and offers a promising pathway toward intelligent and adaptive behavior in artificial intelligence, robotics, and autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Policy Optimization in Robust Constrained MDPs with Iteration Complexity Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constrained decision-making is essential for designing safe policies in real-world control systems, yet simulated environments often fail to capture real-world adversities. We consider the problem of learning a policy that will maximize the cumulative reward while satisfying a constraint, even when there is a mismatch between the real model and an accessible simulator/nominal model. In particular, we consider the robust constrained Markov decision problem (RCMDP) where an agent needs to maximize the reward and satisfy the constraint against the worst possible stochastic model under the uncertainty set centered around an unknown nominal model. Primal-dual methods, effective for standard constrained MDP (CMDP), are not applicable here because of the lack of the strong duality property. Further, one cannot apply the standard robust value-iteration based approach on the composite value function either as the worst case models may be different for the reward value function and the constraint value function. We propose a novel technique that effectively minimizes the constraint value function--to satisfy the constraints; on the other hand, when all the constraints are satisfied, it can simply maximize the robust reward value function. We prove that such an algorithm finds a policy with at most $\epsilon$ sub-optimality and feasible policy after $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. In contrast to the state-of-the-art method, we do not need to employ a binary search, thus, we reduce the computation time by at least 4x for smaller value of discount factor ($\gamma$) and by at least 6x for larger value of $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Neural-Augmented Kelvinlet for Real-Time Soft Tissue Deformation Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of soft-tissue interactions is fundamental for advancing surgical simulation, surgical robotics, and model-based surgical automation. To achieve real-time latency, classical Finite Element Method (FEM) solvers are often replaced with neural approximations; however, naively training such models in a fully data-driven manner without incorporating physical priors frequently leads to poor generalization and physically implausible predictions. We present a novel physics-informed neural simulation framework that enables real-time prediction of soft-tissue deformations under complex single- and multi-grasper interactions. Our approach integrates Kelvinlet-based analytical priors with large-scale FEM data, capturing both linear and nonlinear tissue responses. This hybrid design improves predictive accuracy and physical plausibility across diverse neural architectures while maintaining the low-latency performance required for interactive applications. We validate our method on challenging surgical manipulation tasks involving standard laparoscopic grasping tools, demonstrating substantial improvements in deformation fidelity and temporal stability over existing baselines. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented learning as a principled and computationally efficient paradigm for real-time, physics-aware soft-tissue simulation in surgical AI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots, and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to enable the study of embodied social intelligence at scale. To support these, Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world environments.</description>

      <title>You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of 2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6% $\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code, models, and additional qualitative results can be found on https://mikigom.github.io/YOPO-project-page.</description>

      <title>Collaborative-Online-Learning-Enabled Distributionally Robust Motion Control for Multi-Robot Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel COllaborative-Online-Learning (COOL)-enabled motion control framework for multi-robot systems to avoid collision amid randomly moving obstacles whose motion distributions are partially observable through decentralized data streams. To address the notable challenge of data acquisition due to occlusion, a COOL approach based on the Dirichlet process mixture model is proposed to efficiently extract motion distribution information by exchanging among robots selected learning structures. By leveraging the fine-grained local-moment information learned through COOL, a data-stream-driven ambiguity set for obstacle motion is constructed. We then introduce a novel ambiguity set propagation method, which theoretically admits the derivation of the ambiguity sets for obstacle positions over the entire prediction horizon by utilizing obstacle current positions and the ambiguity set for obstacle motion. Additionally, we develop a compression scheme with its safety guarantee to automatically adjust the complexity and granularity of the ambiguity set by aggregating basic ambiguity sets that are close in a measure space, thereby striking an attractive trade-off between control performance and computation time. Then the probabilistic collision-free trajectories are generated through distributionally robust optimization problems. The distributionally robust obstacle avoidance constraints based on the compressed ambiguity set are equivalently reformulated by deriving separating hyperplanes through tractable semi-definite programming. Finally, we establish the probabilistic collision avoidance guarantee and the long-term tracking performance guarantee for the proposed framework. The numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>SpecPrune-VLA: Accelerating Vision-Language-Action Models via Action-Aware Self-Speculative Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pruning is a typical acceleration technique for compute-bound models by removing computation on unimportant values. Recently, it has been applied to accelerate Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model inference. However, existing acceleration methods focus on local information from the current action step and ignore the global context, leading to &gt;20% success rate drop and limited speedup in some scenarios. In this paper, we point out spatial-temporal consistency in VLA tasks: input images in consecutive steps exhibit high similarity, and propose the key insight that token selection should combine local information with global context of the model. Based on this, we propose SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free, two-level pruning method with heuristic control. (1) Action-level static pruning. We leverage global history and local attention to statically reduce visual tokens per action. (2) Layer-level dynamic pruning. We prune tokens adaptively per layer based on layer-wise importance. (3) Lightweight action-aware controller: We classify actions as coarse- or fine-grained by the speed of the end effector and adjust pruning aggressiveness accordingly. Extensive experiments show that SpecPrune-VLA achieves up to 1.57$\times$ speedup in LIBERO simulation and 1.70$\times$ on real-world tasks, with negligible success rate degradation.</description>

      <title>CoBEVMoE: Heterogeneity-aware Feature Fusion with Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collaborative perception aims to extend sensing coverage and improve perception accuracy by sharing information among multiple agents. However, due to differences in viewpoints and spatial positions, agents often acquire heterogeneous observations. Existing intermediate fusion methods primarily focus on aligning similar features, often overlooking the perceptual diversity among agents. To address this limitation, we propose CoBEVMoE, a novel collaborative perception framework that operates in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space and incorporates a Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (DMoE) architecture. In DMoE, each expert is dynamically generated based on the input features of a specific agent, enabling it to extract distinctive and reliable cues while attending to shared semantics. This design allows the fusion process to explicitly model both feature similarity and heterogeneity across agents. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Expert Metric Loss (DEML) to enhance inter-expert diversity and improve the discriminability of the fused representation. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V and DAIR-V2X-C datasets demonstrate that CoBEVMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, it improves the IoU for Camera-based BEV segmentation by +1.5% on OPV2V and the AP@0.5 for LiDAR-based 3D object detection by +3.0% on DAIR-V2X-C, verifying the effectiveness of expert-based heterogeneous feature modeling in multi-agent collaborative perception. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/godk0509/CoBEVMoE.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21464</link>

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however, constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves 273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x), ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward practical V2X deployment.</description>

      <title>RAP: 3D Rasterization Augmented End-to-End Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning for end-to-end driving trains policies only on expert demonstrations. Once deployed in a closed loop, such policies lack recovery data: small mistakes cannot be corrected and quickly compound into failures. A promising direction is to generate alternative viewpoints and trajectories beyond the logged path. Prior work explores photorealistic digital twins via neural rendering or game engines, but these methods are prohibitively slow and costly, and thus mainly used for evaluation. In this work, we argue that photorealism is unnecessary for training end-to-end planners. What matters is semantic fidelity and scalability: driving depends on geometry and dynamics, not textures or lighting. Motivated by this, we propose 3D Rasterization, which replaces costly rendering with lightweight rasterization of annotated primitives, enabling augmentations such as counterfactual recovery maneuvers and cross-agent view synthesis. To transfer these synthetic views effectively to real-world deployment, we introduce a Raster-to-Real feature-space alignment that bridges the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components form Rasterization Augmented Planning (RAP), a scalable data augmentation pipeline for planning. RAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop robustness and long-tail generalization, ranking first on four major benchmarks: NAVSIM v1/v2, Waymo Open Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving, and Bench2Drive. Our results show that lightweight rasterization with feature alignment suffices to scale E2E training, offering a practical alternative to photorealistic rendering.

      <title>Through the Perspective of LiDAR: A Feature-Enriched and Uncertainty-Aware Annotation Pipeline for Terrestrial Point Cloud Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point clouds is limited by costly manual annotation. We propose a semi-automated, uncertainty-aware pipeline that integrates spherical projection, feature enrichment, ensemble learning, and targeted annotation to reduce labeling effort, while sustaining high accuracy. Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D spherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an ensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty maps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions. The 2D outputs are back-projected to 3D, yielding densely annotated point clouds supported by a three-tier visualization suite (2D feature maps, 3D colorized point clouds, and compact virtual spheres) for rapid triage and reviewer guidance. Using this pipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove forests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address two key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which features matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12 annotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact nine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76. Finally, we confirm the generalization of our feature-enrichment strategy through cross-dataset tests on ForestSemantic and Semantic3D.
  Our contributions include: (i) a robust, uncertainty-aware TLS annotation pipeline with visualization tools; (ii) the Mangrove3D dataset; and (iii) empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance, thus enabling scalable, high-quality segmentation of TLS point clouds for ecological monitoring and beyond. The dataset and processing scripts are publicly available at https://fz-rit.github.io/through-the-lidars-eye/.</description>

      <title>Constructing the Umwelt: Cognitive Planning through Belief-Intent Co-Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper challenges a prevailing epistemological assumption in End-to-End Autonomous Driving: that high-performance planning necessitates high-fidelity world reconstruction. Inspired by cognitive science, we propose the Mental Bayesian Causal World Model (MBCWM) and instantiate it as the Tokenized Intent World Model (TIWM), a novel cognitive computing architecture. Its core philosophy posits that intelligence emerges not from pixel-level objective fidelity, but from the Cognitive Consistency between the agent's internal intentional world and physical reality. By synthesizing von Uexk\"ull's $\textit{Umwelt}$ theory, the neural assembly hypothesis, and the triple causal model (integrating symbolic deduction, probabilistic induction, and force dynamics) into an end-to-end embodied planning system, we demonstrate the feasibility of this paradigm on the nuPlan benchmark. Experimental results in open-loop validation confirm that our Belief-Intent Co-Evolution mechanism effectively enhances planning performance. Crucially, in closed-loop simulations, the system exhibits emergent human-like cognitive behaviors, including map affordance understanding, free exploration, and self-recovery strategies. We identify Cognitive Consistency as the core learning mechanism: during long-term training, belief (state understanding) and intent (future prediction) spontaneously form a self-organizing equilibrium through implicit computational replay, achieving semantic alignment between internal representations and physical world affordances. TIWM offers a neuro-symbolic, cognition-first alternative to reconstruction-based planners, establishing a new direction: planning as active understanding, not passive reaction.</description>

      <title>CostNav: A Navigation Benchmark for Real-World Economic-Cost Evaluation of Physical AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While current navigation benchmarks prioritize task success in simplified settings, they neglect the multidimensional economic constraints essential for the real-world commercialization of autonomous delivery systems. We introduce CostNav, an Economic Navigation Benchmark that evaluates physical AI agents through comprehensive economic cost-revenue analysis aligned with real-world business operations. By integrating industry-standard data - such as SEC filings and AIS injury reports - with Isaac Sim's detailed collision and cargo dynamics, CostNav transcends simple task completion to accurately evaluate business value in complex, real-world scenarios. To our knowledge, CostNav is the first work to quantitatively expose the gap between navigation research metrics and commercial viability, revealing that optimizing for task success on a simplified task fundamentally differs from optimizing for real-world economic deployment. Our evaluation of rule-based Nav2 navigation shows that current approaches are not economically viable: the contribution margin is -22.81/run (AMCL) and -12.87/run (GPS), resulting in no break-even point. We challenge the community to develop navigation policies that achieve economic viability on CostNav. We remain method-agnostic, evaluating success solely on the metric of cost rather than the underlying architecture. All resources are available at https://github.com/worv-ai/CostNav.</description>

      <title>GrndCtrl: Grounding World Models via Self-Supervised Reward Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in video world modeling have enabled large-scale generative models to simulate embodied environments with high visual fidelity, providing strong priors for prediction, planning, and control. Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and stability. We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.</description>

      <title>MomaGraph: State-Aware Unified Scene Graphs with Vision-Language Model for Embodied Task Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile manipulators in households must both navigate and manipulate. This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models, reaching 71.6% accuracy on the benchmark (+11.4% over the best baseline), while generalizing across public benchmarks and transferring effectively to real-robot experiments.</description>

      <title>A Review of Online Diffusion Policy RL Algorithms for Scalable Robotic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion policies have emerged as a powerful approach for robotic control, demonstrating superior expressiveness in modeling multimodal action distributions compared to conventional policy networks. However, their integration with online reinforcement learning remains challenging due to fundamental incompatibilities between diffusion model training objectives and standard RL policy improvement mechanisms. This paper presents the first comprehensive review and empirical analysis of current Online Diffusion Policy Reinforcement Learning (Online DPRL) algorithms for scalable robotic control systems. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing approaches into four distinct families--Action-Gradient, Q-Weighting, Proximity-Based, and Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) methods--based on their policy improvement mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on a unified NVIDIA Isaac Lab benchmark encompassing 12 diverse robotic tasks, we systematically evaluate representative algorithms across five critical dimensions: task diversity, parallelization capability, diffusion step scalability, cross-embodiment generalization, and environmental robustness. Our analysis identifies key findings regarding the fundamental trade-offs inherent in each algorithmic family, particularly concerning sample efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we reveal critical computational and algorithmic bottlenecks that currently limit the practical deployment of online DPRL. Based on these findings, we provide concrete guidelines for algorithm selection tailored to specific operational constraints and outline promising future research directions to advance the field toward more general and scalable robotic learning systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safe exploration is a key requirement for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn and adapt online, beyond controlled (e.g. simulated) environments. In this work, we tackle this challenge by utilizing suboptimal yet conservative policies (e.g., obtained from offline data or simulators) as priors. Our approach, SOOPER, uses probabilistic dynamics models to optimistically explore, yet pessimistically fall back to the conservative policy prior if needed. We prove that SOOPER guarantees safety throughout learning, and establish convergence to an optimal policy by bounding its cumulative regret. Extensive experiments on key safe RL benchmarks and real-world hardware demonstrate that SOOPER is scalable, outperforms the state-of-the-art and validate our theoretical guarantees in practice.</description>

      <title>Aligning Microscopic Vehicle and Macroscopic Traffic Statistics: Reconstructing Driving Behavior from Partial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A driving algorithm that aligns with good human driving practices, or at the very least collaborates effectively with human drivers, is crucial for developing safe and efficient autonomous vehicles. In practice, two main approaches are commonly adopted: (i) supervised or imitation learning, which requires comprehensive naturalistic driving data capturing all states that influence a vehicle's decisions and corresponding actions, and (ii) reinforcement learning (RL), where the simulated driving environment either matches or is intentionally more challenging than real-world conditions. Both methods depend on high-quality observations of real-world driving behavior, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. State-of-the-art sensors on individual vehicles can gather microscopic data, but they lack context about the surrounding conditions. Conversely, roadside sensors can capture traffic flow and other macroscopic characteristics, but they cannot associate this information with individual vehicles on a microscopic level. Motivated by this complementarity, we propose a framework that reconstructs unobserved microscopic states from macroscopic observations, using microscopic data to anchor observed vehicle behaviors, and learns a shared policy whose behavior is microscopically consistent with the partially observed trajectories and actions and macroscopically aligned with target traffic statistics when deployed population-wide. Such constrained and regularized policies promote realistic flow patterns and safe coordination with human drivers at scale.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) using Koopman Operator Theory for Quadrotor Trajectory Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in solving complex sequential decision-making problems. However, its application to safety-critical physical systems remains constrained by the lack of stability guarantees. Standard RL algorithms prioritize reward maximization, often yielding policies that may induce oscillations or unbounded state divergence. There has been significant work in incorporating Lyapunov-based stability guarantees in RL algorithms with key challenges being selecting a candidate Lyapunov function, computational complexity by using excessive function approximators and conservative policies by incorporating stability criterion in the learning process. In this work we propose a novel Lyapunov-constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) algorithm using Koopman operator theory. We propose use of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to produce a linear approximation of the system and use this approximation to derive a closed form solution for candidate Lyapunov function. This derived Lyapunov function is incorporated in the SAC algorithm to further provide guarantees for a policy that stabilizes the nonlinear system. The results are evaluated trajectory tracking of a 2D Quadrotor environment based on safe-control-gym. The proposed algorithm shows training convergence and decaying violations for Lyapunov stability criterion compared to baseline vanilla SAC algorithm.

      <title>Beware Untrusted Simulators -- Reward-Free Backdoor Attacks in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulated environments are a key piece in the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL), allowing practitioners and researchers to train decision making agents without running expensive experiments on real hardware. Simulators remain a security blind spot, however, enabling adversarial developers to alter the dynamics of their released simulators for malicious purposes. Therefore, in this work we highlight a novel threat, demonstrating how simulator dynamics can be exploited to stealthily implant action-level backdoors into RL agents. The backdoor then allows an adversary to reliably activate targeted actions in an agent upon observing a predefined ``trigger'', leading to potentially dangerous consequences. Traditional backdoor attacks are limited in their strong threat models, assuming the adversary has near full control over an agent's training pipeline, enabling them to both alter and observe agent's rewards. As these assumptions are infeasible to implement within a simulator, we propose a new attack ``Daze'' which is able to reliably and stealthily implant backdoors into RL agents trained for real world tasks without altering or even observing their rewards. We provide formal proof of Daze's effectiveness in guaranteeing attack success across general RL tasks along with extensive empirical evaluations on both discrete and continuous action space domains. We additionally provide the first example of RL backdoor attacks transferring to real, robotic hardware. These developments motivate further research into securing all components of the RL training pipeline to prevent malicious attacks.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Waypoint-Action Gap in End-to-End Autonomous Driving via Vehicle Motion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E-AD) systems are typically grouped by the nature of their outputs: (i) waypoint-based models that predict a future trajectory, and (ii) action-based models that directly output throttle, steer and brake. Most recent benchmark protocols and training pipelines are waypoint-based, which makes action-based policies harder to train and compare, slowing their progress. To bridge this waypoint-action gap, we propose a novel, differentiable vehicle-model framework that rolls out predicted action sequences to their corresponding ego-frame waypoint trajectories while supervising in waypoint space. Our approach enables action-based architectures to be trained and evaluated, for the first time, within waypoint-based benchmarks without modifying the underlying evaluation protocol. We extensively evaluate our framework across multiple challenging benchmarks and observe consistent improvements over the baselines. In particular, on NAVSIM \texttt{navhard} our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</description>
