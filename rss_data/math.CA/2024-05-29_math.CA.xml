      <title>On universal sign patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider polynomials $Q:=\sum _{j=0}^da_jx^j$, $a_j\in \mathbb{R}^*$, with all roots real. When the {\em sign pattern} $\sigma (Q):=({\rm sgn}(a_d),{\rm sgn}(a_{d-1})$, $\ldots$, ${\rm sgn}(a_0))$ has $\tilde{c}$ sign changes, the polynomial $Q$ has $\tilde{c}$ positive and $d-\tilde{c}$ negative roots. We suppose the moduli of these roots distinct. The {\em order} of these moduli is defined when in their string as points of the positive half-axis one marks the places of the moduli of negative roots. A sign pattern $\sigma^0$ is {\em universal} when for any possible order of the moduli there exists a polynomial $Q$ with $\sigma (Q)=\sigma^0$ and with this order of the moduli of its roots. We show that when the polynomial $P_{m,n}:=(x-1)^m(x+1)^n$ has no vanishing coefficients, the sign pattern $\sigma (P_{m,n})$ is universal. We also study the question when $P_{m,n}$ can have vanishing coefficients.</description>

      <title>Brenke polynomials with real zeros and the Riemann Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $A(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nz^n$ and $B(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_nz^n$ are two formal power series, with $a_n,b_n\in \mathbb{R}$, the polynomials $(p_n)_n$ defined by the generating function $$ A(z)B(xz)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty p_n(x)z^n $$ are called the Brenke polynomials generated by $A$ and associated to $B$. We say that $A\in \mathcal{R}_B$ if the Brenke polynomials $(p_n)_n$ have only real zeros. Among other results, in this paper we find necessary and sufficient conditions on $B$ such that $\mathcal{R}_B=\mathcal{L}\text{-}\mathcal{P}$, where $\mathcal{L}\text{-}\mathcal{P}$ denotes the Laguerre-P\'olya class (of entire functions). These results can be considered an extension to Brenke polynomials of the Jensen, and P\'olya and Schur characterization $\mathcal{R}_{e^z}=\mathcal{L}\text{-}\mathcal{P}$, for Appell polynomials. When applying our results to a relative of the Riemann zeta function, we find new equivalencies for the Riemann Hypothesis in terms of real-rootedness of some sequences of Brenke polynomials.</description>

      <title>Weighted Sonine conditions and application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sonine kernel described by the classical Sonine condition of convolution form is an important class of kernels used in integral equations and nonlocal differential equations. This work extends this idea to introduce weighted Sonine conditions where the non-convolutional weight functions accommodate the inhomogeneity in practical applications. We characterize tight relations between classical Sonine condition and its weighted versions, which indicates that the non-degenerate weight functions may not introduce significant changes on the set of Sonine kernels. To demonstrate the application of weighted Sonine conditions, we employ them to derive equivalent but more feasible formulations of weighted integral equations and nonlocal differential equations to prove their well-posedness, and discuss possible application to corresponding partial differential equation models.</description>

      <title>On reverse Markov-Nikol'skii inequalities for polynomials with restricted zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Pi_n$ be the class of algebraic polynomials $P$ of degree $n$, all of whose zeros lie on the segment $[-1,1]$. In 1995, S.P. Zhou has proved the following Tur\'{a}n type reverse Markov-Nikol'skii inequality: $\|P'\|_{L_p[-1,1]}&gt;c\, {(\sqrt{n})}^{1-1/p+1/q}\, \|P\|_{L_q[-1,1]}$, $P\in \Pi_n$, where $0&lt;p\le q\le \infty$, $1-1/p+1/q\ge 0$ ($c&gt;0$ is a constant independent of $P$ and $n$). We show that Zhou's estimate remains true in the case $p=\infty$, $q&gt;1$. Some of related Tur\'{a}n type inequalities are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Waves from Finite Sources Arranged in Line Segments within an Infinite Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the propagation of time harmonic waves through a two-dimensional triangular lattice with sources located on line segments. Specifically, we investigate the discrete Helmholtz equation with a wavenumber $k \in \left( 0,2\sqrt{2} \right)$, where input data is prescribed on finite rows or columns of lattice sites. We focus on two main questions: the efficacy of the numerical methods employed in evaluating the Green's function, and the necessity of the cone condition. Consistent with a continuum theory, we employ the notion of radiating solution and establish a unique solvability result and Green's representation formula using difference potentials. Finally, we propose a numerical computation method and demonstrate its efficiency through examples related to the propagation problems in the left-handed 2D inductor-capacitor metamaterial.</description>

      <title>Full Asymptotic Expansion of Monodromy Data for the First Painlev\'{e} Transcendent: Applications to Connection Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the full asymptotic expansion of the monodromy data ({\it i.e.}, Stokes multipliers) for the first Painlev\'{e} transcendent (PI) with large initial data or large pole parameters. Our primary approach involves refining the complex WKB method, also known as the method of uniform asymptotics, to approximate the second-order ODEs derived from PI's Lax pair with higher-order accuracy. As an application, we provide a rigorous proof of the full asymptotic expansion of the nonlinear eigenvalues proposed numerically by Bender, Komijani, and Wang. Additionally, we present the full asymptotic expansion for the pole parameters $(p_{n}, H_{n})$ corresponding to the $n$-th pole of the real tritronqu\'{e}e solution of the PI equation as $n \to +\infty$.</description>

      <title>The Fourier spectrum and sumset type problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study the \emph{Fourier spectrum} which is a continuously parametrised family of dimensions living between the Fourier dimension and the Hausdorff dimension for both sets and measures. We establish some fundamental theory and motivate the concept via several applications, especially to sumset type problems. For example, we study dimensions of convolutions and sumsets, and solve the distance set problem for sets satisfying certain Fourier analytic conditions.</description>

      <title>Resonance between planar self-affine measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05240v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if $\lbrace \varphi_i\rbrace_{i\in \Gamma}$ and $\lbrace \psi_j\rbrace_{j\in\Lambda}$ are self-affine iterated function systems on the plane that satisfy strong separation, domination and irreducibility, then for any associated self-affine measures $\mu$ and $\nu$, the inequality $$\dim_{\rm H}(\mu*\nu) &lt; \min \lbrace 2, \dim_{\rm H} \mu + \dim_{\rm H} \nu \rbrace$$ implies that there is algebraic resonance between the eigenvalues of the linear parts of $\varphi_i$ and $\psi_j$. This extends to planar non-conformal setting the existing analogous results for self-conformal measures on the line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses parabolic reverse H\"older inequalities and their connections to parabolic Muckenhoupt weights. The main result gives several characterizations for this class of weights. There are challenging features related to the parabolic geometry and the time lag, for example, in covering and chaining arguments. We also prove a Gehring type self-improving property for parabolic reverse H\"older inequalities.</description>

      <title>Fourier decay of product measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can one characterise the Fourier decay of a product measure in terms of the Fourier decay of its marginals? We make inroads on this question by describing the Fourier spectrum of a product measure in terms of the Fourier spectrum of its marginals. The Fourier spectrum is a continuously parametrised family of dimensions living between the Fourier and Hausdorff dimensions and captures more Fourier analytic information than either dimension considered in isolation. We provide several examples and applications, including to Kakeya and Furstenberg sets. In the process we derive novel Fourier analytic characterisations of the upper and lower box dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes are a slightly enlarged version of my habilitation thesis, where our research interest and main results in the past few years are summarized. Most of the discussion revolves around complex ordinary differential equations and their underling foliations, singularity theory and dynamical systems. Compared to the original text, a section containing some background material on holomorphic foliations was added. Also some new results obtained in the past three years that are in line with the one presented in the habilitation were included.</description>

      <title>Two-level adiabatic transition probability for small avoided crossings generated by tangential intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the asymptotic behaviors of the transition probability for two-level avoided crossings are studied under the limit where two parameters (adiabatic parameter and energy gap parameter) tend to zero. This is a continuation of our previous works where avoided crossings are generated by tangential intersections and obey a non-adiabatic regime. The main results elucidate not only the asymptotic expansion of transition probability but also a quantum interference caused by several avoided crossings and a coexistence of two-parameter regimes arising from different vanishing orders.</description>
