      <title>The spectral extrema of graphs of odd size forbidding $H(4,3)$ beyond the book graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is said to be $H$-free if it does not contain a subgraph isomorphic to $H$. The fish graph, denoted by $H(4, 3)$, is a $6-$vertex graph obtained from a cycle of length $4$ and a triangle by sharing a common vertex. Earlier it is shown that $\lambda(G)\leq \frac{1+\sqrt{4m-3}}{2}$ holds for all $H(4,3)-$free graphs of odd size $m\geq 44,$ and the equality holds if and only if $G\cong S_{\frac{m+3}{2},2},$ where $S_{\frac{m+3}{2},2}$ is the $m-$edge book graph $K_2 \vee \frac{m-1}{2}K_1,$ where $K_2 \vee \frac{m-1}{2}K_1,$ denotes the join of $K_2$ and $\frac{m-1}{2}K_1.$ Let $\mathcal{G}(m,H(4,3))$ denote the family of $H(4,3)$-free graphs with $m$ edges and no isolated vertices. We write $ \mathcal{G}(m,H(4,3)) \setminus \left\{ K_2 \vee \tfrac{m-1}{2}K_1 \right\} $ for the corresponding subfamily obtained by excluding the book graph. In this paper, we establish a sharp upper bound on the spectral radius of graphs over $\mathcal{G}(m,H(4,3))\setminus \{K_2 \vee \frac{m-1}{2}K_1\}$ for odd $m\geq 58$ and characterize the unique extremal graph attaining this bound.</description>

      <title>Strong edge-coloring of sparse graphs with Ore-degree 7 or 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a strong edge-coloring of a graph $G=(V,E)$, any two edges of distance at most $2$ get distinct colors. The strong chromatic index of $G$, denoted by $\chi_s'(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed in a strong edge-coloring of $G$. The Ore-degree of $G$ is defined by $\max\{d(u)+d(v):uv\in E\}$. In this paper, we apply the discharging method and make use of Hall's marriage theorem to prove two results toward a conjecture by Chen et al. First, we prove that if $G$ is a graph with Ore-degree $7$ and maximum average degree less than $\frac{34}{11}$, then $\chi_s'(G)\le 13$. This result improves the previous best bound from $\frac{40}{13}$ to $\frac{34}{11}$. Second, we prove that if $G$ is a graph with Ore-degree $8$ and maximum average degree less than $\frac{113}{31}$, then $\chi_s'(G)\le 20$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on a theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Szemer\'{e}di</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a real $\varepsilon&gt;0$, an edge-coloring of $G$ is called \textit{$\varepsilon$-balanced} if each color appears on at least an $\varepsilon$-fraction of the edges in $G$. A classical result of Erd\H{o}s and Szemer\'{e}di asserts that if a $2$-edge-coloring of a complete graph $K_n$ is not $\varepsilon$-balanced for some $0&lt;\varepsilon\leq1/2$, then there exists a large monochromatic clique. This theorem has been used extensively in Ramsey-type arguments, as it allows one to focus on reasonably balanced colorings. However, in its original formulation the dependence between $n$ and $\varepsilon$ was left implicit, occasionally leading to inaccurate applications. In this short note, we revisit the Erd\H{o}s--Szemer\'{e}di theorem and specify all parameter dependencies.</description>

      <title>Subgroup perfect codes of $ S_n $ in Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perfect code in a graph $\Gamma = (V, E)$ is a subset $C$ of $V$ such that no two vertices in $C$ are adjacent and every vertex in $V \setminus C$ is adjacent to exactly one vertex in $C$. A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a subgroup perfect code of $G$ if there exists a Cayley graph of $G$ which admits $H$ as a perfect code. In this work, we present a classification of cyclic 2-subgroup perfect codes in $ S_n$. We analyze these subgroup codes, detailing their structure and properties. We extend our discussion to various classes of subgroup codes in the symmetric group $ S_n $, encompassing both commutative and non-commutative cases. We provide numerous examples to illustrate and support our findings.</description>

      <title>Matchings: Source, Goal and Faithful Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matchings were among the earliest motivations for graph theory. They subsequently remained a central goal, inspiring the development of new tools that went well beyond problems directly concerning matchings.
  These tools proved widely applicable, accompanying the growth of graph theory over the past century. A legendary milestone in this trajectory is W. T. Tutte, "The factorization of linear graphs," J. Lond. Math. Soc. (1), 22, no. 2, (1947), 107-111, which firmly embedded graph theory through matchings into the body of classical mathematics, in particular, linear algebra and polynomials.
  In this note we revisit this article presenting its original content, sketching some aspects of its impact until some recent progress, and trace one of its subsequent lines of development finally leading to a new contribution answering an open challenge and extending known results.</description>

      <title>Forest Polynomials and Pattern Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forest polynomials, recently introduced by Nadeau and Tewari, can be thought of as a quasisymmetric analogue for Schubert polynomials. They have already been shown to exhibit interesting interactions with Schubert polynomials; for example, Schubert polynomials decompose positively into forest polynomials. We further describe this relationship by showing that a Schubert polynomial $\mathfrak{S}_w$ is a forest polynomial exactly when $w$ avoids a set of $6$ patterns. This result adds to the long list of properties of Schubert polynomials that are controlled by pattern avoidance.</description>

      <title>Steganographic information hiding via symmetric numerical semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a steganographic information hiding scheme based on structural properties of numerical semigroups arising from the Frobenius coin problem. Instead of encoding data through representable integers, the proposed protocol embeds information into the gap structure of carefully chosen symmetric numerical semigroups. Symmetry guarantees a balanced gap density, ensuring that encoded values are statistically indistinguishable from uniform numerical noise to an observer lacking the private generating set. The security of the scheme relies on the assumed average-case hardness of numerical semigroup membership inference for hidden generators, offering a novel number-theoretic primitive for covert communication and post-quantum resilient information hiding.</description>

      <title>Subgraph discrepancies in the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a 2-edge-coloring $f : E(K_n) \rightarrow \{\pm 1\}$, the discrepancy of a subgraph $F \subseteq K_n$ is defined as $\left| \sum_{e \in E(F)} f(e) \right|$. Erd\H{o}s, F\"uredi, Loebl and S\'os showed that if $F$ is an $n$-vertex tree with maximum degree at most $(1-\varepsilon)n$, then every 2-coloring of $K_n$ has a copy of $F$ with discrepancy $\Omega(\varepsilon)n$. We extend this result by showing that the same conclusion holds for every $n$-vertex graph with maximum degree at most $(1-\varepsilon)n$ and no isolated vertices. We also show that for every $d$-regular $n$-vertex graph $F$ with $d \leq (1-\varepsilon)n$, every 2-coloring of $K_n$ has a copy of $F$ with discrepancy $\Omega(\sqrt{\varepsilon d}) \cdot n$. The dependence on $d$ and $n$ is best possible.
  Finally, we consider specific graphs $F$, namely $K_r$-factors and 2-factors. For each such graph $F$, we determine the optimal constant $\lambda$ such that every 2-coloring of $K_n$ has a copy of $F$ with discrepancy at least $(\lambda + o(1))n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04080v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study polymatroids that are representable by means of linear restricted rank-metric codes, namely, by subspaces of the space of alternating, symmetric, or Hermitian square matrices endowed with the rank metric. More precisely, we characterize the rank function defining these polymatroids and establish sufficient conditions on the relevant parameters under which it is fully determined. We show that there are several differences in compared to the behaviour of $q$-polymatroids of unrestricted matrix codes.</description>

      <title>Path homology of circulant digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We organize and extend a set of computations and structural observations about the Grigoryan--Lin--Muranov--Yau (GLMY) path complex of circulant digraphs $\vec{C}_n^S$ and circulant graphs $C_n^S$. Using the shift automorphism $\tau$ and a Fourier decomposition, we reduce many rank computations for the GLMY boundary maps to finite-dimensional $\tau$-eigenspaces. This provides a reusable "symbol-matrix" recipe that highlights (i) the dependence on prime versus composite $n$ and (ii) stability phenomena for certain natural choices of connection sets $S$. Several fully worked examples are included, together with a discussion of how the additive structure of $S$ governs low-dimensional chains and Betti numbers.</description>

      <title>The uniform asymptotics for real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification II: lower bounds and asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second of two papers on the uniform asymptotics for real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification. Using the modified tropical correspondence theorem established in the first paper of this series, we introduce a combinatorial invariant that serves as a lower bound for real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification. We derive a uniform lower bound for the large-degree and large-genus logarithmic asymptotics of these combinatorial invariants. This uniform lower bound yields the following results: (1) We establish a uniform lower bound for the large-degree and large-genus logarithmic asymptotics of real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification and their complex analogues. In particular, we provide a partial answer to an open question proposed by Dubrovin, Yang and Zagier on the uniform bound for simple Hurwitz numbers. (2) We prove logarithmic equivalence between real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification and their complex analogues as the degree tends to infinity and only simple branch points are added. (3) As the genus tends to infinity and only simple branch points are added, we show that the logarithms of real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification and their complex analogues are of the same order.</description>

      <title>Distance spectral radius conditions for perfect $k$-matching, generalized factor-criticality (bicriticality) and $k$-$d$-criticality of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple connected graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. A $k$-matching of a graph $G$ is a function $f:E(G)\rightarrow \{0,1,\ldots, k\}$ satisfying
  $\sum_{e \in E_G(v)} f(e) \leq k$ for every vertex $v \in V(G)$, where $E_G(v)$ is the set of edges incident with $v$ in $G$. A $k$-matching of a graph $G$ is perfect if
  $
  \sum_{e \in E_G(v) } f(e) = k
  $
  for any vertex $v \in V(G)$. The $k$-Berge-Tutte-formula of a graph $G$ is defined as:
  \[
  \defk(G) = \max_{S \subseteq V(G)}
  \begin{cases}
  k \cdot i(G - S) - k|S|, &amp; k \text{ is even;} \\[6pt]
  \odd(G - S) + k \cdot i(G - S) - k|S|, &amp; k \text{ is odd.}
  \end{cases}
  \]
  A $k$-barrier of the graph $G$ is the subset $S \subseteq V(G)$ that reaches the maximum value in $k$-Berge-Tutte-formula. A connected graph \( G \) of odd (even) order is a {generalized factor-critical (generalized bicritical) graph about integer \( k \)-matching}, abbreviated as a \( \mathrm{GFC}_k (\mathrm{GBC}_k)\) graph, if $\emptyset$ is a unique $k$-barrier. When $k$ is odd, let \( 1 \leq d \leq k \) and \( |V(G)| \equiv d \pmod{2} \). If for any \( v \in V(G) \), there exists a \( k \)-matching \( h \) such that
  $\sum_{e \in E_G(v)} h(e) = k - d$ {and} $\sum_{e \in E_G(u)} h(e) = k$ for any \( u \in V(G) - \{v\} \), then \( G \) is said to be \( k \)-\( d \)-critical.
  In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions in terms of distance spectral radius to ensure that a graph has a perfect $k$-matching and a graph is \( k \)-\( d \)-critical, $\mathrm{GFC}_k$ or $\mathrm{GBC}_k$, respectively.</description>

      <title>On oriented Tur\'an problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oriented Tur\'{a}n number of a given oriented graph $\overrightarrow{F}$, denoted by $\exo(n,\overrightarrow{F})$, is the largest number of arcs in $n$-vertex $\overrightarrow{F}$-free oriented graphs. This concept could be seen as an oriented version of the classical Tur\'{a}n number.
  In this paper, we first prove several propositions that give exact results for several oriented graphs. In particular, we determine all exact values of $\exo(n,\overrightarrow{F})$ for every oriented graph $\overrightarrow{F}$ with at most three arcs and sufficiently large $n$. After that, we prove a stability result and use it to determine the Tur\'an number of an orientation of $C_4$. Finally, we prove oriented versions of the random zooming theorem by Fern\'andez, Hyde, Liu, Pikhurko and Wu and the almost regular subgraph theorem by Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits, and use them to obtain an oriented version of the F\"{u}redi-Alon-Krivelevich-Sudakov Theorem, which generalizes the famous KST Theorem.</description>

      <title>On spectral conditions for fractional $k$-extendable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fractional matching of a graph $G$ is a function $h: E(G) \to [0,1]$ such that $\sum_{e \in E_G(v)} h(e) \leq 1$ for every vertex $v \in V(G)$, where $E_G(v)$ is the set of edges incident to $v$. If $\sum_{e \in E_G(v)} h(e) = 1$ for all $v$, then $h$ is a fractional perfect matching. A graph $G$ is fractional $k$-extendable if it has a matching of size $k$ and every $k$-matching $M$ in $G$ is contained in a fractional perfect matching $h$ such that $h(e)=1$ for every $e \in M$. In this paper, we establish new sufficient conditions for a graph with minimum degree $\delta$ to be fractional $k$-extendable. Our main results provide spectral guarantees for this property based on the distance spectral radius and the signless Laplacian spectral radius.</description>

      <title>Colored interlacing triangles and Genocchi medians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colored interlacing triangles, introduced by Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler (2024), provide the combinatorial framework for the Central Limit Theorem for probability measures arising from the Lascoux-Leclerc-Thibon (LLT) polynomials. Colored interlacing triangles depend on two key parameters: the number of colors $n$ and the depth of the triangle $N$. Recent work of Gaetz-Gao (2025) connects these objects to Schubert calculus and resolves the enumeration for $n=3$ and arbitrary depth $N$. However, the enumerative behavior for general $n$ has remained open.
  In this paper, we analyze the complementary regime: fixed depth $N=2$ and arbitrary number of colors $n$. We prove that in this setting, colored interlacing triangles are in bijection with Dumont derangements, identifying their enumeration with the Genocchi medians. This connects the probabilistic model to a rich hierarchy of classical combinatorial objects.
  Furthermore, we introduce a $q$-deformation of this enumeration arising naturally from the LLT transition energy. This yields new $q$-analogs of the Genocchi medians. Finally, we present computational results and sampling algorithms for colored interlacing triangles with higher $N$ or $n$, which suggests the limits of combinatorial tractability in the $(N,n)$ parameter space.</description>

      <title>The optimal chromatic bound for even-hole-free graphs without induced seven-vertex paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of even-hole-free graphs has been extensively studied on its own and on its relation to perfect graphs. In this paper, we study the $\chi$-boundedness of even-hole-free graphs which itself is an important topic in graph theory. In particular, we prove that every even-hole-free graph $G$ without induced 7-vertex paths satisfies $\chi(G)\le \lceil\frac{5}{4}\omega(G)\rceil$, where $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$, respectively. This bound is optimal. Our result strictly extends the result of Karthick and Maffary \cite{KM19} on even-hole-free graphs without induced 6-vertex paths, and implies that even-hole-free graphs without induced 7-vertex paths satisfy Reed's Conjecture. Our proof relies on a heavy structural analysis on a maximal substructure called a nice blowup of a five-cycle and can be viewed for graphs in which all holes are of length five (graphs with all holes having the same length gain increasing interest in recent years \cite{COOK202496}). Our result gives a partial answer to a conjecture of Wang and Wu \cite{WW25} on graphs in which all holes are of length 5. One of the key technical ingredients is a technical lemma proved via clique cutset argument combined with the idea of Infinite Descent Method (often used in number theory).</description>

      <title>New upper bounds for the period of a negative orientable sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative orientable sequences, i.e. periodic sequences with elements from a finite alphabet of size at least three in which an n-tuple or the negative of its reverse appears at most once in a period of the sequence, were introduced by Alhakim et al. in 2024. The main goal in defining them was as a means of generating orientable sequences, which have automatic position location applications, although they are potentially of interest in their own right. In this paper we develop new upper bounds on the period of negative orientable sequences, which are significantly sharper then the previous known bound for n&gt;2. The approach used to develop the new bounds involves examining the nodes in the subgraph of the de Bruijn graph corresponding to a negative orientable sequence, and to consider the implications of the fact that the in-degree of every vertex in this subgraph must equal the out-degree. However, despite improving the bounds, a gap remains between the largest known period for a negative orientable sequence and the corresponding bounds for every n&gt;2.</description>

      <title>Basis Criteria for Extending Generalized Splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity and $G$ a graph. Extending generalized splines are a further extension of generalized splines by allowing vertex labels of $G$ to lie in varying modules rather than in a fixed ring $R$. Geometrically, this corresponds to the construction of equivariant cohomology by Braden and MacPherson (see [5]). Therefore, characterizing such splines has immediate implications in geometry, particularly in the computation of equivariant cohomology.
  In this paper, we study extending generalized splines as a $R$- module in which each vertex $v$ is labeled by $M_v = m_v R$ and each edge $e$ is labeled by $M_e = R/r_e R$ together with quotient $R$-module homomorphisms $M_v\to M_e$ for each vertex $v$ incident to the edge $e$, where $R$ is a greatest common divisor domain (GCD). We characterize module bases of such splines in terms of determinants so that it provides a criterion for freeness of spline modules.</description>

      <title>A matrix approach to the structure, enumeration, and applications of partially ordered sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a matrix-theoretic approach for studying and enumerating finite posets through their incidence representations, referred to as poset matrices. Naturally labelled posets are encoded as Boolean lower triangular matrices, allowing a unified treatment of Birkhoff problem on non-isomorphic posets and Dedekind problem on antichains. A key idea is a systematic construction and indexing of poset matrices as principal submatrices of the binary Pascal matrix, leading to new structural insights through permutation similarity and domination relations. This approach provides a consistent matrix-based perspective on classical enumeration problems in poset theory.</description>

      <title>Dyck Paths, Configuration Spaces and Polytopes For Linear Nakayama algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combinatorial model of configuration spaces and polytopes associated to the quotients of $\mathbb{C} A_n$, the path algebra of the linearly oriented $A_n$ quiver, i.e. the algebra of upper triangular matrices. These quotient algebras are known as linear Nakayama algebras. Such configuration spaces were recently introduced for more general algebras by the second author and collaborators. In this special setting, we provide elementary proofs and explicit combinatorial constructions. From a Dyck path we define three related objects: a finite-dimensional algebra, an affine algebraic variety, and a polytope. Moreover, our constructions are natural: each relation in the poset of Dyck paths gives a morphism between the corresponding objects.</description>

      <title>Structured sunflowers and Ramsey properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A first-order structure $M$ is said to have the infinite sunflower property if, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}_+$ and each structure $M' \cong M$ whose elements are $k$-sets, there is $S \subseteq M'$, $S \cong M$, such that $S$ is a sunflower: a collection of sets such that each pair of distinct elements has the same intersection. A class $\mathcal{K}$ of finite structures is said to have the finite sunflower property if for all $k \in \mathbb{N}_+$ and $B \in \mathcal{K}$, there is $C \in \mathcal{K}$ such that any $C' \cong C$ whose elements consist of $k$-sets contains a copy of $B$ which is a sunflower. These two notions were introduced by Ackerman, Karker and Mirabi in a recent paper, and give a structural generalisation of the well-known Erd\H{o}s-Rado sunflower lemma for sets. We characterise the infinite sunflower property for countable ultrahomogeneous relational structures with strong amalgamation in terms of a certain vertex-partition property related to indivisibility, generalising and connecting some results of Ackerman, Karker and Mirabi in the countable ultrahomogeneous context, and we show that all free amalgamation classes with a single vertex isomorphism-type have the finite sunflower property. We give a variety of examples and further observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The length $\mathsf{is}(\pi)$ of a longest increasing subsequence in a permutation $\pi$ has been extensively studied. An increasing subsequence is one that has no descents. We study generalizations of this statistic by finding longest subsequences with other descent restrictions. We first consider the statistic which encodes the longest length of a subsequence with a given number of descents. We then generalize this to restrict the descent set of the subsequence. Extending the classical result for $\mathsf{is}(\pi)$, we show how these statistics can be obtained using the RSK correspondence and the Sch\"utzenberger involution. In particular, these statistics only depend on the recording tableau of the permutation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple explicit family $\mathcal{B}$ of $910$ $6$-subsets of $[60]=\{1,\dots,60\}$ such that every $6$-subset $S\subset[60]$ intersects at least one block $B\in\mathcal{B}$ in at least three elements, i.e.\ $|S\cap B|\ge 3$. Equivalently, $\mathcal{B}$ is a covering (dominating set) of the Johnson graph $J(60,6)$ with covering radius $3$ in the Johnson metric. The construction is purely combinatorial, based on a fixed split of $[60]$ into two halves, a pairing of each half, and a pigeonhole argument. We also record a crude counting lower bound and a straightforward generalization to $[2m]$ (with $m$ even).</description>

      <title>Winning in the Limit: Average-Case Committee Selection with Many Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the committee selection problem in the canonical impartial culture model with a large number of voters and an even larger candidate set. Here, each voter independently reports a uniformly random preference order over the candidates. For a fixed committee size $k$, we ask when a committee can collectively beat every candidate outside the committee by a prescribed majority level $\alpha$. We focus on two natural notions of collective dominance, $\alpha$-winning and $\alpha$-dominating sets, and we identify sharp threshold phenomena for both of them using probabilistic methods, duality arguments, and rounding techniques.
  We first consider $\alpha$-winning sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $\alpha$-winning if, for every outside candidate $a \notin S$, at least an $\alpha$-fraction of voters rank some member of $S$ above $a$. We show a sharp threshold at \[ \alpha_{\mathrm{win}}^\star = 1 - \frac{1}{k}. \] Specifically, an $\alpha$-winning set of size $k$ exists with high probability when $\alpha &lt; \alpha_{\mathrm{win}}^\star$, and is unlikely to exist when $\alpha &gt; \alpha_{\mathrm{win}}^\star$.
  We then study the stronger notion of $\alpha$-dominating sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $\alpha$-dominating if, for every outside candidate $a \notin S$, there exists a single committee member $b \in S$ such that at least an $\alpha$-fraction of voters prefer $b$ to $a$. Here we establish an analogous sharp threshold at \[ \alpha_{\mathrm{dom}}^\star = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2k}. \] As a corollary, our analysis yields an impossibility result for $\alpha$-dominating sets: for every $k$ and every $\alpha &gt; \alpha_{\mathrm{dom}}^\star = 1 / 2 - 1 / (2k)$, there exist preference profiles that admit no $\alpha$-dominating set of size $k$. This corollary improves the best previously known bounds for all $k \geq 2$.</description>

Abstract: In this article we introduce a new method, which we call a mutation-sunflower method, for calculating max-eigenvectors of a nonnegative irreducible $n\times n$ matrix $A$. Our method works in the general irreducible case, but it is in comparison with existing methods most effective for some special classes of matrices for example for sparse enough matrices. Our method reduces to solving max-eigenproblems for simple mutation-sunflower matrices that have exactly one positive entry in each row. We include some instructive examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Kontsevich's graphic orbifold Euler characteristic we define a virtual Euler characteristic for any finite set of isomorphism classes of matroids of rank $r$. Our main result provides a simple formula for the virtual Euler characteristic for the set of isomorphism classes of matroids of rank $r$ realizable over $\mathbb{F}_2$ (i.e., binary matroids). We prove this formula by relating the virtual Euler characteristic for binary matroids to the point counts of certain subsets of Grassmanians over finite fields. We conclude by providing several follow-up questions in relation to matroids realizable over other finite prime fields, matroid homology, and beta invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Metric Dimension problem, one asks for a minimum-size set $R$ of vertices such that for any pair of vertices of the graph, there is a vertex from $R$ whose two distances to the vertices of the pair are distinct. This problem has mainly been studied on undirected graphs and has gained a lot of attention in the recent years. We focus on directed graphs, and show how to solve the problem in linear time on digraphs whose underlying undirected graph (ignoring multiple edges) is a tree. This (non-trivially) extends a previous algorithm for oriented trees. We then extend the method to orientations of unicyclic graphs. We also give a fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm for digraphs when parameterized by the directed modular-width, extending a known result for undirected graphs. Finally, we show that Metric Dimension is NP-hard even on planar triangle-free acyclic digraphs of maximum degree 6.</description>

The fort hypergraph is introduced and hypergraph results on transversals and matchings are applied to the zero forcing number and fort number.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider induced subgraphs of the Hamming graph $H(n,3)$. We show that if $U \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_3^n$ and $U$ induces a subgraph of $H(n,3)$ with maximum degree at most $1$ then
  1. If $U$ is disjoint from a maximum size independent set of $H(n,3)$ then $|U| \leq 3^{n-1}+1$. Moreover, all such $U$ with size $3^{n-1}+1$ are isomorphic to each other.
  2. For $n \geq 6$, there exists such a $U$ with size $|U| = 3^{n-1}+18$ and this is optimal for $n = 6$.
  3. If $U \cap \{x, x+e_1, x+2e_1\} \ne \phi$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Z}_3^n$ then $|U| \leq 3^{n-1} + 81$.</description>

      <title>Planar graphs in blowups of fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every $n$-vertex planar graph is contained in the graph obtained from a fan by blowing up each vertex by a complete graph of order $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$. Equivalently, every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ has a set $X$ of $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$ vertices such that $G-X$ has bandwidth $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$. We in fact prove the same result for any proper minor-closed class, and we prove more general results that explore the trade-off between $X$ and the bandwidth of $G-X$. The proofs use three key ingredients. The first is a new local sparsification lemma, which shows that every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ has a set of $O((n\log n)/\delta)$ vertices whose removal results in a graph with local density at most $\delta$. The second is a generalization of a method of Feige and Rao that relates bandwidth and local density using volume-preserving Euclidean embeddings. The third ingredient is graph products, which are a key tool in the extension to any proper minor-closed class.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Index of the $u$-Deformed Homogeneous Polynomials and Generating Functions for $\mathrm{R}_{-n}(x,y;q|u)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08943v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the $u$-deformed homogeneous functions $\mathrm{R}_{\alpha}(x,y;u|q)$, for all $\alpha\in\mathbb{C}$. Basic properties of the functions $\mathrm{R}_{\alpha}(x,y;u|q)$ are given, along with recurrence relations, their $q$-difference equation, and representations. Generating functions for the functions $\mathrm{R}_{-n}(x,y;u|q)$ via the $u$-deformed $q$-exponential operator E$(qD_{q}|u)$, when $u=q^b,q^{b+1/2}$, $b\geq1$, are obtained. This allows us to obtain some $q^b$-series and $q^{b+1/2}$-series. Additionally, transformation formulas for basic hypergeometric series $_{1}\phi_{1}$ and $_{1}\phi_{2}$ are derived.</description>

      <title>Key expansion of the flagged refined skew stable Grothendieck polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flagged refined stable Grothendieck polynomials of skew shapes generalize several polynomials like stable Grothendieck polynomials, flagged skew Schur polynomials. In this paper, we provide a combinatorial expansion of the flagged refined skew stable Grothendieck polynomial in terms of key polynomials. We present this expansion by imposing a Demazure crystal structure on the set of flagged semi-standard set-valued tableaux of a given skew shape and a flag. We also provide expansions of the row-refined stable Grothendieck polynomials and refined dual stable Grothendieck polynomials and the Schur P-functions in terms of stable Grothendieck polynomials $G_{\lambda}$ and in terms of dual stable Grothendieck polynomials $g_{\lambda}$.</description>

      <title>When Many Trees Go to War: On Sets of Phylogenetic Trees With Almost No Common Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that any two trees on the same $n$ leaves can be displayed by a network with $n-2$ reticulations, and there are two trees that cannot be displayed by a network with fewer reticulations. But how many reticulations are needed to display multiple trees? For any set of $t$ trees on $n$ leaves, there is a trivial network with $(t - 1)n$ reticulations that displays them. To do better, we have to exploit common structure of the trees to embed non-trivial subtrees of different trees into the same part of the network. In this paper, we show that for $t \in o(\sqrt{\lg n})$, there is a set of $t$ trees with virtually no common structure that could be exploited. More precisely, we show for any $t\in o(\sqrt{\lg n})$, there are $t$ trees such that any network displaying them has $(t-1)n - o(n)$ reticulations. For $t \in o(\lg n)$, we obtain a slightly weaker bound. We also prove that already for $t = c\lg n$, for any constant $c &gt; 0$, there is a set of $t$ trees that cannot be displayed by a network with $o(n \lg n)$ reticulations, matching up to constant factors the known upper bound of $O(n \lg n)$ reticulations sufficient to display \emph{all} trees with $n$ leaves. These results are based on simple counting arguments and extend to unrooted networks and trees.</description>

      <title>Forbidding the subdivided claw as a subgraph or a minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Y$ be the subdivided claw, the $7$-vertex tree obtained from a claw $K_{1,3}$ by subdividing each edge exactly once. We characterize the graphs (finite and infinite) that do not have $Y$ as a subgraph, or, equivalently, do not have $Y$ as a minor. This work was motivated by a problem involving VCD minors. A graph $H$ is a vertex contraction-deletion minor, or VCD minor, of a graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of vertex deletions or contractions of all edges incident with a single vertex. Our result is a key step in describing $K_{1,3}$-VCD-minor-free line graphs. We also characterize graphs that forbid each subtree of $Y$. We discuss the relevance of our results for Tur\'{a}n. numbers of trees, and pathwidth and growth constants for graphs without a particular tree as a minor.</description>

      <title>A note on the maximum ratio between chromatic number and clique number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f(n)$ be the maximum, over all graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices, of the ratio $\frac{\chi(G)}{\omega(G)}$, where $\chi(G)$ denotes the chromatic number of $G$ and $\omega(G)$ the clique number of $G$. In 1967, Erd\H{o}s showed that \[ \Big( \frac{1}{4} +o(1) \Big) \frac{n}{(\log_2 n)^2} \le f(n) \le \big( 4+o(1) \big) \frac{n}{(\log_2 n)^2} .\] We show that \[ f(n) \le \big(c+o(1)\big) \frac{n}{(\log_2 n)^2}\] for some $c&lt;3.72$. This follows from recent improvements in the asymptotics of Ramsey numbers and is the first improvement in the asymptotics of $f(n)$ established by Erd\H{o}s.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s Matching (Conjecture) Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of $k$-sized subsets of $[n]$ that does not contain $s$ pairwise disjoint subsets.
  The Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture, a celebrated and long-standing open problem in extremal combinatorics, asserts the maximum cardinality of $\mathcal{F}$ is upper bounded by
  $\max\left\{\binom{sk-1}{k}, \binom{n}{k}-\allowbreak \binom{n-s+1}{k}\right\}$.
  These two bounds correspond to the sizes of two canonical extremal families: one in which all subsets are contained within a ground set of $sk-1$ elements, and one in which every subset intersects a fixed set of $s-1$ elements.
  In this paper, we prove the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the tree-decomposition-based parameter totally $\Delta$-modular treewidth (TDM-treewidth) for matrices with two nonzero entries per row. We show how to solve integer programs whose matrices have bounded TDM-treewidth when variables are bounded. This extends previous graph-based decomposition parameters for matrices with at most two nonzero entries per row to include matrices with entries outside of $\{-1,0,1\}$. We also give an analogue of the Grid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour for matrices of bounded TDM-treewidth in the language of rooted signed graphs.</description>

      <title>Rational Homotopy Type of Complements of Submanifold Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide an explicit cdga that controls the rational homotopy type of the complement $X-\cup_i Z_i$, where $X$ is a smooth compact algebraic variety and $\{Z_i\}$ is a collection of subvarieties such that all set-theoretical intersections are smooth. The model is given in terms of the cohomology of all intersections of $Z_i$'s, and the natural maps induced by the inclusions. Our construction is inspired by the work of J.Morgan, who covered the fundamental case where $\{Z_i\}$ is a divisor with normal crossings, and it is built on developments of the theory of mixed Hodge diagrams by Cirici-Horel. We avoid any explicit reduction to the normal crossings divisor case, e.g. via the wonderful compactification of De Concini-Procesi. As an application of our approach we recover and generalize a few separate results on the complements of arrangements in a uniform manner. These include the Kritz-Totaro model for graph configuration spaces, Yuzvinsky's model for affine subspace arrangements and Dupont's model for complements of hypersurfaces with hyperplane-like intersection.</description>

      <title>The uniform asymptotics for real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification I: the tropical correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03671v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first of two papers on the uniform asymptotics for real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification. Real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification count the number of real ramified coverings of the complex projective line $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ by real Riemann surfaces of genus $g$, where the ramification profiles over $0$ and $\infty$ are $\lambda$ and $\mu$ respectively, and the ramification profiles over the remaining real branch points consist of either $(3,1,\ldots,1)$ or $(2,1,\ldots,1)$.
  We apply a modified version of the tropical computation framework developed by Markwig and Rau for real Hurwitz numbers (Math. Z. 281 (2015), no. 1-2, 501-522) to compute the real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification. The new ingredient in our computation is the application of real simple resolution, a technique that enables us to resolve a triple branch point into a pair of simple branch points. Using real simple resolution, we establish a correspondence between real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification and weighted counts of tropical covers. This modified tropical correspondence simplifies the asymptotic analysis of real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification.</description>

      <title>The Lov\'asz Theta Function for Recovering Planted Clique Covers and Graph Colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problems of computing graph colorings and clique covers are central challenges in combinatorial optimization. Both of these are known to be NP-hard, and thus computationally intractable in the worst-case instance. A prominent approach for computing approximate solutions to these problems is the celebrated Lov\'asz theta function $\vartheta(G)$, which is specified as the solution of a semidefinite program (SDP), and hence tractable to compute. In this work, we move beyond the worst-case analysis and set out to understand whether the Lov\'asz theta function recovers clique covers for random instances that have a latent clique cover structure, possibly obscured by noise. We answer this question in the affirmative and show that for graphs generated from the planted clique model we introduce in this work, the SDP formulation of $\vartheta(G)$ has a unique solution that reveals the underlying clique-cover structure with high-probability. The main technical step is an intermediate result where we prove a deterministic condition of recovery based on an appropriate notion of sparsity.</description>

Abstract: We give an explicit, positive, and type-uniform formula for all equivariant structure constants of the Peterson Schubert calculus in arbitrary Lie types, using only the Cartan matrix of the corresponding root system $\Phi$.
