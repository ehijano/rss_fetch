      <title>Planar graphs without 4-, 7-, 9-cycles and 5-cycles normally adjacent to 3-cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is \emph{$(\mathcal{I}, \mathcal{F})$-partitionable} if its vertex set can be partitioned into two parts such that one part $\mathcal{I}$ is an independent set, and the other $\mathcal{F}$ induces a forest. A graph is \emph{$k$-degenerate} if every subgraph $H$ contains a vertex of degree at most $k$ in $H$. Bernshteyn and Lee defined a generalization of $k$-degenerate graphs, which is called \emph{weakly $k$-degenerate}. In this paper, we show that planar graphs without $4$-, $7$-, $9$-cycles, and $5$-cycles normally adjacent to $3$-cycles are both $(\mathcal{I}, \mathcal{F})$-partitionable and weakly $2$-degenerate.</description>

      <title>Finding Minimum Matching Cuts in $H$-free Graphs and Graphs of Bounded Radius and Diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A matching cut is a matching that is also an edge cut. In the problem Minimum Matching Cut, we ask for a matching cut with the minimum number of edges in the matching. We give polynomial-time algorithms for $P_7$-free, $S_{1,1,2}$-free and $(P_6 + P_4)$-free graphs, which also solve several open cases for the well-studied problem Matching Cut. In addition, we show NP-hardness for $3P_3$-free graphs, implying that Minimum Matching Cut and Matching Cut differ in complexity on certain graph classes. We also give complexity dichotomies for both general and bipartite graphs of bounded radius and diameter.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms and quotients of 2-colored quasi best match graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2-colored quasi best match graphs (2-qBMGs) are directed graphs that arose in phylogenetics. Investigations of 2-qBMGs have mostly focused on computational issues. However, 2-qBMGs also have relevant properties for structural graph theory; in particular, their undirected underlying graph is free from induced paths and cycles of size at least 6. In this paper, results on the structure of the automorphism groups of 2-qBMGs are obtained, which shows how to construct 2-qBMGs with large automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of toroidal graphs without some subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family of toroidal graphs, denoted by $\mathcal{T}_{i, j}$, which contain neither $i$-cycles nor $j$-cycles. A graph $G$ is $(d, h)$-decomposable if it contains a subgraph $H$ with $\Delta(H) \leq h$ such that $G - E(H)$ is a $d$-degenerate graph. For each pair $(i, j) \in \{(3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)\}$, Lu and Li proved that every graph in $\mathcal{T}_{i, j}$ is $(2, 1)$-decomposable. In this short note, we present a unified approach to prove that a common superclass of $\mathcal{T}_{i, j}$ is also $(2, 1)$-decomposable.</description>

      <title>Partial-dual genus polynomial of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Chmutov introduced the partial duality of ribbon graphs, which can be regarded as a generalization of the classical Euler-Poincar\'e duality. The partial-dual genus polynomial $^\partial\varepsilon_G(z)$ is an enumeration of the partial duals of $G$ by Euler genus. For an intersection graph derived from a given chord diagram, the partial-dual genus polynomial can be defined by considering the ribbon graph associated to the chord diagram. In this paper, we provide a combinatorial approach to the partial-dual genus polynomial in terms of intersection graphs without referring to chord diagrams. After extending the definition of the partial-dual genus polynomial from intersection graphs to all graphs, we prove that it satisfies the four-term relation of graphs. This provides an answer to a problem proposed by Chmutov.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s Conjecture and AR-Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an edge labeling $f$ of a graph $G$, a vertex $v$ is called an $AR$-vertex, if $v$ has distinct edge weight sums for each distinct subset of edges incident on $v$. An injective edge labeling $f$ of a graph $G$ is called an $AR$-labeling of $G$, if $f:E(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ is such that every vertex in $G$ is an $AR$-vertex under $f$. The minimum $k$ such that there exists an $AR$-labeling $f:E\rightarrow \{1,2,3,\dots,k\}$ is called the $AR$-index of G, denoted by $ARI(G)$. In this paper, using a sequence originating from Erd\H{o}s subset sum conjecture, a lower bound has been obtained for the $AR$-index of a graph and this bound is used to prove that only finitely many bistars, complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs are $AR$-graphs. The exact values of $AR$-index is obtained for stars and wheels.</description>

      <title>Around the Merino--Welsh conjecture: improving Jackson's inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Merino-Welsh conjecture states that for a graph $G$ without loops and bridges we have $$\max(T_G(2,0),T_G(0,2))\geq T_G(1,1).$$ Later Jackson proved that for any matroid $M$ without loop and coloop we have $$T_M(3,0)T_M(0,3)\geq T_M(1,1)^2.$$ The value $3$ in this statement was improved to $2.9242$ by Beke, Cs\'aji, Csikv\'ari and Pituk. In this paper, we further improve on this result by showing that $$T_M(2.355,0)T_M(0,2.355)\geq T_M(1,1)^2.$$ We also prove that the Merino--Welsh conjecture is true for matroids $M$, where all circuits of $M$ and its dual $M^*$ have length between $\ell$ and $(\ell-2)^4$ for some $\ell\geq 6$.</description>

      <title>Algebra and geometry of ASM weak order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much of modern Schubert calculus is centered on Schubert varieties in the complete flag variety and on their classes in its integral cohomology ring. Under the Borel isomorphism, these classes are represented by distinguished polynomials called Schubert polynomials, introduced by Lascoux and Sch\"utzenberger.
  Knutson and Miller showed that Schubert polynomials are multidegrees of matrix Schubert varieties, affine varieties introduced by Fulton, which are closely related to Schubert varieties. Many roads to studying Schubert polynomials pass through unions and intersections of matrix Schubert varieties. The third author showed that the natural indexing objects of arbitrary intersections of matrix Schubert varieties are alternating sign matrices (ASMs). Every ASM variety is expressible as a union of matrix Schubert varieties.
  Many fundamental algebro-geometric invariants (e.g., codimension, degree, and Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity) are well understood combinatorially for matrix Schubert varieties, substantially via the combinatorics of strong Bruhat order on $S_n$. The extension of strong order to ASM(n), the set of $n \times n$ ASMs, has so far not borne as much algebro-geometric fruit for ASM varieties.
  Hamaker and Reiner proposed an extension of weak Bruhat order from $S_n$ to ASM(n), which they studied from a combinatorial perspective. In the present paper, we place this work on algebro-geometric footing. We use weak order on ASMs to give a characterization of codimension of ASM varieties. We also show that weak order operators commute with K-theoretic divided difference operators and that they satisfy the same derivative formula that facilitated the first general combinatorial computation of Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of matrix Schubert varieties. Finally, we build from these results to generalizations that apply to arbitrary unions of matrix Schubert varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every pair of quantum isomorphic graphs, their block trees and their block graphs are isomorphic and that such an isomorphism can be chosen so that the corresponding blocks are quantum isomorphic. As a corollary of this result, we obtain that a minimal pair of quantum isomorphic graphs which are not isomorphic consists of 2-connected graphs.</description>

      <title>CayleyPy RL: Pathfinding and Reinforcement Learning on Cayley Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of studies on developing efficient artificial intelligence-based approaches to pathfinding on extremely large graphs (e.g. $10^{70}$ nodes) with a focus on Cayley graphs and mathematical applications. The open-source CayleyPy project is a central component of our research. The present paper proposes a novel combination of a reinforcement learning approach with a more direct diffusion distance approach from the first paper. Our analysis includes benchmarking various choices for the key building blocks of the approach: architectures of the neural network, generators for the random walks and beam search pathfinding. We compared these methods against the classical computer algebra system GAP, demonstrating that they "overcome the GAP" for the considered examples. As a particular mathematical application we examine the Cayley graph of the symmetric group with cyclic shift and transposition generators. We provide strong support for the OEIS-A186783 conjecture that the diameter is equal to n(n-1)/2 by machine learning and mathematical methods. We identify the conjectured longest element and generate its decomposition of the desired length. We prove a diameter lower bound of n(n-1)/2-n/2 and an upper bound of n(n-1)/2+ 3n by presenting the algorithm with given complexity. We also present several conjectures motivated by numerical experiments, including observations on the central limit phenomenon (with growth approximated by a Gumbel distribution), the uniform distribution for the spectrum of the graph, and a numerical study of sorting networks. To stimulate crowdsourcing activity, we create challenges on the Kaggle platform and invite contributions to improve and benchmark approaches on Cayley graph pathfinding and other tasks.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the package allMarkovBases for Macaulay2, which is used to compute all minimal Markov bases of a given toric ideal. The package builds on functionality of 4ti2 by producing the fiber graph of the toric ideal. The package uses this graph to compute other properties of the toric ideal such as its indispensable set of binomials as well as its universal Markov basis.</description>

      <title>Rogers--Ramanujan Type Identities for Rank Two Partial Nahm Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a $r\times r$ rational nonzero symmetric matrix, $B$ a rational column vector, $C$ a rational scalar. For any integer lattice $L$ and vector $v$ of $\mathbb{Z}^r$, we define Nahm sum on the lattice coset $v+L\in \mathbb{Z}^r/L$: \begin{align*}\label{eq-lattice-sum} f_{A,B,C,v+L}(q):=\sum_{n=(n_1,\dots,n_r)^\mathrm{T} \in v+L} \frac{q^{\frac{1}{2}n^\mathrm{T} An+n^\mathrm{T} B+C}}{(q;q)_{n_1}\cdots (q;q)_{n_r}}. \end{align*} If $L$ is a full rank lattice and a proper subset of $\mathbb{Z}^r$, then we call $f_{A,B,C,v+L}(q)$ a rank $r$ partial Nahm sum. When the rank $r=1$, we find eight modular partial Nahm sums using some known identities. When the rank $r=2$ and $L$ is one of the lattices $\mathbb{Z}(2,0)+\mathbb{Z}(0,1)$, $\mathbb{Z}(1,0)+\mathbb{Z}(0,2)$ or $\mathbb{Z}(2,0)+\mathbb{Z}(0,2)$, we find 14 types of symmetric matrices $A$ such that there exist vectors $B,v$ and scalars $C$ so that the partial Nahm sum $f_{A,B,C,v+L}(q)$ is modular. We establish Rogers--Ramanujan type identities for the corresponding partial Nahm sums which prove their modularity.</description>

      <title>Inductive Freeness of Ziegler's Canonical Multiderivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.09540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal A$ be a free hyperplane arrangement. In 1989, Ziegler showed that the restriction $\mathcal A''$ of $\mathcal A$ to any hyperplane endowed with the natural multiplicity $\kappa$ is then a free multiarrangement $(\mathcal A'',\kappa)$. The aim of this paper is to prove an analogue of Ziegler's theorem for the stronger notion of inductive freeness: if $\mathcal A$ is inductively free, then so is the multiarrangement $(\mathcal A'',\kappa)$. In a related result we derive that if a deletion $\mathcal A'$ of $\mathcal A$ is free and the corresponding restriction $\mathcal A''$ is inductively free, then so is $(\mathcal A'',\kappa)$ -- irrespective of the freeness of $\mathcal A$. In addition, we show counterparts of the latter kind for additive and recursive freeness.</description>

      <title>The Graph Minors Structure Theorem through Bidimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01724v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bidimensionality of a set of vertices $X$ in a graph $G$ is the maximum $k$ for which $G$ contains as a $X$-rooted minor some $(k \times k)$-grid. This notion allows for the following version of the Graph Minors Structure Theorem (GMST) that avoids the use of apices and vortices: $K_k$-minor free graphs are those that admit tree-decompositions whose torsos contain sets of bounded bidimensionality whose removal yield a graph embeddable in some surface $\Sigma$ of bounded Euler-genus. We next fix the target condition by demanding that $\Sigma$ is some particular surface. This defines a "surface extension" of treewidth, where $\Sigma\mbox{-}\textsf{tw}(G)$ is the minimum $k$ for which $G$ admits a tree-decomposition whose torsos become embeddable embeddable in $\Sigma$ after the removal of a set of dimensionality at most $k$. We identify a finite collection $\mathfrak{D}_{\Sigma}$ of parametric graphs and prove that the minor-exclusion of the graphs in $\mathfrak{D}_{\Sigma}$ determines the behavior of ${\Sigma}\mbox{-}\textsf{tw}$, for every surface $\Sigma.$ It follows that the collection $\mathfrak{D}_{\Sigma}$ bijectively corresponds to the "surface obstructions" for $\Sigma,$ i.e., surfaces that are minimally non-contained in $\Sigma.$ Our results are tight in the sense that ${\Sigma}\mbox{-}\textsf{tw}$ cannot be bounded for all parametric graphs in $\mathfrak{D}_{\Sigma}$.</description>

      <title>Essentially tight bounds for rainbow cycles in proper edge-colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An edge-coloured graph is said to be rainbow if no colour appears more than once. Extremal problems involving rainbow objects have been a focus of much research over the last decade as they capture the essence of a number of interesting problems in a variety of areas. A particularly intensively studied question due to Keevash, Mubayi, Sudakov and Verstra\"ete from 2007 asks for the maximum possible average degree of a properly edge-coloured graph on $n$ vertices without a rainbow cycle. Improving upon a series of earlier bounds, Tomon proved an upper bound of $(\log n)^{2+o(1)}$ for this question. Very recently, Janzer-Sudakov and Kim-Lee-Liu-Tran independently removed the $o(1)$ term in Tomon's bound, showing a bound of $O(\log^2 n)$. We prove an upper bound of $(\log n)^{1+o(1)}$ for this maximum possible average degree when there is no rainbow cycle. Our result is tight up to the $o(1)$ term, and so it essentially resolves this question. In addition, we observe a connection between this problem and several questions in additive number theory, allowing us to extend existing results on these questions for abelian groups to the case of non-abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Flat origami is Turing Complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07932v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "Flat origami" refers to the folding of flat, zero-curvature paper such that the finished object lies in a plane. Mathematically, flat origami consists of a continuous, piecewise isometric map $f:P\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2$ along with a layer ordering $\lambda_f:P\times P\to \{-1,1\}$ that tracks which points of $P$ are above/below others when folded. The set of crease lines that a flat origami makes (i.e., the set on which the mapping $f$ is non-differentiable) is called its "crease pattern." Flat origami mappings and their layer orderings can possess surprisingly intricate structure. For instance, determining whether or not a given straight-line planar graph drawn on $P$ is the crease pattern for some flat origami has been shown to be an NP-complete problem, and this result from 1996 led to numerous explorations in computational aspects of flat origami. In this paper we prove that flat origami, when viewed as a computational device, is Turing complete, or more specifically P-complete. We do this by showing that flat origami crease patterns with "optional creases" (creases that might be folded or remain unfolded depending on constraints imposed by other creases or inputs) can be constructed to simulate Rule 110, a one-dimensional cellular automaton that was proven to be Turing complete by Matthew Cook in 2004.</description>

      <title>Dichromatic number of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dichromatic number of a digraph is the minimum integer $k$ such that it admits a $k$-dicolouring, i.e. a partition of its vertices into $k$ acyclic subdigraphs. We say that a digraph $D$ is a super-orientation of an undirected graph $G$ if $G$ is the underlying graph of $D$. If $D$ does not contain any pair of symmetric arcs, we just say that $D$ is an orientation of $G$. In this work, we give both lower and upper bounds on the dichromatic number of super-orientations of chordal graphs. We also show a family of orientations of cographs for which the dichromatic number is equal to the clique number of the underlying graph.</description>

      <title>Hindrance from a wasteful common independent set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For (potentially infinite) matroids $ M $ and $ N $, an $ (M,N) $-hindrance is a set $ H$ that is independent but not spanning in $ N.\mathsf{span}_M(H) $. This concept was introduced by Aharoni and Ziv in the very first paper investigating Nash-Williams' Matroid Intersection Conjecture. They proved that the conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the non-existence of hindrances implies the existence of an $ M $-independent spanning set of $ N $.
  In this paper we present a breakthrough towards the Matroid Intersection Conjecture. Namely, we found a matroidal generalization of the `popular vertex' approach applied in the proof of the infinite version of K\"onig's theorem. The main result of this paper is an application of this new approach to show that if $ M $ and $ N $ admit a common independent set $ I $ that is ``wasteful'' in the sense that $ r(M/I)&lt;r(N/I) $, then there exists an $ (M,N) $-hindrance.</description>

      <title>Hyperpolygonal arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2024, Bellamy, Craw, Rayan, Schedler, and Weiss introduced a particular family of real hyperplane arrangements stemming from hyperpolygonal spaces associated with certain quiver varieties which we thus call hyperpolygonal arrangements $\mathcal H_n$. In this note we study these arrangements and investigate their properties systematically. Remarkably the arrangements $\mathcal H_n$ discriminate between essentially all local properties of arrangements. In addition we show that hyperpolygonal arrangements are projectively unique and combinatorially formal.
  We note that the arrangement $\mathcal H_5$ is the famous counterexample of Edelman and Reiner from 1993 of Orlik's conjecture that the restriction of a free arrangement is again free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a combinatorial theory of horospherical stacks which is motivated by the work of Geraschenko and Satriano on toric stacks. A horospherical stack corresponds to a combinatorial object called a stacky coloured fan. We give many concrete examples, including a class of easy-to-draw examples called coloured fantastacks. The main results in this paper are combinatorial descriptions of horospherical stacks, the morphisms between them, their decolourations, and their good moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Lifted Inference beyond First-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11738v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weighted First Order Model Counting (WFOMC) is fundamental to probabilistic inference in statistical relational learning models. As WFOMC is known to be intractable in general ($\#$P-complete), logical fragments that admit polynomial time WFOMC are of significant interest. Such fragments are called domain liftable. Recent works have shown that the two-variable fragment of first order logic extended with counting quantifiers ($\mathrm{C^2}$) is domain-liftable. However, many properties of real-world data, like acyclicity in citation networks and connectivity in social networks, cannot be modeled in $\mathrm{C^2}$, or first order logic in general. In this work, we expand the domain liftability of $\mathrm{C^2}$ with multiple such properties. We show that any $\mathrm{C^2}$ sentence remains domain liftable when one of its relations is restricted to represent a directed acyclic graph, a connected graph, a tree (resp. a directed tree) or a forest (resp. a directed forest). All our results rely on a novel and general methodology of "counting by splitting". Besides their application to probabilistic inference, our results provide a general framework for counting combinatorial structures. We expand a vast array of previous results in discrete mathematics literature on directed acyclic graphs, phylogenetic networks, etc.</description>

      <title>On the $(S_2)$-condition of edge rings for cactus graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cactus graph is a connected graph in which every block is either an edge or a cycle. In this paper, we will examine cactus graphs where all the blocks are $3$-cycles, i.e., triangular cactus graphs, of diameter $4$. Our main focus is to prove that the corresponding edge ring of this family of graphs is not normal and satisfies Serre's condition $(S_2)$. We use a criterion due to Katth\"an for non-normal affine semigroup rings.</description>

      <title>On Vu's theorem in Waring's problem for thinner sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and $s\geq k(\log k+3.20032)$. Let $\mathbb{N}_{0}^{k}$ be the set of $k$-th powers of nonnegative integers. Assume that $\psi$ is an increasing function tending to infinity with $\psi(x)=o(\log x)$ and satifying some regularity conditions. Then, there exists a subsequence $\mathfrak{X}_{k}=\mathfrak{X}_{k}(s)\subset\mathbb{N}_{0}^{k}$ for which the number of representations $R_{s}(n;\mathfrak{X}_{k})$ of each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ as $$n=x_{1}^{k}+\ldots+x_{s}^{k}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ x_{i}^{k}\in\mathfrak{X}_{k}$$ satisfies the asymptotic formula $$ R_{s}(n;\mathfrak{X}_{k})\sim \mathfrak{S}(n)\psi(n)$$ for almost all natural numbers $n$, with $\mathfrak{S}(n)$ being the singular series associated to Waring's problem. If moreover $s\geq k(\log k+4.20032)$ the above conclusion holds for almost all $n\in [X,X+\log X]$ as $X\to\infty$.
  Let $T(k)$ be the least natural number for which it is known that all large integers are the sum of $T(k)$ $k$-th powers of natural numbers. We also show for $k\geq 14$ and every $s\geq T(k)$ the existence of a sequence $\mathfrak{X}_{k}'\subset \mathbb{N}_{0}^{k}$ satisfying $$R_{s}(n;\mathfrak{X}_{k}')\asymp \log n$$ for every sufficiently large $n$. The latter conclusion sharpens a result of Wooley and addresses a question of Vu.</description>
