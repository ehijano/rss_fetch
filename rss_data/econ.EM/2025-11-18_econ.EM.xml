      <title>Compound Selection Decisions: An Almost SURE Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes methods for producing compound selection decisions in a Gaussian sequence model. Given unknown, fixed parameters $\mu_ {1:n}$ and known $\sigma_{1:n}$ with observations $Y_i \sim \textsf{N}(\mu_i, \sigma_i^2)$, the decision maker would like to select a subset of indices $S$ so as to maximize utility $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i\in S} (\mu_i - K_i)$, for known costs $K_i$. Inspired by Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE), we introduce an almost unbiased estimator, called ASSURE, for the expected utility of a proposed decision rule. ASSURE allows a user to choose a welfare-maximizing rule from a pre-specified class by optimizing the estimated welfare, thereby producing selection decisions that borrow strength across noisy estimates. We show that ASSURE produces decision rules that are asymptotically no worse than the optimal but infeasible decision rule in the pre-specified class. We apply ASSURE to the selection of Census tracts for economic opportunity, the identification of discriminating firms, and the analysis of $p$-value decision procedures in A/B testing.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Comparison of Nonparametric Trending Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework to test for slope heterogeneity between time-varying coefficients in panel data models. Our test not only allows us to detect whether the coefficient functions are the same across all units or not, but also determines which of them are different and where these differences are located. We establish the asymptotic validity of our multiscale test. As an extension of the proposed procedure, we show how to use the results to uncover latent group structures in the model. We apply our methods to test for heterogeneity in the effect of U.S. monetary shocks on 49 foreign economies and itself. We find evidence that such heterogeneity indeed exists and we discuss the clustering results for two groups.</description>

      <title>Double machine learning for causal inference in a multivariate sample selection model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose plug-in (PI) and double machine learning (DML) estimators of average treatment effect (ATE), average treatment effect on the treated (ATET) and local average treatment effect (LATE) in the multivariate sample selection model with ordinal selection equations. Our DML estimators are doubly-robust and based on the efficient influence functions. Finite sample properties of the proposed estimators are studied and compared on simulated data. Specifically, the results of the analysis suggest that without addressing multivariate sample selection, the estimates of the causal parameters may be highly biased. However, the proposed estimators allow us to avoid these biases.</description>

      <title>Identification-aware Markov chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leaving posterior sensitivity concerns aside, non-identifiability of the parameters does not raise a difficulty for Bayesian inference as far as the posterior is proper, but multi-modality or flat regions of the posterior induced by the lack of identification leaves a challenge for modern Bayesian computation. Sampling methods often struggle with slow or non-convergence when dealing with multiple modes or flat regions of the target distributions. This paper develops a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for non-identified models, leveraging the knowledge of observationally equivalent sets of parameters, and highlights an important role that identification plays in modern Bayesian analysis. We show that our proposal overcomes the issues of being trapped in a local mode and achieves a faster rate of convergence than the existing MCMC techniques including random walk Metropolis-Hastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The gain in the speed of convergence is more significant as the dimension or cardinality of the identified sets increases. Simulation studies show its superior performance compared to other popular computational methods including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo. We also demonstrate that our method uncovers non-trivial modes in the target distribution in a structural vector moving-average (SVMA) application.</description>

      <title>Why Do the Elderly Save? Using Health Shocks to Uncover Bequests Motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the saving behavior of elderly singles using an adversarial structural estimation framework by Kaji, Manresa and Pouliot (2023). The method bridges the simulated method of moments (SMM) and maximum-likelihood estimation by embedding a flexible discriminator, implemented as a neural network, that adaptively selects the most informative features of the data. Applying this approach to the model of De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010) with AHEAD data, we show that including gender and health histories in the discriminator improves identification and precision of bequests motives. The resulting estimates reveal that bequest motives explain between $13\%$ and $19\%$ percent of late-life savings across all permanent-income quintiles, not only among the rich. The adversarial estimator precisely disentangles bequest motives from precautionary savings motives. These findings suggest that heterogeneity in health-related survival expectations is another important source of identifying variation to distinguishing bequest and precautionary saving motives.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Inequalities using Machine Learning and Overcoming Common Support Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition splits the difference in means between two groups into an explained part, due to observable factors, and an unexplained part. In this paper, we reformulate this framework using potential outcomes, highlighting the critical role of the reference outcome. To address limitations like common support and model misspecification, we extend Neumark's (1988) weighted reference approach with a doubly robust estimator. Using Neyman orthogonality and double machine learning, our method avoids trimming and extrapolation. This improves flexibility and robustness, as illustrated by two empirical applications. Nevertheless, we also highlight that the decomposition based on the Neumark reference outcome is particularly sensitive to the inclusion of irrelevant explanatory variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the seminal work by Beresteanu and Molinari(2008), the random set theory and related inference methods have been widely applied in partially identified econometric models. Meanwhile, there is an emerging field in statistics for studying random objects in metric spaces, called metric statistics. This paper clarifies a relationship between two fundamental concepts in these literatures, the Aumann and Fr\'echet means, and presents some applications of metric statistics to econometric problems involving random sets.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Data: Topology Meets Analytics. A Practical Introduction to Topological Analytics and the Stability Index (TSI) in Business</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern business and economic datasets often exhibit nonlinear, multi-scale structures that traditional linear tools under-represent. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a geometric lens for uncovering robust patterns, such as connected components, loops and voids, across scales. This paper provides an intuitive, figure-driven introduction to persistent homology and a practical, reproducible TDA pipeline for applied analysts. Through comparative case studies in consumer behavior, equity markets (SAX/eSAX vs.\ TDA) and foreign exchange dynamics, we demonstrate how topological features can reveal segmentation patterns and structural relationships beyond classical statistical methods. We discuss methodological choices regarding distance metrics, complex construction and interpretation, and we introduce the \textit{Topological Stability Index} (TSI), a simple yet interpretable indicator of structural variability derived from persistence lifetimes. We conclude with practical guidelines for TDA implementation, visualization and communication in business and economic analytics.</description>

      <title>A Gentle Introduction to Conformal Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc framework for uncertainty quantification that provides distribution-free coverage guarantees. However, these guarantees crucially rely on the assumption of exchangeability. This assumption is fundamentally violated in time series data, where temporal dependence and distributional shifts are pervasive. As a result, classical split-conformal methods may yield prediction intervals that fail to maintain nominal validity. This review unifies recent advances in conformal forecasting methods specifically designed to address nonexchangeable data. We first present a theoretical foundation, deriving finite-sample guarantees for split-conformal prediction under mild weak-dependence conditions. We then survey and classify state-of-the-art approaches that mitigate serial dependence by reweighting calibration data, dynamically updating residual distributions, or adaptively tuning target coverage levels in real time. Finally, we present a comprehensive simulation study that compares these techniques in terms of empirical coverage, interval width, and computational cost, highlighting practical trade-offs and open research directions.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Control Inference for Staggered Adoption</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.06320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a synthetic control methodology to study policies with staggered adoption. Many policies, such as the board gender diversity policies, are replicated by other policy setters at different time frames. Our method estimates the dynamic average treatment effects on the treated using variation introduced by the staggered adoption of policies. Our method gives asymptotically unbiased estimators of many interesting quantities and delivers asymptotically valid inference. By using the proposed method and national labor data in Europe, we find evidence that regulation on board gender diversity leads to an increase in full-time employment for female professionals.</description>

      <title>A jackknife bias correction for nonlinear network data models with fixed effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.15603v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I introduce a new method for bias correction of dyadic models with agent-specific fixed effects, including the dyadic link formation model with homophily and degree heterogeneity. The proposed approach uses a jackknife procedure to deal with the incidental parameters problem. The method can be applied to both directed and undirected networks, allows for non-binary outcome variables, and can be used to bias correct estimates of average effects and counterfactual outcomes. I also show how the jackknife can be used to bias correct fixed-effect averages over functions that depend on multiple nodes, e.g. triads or tetrads in the network. As an example, I implement specifica- tion tests for dependence across dyads, such as reciprocity or transitivity. Finally, I demonstrate the usefulness of the estimator in an application to a gravity model for import/export relationships across countries.</description>

      <title>Bootstraps for Dynamic Panel Threshold Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04027v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops valid bootstrap inference methods for the dynamic short panel threshold regression. We show that the standard nonparametric bootstrap is inconsistent for the first-differenced generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. The inconsistency arises from an $n^{1/4}$-consistent non-normal asymptotic distribution of the threshold estimator when the true parameter lies in the continuity region of the parameter space, which stems from the rank deficiency of the approximate Jacobian of the sample moment conditions on the continuity region. To address this, we propose a grid bootstrap to construct confidence intervals for the threshold and a residual bootstrap to construct confidence intervals for the coefficients. They are shown to be valid regardless of the model's continuity. Moreover, we establish a uniform validity for the grid bootstrap. A set of Monte Carlo experiments compares the proposed bootstraps with the standard nonparametric bootstrap. An empirical application to a firm investment model illustrates our methods.</description>

Abstract: We propose a constrained generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator with some equilibrium uniqueness conditions for estimating the conduct parameter in a log-linear model with homogeneous goods markets. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that merely imposing parameter restrictions leads to not just inaccurate estimations but also some numerical issues, and adding the equilibrium uniqueness conditions resolves them. We also suggest a formulation of the GMM estimation to further avoid the numerical issues.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Identification of the Conduct Parameter in Homogeneous Goods Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the identification of the conduct parameter in homogeneous goods markets. Lau (1982) argues that the conduct parameter is not identified if and only if the inverse demand function is separable, except for a specific separable function. This result has been regarded as an extension of the result in Bresnahan (1982) to more general settings. However, we show that Lau's claim is incorrect and provide a new characterization of the non-identification. Our characterization shows that a demand function with demand rotation instruments is the necessary and sufficient condition for the identification of the conduct parameter. Therefore, our result properly generalizes the role of demand rotation instruments in identifying the conduct parameter, as highlighted by Bresnahan (1982), to more general settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study linear regressions in a context where the outcome of interest and some of the covariates are observed in two different datasets that cannot be matched. Traditional approaches obtain point identification by relying, often implicitly, on exclusion restrictions. We show that without such restrictions, coefficients of interest can still be partially identified, with the sharp bounds taking a simple form. We obtain tighter bounds when variables observed in both datasets, but not included in the regression of interest, are available, even if these variables are not subject to specific restrictions. We develop computationally simple and asymptotically normal estimators of the bounds. Finally, we apply our methodology to estimate racial disparities in patent approval rates and to evaluate the effect of patience and risk-taking on educational performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can stated preferences inform counterfactual analyses of actual choice? This research proposes a novel approach to researchers who have access to both stated choices in hypothetical scenarios and actual choices, matched or unmatched. The key idea is to use stated choices to identify the distribution of individual unobserved heterogeneity. If this unobserved heterogeneity is the source of endogeneity, the researcher can correct for its influence in a demand function estimation using actual choices and recover causal effects. Bounds on causal effects are derived in the case, where stated choice and actual choices are observed in unmatched data sets. These data combination bounds are of independent interest. We derive bootstrap inference for the bounds and show its good performance in a simulation experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a step-by-step guide to leniency (a.k.a. judge or examiner instrument) designs, drawing on recent econometric literatures. The unbiased jackknife instrumental variables estimator (UJIVE) is purpose-built for leveraging exogenous leniency variation, avoiding subtle biases even in the presence of many decision-makers or controls. We show how UJIVE can also be used to assess key assumptions underlying leniency designs, including quasi-random assignment and average first-stage monotonicity, and to probe the external validity of treatment effect estimates. We further discuss statistical inference, arguing that non-clustered standard errors are often appropriate. A reanalysis of Farre-Mensa et al. (2020), using quasi-random examiner assignment to estimate the value of patents to startups, illustrates our checklist.</description>
