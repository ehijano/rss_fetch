      <title>Stabilization of Poincar\'{e} duality complexes and homotopy gyrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilization of manifolds by a product of spheres or a projective space is important in geometry. There has been considerable recent work that studies the homotopy theory of stabilization for connected manifolds. This paper generalizes that work by developing new methods that allow for a generalization to stabilization of Poincar\'{e} Duality complexes. This includes the systematic study of a homotopy theoretic generalization of a gyration, obtained from a type of surgery in the manifold case. In particular, for a fixed Poincar\'{e} Duality complex, a criterion is given for the possible homotopy types of gyrations and shows there are only finitely many.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the base space of a homotopy cofibration is locally hyperbolic under various conditions. In particular, if these manifolds admit a rationally elliptic closure, then almost all punctured manifolds and almost all manifolds with rationally spherical boundary are $\mathbb{Z}/p^r$-hyperbolic for almost all primes $p$ and all integers $r \geq 1$, and satisfy Moore's conjecture at sufficiently large primes.</description>

      <title>Equivariant bordism classification of five-dimensional $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$-manifolds with isolated fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denote by $\mathcal{Z}_5((\mathbb{Z}_2)^3)$ the group, which is also a vector space over $\mathbb{Z}_2$, generated by equivariant unoriented bordism classes of all five-dimensional closed smooth manifolds with effective smooth $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$-actions fixing isolated points. We show that $\dim_{\mathbb{Z}_2} \mathcal{Z}_5((\mathbb{Z}_2)^3) = 77$ and determine a basis of $\mathcal{Z}_5((\mathbb{Z}_2)^3)$, each of which is explicitly chosen as the projectivization of a real vector bundle. Thus this gives a complete classification up to equivariant unoriented bordism of all five-dimensional closed smooth manifolds with effective smooth $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$-actions with isolated fixed points.</description>

      <title>A discrete model for surface configuration spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary methods of studying the topology of configurations of points in a graph and configurations of disks in a planar region has been to examine discrete combinatorial models arising from the underlying spaces. Despite the success of these models in the graph and disk settings, they have not been constructed for the vast majority of surface configuration spaces. In this paper, we construct such a model for the ordered configuration space of $m$ points in an oriented surface $\Sigma$. More specifically, we prove that if we give $\Sigma$ a certain cube complex structure $K$, then the ordered configuration space of $m$ points in $\Sigma$ is homotopy equivalent to a subcomplex of $K^{m}$</description>

      <title>Commutative algebra-enhanced topological data analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) combines computational topology and data science to extract and analyze intrinsic topological and geometric structures in data set in a metric space. While the persistent homology (PH), a widely used tool in TDA, which tracks the lifespan information of topological features through a filtration process, has shown its effectiveness in applications,it is inherently limited in homotopy invariants and overlooks finer geometric and combinatorial details. To bridge this gap, we introduce two novel commutative algebra-based frameworks which extend beyond homology by incorporating tools from computational commutative algebra : (1) \emph{the persistent ideals} derived from the decomposition of algebraic objects associated to simplicial complexes, like those in theory of edge ideals and Stanley--Reisner ideals, which will provide new commutative algebra-based barcodes and offer a richer characterization of topological and geometric structures in filtrations.(2)\emph{persistent chain complex of free modules} associated with traditional persistent simplicial complex by labelling each chain in the chain complex of the persistent simplicial complex with elements in a commutative ring, which will enable us to detect local information of the topology via some pure algebraic operations. \emph{Crucially, both of the two newly-established framework can recover topological information got from conventional PH and will give us more information.} Therefore, they provide new insights in computational topology, computational algebra and data science.</description>

      <title>Commutator subalgebra of the Lie algebra associated with a right-angled Coxeter group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the graded Lie algebra $L(RC_K)$ associated with the lower central series of a right-angled Coxeter group $RC_K$. We prove that its commutator subalgebra is a quotient of the polynomial ring over an auxiliary Lie subalgebra $N_K$ of the graph Lie algebra $L_K$, and conjecture that the quotient map is an isomorphism. The epimorphism is defined in terms of a new operation in the associated Lie algebra, which corresponds to the squaring and has an analogue in homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>Abstract simplicial complexes in {\tt Macaulay2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: {\tt AbstractSimplicialComplexes.m2} is a computer algebra package written for the computer algebra system {\tt Macaulay2} \cite{M2}. It provides new infrastructure to work with abstract simplicial complexes and related homological constructions. Its key novel feature is to implement each given abstract simplicial complex as a certain graded list in the form of a hash table with integer keys. Among other features, this allows for a direct implementation of the associated reduced and non-reduced simplicial chain complexes. Further, it facilitates construction of random simplicial complexes. The approach that we employ here builds on the {\tt Macaulay2} package {\tt Complexes.m2} \cite{Stillman:Smith:Complexes.m2}. It complements and is entirely different from the existing {\tt Macaulay2} simplicial complexes framework that is made possible by the package {\tt SimplicialComplexes.m2} \cite{Smith:et:al:SimplicialComplexes.m2:jsag}.</description>

      <title>Quantum Barcodes: Persistent Homology for Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce "quantum barcodes," a theoretical framework that applies persistent homology to classify topological phases in quantum many-body systems. By mapping quantum states to classical data points through strategic observable measurements, we create a "quantum state cloud" analyzable via persistent homology techniques. Our framework establishes that quantum systems in the same topological phase exhibit consistent barcode representations with shared persistent homology groups over characteristic intervals. We prove that quantum phase transitions manifest as significant changes in these persistent homology features, detectable through discontinuities in the persistent Dirac operator spectrum. Using the SSH model as a demonstrative example, we show how our approach successfully identifies the topological phase transition and distinguishes between trivial and topological phases. While primarily developed for symmetry-protected topological phases, our framework provides a mathematical connection between persistent homology and quantum topology, offering new methods for phase classification that complement traditional invariant-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries of Non-SUSY and Discrete Torsion String Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String / M-theory backgrounds with degrees of freedom at a localized singularity provide a general template for generating strongly correlated systems decoupled from lower-dimensional gravity. There are by now several complementary procedures for extracting the associated generalized symmetry data from orbifolds of the form $\mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$, including methods based on the boundary topology of the asymptotic geometry, as well as the adjacency matrix for fermionic degrees of freedom in the quiver gauge theory of probe branes. In this paper we show that this match between the two methods also works in non-supersymmetric and discrete torsion backgrounds. In particular, a refinement of geometric boundary data based on Chen-Ruan cohomology matches the expected answer based on quiver data. Additionally, we also show that free (i.e., non-torsion) factors count the number of higher-dimensional branes which couple to the localized singularity. We use this to also extract quadratic pairing terms in the associated symmetry theory (SymTh) for these systems, and explain how these considerations generalize to a broader class of backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1511.03784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop general machinery for computing the classifying ring $L^A$ of one-dimensional formal $A$-modules, for various commutative rings $A$. We then apply the machinery to obtain calculations of $L^A$ for various number rings and cyclic group rings $A$. This includes the first full calculations of the ring $L^A$ in cases in which it fails to be a polynomial algebra. We also derive consequences for the solvability of some lifting and extension problems.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Sub-Barcodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the work of Bauer and Lesnick, it is known that there is no functor from the category of pointwise finite-dimensional persistence modules to the category of barcodes and overlap matchings. In this work, we introduce sub-barcodes and show that there is a functor from the category of factorizations of persistence module homomorphisms to a poset of barcodes ordered by the sub-barcode relation. Sub-barcodes and factorizations provide a looser alternative to bottleneck matchings and interleavings that can give strong guarantees in a number of settings that arise naturally in topological data analysis. The main use of sub-barcodes is to make strong claims about an unknown barcode in the absence of an interleaving. For example, given only upper and lower bounds $g\geq f\geq \ell$ of an unknown real-valued function $f$, a sub-barcode associated with $f$ can be constructed from $\ell$ and $g$ alone. We propose a theory of sub-barcodes and observe that the subobjects in the category of functors from intervals to matchings naturally correspond to sub-barcodes.</description>

Abstract: We give an expression for the Smith-Thom deficiency of the Hilbert square $X^{[2]}$ of a smooth real algebraic variety $X$ in terms of the rank of a suitable Mayer-Vietoris mapping in several situations. As a consequence, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the maximality of $X^{[2]}$ in the case of projective complete intersections, and show that with a few exceptions no real nonsingular projective complete intersection of even dimension has maximal Hilbert square. We also provide new examples of smooth real algebraic varieties with maximal Hilbert square.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circuit algebras are a symmetric version of Jones's planar algebras. They originated in quantum topology as a framework for encoding virtual crossings. Oriented circuit algebras are equivalent to wheeled props. This paper
  extends existing results for modular operads to construct a graphical calculus and monad for general circuit algebras and prove an abstract nerve theorem. Specialisations of these results to wheeled props follow as straightforward corollaries.
  The machinery used to prove these results relies on a subtle interplay between distributive laws and abstract nerve theory, and provides extra insights into the underlying structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An equilevel algebra is a subalgebra of the space of smooth functions $f: M \to {\mathbb R}$ distinguished in this space by finitely many conditions of the type $f(x_i) = f(\tilde x_i)$, $x_i \neq \tilde x_i \in M$, or approximated by such subalgebras. For $M = S^1$ or ${\mathbb R}^1$, the regular points of the variety of equilevel algebras of codimension $k$ are known in knot theory as $k$-chord diagrams. The whole of this variety completes the space of chord diagrams in the same way as the Hilbert schemes complete the configuration spaces. We describe cell structures of the varieties of all equilevel algebras up to the codimension three in the space $C^\infty(S^1, {\mathbb R})$ and compute their homology groups and characteristic classes of canonical vector bundles on them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a very general approach to the analysis of signals from their noisy measurements from the perspective of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). While TDA has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for data with pronounced topological structures, here we demonstrate its applicability for general problems of signal processing, without any a-priori geometric feature. Our methods are well-suited to a wide array of time-dependent signals in different scientific domains, with acoustic signals being a particularly important application. We invoke time-frequency representations of such signals, focusing on their zeros which are gaining salience as a signal processing tool in view of their stability properties. Leveraging state-of-the-art topological concepts, such as stable and minimal volumes, we develop a complete suite of TDA-based methods to explore the delicate stochastic geometry of these zeros, capturing signals based on the disruption they cause to this rigid, hyperuniform spatial structure. Unlike classical spatial data tools, TDA is able to capture the full spectrum of the stochastic geometry of the zeros, thereby leading to powerful inferential outcomes that are underpinned by a principled statistical foundation. This is reflected in the power and versatility of our applications, which include competitive performance in processing. a wide variety of audio signals (esp. in low SNR regimes), effective detection and reconstruction of gravitational wave signals (a reputed signal processing challenge with non-Gaussian noise), and medical time series data from EEGs, indicating a wide horizon for the approach and methods introduced in this paper.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to show that the fundamental group of any smooth complex algebraic variety cannot be realized as a lattice of any simply connected nilpotent Lie group whose Lie algebra is $p$-filiform Lie algebra such that neither abelian nor $2$-step nilpotent. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition for a lattice in a simply connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension up to $6$ not to be isomorphic to the fundamental group of any smooth complex algebraic variety.</description>
