      <title>Approximating a branch of solutions to the Navier--Stokes equations by reduced-order modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends a low-rank tensor decomposition (LRTD) reduced order model (ROM) methodology to simulate viscous flows and in particular to predict a smooth branch of solutions for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, it enhances the LRTD-ROM methodology by introducing a non-interpolatory variant, which demonstrates improved accuracy compared to the interpolatory method utilized in previous LRTD-ROM studies. After presenting both the interpolatory and non-interpolatory LRTD-ROM, we demonstrate that with snapshots from a few different viscosities, the proposed method is able to accurately predict flow statistics in the Reynolds number range $[25,400]$. This is a significantly wider and higher range than state of the art (and similar size) ROMs built for use on varying Reynolds number have been successful on. The paper also discusses how LRTD may offer new insights into the properties of parametric solutions.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamic approach to reproduce multiple spinning vortices in horizontally rotating three-dimensional liquid helium-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports a three-dimensional (3D) simulation of a rotating liquid, helium-4, using a two-fluid model with spin-angular momentum conservation. Our model was derived from the particle approximation of an inviscid fluid with residual viscosity. Despite the fully classical mechanical picture, the resulting system equations were consistent with those of the conventional two-fluid model. We consider bulk liquid helium-4 to be an inviscid fluid, assuming that the viscous fluid component remains at finite temperatures. As the temperature decreased, the amount of the viscous fluid component decreased, ultimately becoming a fully inviscid fluid at absolute zero. Weak compressibility is assumed to express the volume change because some helium atoms do not render fluid owing to BECs or change states because of local thermal excitation. One can solve the governing equations for an incompressible fluid using explicit SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics), simultaneously reproducing density fluctuations and describing the fluid in a many-particle system. We assume the following fluid-particle duality: a hydrodynamic interfacial tension between the inviscid and viscous components or a local interaction force between two types of fluid particles. The former can be induced in the horizontal direction when non-negligible non-uniformity of the particles occurs during forced two-dimensional rotation, and the latter is non-negligible when the former is negligible. We performed a largescale simulation of 3D liquid helium forced to rotate horizontally using 32 GPUs. Compared with the low-resolution calculation using 2.4 million particles, the high-resolution calculation using 19.6 million particles showed spinning vortices close to those of the theoretical solution. We obtained a promising venue to establish a practical simulation method for bulk liquid helium-4.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic lattice models for flows with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many fundamental problems in fluid dynamics are related to the effects of solid boundaries. In general, they install sharp gradients and contribute to the developement of small-scale structures, which are computationally expensive to resolve with numerical simulations. A way to access extremely fine scales with a reduced number of degrees of freedom is to consider the equations on logarithmic lattices in Fourier space. Here we introduce new toy models for flows with walls, by showing how to add boundaries to the logarithmic lattice framework. The resulting equations retain many important properties of the original systems, such as the conserved quantities, the symmetries and the boundary effects. We apply this technique to many flows, with emphasis on the inviscid limit of the Navier-Stokes equations. For this setup, simulations reach impressively large Reynolds numbers and disclose interesting insights about the original problem.</description>

      <title>Stationary and non-stationary energy cascades in homogeneous ferrofluid turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear transfer rate of the total energy (transfer rate of kinetic energy + transfer rate due to the work done by the magnetization) for an incompressible turbulent ferrofluid system is studied under the assumption of statistical homogeneity. Using the formalism of the two-point correlators, an exact relation connecting the second-order statistical moments to the average energy injection rate is derived for the scale-to scale transfer of the total energy. We validate the universality of the exact relation through direct numerical simulations for stationary and non-stationary cascade regimes. For a weak external magnetic field, both kinetic and the total energy cascade with nearly the same cascade rate. A stationary cascade regime is achieved and hence a good agreement between the exact energy transfer rate and the average energy injection is found. Due to the rapid alignment of the ferrofluid particles in the presence of strong external fields, the turbulence dynamics becomes non-stationary. Interestingly, there too, both kinetic and the total energy exhibit inertial range cascades but with different cascade rates which can be explained using the non-stationary form of our derived exact relation.</description>

      <title>Thermal convection in a higher velocity gradient and higher temperature gradient fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a model for thermal convection in a class of generalized Navier-Stokes equations containing fourth order spatial derivatives of the velocity and of the temperature. The work generalises the isothermal model of A. Musesti. We derive critical Rayleigh and wavenumbers for the onset of convective fluid motion paying careful attention to the variation of coefficients of the highest derivatives. In addition to linear instability theory we include an analysis of fully nonlinear stability theory. The theory analysed possesses a bi-Laplacian term for the velocity field and also for the temperature field. It was pointed out by E. Fried and M. Gurtin that higher order terms represent micro-length effects and these phenomena are very important in flows in microfluidic situations. We introduce temperature into the theory via a Boussinesq approximation where the density of the body force term is allowed to depend upon temperature to account for buoyancy effects which arise due to expansion of the fluid when this is heated. We analyse a meaningful set of boundary conditions which are introduced by Fried and Gurtin as conditions of strong adherence, and these are crucial to understand the effect of the higher order derivatives upon convective motion in a microfluidic scenario where micro-length effects are paramount. The basic steady state is the one of zero velocity, but in contrast to the classical theory the temperature field is nonlinear in the vertical coordinate. This requires care especially dealing with nonlinear theory and also leads to some novel effects.</description>

      <title>Alfv\'en waves at low Magnetic Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper seeks whether Alfv\'en waves (AW) can be produced in laboratory-scale liquid metal experiments, \emph{i.e.) at low-magnetic Reynolds Number ($R\!m$). AW are incompressible waves propagating along magnetic fields typically found geo and astrophysical systems. Until now, only faint linear waves have been experimentally produced in liquid metals because of the large magnetic dissipation they undergo when $R\!m\ll1$. Yet, controlling laboratory AW could emulate such far remote processes as anomalous heating in the solar corona, oscillations of the Earth inner core or turbulence in the solar wind. To answer this question, we force AW with an AC electric current in a liquid metal channel in a transverse magnetic field. We derive a wave-bearing extension of the usual low$-R\!m$ MHD approximation to identify two linear regimes: The purely diffusive regime exists when $N_\omega$, the ratio of the oscillation period to the timescale of diffusive two-dimensionalisation by the Lorentz force, is small. The propagative regime is governed by the ratio of the forcing period to the AW propagation timescale which, we call the Jameson number $J\!a$ after Jameson (1964), JFM. In this regime, AW are dissipative and dispersive as they propagate more slowly where velocity gradients are higher. Both regimes are recovered in the FLOWCUBE experiment, in excellent agreement with the model up to $J\!a \lesssim 0.85$ but near the $J\!a=1$ resonance, high amplitude waves become clearly nonlinear. Hence, in electrically driving AW, we were able to produce some of the propagative, diffusive and nonlinear processes of astro and geophysical AW.</description>

      <title>Geometric approaches to Lagrangian averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangian averaging theories, most notably the Generalised Lagrangian Mean (GLM) theory of Andrews &amp; McIntyre (1978), have been primarily developed in Euclidean space and Cartesian coordinates. We re-interpret these theories using a geometric, coordinate-free formulation. This gives central roles to the flow map, its decomposition into mean and perturbation maps, and the momentum 1-form dual to the velocity vector. In this interpretation, the Lagrangian mean of any tensorial quantity is obtained by averaging its pull back to the mean configuration. Crucially, the mean velocity is not a Lagrangian mean in this sense. It can be defined in a variety of ways, leading to alternative Lagrangian mean formulations that include GLM and Soward &amp; Roberts' (2010) glm. These formulations share key features which the geometric approach uncovers. We derive governing equations both for the mean flow and for wave activities constraining the dynamics of the pertubations. The presentation focusses on the Boussinesq model for inviscid rotating stratified flows and reviews the necessary tools of differential geometry.</description>

      <title>A fully differentiable GNN-based PDE Solver: With Applications to Poisson and Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel computational framework that integrates the finite volume method with graph neural networks to address the challenges in Physics-Informed Neural Networks(PINNs). Our approach leverages the flexibility of graph neural networks to adapt to various types of two-dimensional unstructured grids, enhancing the model's applicability across different physical equations and boundary conditions. The core innovation lies in the development of an unsupervised training algorithm that utilizes GPU parallel computing to implement a fully differentiable finite volume method discretization process. This method includes differentiable integral and gradient reconstruction algorithms, enabling the model to directly solve partial-differential equations(PDEs) during training without the need for pre-computed data. Our results demonstrate the model's superior mesh generalization and its capability to handle multiple boundary conditions simultaneously, significantly boosting its generalization capabilities. The proposed method not only shows potential for extensive applications in CFD but also establishes a new paradigm for integrating traditional numerical methods with deep learning technologies, offering a robust platform for solving complex physical problems.</description>

      <title>Oscillating Middle Vehicle in a Platoon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-member platoon of Ahmed bodies was studied to investigate the effects of drag variation when the middle member goes out of synchronization and starts to oscillate longitudinally. Oscillations were carried out at two different reduced frequencies corresponding to two different drafting scenarios in NASCAR. Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations were performed to calculate the transient drag force, which was compared with the steady averaged drag results obtained with the middle member in different locations with respect to the lead and trailing bodies. Oscillations create dynamic forces in a platoon, such as suction and compression, which are taken into account by transient analysis. Since the steady cases failed to reproduce these forces on the oscillating vehicle, steady and transient drag comparison for the middle vehicle showed about 75\% difference at normalized time of 1.5 for reduced frequency of 0.4. Drag oscillates for every platoon member and remains cyclically repeatable after the first cycle. Higher reduced frequency increases the drag amplitude for the oscillating member. For the rest of the platoon, changing frequencies does not show significant effects. At very small separation gaps, pressure loss occurs resulting in sudden change in the drag. Drag peaks are mostly governed by the dynamic forces, therefore transient methods should be used for studying the oscillating effects in a platoon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of surface-driven convection near the temperature of maximum density $\tilde T_{md}$. A dynamic surface boundary condition couples heat flux through the surface to the induced convection, creating a dynamic equilibrium between the surface water temperature and the convection below. In this system, we identified three convective regimes: (1) free convection when the surface water temperature is above $\tilde T_{md}$, (2) penetrative convection when the surface water temperature is below $\tilde T_{md}$ and the convection is actively mixing the fluid layer, and (3) decaying convection when the convection weakens. We then predict the transitions between these regimes. Understanding these transitions is essential for the predicting timing of ice formation in natural systems.</description>

      <title>Semi-implicit Lagrangian Voronoi Approximation for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Semi-Implicit Lagrangian Voronoi Approximation (SILVA), a novel numerical method for the solution of the incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, which combines the efficiency of semi-implicit time marching schemes with the robustness of time-dependent Voronoi tessellations. In SILVA, the numerical solution is stored at particles, which move with the fluid velocity and also play the role of the generators of the computational mesh. The Voronoi mesh is rapidly regenerated at each time step, allowing large deformations with topology changes. As opposed to the reconnection-based Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian schemes, we need no remapping stage. A semi-implicit scheme is devised in the context of moving Voronoi meshes to project the velocity field onto a divergence-free manifold. We validate SILVA by illustrative benchmarks, including viscous, inviscid, and multi-phase flows. Compared to its closest competitor, the Incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (ISPH) method, SILVA offers a sparser stiffness matrix and facilitates the implementation of no-slip and free-slip boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Dynamo action driven by precessional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal and analyze an efficient magnetic dynamo action due to precession-driven hydrodynamic turbulence in the local model of a precessional flow, focusing on the kinematic stage of this dynamo. The growth rate of magnetic field monotonically increases with Poincar\'{e} number, $\rm Po$, characterizing precession strength, and magnetic Prandtl number, $\rm Pm$, equal to the ratio of viscosity to resistivity, for the considered ranges of these parameters. The critical ${\rm Po}_c$ for the dynamo onset decreases with increasing $\rm Pm$. To understand the scale-by-scale evolution (growth) of the precession dynamo and its driving processes, we perform spectral analysis by calculating the spectra of magnetic energy and of different terms in the induction equation in Fourier space. To this end, we decompose the velocity field of precession-driven turbulence into 2D vortical and 3D inertial wave modes. It is shown that the dynamo operates across a broad range of scales and exhibits a remarkable transition from a primarily vortex-driven regime at lower $\rm Po$ to a more complex regime at higher $\rm Po$ where it is driven jointly by vortices, inertial waves and the shear of the background precessional flow. The vortices and shear drive the dynamo mostly at large scales, comparable to the flow system size, and at intermediate scales, while at smaller scales it is mainly driven by inertial waves. This study can be important not only for understanding the magnetic dynamo action in precession-driven flows, but also in a general context of flows where vortices emerge and govern the flow dynamics and evolution.</description>

      <title>Rheology of suspensions of non-Brownian soft spheres across the jamming and viscous-to-inertial transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rheology of suspensions of non-Brownian soft spheres is studied across jamming but also across the viscous and inertial regimes using a custom pressure- and volume-imposed rheometer. The study shows that the granular rheology found for suspensions of hard spheres can be extended to a soft granular rheology (SGR) by renormalizing the critical volume fraction and friction coefficient to pressure-dependent values and using the addition of the viscous and inertial stress scales. This SGR encompasses rheological behaviors on both sides of the jamming transition, resulting in an approximate collapse of the rheological data into two branches when scaled with the distance to jamming, as observed for soft colloids. This research suggests that suspensions of soft particles across flow regimes can be described by a uni?ed SGR framework around the jamming transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The occurrence of in-stent restenosis following percutaneous coronary intervention highlights the need for the creation of computational tools that can extract pathophysiological insights and optimize interventional procedures on a patient-specific basis. In light of this, a comprehensive framework encompassing multiple physical phenomena is introduced in this work. This framework effectively captures the intricate interplay of chemical, mechanical, and biological factors. In addition, computational approaches for the extraction of hemodynamic indicators that modulate the severity of the restenotic process are devised. Thus, this marks a significant stride towards facilitating computer-assisted clinical methodologies.</description>
