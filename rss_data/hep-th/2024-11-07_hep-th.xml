      <title>Young Researchers School 2024 Maynooth: Lectures on CFT, BCFT and DCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The material of these notes was presented at the Young Researchers School (YRS) in Maynooth in April 2024 and provide an introduction to Conformal Field Theory CFT, Boundary Conformal Field Theory (BCFT) and Defect Conformal Field Theory (DCFT) with emphasis on the topics relevant to the remaining classes at this school. This class is mostly self-contained and includes exercises with solutions. The first part of these notes is concerned with the basics of CFT, and was taught by the author during the pre-school for the YRS 2024. Here the aim is to convey the notion of conformal families, their fusion and the construction of partition functions. The second part of these notes is dedicated to boundaries and defects in CFT and was presented by the author at the main school. As far as boundaries are concerned, emphasis is placed on boundary operators and their state spaces, as well as the boundary state formalism with the Cardy constraint. Topological defects are discussed in analogy, i.e. defect state spaces and the relevant consistency constraints are derived. Verlinde lines are constructed as their simplest solution and their properties are inspected.</description>

      <title>Absorptive Effects in Black Hole Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we define absorptive Compton amplitudes, which captures the absorption factor for waves of spin-weight-$s$ scattering in black hole perturbation theory. At the leading order, in the $G M \omega$ expansion, such amplitudes are purely imaginary and expressible as contact terms. Equipped with these amplitudes we compute the mass change in black hole scattering events via Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, where the rest mass of Schwarzschild/Kerr black hole is modified due to absorption of gravitational, electromagnetic, or scalar fields sourced by other compact object. We reproduced the power loss previously computed in the post-Newtonian expansion. The results presented here hold for similar mass ratios and generic spin orientation, while keeping the Kerr spin parameter to lie in the physical region $\chi \le 1$.</description>

      <title>Signals of multiparty entanglement and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multiparty entanglement signals, which are functions of a quantum state that are non-zero only when the state has multiparty entanglement. We consider known signals of three- and four-party entanglement, and propose new signals for four- and higher-party entanglement. We make some remarks on their general properties, but mainly focus on using holographic states in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$ as a test case to explore their properties. For both the AdS vacuum and multiboundary wormhole states, we find that the multiparty entanglement signals are generically non-zero and of order one in units of the central charge of the dual CFT, revealing substantial multiparty entanglement. In the large-horizon limit of multiboundary wormhole states, however, the signals for three or more parties become small indicating the short-range nature of entanglement.</description>

      <title>All Class $\mathcal{S}$ Theories of Type-$A$ Originate from Orbi-instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A surprising relation between 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ class $\mathcal{S}$ superconformal field theories of Type-$A$ and 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ orbi-instanton theories is investigated. We find that all of the theories in the former class can be obtained by a series of deformations of the 4d theories arising from compactifying the latter on a torus. This is demonstrated by examining Fayet--Iliopoulos (FI) deformations of the $E_8$-shaped magnetic quivers of the orbi-instanton theories whose body fits into the affine $E_8$ Dynkin diagram with a tail attached. Turning on FI parameters at the appropriate gauge groups leads, in stages, to $E_7$-shaped, $E_6$-shaped, and general star-shaped quivers, where the latter are magnetic quivers for the class $\mathcal{S}$ theory of Type-$A$ on a sphere with punctures. Deforming a suitable star-shaped quiver, one obtains a magnetic quiver of the Type-$A$ class $\mathcal{S}$ theory with general genus and an arbitrary number of punctures. Given such a theory, we also propose the inverse algorithm, thereby determining a parent orbi-instanton theory. This is achieved by uplifting the corresponding magnetic quiver step by step to the star-shaped, $E_6$-shaped, $E_7$-shaped, and $E_8$-shaped quivers, where at each step all of the underbalanced nodes, possessing non-zero FI parameters, are dualized. The latter $E_8$-shaped quiver then characterizes the 6d orbi-instanton theory from which the class $\mathcal{S}$ theory in question originates.</description>

      <title>Does connected wedge imply distillable entanglement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ryu-Takayanagi formula predicts that two spatially separated boundary subsystems can have large mutual information if their entanglement wedge is connected in the bulk. However, the nature of this mysterious entanglement remains elusive. Here, we propose that i) there is no LO-distillable entanglement at the leading order in $1/G_{N}$ for holographic mixed states, suggesting the absence of bipartite entanglement, and ii) one-shot LOCC-distillable entanglement with holographic measurements is given by locally accessible information, which is related to the entanglement wedge cross section $E^W$ involving the (third) purifying system. In particular, we demonstrate that a connected wedge does not necessarily imply nonzero distillable entanglement with holographic measurements at the leading order. Thus, it is an example of NPT bound entanglement in one-shot holographic settings. Our proposals have parallel statements for Haar random states which may be of independent interest. We will also discuss potential physical mechanisms for subleading effects, namely i) holographic scattering, ii) traversable wormholes, and iii) Planck scale effects. Finally, we establish a holographic monogamy relation between distillable entanglement and entanglement of formation $E_F$ whose dual we propose is $E^W$.</description>

      <title>Confining Strings and the Worldsheet Axion from the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a major update on the spectrum of closed flux tubes in $D=3+1$ $SU(N)$ gauge theories. We measure the excitation spectrum of confining strings wound around a spatial dimension of a size $R$. We do so for the $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory with $N=3,5,6$ and for two different values of the lattice spacing. We employ the generalized eigenvalue problem in combination with an extended basis of operators; this enables us to project onto all possible irreducible representations characterised by spin $|J_{\rm modulo \ 4}|$, transverse parity $P_{\perp}$, longitudinal parity $P_{\parallel}$ as well as by longitudinal momentum $p_{\parallel}=\frac{2 \pi q}{R}$, and extract accurate results for approximately $35$ lightest states. Applying the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) technique for calculating the finite volume spectrum, we confirm that the observed states are well described by the low energy effective theory of a long string consisting of two translational Goldstone bosons (``phonons"), along with a massive pseudoscalar (``the worldsheet axion") coupled to phonons through a $\theta$-term. Moreover, we find that the leading axion-axion and axion-phonon interactions are well approximated by the $T\bar{T}$ deformation of a free axion.</description>

      <title>The evaporation of charged black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged particle emission from black holes with sufficiently large charge is exponentially suppressed. As a result, such black holes are driven towards extremality by the emission of neutral Hawking radiation. Eventually, an isolated black hole gets close enough to extremality that the gravitational backreaction of a single Hawking photon becomes important, and the QFT in curved spacetime approximation breaks down. To proceed further, we need to use a quantum theory of gravity. We make use of recent progress in our understanding of the quantum-gravitational thermodynamics of near-extremal black holes to compute the corrected spectrum for both neutral and charged Hawking radiation, including the effects of backreaction, greybody factors, and metric fluctuations. At low temperatures, large fluctuations in a set of light modes of the metric lead to drastic modifications to neutral particle emission that -- in contrast to the semiclassical prediction -- ensure the black hole remains subextremal. Relatedly, angular momentum constraints mean that, close enough to extremality, black holes with zero angular momentum no longer emit individual photons and gravitons; the dominant radiation channel consists of entangled pairs of photons in angular-momentum singlet states. We also compute the effects of backreaction and metric fluctuations on the emission of charged particles. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the semiclassical Schwinger emission rate is essentially unchanged despite the fact that the emission process leads to large changes in the geometry and thermodynamics of the throat. We present, for the first time, the full history of the evaporation of a large charged black hole. This corrects the semiclassical calculation, which gives completely wrong predictions for almost the entire evaporation history, even for the crudest observables like the temperature seen by a thermometer.</description>

      <title>All actions for free massive higher-spin fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive higher-spin states/fields appear in the effective description of various systems from hadrons and nuclei to black-holes, whenever the point-particle approximation is justified, as well as in the bottom-up approaches to the quantum gravity problem. In $4d$ the actions for massive higher-spin fields utilize either the Sing-Hagen/Zinoviev set of auxiliary fields or a single chiral field, which is an $sl(2,\mathbb{C})$ spin-tensor of type $(2s,0)$, generalizing the Chalmers-Siegel approach. We show that these two actions are on the opposite ends of a discrete family of actions where the physical field is a spin-tensor of type $(s+k,s-k)$. The $(2s-1,1)$- and $(2s-2,2)$-cases generalize the Proca and the Fierz-Pauli actions, respectively, to all spins. A similar family of second-order actions exists for fermionic higher-spin fields.</description>

      <title>The M-algebra completes the hierarchy of Super-Exceptional Tangent Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conjectured symmetries of M-theory famously involve (1.) brane-extended super-symmetry (the M-algebra) and (2.) exceptional duality-symmetry (the $\mathfrak{e}_{11}$-algebra); but little attention has been given to their inevitable combination.
  In this little note, we highlight (by combining results available in the literature) that the $local$ exceptional duality-symmetry (the hyperbolic involutary $\mathfrak{k}_{1,10} \subset \mathfrak{e}_{11}$) acts on the M-algebra, through the "brane-rotating symmetry" $\mathfrak{sl}_{32}$, in a way which extends the known hierarchy of finite-dimensional $n$-exceptional tangent spaces compatibly beyond the traditional bound of $n \leq 7$ all the way to $n = 11$.</description>

      <title>Phase transition on superfluid vortices in Higgs-Confinement crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to distinguish states of matter by identifying spontaneous symmetry breaking on extended objects, such as vortices, even in the absence of a bulk phase transition. As a specific example, we investigate the phase transition on superfluid vortices in the Higgs-confinement crossover using a $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{gauge} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ model. This model exhibits superfluidity of $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ symmetry and allows for a crossover between the Higgs and confinement regimes by varying the gauge coupling constant from weak to strong. We demonstrate that, on vortices, spontaneous breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flavor symmetry occurs in the weak coupling (Higgs) regime, while it does not in the strong coupling (confinement) regime. We also confirm that those regimes are separated by a second-order phase transition through Monte Carlo simulations, whose universality class corresponds to the two-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <title>Ambient space and integration of the trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the ambient space construction, in which spacetime is mapped into a special lightcone of a higher dimensional manifold, to derive the integrable terms of the trace anomaly in even dimensions. We argue that the natural topological anomaly is the so-called $Q$-curvature, which, when projected from the ambient space, always comes with a Weyl covariant operator that should be adopted for the integration of the anomaly itself in the form of a nonlocal action. The use of the ambient space makes trasparent the fact that there are some new ambiguities in the integration of the anomaly, which we now understand geometrically from the ambient point of view. These ambiguities, which manifest themselves as undetermined parameters in the integrated nonlocal action, become more severe in dimensions $d\geq 6$ and do not seem to be related to a choice of the renormalization scheme.</description>

      <title>Into the wedge of $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\frac{1}{4}$-BPS Wilson loops in four-dimensional SU$(N$) ${\cal N}=2$ super-Yang-Mills theories with conformal matter in an arbitrary representation $\mathcal{R}$. These operators are special examples of loops consisting of two meridians on the two-sphere separated by an arbitrary opening angle. We conjecture an exact expression for the observable based on Pestun's matrix model and show that it perfectly reproduces the perturbative calculations at three loops in the theories under examination and at four loops in special setups characterized by hypermultiplets in the (rank-2) symmetric and antisymmetric representation of the gauge group. Moreover, we show that our conjecture is consistent with the known expression for the Bremsstrahlung function of ${\cal N}=2$ SYM theories. Finally, exploiting the matrix model representation of these Wilson loops, we study the large-$N$ limit at strong coupling of $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal QCD, finding a surprising transition in the vacuum expectation value for a critical opening angle.</description>

      <title>Massless Conformal Fields in Ten Dimensions, Minimal Unitary Representation of $E_{7(-25)}$ and Exceptional Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal unitary representation of $SO(d,2)$ and its deformations describe all the conformally massless fields in $d$ dimensional Minkowskian spacetimes. In critical dimensions these spacetimes admit extensions with twistorial coordinates plus a dilatonic coordinate to causal spacetimes coordinatized by Jordan algebras $J_3^{A}$ of degree three over the four division algebras $A= R , C , H , O $. We study the minimal unitary representation (minrep) of the conformal group $E_{7(-25)}$ of the spacetime coordinatized by the exceptional Jordan algebra $J_3^{O}$. We show that the minrep of $E_{7(-25)}$ decomposes into infinitely many massless representations of the conformal group $SO(10,2)$. Corresponding conformal fields transform as symmetric tensors in spinor indices of $SO(9,1)$ subject to certain constraints. Even and odd tensorial fields describe bosonic and fermionic conformal fields, respectively. Each irrep of $SO(10,2)$ falls into a unitary representation of an $SU(1,1)$ subgroup that commutes with $SO(10,2)$. The noncompact generators in spinor representation $16 $ of $SO(10)$ interpolate between the bosonic and fermionic representations and hence act like "bosonic supersymmetry" generators. We also give the decomposition of the minrep of $E_{7(-25)}$ with respect to the subgroup $SO^*(12)\times SU(2)$ with $SO^*(12) $ acting as the conformal group of the spacetime coordinatized by $J_3^{H}$. Group $E_{7(-25)}$ is also the U-duality group of the exceptional $N=2$ Maxwell-Einstein supergravity in four dimensions. We discuss the relevance of our results to the composite scenario that was proposed for the exceptional supergravity so as to accommodate the families of quarks and leptons of the standard model as well as to the proposal that $E_{7(-25)}$ acts as spectrum generating symmetry group of the $5d$ exceptional supergravity</description>

      <title>On the Unruh effect for hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18155v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration, implying the existence of a maximal value for the Unruh temperature. We discuss this result for an electrodynamic model with maximal proper acceleration, showing that the maximal Unruh temperature must be of order $10^5\, K$ for current high acceleration gradient laser-plasma acceleration experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of phase transitions in frustrated magnetic systems with $O(N)\times O(2)$ symmetry has been the subject of controversy for more than twenty years, with theoretical, numerical and experimental results in disagreement. Even theoretical studies lead to different results, with some predicting a first-order phase transition while others find it to be second-order. Recently, a series of results from both numerical simulations and theoretical analyses, in particular those based on the Conformal Bootstrap, have rekindled interest in this controversy, especially as they are still not in agreement with each other. Studies based on the functional renormalization group have played a major role in this controversy in the past, and we revisit these studies, taking them a step further by adding non-trivial second order derivative terms to the derivative expansion of the effective action. We confirm the first-order nature of the phase transition for physical values of $N$, i.e. for $N=2$ and $N=3$ in agreement with the latest results obtained with the Conformal Bootstrap. We also study an other phase of the $O(N)\times O(2)$ models, called the sinusoidal phase, qualitatively confirming earlier perturbative results.</description>

      <title>Kinetic structure of strong-field QED showers in crossed electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete, kinetic description of electron-seeded strong-field QED showers in crossed electromagnetic fields is derived. The kinetic structure of the shower and its temporal evolution are shown to be a function of two parameters: the initial shower quantum parameter and radiation time. The latter determines the short and long time evolution of the shower. Explicit solutions for the shower multiplicity (number of pairs per seed electron) and the emitted photon spectrum are obtained for both timescales. Our approach is first derived considering showers in a constant, homogeneous magnetic field. We find that our results are valid for any crossed fields and we apply them to laboratory settings for which we obtain fully analytical, predictive scaling laws.</description>

      <title>A Cosmological Solution to the Doublet-Triplet Splitting Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model that provides a simultaneous solution to the doublet-triplet splitting problem of grand unified theories, the electroweak hierarchy problem and the strong CP problem. The mechanism is based on the dynamics of two axion-like particles that would crunch the universe at the time of the QCD phase transition if triplets were light or had a VEV or if doublets were heavy or did not have a VEV. The only trace left at low energies are these two axion-like particles. They are weakly coupled to the Standard Model and could be detected at upcoming axion experiments or by a combination of neutron EDM measurements and the astrophysical detection of fuzzy dark matter.</description>

      <title>Towards Entropic Constraints on Quantum Speedups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some quantum algorithms have "quantum speedups": improved time complexity as compared with the best-known classical algorithms for solving the same tasks. Can we understand what fuels these speedups from an entropic perspective? Information theory gives us a multitude of metrics we might choose from to measure how fundamentally 'quantum' is the behavior of a quantum computer running an algorithm. The entanglement entropies for subsystems of a quantum state can be analyzed for subsystems of qubits in a quantum computer throughout the running of an algorithm. Here, a framework for making this entropic analysis is constructed, and performed on a selection of quantum circuits implementing known fast quantum algorithms and subroutines: Grover search, the quantum Fourier transform, and phase estimation. Our results are largely unsatisfactory: known entropy inequalities do not suffice to identify the presence or absence of quantum speedups. Although we know our algorithms must have quantum "magic", the Ingleton inequality, which holds for all entropies of subsystems of stabilizer states, is not violated in any of our examples. In some cases, however, monogamy of mutual information, which is obeyed for product states but violated for highly entangled bipartite states such as the $GHZ$ states, fails at some point in the course of our quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Origin of CMB Large-Scale Features Using LiteBIRD and CMB-S4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several missions following Planck are currently under development, which will provide high-precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. Specifically, measurements of the E modes will become nearly limited by cosmic variance, which, especially when considering the sharpness of the E-mode transfer functions, may allow for the ability to detect deviations from the concordance model in the CMB data. We investigate the capability of upcoming missions to scrutinize models that have been proposed to address large-scale anomalies observed in the temperature spectra from WMAP and Planck. To this purpose, we consider four benchmarks that modify the CMB angular power spectra at large scales: models producing suppression, a dip, and amplification in the primordial scalar power spectrum, as well as a beyond-Lambda CDM prescription of dark energy. Our analysis shows that large-scale measurements from LiteBIRD will be able to distinguish between various types of primordial and late-time models that predict modifications to the angular spectra at these scales. Moreover, if these deviations from the standard cosmological model are determined to be systematic and do not reflect the true universe model, future experiments could potentially dismiss these features as statistical fluctuations. We also show that additional measurements from CMB-S4 can impose more stringent constraints by probing correlated signals that these models predict at smaller scales (l&gt;100). A byproduct of our analysis is that a recently proposed "Dark Dimension" scenario, featuring power amplification at large scales, is strongly bound by current data, pushing the deviation from the standard model to unobservable scales. Overall, our results demonstrate that future CMB measurements can provide valuable insights into large-scale anomalies that are present in the current CMB data.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group improved cosmology in the presence of a stiff matter era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.92.103004}{Phys. Rev. D 92 (2015) 103004}, simple analytical solutions of the Friedman equations were obtained for a universe having stiff matter component in the early universe together with a dark matter, and a dark energy component. In this analysis, the universe is considered to be made of a dark fluid which behaves as a stiff matter in the early phase of the universe (when the internal energy dominates). It is also more logical to consider quantum gravitational effects in the early phase of the cosmological evolution. In this analysis, following \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.65.043508}{Phys. Rev. D 65 (2002) 043508}, we consider renormalization group improved modified Friedmann equations where the Newton's gravitational constant ($G$) and the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) flows with the momentum scale $k$ of the universe. It is observed that for a universe undergoing a stiff matter era, radiation era, and matter era, inflation is absent in the early time regime of the universe when the flow of the Newton's gravitational constant and cosmological constant is under consideration. Using the identification of the momentum scale with the scale factor of the universe, we then explore the era $t&gt;t_{\text{Pl}}$ which indicates a primarily matter dominated era with accelerated expansion due to the presence of dark energy. Finally, considering the total equation of state as a combination of linear equation of state along with a polytropic equation of state, we observe that after the Planck-time the universe can undergo an inflationary phase and we find out that the inflation is enhanced by quantum gravitational effects arising due to the consideration of renormalization group approach to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>TMD-like functions through the twisted quark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a new class of transverse momentum dependent functions (TMDs) as known as align-spin (AS) functions, employing the framework of twisted quark states. We reveal that these twisted (vortex) quark states serve as effective tools for the study of TMDs, thereby facilitating a comprehensive analysis of AS-functions. The proposed method is quite general and can be used for the standard TMDs. In contrast to the previous studies, the presented approach focuses on the leading order of interactions, providing a simplified and robust alternative to the methods based on the traditional $\mathbb{S}$-matrix expansion. We highlight that the critical dependence of transverse momentum arises not only from interactions but also from significant contributions linked to orbital angular momentum (OAM), influenced by the transverse momentum characteristics of correlators. Using a cylindrical formulation for twisted states, we can combine the properties of plane-wave particles with a description stemmed from spherical harmonics, resulting in well-defined propagation directions accompanied by essential OAM projections. In particular, this innovative framework opens a new window for the direct investigations of AS-functions, generating the unique angular $\phi$-dependence of differential cross sections. It also points towards promising applications in experimental particle physics.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Horndeski gravity and the ultra slowly evaporating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the evaporation behaviors of asymptotically flat charged black holes in the Einstein-Horndeski gravity theory. Based on the thermodynamics of the Horndeski black hole, we present a physical understanding of the scalar charge of the Horndeski black hole and also clarify its connection to the Einstein vector theory. As the presence of non-minimal coupling, the evaporating behaviors of the Horndeski black hole are vastly different from the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole case. Due to the different spacetime and electric field structures, the evaporation rate of the Horndeski black hole will slow down at the late stage of evaporation and thus gain a lifetime much longer than the RN black hole. These results illuminate the effect of non-minimally coupled matters on the black hole evaporation and provide clues to search for these matter fields in future observations.</description>

      <title>Self-congruent point in critical matrix product states: An effective field theory for finite-entanglement scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set up an effective field theory formulation for the renormalization flow of matrix product states (MPS) with finite bond dimension, focusing on systems exhibiting finite-entanglement scaling close to a conformally invariant critical fixed point. We show that the finite MPS bond dimension $\chi$ is equivalent to introducing a perturbation by a relevant operator to the fixed-point Hamiltonian. The fingerprint of this mechanism is encoded in the $\chi$-independent universal transfer matrix's gap ratios, which are distinct from those predicted by the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory. This phenomenon defines a renormalization group self-congruent point, where the relevant coupling constant ceases to flow due to a balance of two effects; When increasing $\chi$, the infrared scale, set by the correlation length $\xi(\chi)$, increases, while the strength of the perturbation at the lattice scale decreases. The presence of a self-congruent point does not alter the validity of the finite-entanglement scaling hypothesis, since the self-congruent point is located at a finite distance from the critical fixed point, well inside the scaling regime of the CFT. We corroborate this framework with numerical evidences from the exact solution of the Ising model and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of an effective lattice model.</description>

Abstract: We compute the invariant mass of dijets produced in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation processes up to four-loops in perturbation theory for both anti-$k_t$ and $k_t$ jet algorithms. The calculations, performed within the eikonal approximation and employing strong-energy ordering, capture the full analytic structure of the leading Abelian and non-Abelian non-global logarithms, including full colour and jet-radius dependence. We evaluate the significance of these logarithms and the convergence of the four-loop perturbative expansion by comparing with all-orders numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (EsGB) theory of gravity in a cosmological context using the formalism of dynamical systems. We obtain the equations of motion of the theory and introduce an appropriate set of dynamical variables to allow for a direct comparison with the results from General Relativity (GR). We observe that the cosmological phase space features the same set of fixed points as in standard GR, i.e., radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, curvature-dominated, and exponentially-accelerated solutions independently of the values of the coupling function and the scalar field. Furthermore, the radiation-dominated fixed points are repellers and the exponentially accelerated fixed points are attractors in the phase space, thus allowing for cosmological solutions behaving qualitatively similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model, i.e., transitioning from a radiation-dominated phase into a matter-dominated phase, and later into a late-time cosmic acceleration phase supported by the scalar field potential. Following a reconstruction method through which we produce the cosmological solutions in the GR limit of the theory and introduce them into the general EsGB dynamical system, a numerical integration of the dynamical system shows that the EsGB theory provides cosmological solutions indistinguishable from those of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, compatible with the current observations from the Planck satellite and weak-field solar system dynamics, while maintaining the scalar field and the coupling function finite and regular throughout the entire time evolution.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the conformal anomaly for a Weyl fermion in four dimensions that has generated some debate recently. We employ a perturbative expansion for the metric around Minkowski space, dimensional regularization and a Breitenlohner--Maison prescription for the chiral $\gamma$ matrix. We obtain a vanishing odd-parity contribution for Weyl fermions in four dimensions, while the even-parity contribution is exactly half the one for a Dirac fermion.</description>

      <title>BRST and Related Superfield Approach to a Few Interesting Models of Point Particles and a Model of Bosonic String: A Brief Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06850v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this brief review-cum-research article, we discuss a few key aspects of the off-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations, Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restriction(s), coupled Lagrangians/Lagrangian densities, etc., for the 1D diffeomorphism (i.e. reparameterization) invariant models of $(i)$ a non-relativistic and non-SUSY free particle, $(ii)$ a scalar (i.e. non-SUSY) relativistic free particle, $(iii)$ a spinning (i.e. SUSY) relativistic free particle, and $(iv)$ a 2D diffeomorphism invariant model of a specific bosonic string theory within the framework of BRST and related supervariable/superfield approach. We take up a new 1D diffeomorphism invariant model of an interacting scalar relativistic particle with the electromagnetic field. The latter is treated as a constant background variable and is, therefore, independent of the evolution parameter. We show that the universal nature of the CF-type restriction is maintained in the case of this new model, too. We exploit the modified Bonora-Tonin supervariable/superfield approach (MBTSA) to BRST formalism in the context of the 1D and 2D diffeomorphism invariant theories to prove the universal nature of the CF-type restriction(s). We further demonstrate that the 1D diffeomorphism invariant models of all kinds of particles are described by the singular Lagrangians. This singular nature has, to the best of our knowledge, not been explicitly shown elsewhere. Thus, these 1D models also respect the gauge symmetry transformations which are generated by the first-class constraints that exist on them. The equivalence of the 1D diffeomorphism and gauge symmetries is also established under specific conditions..</description>

      <title>Laminar flow of charged quantum fluids of the Calogero-Sutherland universality class</title>

Abstract: The effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model represents a universality class of quantum hydrodynamic fluids in one spatial dimension. It describes quantum compressible fluids involving both chiralities in which the chiral density field obeys the quantum Benjamin-Ono equation. An extension of this theory to describe a laminar flow of the Calogero-Sutherland fluids in a rectangular geometry with small transverse width and the topology of a ribbon, is considered here. The physical picture is based on the edge states in the hierarchical quantum Hall effect, which may be seen as a collection of parallel one-dimensional quantum incompressible fluids moving along but confined within the transverse microscopic width of the edge of the sample. The effective theory is thus defined as the direct product of two one-dimensional theories of the Calogero-Sutherland class so that one involves motion while the other is confining. Charge transport may be induced by coupling the system to an external electromagnetic field that yields a global translation of the ground state. The effective theory describes quantum solitonic excitations along the direction of the flow and possesses a two-dimensional electric current density which shows a Wigner semicircle law profile in the transverse direction, suggesting a Poiseuille-like behavior but without dissipative viscous effects since the velocity of the fluid is not a well-defined quantum field. This simple physical picture predicts interesting phenomena with distinctive signatures that may be tested in real samples.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic Emission of Charges from Near-Extremal Nariai Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using both the in-out formalism and the monodromy method, we study the emission of charges from near-extremal charged Nariai black holes with the black hole event and cosmological horizons close to each other, whose near-horizon geometry is $\mathrm{dS}_2 \times \mathrm{S}^2$. The emission becomes catastrophic for a charge with energy greater than its chemical potential, whose leading exponential factor increases inversely proportional to the separation of two horizons. This effect may prevent near-extremal Nariai black holes with large charges that evaporate dominantly through the charge emission from evolving to black holes with a naked singularity, in analog to near-extremal RN-dS black holes that have the Breitenlohner-Friedman bound, below which they become stable against Hawking radiation and Schwinger effect of charge emission. The near-extremal Nariai black holes with small charges, which are close to near-extremal Schwarzschild-dS black holes, emit dominantly charge-neutral particles and evolve to black holes with increasing charge to mass ratio. We illuminate the origin of the catastrophic emission in the phase-integral formulation and monodromy method by comparing near-extremal charged Nariai black holes with near-extremal RN-dS black holes.</description>

      <title>On gravity unification in SL(2N,C) gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry is shown to provide, when appropriately constrained, a viable framework for a consistent unification of the known elementary forces, including gravity. Such a covariant constraint implies that an actual gauge field multiplet in the $SL(2N,C)$ theory is ultimately determined by the associated tetrad fields which not only specify the geometric features of spacetime but also govern which local internal symmetries are permissible within it. As a consequence, upon the covariant removal of all "redundant" gauge field components, the entire theory only exhibits the effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(N)$ symmetry, comprising $SL(2,C)$ gauge gravity on one hand and $SU(N)$ grand unified theory on the other. Given that all states involved in the $SL(2N,C)$ theories are additionally classified according to their spin values, many potential $SU(N)$ GUTs, including the conventional $SU(5)$ theory, appear to be irrelevant for standard spin $1/2$ quarks and leptons. Meanwhile, applying the $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry to the model of composite quarks and leptons with constituent chiral preons in its fundamental representations reveals, under certain natural conditions, that among all accompanying $SU(N)_{L}\times SU(N)_{R}$ chiral symmetries of preons and their composites only the $SU(8)_{L}\times SU(8)_{R}$ meets the anomaly matching condition ensuring masslessness of these composites at large distances. This, in turn, identifies $SL(16,C)$ with the effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(8)$ symmetry, accommodating all three families of composite quarks and leptons, as the most likely candidate for hyperunification of the existing elementary forces.</description>

      <title>On the structure of the large-$N$ expansion in SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, we have computed the short-distance asymptotics of the generating functional of Euclidean correlators of single-trace twist-$2$ operators in the large-$N$ expansion of SU($N$) Yang-Mills (YM) theory to the leading-nonplanar order. Remarkably, it has the structure of the logarithm of a functional determinant, but with the sign opposite to the one that would follow from the spin-statistics theorem for the glueballs. In order to solve this sign puzzle, we have reconsidered the proof in the literature that in the 't Hooft topological expansion of large-$N$ YM theory the leading-nonplanar contribution to the generating functional consists of the sum over punctures of $n$-punctured tori. We have discovered that for twist-$2$ operators it contains -- in addition to the $n$-punctured tori -- the normalization of tori with $1 \leq p \leq n$ pinches and $n-p$ punctures. Once the existence of the new sector is taken into account, the violation of the spin-statistics theorem disappears. Moreover, the new sector contributes trivially to the nonperturbative $S$ matrix because -- for example -- the $n$-pinched torus represents nonperturbatively a loop of $n$ glueball propagators with no external leg. This opens the way for an exact solution limited to the new sector that may be solvable thanks to the vanishing $S$ matrix.</description>

Abstract: We explore new aspects of internal fermionic shifting symmetries, present in physical systems such as free Dirac spinors and p-form tensor-spinor fields. We propose a novel procedure to gauge these global symmetries, which also introduces a new St\"uckelberg mechanism to give a mass to free fermionic fields. Furthermore, we find new magnetic fermionic symmetries in these physical systems whose charged objects are disorder operators. For the case of a Dirac spinor, we discuss an dual description, where the magnetic symmetry acts on the holonomies of a dual 2-form tensor-spinor. Further generalizations such as higher-group-like structures are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Weak Cosmic Censorship and Weak Gravity Conjectures in CFT Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the intriguing interplay between fundamental theoretical physics concepts within the context of charged black holes. Specifically, we focus on the consistency of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) and weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) in the thermodynamics of conformal field theory (CFT), and restricted phase space thermodynamics (RPST) for AdS Reissner-Nordstrom black holes with a perfect fluid dark matter (RN-PFDM). The WGC ensures that gravity remains the weakest force in the system. Meanwhile, the WCCC addresses the cosmic censorship problem by preventing the violation of fundamental physical laws near the black hole singularity. First, we analyze the RN black hole's free energy in both spaces, revealing a distinctive swallowtail pattern indicative of a first-order phase transition when certain free parameter conditions are met. We explore the WGC across different phase spaces, emphasizing the need for certain conditions in extended phase space thermodynamics (EPST), RPST, and CFT. We demonstrate that PFDM parameter \( \gamma \) and the radius of AdS \( l \) have a vital role in proving the satisfaction of the WGC. Also, these values have a linear relation with the range compatibility of WGC. The range of compatibility for WGC in RPST and EPST is the same while for CFT, this range is larger than EPST, and RPST. It means somehow the WGC and CFT are more consistent. The WCCC was examined at the critical juncture, confirming its validity in critical points. We conclude that the WGC is supported at the critical point of black holes, and the WCCC is also maintained, demonstrating the robustness of these conjectures within the critical ranges of black hole parameters</description>

      <title>Topology of restricted phase space thermodynamics in Kerr-Sen-Ads black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the thermodynamic topology of the Kerr-Sen-Ads black hole in restricted phase space. In the restricted phase space, a new parameter, central charge $C$, and its conjugate parameter $\mu$ are introduced, omitting the well-known $PdV$ term in the first law of black hole thermodynamics. We study the local and global topology of the black hole by considering the black hole solution as topological defects in the free energy landscape. We compute the winding number and the total topological number at the thermodynamic defects. For our analysis, we have considered five ensembles of Kerr-Sen-Ads black holes in restricted phase space: fixed $(Q, J, C)$, fixed $(\phi, J, C)$, fixed $(Q,\Omega, C)$, fixed $(Q, J, \mu)$, and fixed $(\phi,\Omega, C)$, where $Q$ is the electric charge, $J$ is the angular momentum, $C$ is the central charge, $\phi$ is the electric potential conjugate to charge, $\Omega$ is the angular frequency conjugate to $J$, and finally, $\mu$ is the chemical potential. In the fixed $(Q, J, C)$, fixed $(\phi, J, C)$, and fixed $(Q, J, \mu)$ ensembles, we find a topological charge of $+1$. In the fixed $(Q,\Omega, C)$ and fixed $(\phi, \Omega, C)$ ensembles, depending on the values of the thermodynamic parameters, we find topological charges of $-1$, $0$, and $+1$. Interestingly, in ensembles where we find the topological charge to be $0$, we observe both Hawking-Page and Davies type phase transitions. We show that both types of these phase transitions can be studied using a common vector field, and the topological charges associated with Davies type and Hawking-Page phase transitions are $-1$ and $+1$, respectively.</description>

      <title>String loops and gravitational positivity bounds: imprint of light particles at high energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study loop corrections to positivity bounds on effective field theories in the context of $2\to 2$ scattering in gravitational theories, in the presence of light particles. It has been observed that certain negative contributions at low energies are enhanced by inverse powers of a small mass $m$ and are nontrivial to cancel against other low-energy contributions. These originate from near the forward limit of diagrams involving graviton exchange. We observe that scattering in this kinematics domain remains infrared-sensitive even at high center-of-mass energy. By considering a string-inspired model in which high-energy loops can be calculated using unitarity and Regge behavior of tree amplitudes, we uncover a natural mechanism through which $1/m$-enhanced terms perfectly cancel between low and high energy contributions. This concretely explains possible positivity violations in the presence of gravity from the high-energy viewpoint.</description>

      <title>One point functions in large $N$ vector models at finite chemical potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the thermal one point function of higher spin currents in the critical model of $U(N)$ complex scalars interacting with a quartic potential and the $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model of Dirac fermions at large $N$ and strong coupling using the Euclidean inversion formula. These models are considered in odd space time dimensions $d$ and held at finite temperature and finite real chemical potential $\mu$ measured in units of the temperature. We show that these one point functions simplify both at large spin and large $d$. At large spin, the one point functions behave as though the theory is free, the chemical potential appears through a simple pre-factor which is either $\cosh\mu$ or $\sinh\mu$ depending on whether the spin is even or odd. At large $d$, but at finite spin and chemical potential, the 1-point functions are suppressed exponentially in $d$ compared to the free theory. We study a fixed point of the critical Gross-Neveu model in $d=3$ with 1-point functions exhibiting a branch cut in the chemical potential plane. The critical exponent for the free energy or the pressure at the branch point is $3/2$ which coincides with the mean field exponent of the Lee-Yang edge singularity for repulsive core interactions.</description>

      <title>Probing Krylov Complexity in Scalar Field Theory with General Temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Krylov complexity characterizes the operator growth in the quantum many-body systems or quantum field theories. The existing literatures have studied the Krylov complexity in the low temperature limit in the quantum field theories. In this paper, we extend and systematically study the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy in a scalar field theory with general temperatures. To this end, we propose a new method to calculate the Wightman power spectrum which allows us to compute the Lanczos coefficients and subsequently to study the Krylov complexity (entropy) in general temperatures. We find that the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov complexity (entropy) in the high temperature limit will behave somewhat differently from those studies in the low temperature limit. We give an explanation of why the Krylov complexity does not oscillate in the high-temperature region. Moreover, we uncover the transition temperature that separates the oscillating and monotonic increasing behavior of Krylov complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study tree-level scattering processes of arbitrary string states using the DDF formalism and suitable coherent vertex operators. We obtain new exact compact formulae for heavy-heavy-light-light scattering amplitudes in open or closed bosonic string theories, and derive explicit exact expressions for the absorption cross-sections, and corresponding emission rates, of highly excited string states using the optical theorem and time reversal symmetry. We show that these expressions are independent of the microscopic structure of the excited string states without averaging. For the absorption of massless modes in open string theory, in particular, we find a constant, frequency-independent cross-section. In contrast, the corresponding cross-section for the absorption of massless modes by excited closed strings depends linearly on the frequency, implying a non-trivial grey-body factor. In both cases, at energies below the scale set by the mass of the highly excited strings, we find emission rates with a Boltzmann factor at Hagedorn temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the complete set of planar two-loop five-point Feynman integrals with two off-shell external legs. These integrals are relevant, for instance, for the calculation of the second-order QCD corrections to the production of two heavy vector bosons in association with a jet or a photon at a hadron collider. We construct pure bases for these integrals and reconstruct their analytic differential equations in canonical form through numerical sampling over finite fields. The newly identified symbol alphabet, one of the most complex to date, provides valuable data for bootstrap methods. We then apply our results to initiate the study of double Lagrangian insertions in a four-cusp Wilson loop in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, computing it through two loops. We observe that it is finite, conformally invariant in four dimensions, and of uniform transcendentality. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence for its positivity within the amplituhedron region through two loops.</description>

      <title>Constraints, Conserved Charges and Extended BRST Algebra for a 3D Field-Theoretic Example for Hodge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the constraint analysis of a three (2 + 1)-dimensional (3D) field-theoretic example for Hodge theory $(i)$ at the classical level within the ambit of Lagrangian formulation, and $(ii)$ at the quantum level within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism. We derive the conserved charges corresponding to the six continuous symmetries of our present theory. These six continuous summery transformations are the nilpotent (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST symmetries, a unique bosonic symmetry and the ghost-scale symmetry. It turns out that the Noether conserved (anti-)BRST charges are found to be non-nilpotent even though they are derived from the off-shell nilpotent versions of the continuous and infinitesimal (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations. We obtain the nilpotent versions of the (anti-)BRST charges from the non-nilpotent Noether (anti-)BRST charges and discuss the physicality criteria w.r.t. the latter to demonstrate that the operator forms of the first-class constraints (of the classical gauge theory) annihilate the physical states at the quantum level. This observation is consistent with Dirac's quantization conditions for the systems that are endowed with the constraints. We lay emphasis on the existence of a single (anti-)BRST invariant Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restriction in our theory and derive it from various theoretical angles.</description>

      <title>The dual Ginzburg-Landau theory for a holographic superconductor: Finite coupling corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The holographic superconductor is the holographic dual of superconductors. We recently identified the dual Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors (arXiv:2207.07182 [hep-th]). However, the result is the strong coupling limit or the large-$N_c$ limit. A natural question is how the dual GL theory changes at finite coupling. We identify the dual GL theory for a minimal holographic superconductor at finite coupling (Gauss-Bonnet holographic superconductor), where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly. The GL parameter $\kappa$ increases at finite coupling, namely the system approaches a more Type-II superconductor like material. We also point out two potential problems in previous works: (1) the "naive" AdS/CFT dictionary, and (2) the condensate determined only from the GL potential terms. As a result, the condensate increases at finite coupling unlike common folklore.</description>

      <title>Spinor-Vector Duality and Mirror Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mirror symmetry was first observed in worldsheet string constructions and shown to have profound implications in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) limit of string compactifications, and for the properties of Calabi-Yau manifolds. It opened up a new field in pure mathematics and was utilised in the area of enumerative geometry. Spinor-Vector Duality (SVD) is an extension of mirror symmetry. This can be readily understood in terms of the moduli of toroidal compactification of the heterotic string, which include the metric the antisymmetric tensor field and the Wilson line moduli. In terms of toroidal moduli, mirror symmetry corresponds to mappings of the internal space moduli, whereas spinor-vector duality corresponds to maps of the Wilson line moduli. In the past few of years, we demonstrated the existence of spinor-vector duality in the effective field theory compactifications of the string theories. This was achieved by starting with a worldsheet orbifold construction that exhibited spinor-vector duality and resolving the orbifold singularities, hence generating a smooth effective field theory limit with an imprint of the spinor-vector duality. Just like mirror symmetry, the spinor-vector duality can be used to study the properties of complex manifolds with vector bundles. Spinor--vector duality offers a top-down approach to the ``Swampland''-program, by exploring the imprint of the symmetries of the ultra-violet complete worldsheet string constructions in the effective field theory limit. The SVD suggests a demarcation line between (2,0) EFTs that possess an ultra-violet complete embedding versus those that do not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short paper we want to generalize some recent concepts related to stubs in open string field theory. First, we modify the auxiliary field method by Erbin and Firat [#Erbin2023] to non-BPZ even sliver frame stubs. We then also show that the construction is consistent at the full quantum level without any additional assumptions. Finally, we apply the method explicitly to the tachyon vacuum and the simplest identity-like solution.</description>

      <title>A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically an Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</description>

      <title>Graded transcendental functions: an application to four-point amplitudes with one off-shell leg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a general method for constructing a minimal basis of transcendental functions tailored to a scattering amplitude. Starting with formal solutions for all master integral topologies, we grade the appearing functions by properties such as their symbol alphabet or letter adjacency. We rotate the basis such that functions with spurious features appear in the least possible number of basis elements. Since their coefficients must vanish for physical quantities, this approach avoids complex cancellations. As a first application, we evaluate all integral topologies relevant to the three-loop $Hggg$ and $Hgq\bar{q}$ amplitudes in the leading-colour approximation and heavy-top limit. We describe the derivation of canonical differential equation systems and present a method for fixing boundary conditions without the need for a full functional representation. Using multiple numerical reductions, we test the maximal transcendentality conjecture for $Hggg$ and identify a new letter which appears in functions of weight 4 and 5. In addition, we provide the first direct analytic computation of a three-point form factor of the operator $\mathrm{Tr}(\phi^2)$ in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM and find agreement with numerical and bootstrapped results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass spectra are calculated for ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD and SQCD-type theories and for softly broken ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD in vacua with unbroken $Z_{(2N_c-N_F)\geq 2}$ symmetry. It is shown that the Seiberg ${\cal N}=1$ duality works, at best, for massless quarks within the conformal window only.
  Besides: a) the gauge invariant order parameter for scalar quarks is introduced which distinguishes confinement and higgs phases, b) the phase transition are described in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD-type and broken ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD theories between confinement and higgs phases, c) the confinement mechanism is proposed for the ordinary QCD and ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD theories.</description>

      <title>First few overtones probe the event horizon geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is broadly believed that quasinormal modes cannot tell the black-hole near-horizon geometry, because usually the low-lying modes are determined by the scattering of perturbations around the peak of the effective potential. Using the general parametrization of the black-hole spacetimes respecting the generic post-Newtonian asymptotic, we will show that tiny modifications of the Schwarzschild/Kerr geometry in a relatively small region near the event horizon lead to almost the same Schwarzschild/Kerr fundamental mode, but totally different first few overtones. Having in mind that the first several overtones affect the quasinormal ringing at its early and intermediate stage [M. Giesler, M. Isi, M. Scheel, and S. Teukolsky, Phys. Rev. X 9, 041060 (2019)], we argue that the near-horizon geometry could in principle be studied via the first few overtones of the quasinormal spectrum, which is important because corrections to the Einstein theory must modify precisely the near-horizon geometry, keeping the known weak field regime.</description>

Abstract: We prove a formula for the ${\mathbb S}_n$-equivariant Euler characteristic of the moduli space of graphs $\mathcal{MG}_{g,n}$. Moreover, we prove that the rational ${\mathbb S}_n$-invariant cohomology of $\mathcal{MG}_{g,n}$ stabilizes for large $n$. That means, if $n \geq g \geq 2$, then there are isomorphisms $H^k(\mathcal{MG}_{g,n};\mathbb{Q})^{{\mathbb S}_n} \rightarrow H^k(\mathcal{MG}_{g,n+1};\mathbb{Q})^{{\mathbb S}_{n+1}}$ for all $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15147v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to T-duality based on Courant algebroid relations which subsumes the usual T-duality as well as its various generalisations. Starting from a relational description for the reduction of exact Courant algebroids over foliated manifolds, we introduce a weakened notion of generalised isometries that captures the generalised geometry counterpart of Riemannian submersions when applied to transverse generalised metrics. This is used to construct T-dual backgrounds as generalised metrics on reduced Courant algebroids which are related by a generalised isometry. We prove an existence and uniqueness result for generalised isometric exact Courant algebroids coming from reductions. We demonstrate that our construction reproduces standard T-duality relations based on correspondence spaces. We also describe how it applies to generalised T-duality transformations of almost para-Hermitian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Precision reconstruction of rational CFT from exact fixed point tensor network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18005v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The novel concept of entanglement renormalization and its corresponding tensor network renormalization technique have been highly successful in developing a controlled real space renormalization group (RG) scheme. Numerically approximate fixed-point (FP) tensors are widely used to extract the conformal data of the underlying conformal field theory (CFT) describing critical phenomena. In this paper, we present an explicit analytical construction of the FP tensor for 2D rational CFT. We define it as a correlation function between the "boundary-changing operators" on triangles. Our construction fully captures all the real-space RG conditions. We also provide concrete examples, such as Ising, Yang-Lee and Tri-critical Ising models to compute the scaling dimensions explicitly based on the corresponding FP tensor. Interestingly, our construction of FP tensors is closely related to a strange correlator, where the holographic picture naturally emerges. Our results also open a new door towards understanding CFT in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>The pseudospectra of black holes in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08352v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of quasinormal modes (QNMs) in electrically charged black brane spacetimes that asymptote to AdS by means of the pseudospectrum. Methodologically, we adopt ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates to cast QNMs in terms of a generalised eigenvalue problem involving a non-selfadjoint operator; this simplifies the computation significantly in comparison with previous results in the literature. Our analysis reveals spectral instability for (neutral) scalar as well as gravitoelectric perturbations. This indicates that the equilibration process of perturbed black branes is sensitive to external perturbations. Particular attention is given on the hydrodynamic modes, which are found to be the least unstable. In contrast with computations in hyperboloidal coordinates, we find that the pseudospectral contour lines cross to the upper half plane. This indicates the existence of pseudo-resonances as well as the possibility of transient instabilities. We also investigate the asymptotic structure of pseudospectral contour levels and we find remarkable universality across all sectors, persistent in the extremal limit.</description>

Abstract: We investigate detailed properties of imaginary rotating matter with gluons and quarks at high temperature. Previously, we showed that imaginary rotation induces perturbative confinement of gluons at the rotation center. We perturbatively calculate the Polyakov loop potential and find inhomogeneous confinement above a certain threshold of imaginary angular velocity. We also evaluate the quark contribution to the Polyakov loop potential and confirm that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the perturbatively confined phase.</description>

      <title>String-based parametrization of nucleon GPDs at any skewness: a comparison to lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a string-based parametrization for nucleon quark and gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) valid at all skewness values. The conformal moments of the GPDs are expressed as sums of the spin-j nucleon A-form factor, and the skewness-dependent spin-j nucleon D-form factor. This representation, which fulfills the polynomiality condition (due to Lorentz invariance) and does not rely on model-specific assumptions, is derived from t-channel string exchanges in AdS spaces. The spin-j nucleon D-form factor is closely related to the the spin-j nucleon A-form factor. We use the Mellin moments from empirical parton distributions to model the spin-j nucleon A-form factors. Using only five Regge slope parameters, fixed from the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, our string-based parametrization generates accurate singlet, non-singlet, isovector, and flavor-separated nucleon quark GPDs, along with symmetric nucleon gluon GPDs from their Mellin-Barnes integral representations. Our isovector nucleon quark GPD is in agreement with existing lattice data. Our string-based parametrization should facilitate the empirical extraction and global analysis of nucleon GPDs in exclusive processes, bypassing the deconvolution challenge.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and linear holographic hard wall models for light unflavored mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider anomalous and linear holographic hard wall (HW) models for light unflavored mesons inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence. The anomalous dimensions depend on the logarithm of the spin S of the meson state and come from a semiclassical analysis of gauge/string duality. The anomalous HW model produces very good masses and good Regge trajectories for mesons compared with PDG data. Inspired by this anomalous HW model we also propose a phenomenological modification of the dimension of the boundary operators such that the model produces asymptotic linear Regge trajectories. Both anomalous HW models considered here present mass percentage deviations of less than 3%, when compared with PDG data.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuations and Many-Body Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many-body systems with U(1) global symmetry, the charge fluctuations in a subregion reveal important insights into entanglement and other global properties. For subregions with sharp corners, bipartite fluctuations have been predicted to exhibit a universal shape dependence on the corner angle in certain quantum phases and transitions, characterized by a "universal angle function" and a "universal coefficient." However, we demonstrate that this simple formula is insufficient for charge insulators, including composite fermi liquids. In these systems, the corner contribution may depend on the corner angle, subregion orientation, and other microscopic details. We provide an infinite series representation of the corner term, introducing orientation-resolved universal angle functions with their non-universal coefficients. In the small-angle limit or under orientation averaging, the remaining terms' coefficients are fully determined by the many-body quantum metric, which, while not universal, adheres to both a universal topological lower bound and an energetic upper bound. We also clarify the conditions for bound saturation in (anisotropic) Landau levels, leveraging the generalized Kohn theorem and holomorphic properties of many-body wavefunctions. We find that a broad class of fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions, including unprojected parton states and composite-fermion Fermi sea wavefunctions, saturates the bounds.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical instanton theory for reaction rates at any temperature: How a rigorous real-time derivation solves the crossover temperature problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instanton theory relates the rate constant for tunneling through a barrier to the periodic classical trajectory on the upturned potential energy surface whose period is $\tau=\hbar/(k_{\rm B}T)$. Unfortunately, the standard theory is only applicable below the "crossover temperature", where the periodic orbit first appears. This paper presents a rigorous semiclassical ($\hbar\to0$) theory for the rate that is valid at any temperature. The theory is derived by combining Bleistein's method for generating uniform asymptotic expansions with a real-time modification of Richardson's flux-correlation function derivation of instanton theory. The resulting theory smoothly connects the instanton result at low temperature to the parabolic correction to Eyring transition state theory at high-temperature. Although the derivation involves real time, the final theory only involves imaginary-time (thermal) properties, consistent with the standard version of instanton theory. Therefore, it is no more difficult to compute than the standard theory. The theory is illustrated with application to model systems, where it is shown to give excellent numerical results. Finally, the first-principles approach taken here results in a number of advantages over previous attempts to extend the imaginary free-energy formulation of instanton theory. In addition to producing a theory that is a smooth (continuously differentiable) function of temperature, the derivation also naturally incorporates hyperasymptotic (i.e. multi-orbit) terms, and provides a framework for further extensions of the theory.</description>

      <title>A simple gravitational self-decoherence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the greatest debates of our time is whether our macroscopic world (i) naturally emerges from quantum mechanics or (ii) requires new physics. We argue for (ii) and propose a simple gravitational self-decoherence mechanism. The purity loss for a free quantum particle is evaluated and shown to be extremely inefficient for elementary particles but very effective for those at the Planck scale. The physical picture behind it is that coherence would easily leak from heavy enough particles to (non-observable) spacetime quantum degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Quantum K-Rings of Partial Flag Varieties, Coulomb Branches, and the Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15575v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a purely geometric explanation of the coincidence between the Coulomb Branch equations for the 3D GLSM describing the quantum $K$-theory of a flag variety, and the Bethe Ansatz equations of the 5-vertex lattice model. In doing so, we prove two explicit presentations for the quantum $K$-ring of the flag variety, resolving conjectures of Gu-Sharpe-Mihalcea-Xu-Zhang-Zou and Rimanyi-Tarasov-Varchenko. We also prove that the stable map and quasimap $K$-theory of the partial flag varieties are isomorphic, using the work of Koroteev-Pushkar-Smirnov-Zeitlin identifying the latter ring with the Bethe algebra of the 5-vertex lattice model. Our isomorphism gives a more explicit description of the quantum tautological bundles described in the quasimap ring.</description>

      <title>Direct proof of one-hook scaling property for Alexander polynomial from Reshetikhin-Turaev formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that normalized colored Alexander polynomial (the $A \rightarrow 1$ limit of colored HOMFLY-PT polynomial) evaluated for one-hook (L-shape) representation R possesses scaling property: it is equal to the fundamental Alexander polynomial with the substitution $q \rightarrow q^{|R|}$. The proof is simple and direct use of Reshetikhin-Turaev formalism to get all required R-matrices.</description>
