      <title>Chaos in high-dimensional dynamical systems with tunable non-reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional dynamical systems of interacting degrees of freedom are ubiquitous in the study of complex systems. When the directed interactions are totally uncorrelated, sufficiently strong and non-linear, many of these systems exhibit a chaotic attractor characterized by a positive maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE). On the contrary, when the interactions are completely symmetric, the dynamics takes the form of a gradient descent on a carefully defined cost function, and it exhibits slow dynamics and aging. In this work, we consider the intermediate case in which the interactions are partially symmetric, with a parameter {\alpha} tuning the degree of non-reciprocity. We show that for any value of {\alpha} for which the corresponding system has non-reciprocal interactions, the dynamics lands on a chaotic attractor. Correspondingly, the MLE is a non-monotonous function of the degree of non-reciprocity. This implies that conservative forcing deriving from the gradient field of a rough energy landscape can make the system more chaotic.</description>

      <title>Spin-aligned butterfly spectral map in Non-Hermitian quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Non-Hermitian spinful Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model in the presence of Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and a spatially varying textured magnetic field is studied. Interestingly, our analysis produces a butterfly spectral map due to the non-trivial extent of localization of the states in the spectrum. This spectral map also exhibits an asymmetric spin alignment with respect to the wings of the butterfly. Our analysis also suggests that the onset of such a spectral map is a combined effect of the non-hermiticity, spin-orbit interaction, and the textured magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Beyond the imbalance: site-resolved dynamics probing resonances in many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the limitations of using imbalance dynamics as a diagnostic tool for many-body localization (MBL) and show that spatial averaging can mask important microscopic features. Focusing on the strongly disordered regime of the random-field XXZ chain, we use state-of-the-art numerical techniques (Krylov time evolution and full diagonalization) to demonstrate that site-resolved spin autocorrelators reveal a rich and complex dynamical behavior that is obscured by the imbalance observable. By analyzing the time evolution and infinite-time limits of these local probes, we reveal resonant structures and rare local instabilities within the MBL phase. These numerical findings are supported by an analytical, few-site toy model that captures the emergence of a multiple-peak structure in local magnetization histograms, which is a hallmark of local resonances. These few-body local effects provide a more detailed understanding of ergodicity-breaking dynamics, and also allow us to explain the finite-size effects of long-time imbalance, and its sensitivity to the initial conditions in quench protocols. Overall, our experimentally testable predictions highlight the necessity of a refined, site-resolved approach to fully understand the complexities of MBL and its connection to rare-region effects.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Dynamical Heterogeneity in Active Glasses as a Signature of Violation of Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) systems have attracted renewed interest within the scientific community due to their anomalous dynamical behaviors, which arise from long-wavelength density fluctuations as predicted by the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg (MWH) theorem. In equilibrium, it is well established that continuous spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in 2D is prohibited at any finite temperature ($T &gt; 0$), resulting in the absence of true long-range positional order and establishing $d_l = 2$ as the lower critical dimension. Recent studies have demonstrated that, in active systems, the lower critical dimension can shift from $d_l = 2$ to $3$. This study examines the impact of MWH theorem violation in active systems on dynamical heterogeneity (DH). As a minimal model, glassy systems of active particles undergoing run-and-tumble (RT) motion are considered. Glass-like dynamical behavior, including anomalously enhanced DH, is observed in various biological systems such as collective cell migration, bacterial cytoplasm, and ant colonies. Furthermore, the study investigates the influence of local positional order, or medium-range crystalline order (MRCO), on DH in the presence of activity. The results indicate that the growth of DH with increasing activity differs significantly between systems with and without MRCO. These findings may have important implications, as many biological systems exhibit local structural ordering, and DH could serve as a useful indicator for quantifying the degree of ordering.</description>

      <title>Robust Reasoning as a Symmetry-Protected Topological Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models suffer from "hallucinations"-logical inconsistencies induced by semantic noise. We propose that current architectures operate in a "Metric Phase," where causal order is vulnerable to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we identify robust inference as an effective Symmetry-Protected Topological phase, where logical operations are formally isomorphic to non-Abelian anyon braiding, replacing fragile geometric interpolation with robust topological invariants. Empirically, we demonstrate a sharp topological phase transition: while Transformers and RNNs exhibit gapless decay, our Holonomic Network reveals a macroscopic "mass gap," maintaining invariant fidelity below a critical noise threshold. Furthermore, in a variable-binding task on $S_{10}$ ($3.6 \times 10^6$ states) representing symbolic manipulation, we demonstrate holonomic generalization: the topological model maintains perfect fidelity extrapolating $100\times$ beyond training ($L=50 \to 5000$), consistent with a theoretically indefinite causal horizon, whereas Transformers lose logical coherence. Ablation studies indicate this protection emerges strictly from non-Abelian gauge symmetry. This provides strong evidence for a new universality class for logical reasoning, linking causal stability to the topology of the semantic manifold.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Long Wavelength Mermin-Wagner Fluctuations in Active Crystals and Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensions (2D), the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg (MWH) fluctuation plays a significant role, giving rise to striking dimensionality effects marked by long-range density fluctuations leading to the singularities of various dynamical properties. According to the MWH theorem, a 2D equilibrium system with continuous degrees of freedom cannot achieve long-range crystalline order at non-zero temperatures. Recently, MWH fluctuations have been observed in glass-forming liquids, evidenced by the logarithmic divergence in the plateau value of mean squared displacement (MSD). Our research investigates long-wavelength fluctuations in crystalline and glassy systems influenced by non-equilibrium active noises. Active systems serve as a minimal model for understanding diverse non-equilibrium dynamics, such as those in biological systems and self-propelled colloids. We demonstrate that fluctuations from active forces can strongly couple with long-wavelength density fluctuations, altering the lower critical dimension ($d_l$) from $2$ to $3$ and leading to a novel logarithmic divergence of the MSD plateau with system size in 3D.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Liquids Stabilized by Disorder in Non-Kramers Pyrochlores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum spin liquid phases in pyrochlore oxides with non-Kramers ions, in which structural randomness effectively acts as a transverse field, introducing quantum fluctuations on top of the spin ice manifold. This is contrary to the naive expectation that disorder favors phases with short-range entanglement by adjusting the spins with their local environment. We study a minimal model for a disordered quantum spin ice, the transverse-field Ising model, using a real-space formulation of the gauge mean-field theory. This approach allows the inclusion of non-perturbative disorder effects exactly, and thus to assess the stability of the spin-liquid phase with respect to the disorder. The analysis shows that the quantum spin ice remains remarkably stable with respect to disorder up to the transition to the polarized phase at high fields, indicating that it can occur in real materials. A Griffiths region of enhanced disorder-induced fluctuations is restricted to the immediate vicinity of this transition due to the peculiar nature of the low-energy excitations of the problem. For most of the phase diagram, an average description of the disorder captures the physical behavior well, indicating that the inhomogeneous quantum spin ice behaves closely to its homogeneous counterpart.</description>
