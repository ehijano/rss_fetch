      <title>Optimising image capture for low-light widefield quantitative fluorescence microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-light optical imaging refers to the use of cameras to capture images with minimal photon flux. This area has broad application to diverse fields, including optical microscopy for biological studies. In such studies, it is important to reduce the intensity of illumination to reduce adverse effects such as photobleaching and phototoxicity that may perturb the biological system under study. The challenge when minimising illumination is to maintain image quality that reflects the underlying biology and can be used for quantitative measurements. An example is the optical redox ratio which is computed from autofluorescence intensity to measure metabolism. In all such cases, it is critical for researchers to optimise selection and application of scientific cameras to their microscopes, but few resources discuss performance in the low-light regime. In this tutorial, we address the challenges in optical fluorescence imaging at low-light levels for quantitative microscopy, with an emphasis on live biological samples. We analyse the performance of specialised low-light scientific cameras such as the EMCCD, qCMOS, and sCMOS, while considering the differences in platform architecture and the contribution of various sources of noise. The tutorial covers a detailed discussion of user-controllable parameters, as well as the application of post-processing algorithms for denoising. We illustrate these concepts using autofluorescence images of live mammalian embryos captured with a two-photon light sheet fluorescence microscope.</description>

      <title>Peptide-GPT: Generative Design of Peptides using Generative Pre-trained Transformers and Bio-informatic Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, natural language processing (NLP) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains beyond traditional text generation. In this work, we introduce PeptideGPT, a protein language model tailored to generate protein sequences with distinct properties: hemolytic activity, solubility, and non-fouling characteristics. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation of these generated sequences, we established a comprehensive evaluation pipeline consisting of ideas from bioinformatics to retain valid proteins with ordered structures. First, we rank the generated sequences based on their perplexity scores, then we filter out those lying outside the permissible convex hull of proteins. Finally, we predict the structure using ESMFold and select the proteins with pLDDT values greater than 70 to ensure ordered structure. The properties of generated sequences are evaluated using task-specific classifiers - PeptideBERT and HAPPENN. We achieved an accuracy of 76.26% in hemolytic, 72.46% in non-hemolytic, 78.84% in non-fouling, and 68.06% in solubility protein generation. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PeptideGPT in de novo protein design and underscore the potential of leveraging NLP-based approaches for paving the way for future innovations and breakthroughs in synthetic biology and bioinformatics.

      <title>Electromechanical Dynamics of the Heart: A Study of Cardiac Hysteresis During Physical Stress Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are best diagnosed using multiple modalities that assess both the heart's electrical and mechanical functions. While effective, imaging techniques like echocardiography and nuclear imaging are costly and not widely accessible. More affordable technologies, such as simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiography (PCG), may provide valuable insights into electromechanical coupling and could be useful for prescreening in low-resource settings.
  Using physical stress test data from the EPHNOGRAM ECG-PCG dataset, collected from 23 healthy male subjects (age: 25.4+/-1.9 yrs), we investigated electromechanical intervals (RR, QT, systolic, and diastolic) and their interactions during exercise, along with hysteresis between cardiac electrical activity and mechanical responses.
  Time delay analysis revealed distinct temporal relationships between QT, systolic, and diastolic intervals, with RR as the primary driver. The diastolic interval showed near-synchrony with RR, while QT responded to RR interval changes with an average delay of 10.5s, and the systolic interval responded more slowly, with an average delay of 28.3s. We examined QT-RR, systolic-RR, and diastolic-RR hysteresis, finding narrower loops for diastolic RR and wider loops for systolic RR. Significant correlations (average:0.75) were found between heart rate changes and hysteresis loop areas, suggesting the equivalent circular area diameter as a promising biomarker for cardiac function under exercise stress.
  Deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Networks, estimated the QT, systolic, and diastolic intervals from RR data, confirming the nonlinear relationship between RR and other intervals. Findings highlight a significant cardiac memory effect, linking ECG and PCG morphology and timing to heart rate history.</description>

      <title>Decomposing force fields as flows on graphs reconstructed from stochastic trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disentangling irreversible and reversible forces from random fluctuations is a challenging problem in the analysis of stochastic trajectories measured from real-world dynamical systems. We present an approach to approximate the dynamics of a stationary Langevin process as a discrete-state Markov process evolving over a graph-representation of phase-space, reconstructed from stochastic trajectories. Next, we utilise the analogy of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of an edge-flow on a contractible simplicial complex with the associated decomposition of a stochastic process into its irreversible and reversible parts. This allows us to decompose our reconstructed flow and to differentiate between the irreversible currents and reversible gradient flows underlying the stochastic trajectories. We validate our approach on a range of solvable and nonlinear systems and apply it to derive insight into the dynamics of flickering red-blood cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. In particular, we capture the difference in irreversible circulating currents between healthy and passive cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. Our method breaks new ground at the interface of data-driven approaches to stochastic dynamics and graph signal processing, with the potential for further applications in the analysis of biological experiments and physiological recordings. Finally, it prompts future analysis of the convergence of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition in discrete and continuous spaces.</description>
