      <title>Elucidating balling mechanism in laser melting of tantalum using in-situ X-ray imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the laser welding and additive manufacturing (AM) communities, the balling defect is primarily attributed to the action of fluid instabilities with a few authors suggesting other mechanisms. Without commenting on the validity of the fluid instability driven \textit{mechanism} of balling in AM, this work intends to present the most realistic analytical discussion of the balling defect driven purely by fluid instabilities. Synchrotron-based X-ray radiography of thin samples indicate that fluid instability growth rates and solidification can be comparable in magnitude and thus compete. Neglecting the action of fluid flows and heat transport, this work presents an analytical formalism which accounts for fluid instabilities and solidification competition, giving a continuous transition from balling to non-balling which is lacking in current literature. We adapt a Rivulet instability model from the fluid physics community to account for the stabilizing effects of the substrate which the Plateau-Rayleigh instability model does not account for, and estimate the instability growth rate. Our model predicts instability growth at higher wavelengths and shallower melt pool depths relative to width, as well as strong sensitivity to the solidification front curvature. Deviations between model predictions and our experimental results demonstrate the importance of fluid flows and heat transport in the balling process. Our experiments further demonstrate at least one mechanism by which the melt pool length and balling wavelength are not equivalent, as commonly claimed.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Brownian coagulation in the spatial mixing layer based on average kernel coupled with iterative direct numerical simulation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the evolution of nanoparticle populations undergoing Brownian coagulation in a spatial mixing layer. The dynamics of particle size distribution and number concentration are analyzed using a coupled Eulerian approach that combines fluid dynamics with aerosol dynamics. The mixing layer serves as a fundamental flow configuration to understand particle-vortex interactions and their effect on coagulation rates. Results demonstrate that the shear-induced spatial mixing significantly influences the spatial distribution of nanoparticles and their subsequent coagulation behavior. The enhanced mixing in the shear layer leads to locally increased particle collision frequencies, accelerating the coagulation process compared to laminar conditions. The study reveals that the evolution of the particle size distribution is strongly dependent on both the local vorticity intensity and the initial particle concentration gradients across the mixing layer.</description>

      <title>Impact of transverse strain on linear, transitional and self-similar turbulent mixing layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of interfacial instabilities such as the Rayleigh-Taylor (RTI) and Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) are modified when developing in convergent geometries. Whilst these modifications are usually quantified by the compression rate and convergence rate of the mixing layer, an alternative framework is proposed, describing the evolution of the mixing layer through the effects of the mean strain rates experienced by the mixing layer. An investigation into the effect of the transverse strain rate on the mixing layer development is conducted through application of transverse strain rates in planar geometry. A model for the linear regime in planar geometry with transverse strain rate is derived, with equivalent solutions to convergent geometry, and validated with two-dimensional simulations demonstrating the amplification of the instability growth under transverse compression. The effect of the transverse strain rate on the transitional-to-turbulent mixing layer is investigated with implicit large eddy simulation based on the multi-mode quarter-scale $\theta$-group case by Thornber et al. (Phys. Fluids, vol. 29, 2017, 105107). The mixing layer's growth exhibits the opposite trend to the linear regime model, with reduced growth under transverse compression. The effect of shear-production under transverse compression causes the mixing layer to become more mixed and the turbulent kinetic energy is increasingly dominated by the transverse directions, deviating from the unstrained self-similar state. The mixing layer width is able to be predicted by adjusting the buoyancy-drag model by Youngs &amp; Thornber (Physica D, vol. 410, 2020, 132517) to utilise a drag length scale that scales with the transverse expansion.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Modelling of Mixing Layers under Anisotropic Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of turbulent mixing layers can be altered by the application of anisotropic strain rates, potentially arising from radial motion in convergent geometry or movement through non-uniform geometry. Previous closure models and calibrations of compressible turbulence models tend to focus on incompressible flows or isotropic strain cases, which is in contrast to many real flow conditions. The treatment of bulk compression under anisotropic strain is investigated using the K-L turbulence model, a two-equation Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model that is commonly used for simulating interfacial instabilities. One-dimensional simulations of shock-induced turbulent mixing layers under applied axial or transverse strain rates are performed using three different closures for the bulk compression of the turbulent length scale. The default closure method using the mean isotropic strain rate is able to reasonably predict the integral width and turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing layer under the applied strain rates. However, the K-L model's performance is improved with the transverse strain closure, while the axial strain closure worsens the model. The effects of this new closure are investigated for the buoyancy-drag model, showing that a three-equation model which evolves the integral width and turbulent length scale separately is most effective for modelling anisotropic strain. Through the equivalence of two-equation RANS models, the modification of the bulk compression closure for the turbulent length scale also suggests an alteration to the K-$\epsilon$ and K-$\omega$ models.</description>

      <title>Data-driven correlations for thermohydraulic roughness properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of rough surfaces on fluid flow is characterized by the downward shift in the logarithmic layer of velocity and temperature profiles, namely the velocity roughness function $\Delta U^+$ and the corresponding temperature roughness function $\Delta \Theta^+$. Their computation relies on computational simulations, and hence a simple prediction without such simulation is envisioned. We present a framework, where a data-driven model is developed using the dataset of Yang et al. 2023 \cite{yang_2023} with $93$ high fidelity direct numerical simulations of a fully-developed turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau \approx 800$ and $Pr = 0.71$. The model provides robust predictive capabilities (mean squared error $\text{MSE}_{k} = 0.09$ and $\text{MSE}_\theta = 0.096$), but lacks interpretability. Simplistic statistical roughness parameters provide a more understandable route, so the framework is extended with a symbolic regression approach to distill an empirical correlation from the data-driven model. The derived expression leads to a predictive correlation for the equivalent sand-grain roughness $k_\text{s} = k_\text{99} (ES_x ( - ES_x + Sk + 2.37) + 0.772)$ with reasonable predictive powers. The predictive capability of the temperature roughness function is subject to limitations due to the missing Prandtl-number variation in the dataset. Nevertheless, the interpretable correlation and the neural network as well as the original dataset can be used to explore the roughness functions. The functional form of the derived correlations, along with visual analysis of these surfaces, suggests a strong relationship with roughness wavelengths, further linking them to explanations based on sheltered and windward regions.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric boundary layer over urban roughness: validation of large-eddy simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study presents wall-modeled large-eddy simulations (LES) characterizing the flow features of a neutral atmospheric boundary layer over two urban-like roughness geometries: an array of three-dimensional square prisms and the 'Michel-Stadt' geometry model. The former is an arrangement of idealized building blocks. The latter mimics a typical central European urban geometry. In both cases, the incident wind angle is $0^\circ$. The Reynolds number for each case are $Re_H = 5.0 \times 10^6$ and $8.0 \times 10^6$, respectively ($Re_H = U_{ref} H/\nu$ with $U_{ref}$ and $H$ denoting the reference velocity and building height, respectively, and $\nu$ the kinematic viscosity). The LES employs a high-order, low-dissipation numerical scheme with a spatial resolution of 0.75m within the urban canopy. An online precursor simulation ensures realistic turbulent inflow conditions. The simulations performed successfully captures mean-velocity profiles, wake regions, and rooftop acceleration, with excellent agreement in the streamwise velocity component. While turbulent kinetic energy is well predicted at most locations, minor discrepancies are observed near the ground. The analysis of scatter plots and validation metrics (FAC2 and hit rate) shows that LES predictions outperform the standard criteria commonly used in urban flow simulations, while spectral analysis verifies that LES accurately resolves the turbulent energy cascade over approximately two frequency decades. The Kolmogorov -2/3 slope in the pre-multiplied spectra has been well reproduced below and above the urban canopy. These findings reinforce the importance of spectral analysis in LES validation and highlight the potential of high-order methods for LES of urban flows.</description>

      <title>Application of machine learning algorithm in temperature field reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the stratification patterns and dynamic evolution of reservoir water temperatures, aiming to estimate and reconstruct the temperature field using limited and noisy local measurement data. Due to complex measurement environments and technical limitations, obtaining complete temperature information for reservoirs is highly challenging. Therefore, accurately reconstructing the temperature field from a small number of local data points has become a critical scientific issue. To address this, the study employs Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and sparse representation methods to reconstruct the temperature field based on temperature data from a limited number of local measurement points. The results indicate that satisfactory reconstruction can be achieved when the number of POD basis functions is set to 2 and the number of measurement points is 10. Under different water intake depths, the reconstruction errors of both POD and sparse representation methods remain stable at around 0.15, fully validating the effectiveness of these methods in reconstructing the temperature field based on limited local temperature data. Additionally, the study further explores the distribution characteristics of reconstruction errors for POD and sparse representation methods under different water level intervals, analyzing the optimal measurement point layout scheme and potential limitations of the reconstruction methods in this case. This research not only effectively reduces measurement costs and computational resource consumption but also provides a new technical approach for reservoir temperature analysis, holding significant theoretical and practical importance.</description>

Abstract: To address the computational challenges posed by nonlinear collision kernels in the Smoluchowski equation, this study proposes a universal preprocessing algorithm for the average kernel method based on the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature for double integrals. With this algorithm, the numerical code accurately and efficiently determines the pre-exponential factor of the average kernel. Additionally, the exact pre-exponential factors of the four fundamental average kernels and their associated truncation error estimations were analyzed. The results demonstrate the reasonability and reliability of the preprocessing algorithm.</description>

      <title>Controlling deposition and characterising dynamics of thin liquid films with high temporal and spatial resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high inertia of classical fluid coating processes severely limits the possibility of controlling the deposited film thickness through the entrainment velocity. We describe and characterize a new experimental device where the inertia is dramatically reduced, allowing for millimeter-scale patterning with micrometer-accurate thickness. Measuring precise film profiles over large spatial extents with high temporal resolution poses a challenge, which we overcome using a custom interferometric set-up coupled with state-of-the-art signal processing. The sensitivity of our method allows us to resolve film thinning rates in the nanometer-per-second range, and to quantify the relative contribution of surface-tension and gravity driven flows. We apply this method by showing that the thickness of the deposited film obeys the classical Landau-Levich scaling even when the meniscus faces important acceleration.</description>

      <title>Time-delayed Newton's law of cooling with a finite-rate thermal quench. Impact on the Mpemba and Kovacs effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba and Kovacs effects are two notable memory phenomena observed in nonequilibrium relaxation processes. In a recent study [Phys.~Rev.~E \textbf{109}, 044149 (2024)], these effects were analyzed within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling under the assumption of instantaneous temperature quenches. Here, the analysis is extended to incorporate finite-rate quenches, characterized by a nonzero quench duration $\sigma$. The results indicate that a genuine Mpemba effect is absent under finite-rate quenches if both samples experience the same thermal environment during the quenching process. However, if $\sigma$ remains sufficiently small, the deviations in the thermal environment stay within an acceptable range, allowing the Mpemba effect to persist with a slightly enhanced magnitude. In contrast, the Kovacs effect is significantly amplified, with the transient hump in the temperature evolution becoming more pronounced as both the waiting time and $\sigma$ increase. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating finite-time effects in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation models and offer a more realistic perspective for experimental studies.</description>

      <title>A Digital Urban Twin Enabling Interactive Pollution Predictions and Enhanced Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology is increasingly used in urban planning, leveraging real-time data integration for environmental monitoring. This paper presents an urban-focused DT that combines computational fluid dynamics simulations with live meteorological data to analyze pollution dispersion. Addressing the health impacts of pollutants like particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, the DT provides real-time updates on air quality, wind speed, and direction. Using OpenStreetMaps XML-based data, the model distinguishes between porous elements like trees and solid structures, enhancing urban flow analysis. The framework employs the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) within the open-source software OpenLB to simulate pollution transport. Nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter concentrations are estimated based on traffic and building emissions, enabling hot-spot identification. The DT was used from November 7 to 23, 2024, with hourly updates, capturing pollution trends influenced by wind patterns. Results show that alternating east-west winds during this period create a dynamic pollution distribution, identifying critical residential exposure areas. This work contributes a novel DT framework that integrates real-time meteorological data, OpenStreetMap-based geometry, and high-fidelity LBM simulations for urban wind and pollution modeling. Unlike existing DTs, which focus on structural monitoring or large-scale environmental factors, this approach enables fine-grained, dynamic analyses of urban airflow and pollution dispersion. By allowing interactive modifications to urban geometry and continuous data updates, the DT serves as a powerful tool for adaptive urban planning, supporting evidence-based policy making to improve air quality and public health.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In analogy with the non-Abelian gauge helicities conserved in time for ``null fields", that we have defined previously, in this paper we first define non-Abelian fluid helicities and then total non-Abelian helicities for combined non-Abelian fluid and gauge fields. For a U(N) group the helicities considered are for both gluonic-type fluids, composed of particles in the adjoint representation, and quark-type fluids, in the $N$-dimensional Cartan subalgebra. We write down various Lagrangian formulations for the uncoupled and coupled systems. In each case we determine the equations of motion, symmetries, and a Hamiltonian formulation. Taking the velocity of the fluid in the adjoint representation, we find that in the case of the gluonic fluid, we can write a non-Abelian gluonic fluid Euler-Yang-Mills equation that conserves the defined helicities, and comes from a Lagrangian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalized composite dynamics framework is presented for the lattice Boltzmann method. It leverages synergies of various simple collision operators to model intertwined physical processes, capturing complex behavior. The framework is validated by recovering partial bounceback fluid flow methods. Systematic derivation in our framework provides mathematical justification for the incorporation of forces, addressing a gap in the literature. The versatility of this framework is demonstrated by analyzing a robin boundary condition. Moreover, two new dynamics are proposed using our generalized framework, namely the partial robin boundary condition, and transfer partial bounceback. The generalized composite dynamics framework opens innovative possibilities for simulating complex phenomena using lattice Boltzmann methods, demonstrated here with sub-grid wall reactions and reactive porous media.</description>

      <title>Active flow control for drag reduction through multi-agent reinforcement learning on a turbulent cylinder at $Re_D=3900$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents novel drag reduction active-flow-control (AFC) strategies} for a three-dimensional cylinder immersed in a flow at a Reynolds number based on freestream velocity and cylinder diameter of $Re_D=3900$. The cylinder in this subcritical flow regime has been extensively studied in the literature and is considered a classic case of turbulent flow arising from a bluff body. The strategies presented are explored through the use of deep reinforcement learning. The cylinder is equipped with 10 independent zero-net-mass-flux jet pairs, distributed on the top and bottom surfaces, which define the AFC setup. The method is based on the coupling between a computational-fluid-dynamics solver and a multi-agent reinforcement-learning (MARL) framework using the proximal-policy-optimization algorithm. This work introduces a multi-stage training approach to expand the exploration space and enhance drag reduction stabilization. By accelerating training through the exploitation of local invariants with MARL, a drag reduction of approximately 9% is achieved. The cooperative closed-loop strategy developed by the agents is sophisticated, as it utilizes a wide bandwidth of mass-flow-rate frequencies, which classical control methods are unable to match. Notably, the mass cost efficiency is demonstrated to be two orders of magnitude lower than that of classical control methods reported in the literature. These developments represent a significant advancement in active flow control in turbulent regimes, critical for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Near-inertial echoes of ageostrophic instability in submesoscale filaments</title>

Abstract: Ocean submesoscales, flows with characteristic size around 10m--10km, are transitional between the larger, rotationally-constrained mesoscale and three-dimensional turbulence. In this paper we present simulations of a submesoscale ocean filament. The strong vertical transport associated with submesoscale fronts and filaments ventilates the deeper water and provides a route for the observed forward cascade of energy in the ocean. In our case, the filament is strongly sheared in both vertical and cross-filament directions and is unstable. Instability indeed dominates the early behaviour with a fast extraction of kinetic energy from the vertically sheared thermal wind. The filament is expected to be subject to instabilities, including symmetric and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. An instability emerges with a circulation that does not match either, though symmetric modes become apparent later. The action of the instability is sufficiently rapid that the filament does not respond in a geostrophically balanced sense. Instead, it later exhibits vertically sheared near-inertial oscillations with higher amplitude as the initial minimum Richardson number decreases. Horizontal gradients strengthen only briefly as the fronts restratify. These unstable filaments can be generated by strong mixing events at pre-existing stable structures. The oscillations must also be considered when designing initial conditions for numerical experiments of submesoscale flows, where the initial state is intended to be balanced.</description>

      <title>Mesh-based Super-Resolution of Fluid Flows with Multiscale Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex and backward-facing step flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations. Reconstruction errors for fixed architectures were found to increase in proportion to the Reynolds number. Geometry extrapolation studies on a separate cavity flow configuration show promising cross-mesh capabilities of the super-resolution strategy.</description>

      <title>An a posteriori data-driven method for phase-averaged optical measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase-averaging is a fundamental approach for investigating periodic and non-stationary phenomena. In fluid dynamics, these can be generated by rotating blades such as propellers/turbines or by pulsed jets. Traditional phase-averaging approaches often rely on synchronized data acquisition systems, which might require high-speed cameras, light sources, and precise delay generators and encoders, making them expensive and sometimes unfeasible. This work proposes an a posteriori data-driven approach that reconstructs phase information from randomly acquired uncorrelated photographic frames (snapshots) using the ISOMAP algorithm. The technique enables accurate reordering of snapshots in the phase space and subsequent computation of the phase-averaged flow field without the need for synchronization. The framework was validated through numerical simulations and experimental fluid dynamics datasets from an optical setup featuring single- and multi-propeller configurations. The results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively captures the periodic flow characteristics while addressing the challenges related to synchronization and hardware limitations. Furthermore, the ability to apply this technique to archival datasets extends its applicability to a wide range of experimental fluid dynamics studies. This approach provides a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods for the analysis of periodic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Sampling-based Distributed Training with Message Passing Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15106v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a domain-decomposition-based distributed training and inference approach for message-passing neural networks (MPNN). Our objective is to address the challenge of scaling edge-based graph neural networks as the number of nodes increases. Through our distributed training approach, coupled with Nystr\"om-approximation sampling techniques, we present a scalable graph neural network, referred to as DS-MPNN (D and S standing for distributed and sampled, respectively), capable of scaling up to $O(10^5)$ nodes. We validate our sampling and distributed training approach on two cases: (a) a Darcy flow dataset and (b) steady RANS simulations of 2-D airfoils, providing comparisons with both single-GPU implementation and node-based graph convolution networks (GCNs). The DS-MPNN model demonstrates comparable accuracy to single-GPU implementation, can accommodate a significantly larger number of nodes compared to the single-GPU variant (S-MPNN), and significantly outperforms the node-based GCN.</description>
