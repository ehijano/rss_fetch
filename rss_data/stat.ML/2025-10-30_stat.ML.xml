      <title>Multimodal Bandits: Regret Lower Bounds and Optimal Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with i.i.d. rewards where the expected reward function is multimodal with at most m modes. We propose the first known computationally tractable algorithm for computing the solution to the Graves-Lai optimization problem, which in turn enables the implementation of asymptotically optimal algorithms for this bandit problem. The code for the proposed algorithms is publicly available at https://github.com/wilrev/MultimodalBandits</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction Beyond the Horizon: Distribution-Free Inference for Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL) in high-stakes settings. We propose a unified conformal prediction framework for infinite-horizon policy evaluation that constructs distribution-free prediction intervals {for returns} in both on-policy and off-policy settings. Our method integrates distributional RL with conformal calibration, addressing challenges such as unobserved returns, temporal dependencies, and distributional shifts. We propose a modular pseudo-return construction based on truncated rollouts and a time-aware calibration strategy using experience replay and weighted subsampling. These innovations mitigate model bias and restore approximate exchangeability, enabling uncertainty quantification even under policy shifts. Our theoretical analysis provides coverage guarantees that account for model misspecification and importance weight estimation. Empirical results, including experiments in synthetic and benchmark environments like Mountain Car, show that our method significantly improves coverage and reliability over standard distributional RL baselines.</description>

      <title>$L_1$-norm Regularized Indefinite Kernel Logistic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel logistic regression (KLR) is a powerful classification method widely applied across diverse domains. In many real-world scenarios, indefinite kernels capture more domain-specific structural information than positive definite kernels. This paper proposes a novel $L_1$-norm regularized indefinite kernel logistic regression (RIKLR) model, which extends the existing IKLR framework by introducing sparsity via an $L_1$-norm penalty. The introduction of this regularization enhances interpretability and generalization while introducing nonsmoothness and nonconvexity into the optimization landscape. To address these challenges, a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient proximal linearized algorithm is developed. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of both accuracy and sparsity.</description>

      <title>Bias-Corrected Data Synthesis for Imbalanced Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imbalanced data, where the positive samples represent only a small proportion compared to the negative samples, makes it challenging for classification problems to balance the false positive and false negative rates. A common approach to addressing the challenge involves generating synthetic data for the minority group and then training classification models with both observed and synthetic data. However, since the synthetic data depends on the observed data and fails to replicate the original data distribution accurately, prediction accuracy is reduced when the synthetic data is naively treated as the true data. In this paper, we address the bias introduced by synthetic data and provide consistent estimators for this bias by borrowing information from the majority group. We propose a bias correction procedure to mitigate the adverse effects of synthetic data, enhancing prediction accuracy while avoiding overfitting. This procedure is extended to broader scenarios with imbalanced data, such as imbalanced multi-task learning and causal inference. Theoretical properties, including bounds on bias estimation errors and improvements in prediction accuracy, are provided. Simulation results and data analysis on handwritten digit datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Projection Generation for Efficiently Solving Heterogeneous Quadratic Programming Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for efficiently solving quadratic programming (QP) problems by reducing the number of variables in high-dimensional QPs using instance-specific projection. A graph neural network-based model is designed to generate projections tailored to each QP instance, enabling us to produce high-quality solutions even for previously unseen problems. The model is trained on heterogeneous QPs to minimize the expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions. This is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem; the inner optimization solves the QP under a given projection using a QP solver, while the outer optimization updates the model parameters. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this bilevel optimization problem, which computes parameter gradients without backpropagating through the solver. We provide a theoretical analysis of the generalization ability of solving QPs with projection matrices generated by neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces high-quality feasible solutions with reduced computation time, outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Diagnostics for Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) integrates prior physical information, often in the form of differential equation constraints, into the process of fitting machine learning models to physical data. Popular PIML approaches, including neural operators, physics-informed neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and neural discrete equilibria, are typically fit to objectives that simultaneously include both data and physical constraints. However, the multi-objective nature of this approach creates ambiguity in the measurement of model quality. This is related to a poor understanding of epistemic uncertainty, and it can lead to surprising failure modes, even when existing statistical metrics suggest strong fits. Working within a Gaussian process regression framework, we introduce the Physics-Informed Log Evidence (PILE) score. Bypassing the ambiguities of test losses, the PILE score is a single, uncertainty-aware metric that provides a selection principle for hyperparameters of a PIML model. We show that PILE minimization yields excellent choices for a wide variety of model parameters, including kernel bandwidth, least squares regularization weights, and even kernel function selection. We also show that, even prior to data acquisition, a special 'data-free' case of the PILE score identifies a priori kernel choices that are 'well-adapted' to a given PDE. Beyond the kernel setting, we anticipate that the PILE score can be extended to PIML at large, and we outline approaches to do so.</description>

      <title>Multi-Output Robust and Conjugate Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) regression allows modelling dependencies among multiple correlated response variables. Similarly to standard Gaussian processes, MOGPs are sensitive to model misspecification and outliers, which can distort predictions within individual outputs. This situation can be further exacerbated by multiple anomalous response variables whose errors propagate due to correlations between outputs. To handle this situation, we extend and generalise the robust and conjugate Gaussian process (RCGP) framework introduced by Altamirano et al. (2024). This results in the multi-output RCGP (MO-RCGP): a provably robust MOGP that is conjugate, and jointly captures correlations across outputs. We thoroughly evaluate our approach through applications in finance and cancer research.</description>

      <title>Action-Driven Processes for Continuous-Time Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the heart of reinforcement learning are actions - decisions made in response to observations of the environment. Actions are equally fundamental in the modeling of stochastic processes, as they trigger discontinuous state transitions and enable the flow of information through large, complex systems. In this paper, we unify the perspectives of stochastic processes and reinforcement learning through action- driven processes, and illustrate their application to spiking neural networks. Leveraging ideas from control-as-inference, we show that minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a policy-driven true distribution and a reward-driven model distribution for a suitably defined action-driven process is equivalent to maximum entropy reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the conditional exchangeability assumption in causal machine learning models: a simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational studies developing causal machine learning (ML) models for the prediction of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) seldom conduct empirical evaluations to assess the conditional exchangeability assumption. We aimed to evaluate the performance of these models under conditional exchangeability violations and the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic. We conducted a simulation study to examine confounding bias in ITE estimates generated by causal forest and X-learner models under varying conditions, including the presence or absence of true heterogeneity. We simulated data to reflect real-world scenarios with differing levels of confounding, sample size, and NCO confounding structures. We then estimated and compared subgroup-level treatment effects on the primary outcome and NCOs across settings with and without unmeasured confounding. When conditional exchangeability was violated, causal forest and X-learner models failed to recover true treatment effect heterogeneity and, in some cases, falsely indicated heterogeneity when there was none. NCOs successfully identified subgroups affected by unmeasured confounding. Even when NCOs did not perfectly satisfy its ideal assumptions, it remained informative, flagging potential bias in subgroup level estimates, though not always pinpointing the subgroup with the largest confounding. Violations of conditional exchangeability substantially limit the validity of ITE estimates from causal ML models in routinely collected observational data. NCOs serve a useful empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific unmeasured confounding and should be incorporated into causal ML workflows to support the credibility of individualized inference.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap between Empirical Welfare Maximization and Conditional Average Treatment Effect Estimation in Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of policy learning is to train a policy function that recommends a treatment given covariates to maximize population welfare. There are two major approaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM) approach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a classification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population welfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by maximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on regression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome. This study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are based on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an exact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of the policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in several respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common conditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization method for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationally efficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial step typically required in EWM.</description>

      <title>A Unified Theory for Causal Inference: Direct Debiased Machine Learning via Bregman-Riesz Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note introduces a unified theory for causal inference that integrates Riesz regression, covariate balancing, density-ratio estimation (DRE), targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and the matching estimator in average treatment effect (ATE) estimation. In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and the regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the balancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction term, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression, covariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating the balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE in the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is in a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for constructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term becomes zero. Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density Ratio Estimation and Riesz Regression.</description>

      <title>The Ray Tracing Sampler: Bayesian Sampling of Neural Networks for Everyone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler based on following ray paths in a medium where the refractive index $n(x)$ is a function of the desired likelihood $\mathcal{L}(x)$. The sampling method propagates rays at constant speed through parameter space, leading to orders of magnitude higher resilience to heating for stochastic gradients as compared to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), as well as the ability to cross any likelihood barrier, including holes in parameter space. Using the ray tracing method, we sample the posterior distributions of neural network outputs for a variety of different architectures, up to the 1.5 billion-parameter GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) architecture, all on a single consumer-level GPU. We also show that prior samplers including traditional HMC, microcanonical HMC, Metropolis, Gibbs, and even Monte Carlo integration are special cases within a generalized ray tracing framework, which can sample according to an arbitrary weighting function. Public code and documentation for C, JAX, and PyTorch are available at https://bitbucket.org/pbehroozi/ray-tracing-sampler/src</description>

      <title>Transferring Causal Effects using Proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal effect of website rankings on consumer choices.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flow Sampler-based Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mathematically principled PDE gradient flow framework for distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Exploiting the recent advances in the intersection of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and gradient flow theory, we show that our theoretical framework can be implemented as practical algorithms for sampling from worst-case distributions and, consequently, DRO. While numerous previous works have proposed various reformulation techniques and iterative algorithms, we contribute a sound gradient flow view of the distributional optimization that can be used to construct new algorithms. As an example of applications, we solve a class of Wasserstein and Sinkhorn DRO problems using the recently-discovered Wasserstein Fisher-Rao and Stein variational gradient flows. Notably, we also show some simple reductions of our framework recover exactly previously proposed popular DRO methods, and provide new insights into their theoretical limit and optimization dynamics. Numerical studies based on stochastic gradient descent provide empirical backing for our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Predictive Coding Done Right for Mutual Information Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation, despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but from the learning of structured density ratios.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias of Per-sample Adam on Separable Data: Departure from the Full-batch Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation. Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$ close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while Signum remains invariant.</description>

      <title>Posterior Sampling by Combining Diffusion Models with Annealed Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior $p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an $L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Matching Decisions via Matrix Completion under Dependent Missingness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies decision-making and statistical inference for two-sided matching markets via matrix completion. In contrast to the independent sampling assumed in classical matrix completion literature, the observed entries, which arise from past matching data, are constrained by matching capacity. This matching-induced dependence poses new challenges for both estimation and inference in the matrix completion framework. We propose a non-convex algorithm based on Grassmannian gradient descent and establish near-optimal entrywise convergence rates for three canonical mechanisms, i.e., one-to-one matching, one-to-many matching with one-sided random arrival, and two-sided random arrival. To facilitate valid uncertainty quantification and hypothesis testing on matching decisions, we further develop a general debiasing and projection framework for arbitrary linear forms of the reward matrix, deriving asymptotic normality with finite-sample guarantees under matching-induced dependent sampling. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach provides accurate estimation, valid confidence intervals, and efficient evaluation of matching policies.</description>

      <title>LLMs as In-Context Meta-Learners for Model and Hyperparameter Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.</description>

      <title>Approximating Heavy-Tailed Distributions with a Mixture of Bernstein Phase-Type and Hyperexponential Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy-tailed distributions, prevalent in a lot of real-world applications such as finance, telecommunications, queuing theory, and natural language processing, are challenging to model accurately owing to their slow tail decay. Bernstein phase-type (BPH) distributions, through their analytical tractability and good approximations in the non-tail region, can present a good solution, but they suffer from an inability to reproduce these heavy-tailed behaviors exactly, thus leading to inadequate performance in important tail areas. On the contrary, while highly adaptable to heavy-tailed distributions, hyperexponential (HE) models struggle in the body part of the distribution. Additionally, they are highly sensitive to initial parameter selection, significantly affecting their precision.
  To solve these issues, we propose a novel hybrid model of BPH and HE distributions, borrowing the most desirable features from each for enhanced approximation quality. Specifically, we leverage an optimization to set initial parameters for the HE component, significantly enhancing its robustness and reducing the possibility that the associated procedure results in an invalid HE model. Experimental validation demonstrates that the novel hybrid approach is more performant than individual application of BPH or HE models. More precisely, it can capture both the body and the tail of heavy-tailed distributions, with a considerable enhancement in matching parameters such as mean and coefficient of variation. Additional validation through experiments utilizing queuing theory proves the practical usefulness, accuracy, and precision of our hybrid approach.</description>

      <title>On Measuring Localization of Shortcuts in Deep Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks (Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and architecture-specific approaches instead.</description>

      <title>Budgeted Multiple-Expert Deferral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems. However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses. Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.</description>

      <title>Deep sequence models tend to memorize geometrically; it is unclear why</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry, despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures. Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.</description>

      <title>Random pairing MLE for estimation of item parameters in Rasch model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rasch model, a classical model in the item response theory, is widely used in psychometrics to model the relationship between individuals' latent traits and their binary responses to assessments or questionnaires. In this paper, we introduce a new likelihood-based estimator -- random pairing maximum likelihood estimator ($\mathrm{RP\text{-}MLE}$) and its bootstrapped variant multiple random pairing MLE ($\mathrm{MRP\text{-}MLE}$) which faithfully estimate the item parameters in the Rasch model. The new estimators have several appealing features compared to existing ones. First, both work for sparse observations, an increasingly important scenario in the big data era. Second, both estimators are provably minimax optimal in terms of finite sample $\ell_{\infty}$ estimation error. Lastly, both admit precise distributional characterization that allows uncertainty quantification on the item parameters, e.g., construction of confidence intervals for the item parameters. The main idea underlying $\mathrm{RP\text{-}MLE}$ and $\mathrm{MRP\text{-}MLE}$ is to randomly pair user-item responses to form item-item comparisons. This is carefully designed to reduce the problem size while retaining statistical independence. We also provide empirical evidence of the efficacy of the two new estimators using both simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Mahalanobis Distance with Applications to Kernelized Novelty Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mahalanobis distance is a classical tool used to measure the covariance-adjusted distance between points in $\bbR^d$. In this work, we extend the concept of Mahalanobis distance to separable Banach spaces by reinterpreting it as a Cameron-Martin norm associated with a probability measure. This approach leads to a basis-free, data-driven notion of anomaly distance through the so-called variance norm, which can naturally be estimated using empirical measures of a sample. Our framework generalizes the classical $\bbR^d$, functional $(L^2[0,1])^d$, and kernelized settings; importantly, it incorporates non-injective covariance operators. We prove that the variance norm is invariant under invertible bounded linear transformations of the data, extending previous results which are limited to unitary operators. In the Hilbert space setting, we connect the variance norm to the RKHS of the covariance operator, and establish consistency and convergence results for estimation using empirical measures with Tikhonov regularization. Using the variance norm, we introduce the notion of a kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance, and study some of its finite-sample concentration properties. In an empirical study on 12 real-world data sets, we demonstrate that the kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance outperforms the traditional kernelized Mahalanobis distance for multivariate time series novelty detection, using state-of-the-art time series kernels such as the signature, global alignment, and Volterra reservoir kernels.</description>

      <title>Beyond likelihood ratio bias: Nested multi-time-scale stochastic approximation for likelihood-free parameter estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study parameter inference in simulation-based stochastic models where the analytical form of the likelihood is unknown. The main difficulty is that score evaluation as a ratio of noisy Monte Carlo estimators induces bias and instability, which we overcome with a ratio-free nested multi-time-scale (NMTS) stochastic approximation (SA) method that simultaneously tracks the score and drives the parameter update. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the proposed NMTS algorithm for solving likelihood-free inference problems, including strong convergence, asymptotic normality, and convergence rates. We show that our algorithm can eliminate the original asymptotic bias $O\big(\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}}\big)$ and accelerate the convergence rate from $O\big(\beta_k+\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}}\big)$ to $O\big(\frac{\beta_k}{\alpha_k}+\sqrt{\frac{\alpha_k}{N}}\big)$, where $N$ is the fixed batch size, $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$ are decreasing step sizes with $\alpha_k$, $\beta_k$, $\beta_k/\alpha_k\rightarrow 0$. With proper choice of $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$, our convergence rates can match the optimal rate in the multi-time-scale SA literature. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can improve the estimation accuracy by one to two orders of magnitude at the same computational cost, making it efficient for parameter estimation in stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Performative Risk Minimization for Binary Random Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performativity, the phenomenon where outcomes are influenced by predictions, is particularly prevalent in social contexts where individuals strategically respond to a deployed model. In order to preserve the high accuracy of machine learning models under distribution shifts caused by performativity, Perdomo et al. (2020) introduced the concept of performative risk minimization (PRM). While this framework ensures model accuracy, it overlooks the impact of the PRM on the underlying distributions and the predictions of the model. In this paper, we initiate the analysis of the impact of PRM, by studying performativity for a sequential performative risk minimization problem with binary random variables and linear performative shifts. We formulate two natural measures of impact. In the case of full information, where the distribution dynamics are known, we derive explicit formulas for the PRM solution and our impact measures. In the case of partial information, we provide performative-aware statistical estimators, as well as simulations. Our analysis contrasts PRM to alternatives that do not model data shift and indicates that PRM can have amplified side effects compared to such methods.</description>

Abstract: This article studies the problem of online non-parametric change point detection in multivariate data streams. We approach the problem through the lens of kernel-based two-sample testing and introduce a sequential testing procedure based on random Fourier features, running with logarithmic time complexity per observation and with overall logarithmic space complexity. The algorithm has two advantages compared to the state of the art. First, our approach is genuinely online, and no access to training data known to be from the pre-change distribution is necessary. Second, the algorithm does not require the user to specify a window parameter over which local tests are to be calculated. We prove strong theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's performance, including information-theoretic bounds demonstrating that the detection delay is optimal in the minimax sense. Numerical studies on real and synthetic data show that our algorithm is competitive with respect to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Nearly Minimax Discrete Distribution Estimation in Kullback-Leibler Divergence with High Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the fundamental problem of estimating a discrete distribution on a domain of size~$K$ with high probability in Kullback-Leibler divergence. We provide upper and lower bounds on the minimax estimation rate, which show that the optimal rate is between $\big(K + \ln(K)\ln(1/\delta)\big) /n$ and $\big(K\ln\ln(K) + \ln(K)\ln(1/\delta)\big) /n$ at error probability $\delta$ and sample size $n$, which pins down the rate up to the doubly logarithmic factor $\ln \ln K$ that multiplies $K$. Our upper bound uses techniques from online learning to construct a novel estimator via online-to-batch conversion. Perhaps surprisingly, the tail behavior of the minimax rate is worse than for the squared total variation and squared Hellinger distance, for which it is $\big(K + \ln(1/\delta)\big) /n$, i.e.\ without the $\ln K$ multiplying $\ln (1/\delta)$. As a consequence, we cannot obtain a fully tight lower bound from the usual reduction to these smaller distances. Moreover, we show that this lower bound cannot be achieved by the standard lower bound approach based on a reduction to hypothesis testing, and instead we need to introduce a new reduction to what we call weak hypothesis testing. We investigate the source of the gap with other divergences further in refined results, which show that the total variation rate is achievable for Kullback-Leibler divergence after all (in fact by he maximum likelihood estimator) if we rule out outcome probabilities smaller than $O(\ln(K/\delta) / n)$, which is a vanishing set as $n$ increases for fixed $K$ and~$\delta$. This explains why minimax Kullback-Leibler estimation is more difficult than asymptotic estimation.</description>

      <title>Reward Collapse in Aligning Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extraordinary capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 are in part unleashed by aligning them with reward models that are trained on human preferences, which are often represented as rankings of responses to prompts. In this paper, we document the phenomenon of \textit{reward collapse}, an empirical observation where the prevailing ranking-based approach results in an \textit{identical} reward distribution \textit{regardless} of the prompts during the terminal phase of training. This outcome is undesirable as open-ended prompts like ``write a short story about your best friend'' should yield a continuous range of rewards for their completions, while specific prompts like ``what is the capital of New Zealand'' should generate either high or low rewards. Our theoretical investigation reveals that reward collapse is primarily due to the insufficiency of the ranking-based objective function to incorporate prompt-related information during optimization. This insight allows us to derive closed-form expressions for the reward distribution associated with a set of utility functions in an asymptotic regime. To overcome reward collapse, we introduce a prompt-aware optimization scheme that provably admits a prompt-dependent reward distribution within the interpolating regime. Our experimental results suggest that our proposed prompt-aware utility functions significantly alleviate reward collapse during the training of reward models.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Programming for Differential Equations: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The differentiable programming paradigm is a cornerstone of modern scientific computing. It refers to numerical methods for computing the gradient of a numerical model's output. Many scientific models are based on differential equations, where differentiable programming plays a crucial role in calculating model sensitivities, inverting model parameters, and training hybrid models that combine differential equations with data-driven approaches. Furthermore, recognizing the strong synergies between inverse methods and machine learning offers the opportunity to establish a coherent framework applicable to both fields. Differentiating functions based on the numerical solution of differential equations is non-trivial. Numerous methods based on a wide variety of paradigms have been proposed in the literature, each with pros and cons specific to the type of problem investigated. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques to compute derivatives of numerical solutions of differential equations. We first discuss the importance of gradients of solutions of differential equations in a variety of scientific domains. Second, we lay out the mathematical foundations of the various approaches and compare them with each other. Third, we cover the computational considerations and explore the solutions available in modern scientific software. Last but not least, we provide best-practices and recommendations for practitioners. We hope that this work accelerates the fusion of scientific models and data, and fosters a modern approach to scientific modelling.</description>

      <title>Neural active manifolds: nonlinear dimensionality reduction for uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, specifically designed for computationally expensive mathematical models. We leverage autoencoders to discover a one-dimensional neural active manifold (NeurAM) capturing the model output variability, through the aid of a simultaneously learnt surrogate model with inputs on this manifold. Our method only relies on model evaluations and does not require the knowledge of gradients. The proposed dimensionality reduction framework can then be applied to assist outer loop many-query tasks in scientific computing, like sensitivity analysis and multifidelity uncertainty propagation. In particular, we prove, both theoretically under idealized conditions, and numerically in challenging test cases, how NeurAM can be used to obtain multifidelity sampling estimators with reduced variance by sampling the models on the discovered low-dimensional and shared manifold among models. Several numerical examples illustrate the main features of the proposed dimensionality reduction strategy and highlight its advantages with respect to existing approaches in the literature.</description>

      <title>Parallel Unlearning in Inherited Model Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlearning is challenging in generic learning frameworks with the continuous growth and updates of models exhibiting complex inheritance relationships. This paper presents a novel unlearning framework that enables fully parallel unlearning among models exhibiting inheritance. We use a chronologically Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to capture various unlearning scenarios occurring in model inheritance networks. Central to our framework is the Fisher Inheritance Unlearning (FIUn) method, designed to enable efficient parallel unlearning within the DAG. FIUn utilizes the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to assess the significance of model parameters for unlearning tasks and adjusts them accordingly. To handle multiple unlearning requests simultaneously, we propose the Merging-FIM (MFIM) function, which consolidates FIMs from multiple upstream models into a unified matrix. This design supports all unlearning scenarios captured by the DAG, enabling one-shot removal of inherited knowledge while significantly reducing computational overhead. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of our unlearning framework. For single-class tasks, it achieves complete unlearning with 0% accuracy for unlearned labels while maintaining 94.53% accuracy for retained labels. For multi-class tasks, the accuracy is 1.07% for unlearned labels and 84.77% for retained labels. Our framework accelerates unlearning by 99% compared to alternative methods.

      <title>End-to-end guarantees for indirect data-driven control of bilinear systems with finite stochastic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an end-to-end algorithm for indirect data-driven control for bilinear systems with stability guarantees. We consider the case where the collected i.i.d. data is affected by probabilistic noise with possibly unbounded support and leverage tools from statistical learning theory to derive finite sample identification error bounds. To this end, we solve the bilinear identification problem by solving a set of linear and affine identification problems, by a particular choice of a control input during the data collection phase. We provide a priori as well as data-dependent finite sample identification error bounds on the individual matrices as well as ellipsoidal bounds, both of which are structurally suitable for control. Further, we integrate the structure of the derived identification error bounds in a robust controller design to obtain an exponentially stable closed-loop. By means of an extensive numerical study we showcase the interplay between the controller design and the derived identification error bounds. Moreover, we note appealing connections of our results to indirect data-driven control of general nonlinear systems through Koopman operator theory and discuss how our results may be applied in this setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior work (Klochkov $\&amp;$ Zhivotovskiy, 2021) establishes at most $O\left(\log (n)/n\right)$ excess risk bounds via algorithmic stability for strongly-convex learners with high probability. We show that under the similar common assumptions -- - Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, smoothness, and Lipschitz continous for losses -- - rates of $O\left(\log^2(n)/n^2\right)$ are at most achievable. To our knowledge, our analysis also provides the tightest high-probability bounds for gradient-based generalization gaps in nonconvex settings.</description>

      <title>Modeling Neural Activity with Conditionally Linear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural population activity exhibits complex, nonlinear dynamics, varying in time, over trials, and across experimental conditions. Here, we develop Conditionally Linear Dynamical System (CLDS) models as a general-purpose method to characterize these dynamics. These models use Gaussian Process (GP) priors to capture the nonlinear dependence of circuit dynamics on task and behavioral variables. Conditioned on these covariates, the data is modeled with linear dynamics. This allows for transparent interpretation and tractable Bayesian inference. We find that CLDS models can perform well even in severely data-limited regimes (e.g. one trial per condition) due to their Bayesian formulation and ability to share statistical power across nearby task conditions. In example applications, we apply CLDS to model thalamic neurons that nonlinearly encode heading direction and to model motor cortical neurons during a cued reaching task.</description>

      <title>Advancing Local Clustering on Graphs via Compressive Sensing: Semi-supervised and Unsupervised Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local clustering aims to identify specific substructures within a large graph without any additional structural information of the graph. These substructures are typically small compared to the overall graph, enabling the problem to be approached by finding a sparse solution to a linear system associated with the graph Laplacian. In this work, we first propose a method for identifying specific local clusters when very few labeled data are given, which we term semi-supervised local clustering. We then extend this approach to the unsupervised setting when no prior information on labels is available. The proposed methods involve randomly sampling the graph, applying diffusion through local cluster extraction, then examining the overlap among the results to find each cluster. We establish the co-membership conditions for any pair of nodes, and rigorously prove the correctness of our methods. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve state of the art results in the low-label rates regime.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity threat detection based on a UEBA framework using Deep Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA) is a broad branch of data analytics that attempts to build a normal behavioural profile in order to detect anomalous events. Among the techniques used to detect anomalies, Deep Autoencoders constitute one of the most promising deep learning models on UEBA tasks, allowing explainable detection of security incidents that could lead to the leak of personal data, hijacking of systems, or access to sensitive business information. In this study, we introduce the first implementation of an explainable UEBA-based anomaly detection framework that leverages Deep Autoencoders in combination with Doc2Vec to process both numerical and textual features. Additionally, based on the theoretical foundations of neural networks, we offer a novel proof demonstrating the equivalence of two widely used definitions for fully-connected neural networks. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework capability to detect real and synthetic anomalies effectively generated from real attack data, showing that the models provide not only correct identification of anomalies but also explainable results that enable the reconstruction of the possible origin of the anomaly. Our findings suggest that the proposed UEBA framework can be seamlessly integrated into enterprise environments, complementing existing security systems for explainable threat detection.</description>

      <title>Pass@K Policy Optimization: Solving Harder Reinforcement Learning Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms sample multiple n&gt;1 solution attempts for each problem and reward them independently. This optimizes for pass@1 performance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of the diversity and collective utility of sets of samples. This under-utilizes the sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder examples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO), a transformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of pass@k performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward when considered jointly. Our contribution is to derive novel low variance unbiased estimators for pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and continuous reward settings. We show optimization with our estimators reduces to standard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and efficient transformation function.
  While previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable robust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k &lt;= n. Moreover, instead of trading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k during training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1 numbers alongside significant pass@k gains.
  We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the variance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world examples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation effectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable solving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and pass@k . Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1 optimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely due to better exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual samples.</description>

      <title>Efficient Regression-Based Training of Normalizing Flows for Boltzmann Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-free training frameworks have been at the forefront of the generative modelling revolution in continuous spaces, leading to large-scale diffusion and flow matching models. However, such modern generative models suffer from expensive inference, inhibiting their use in numerous scientific applications like Boltzmann Generators (BGs) for molecular conformations that require fast likelihood evaluation. In this paper, we revisit classical normalizing flows in the context of BGs that offer efficient sampling and likelihoods, but whose training via maximum likelihood is often unstable and computationally challenging. We propose Regression Training of Normalizing Flows (RegFlow), a novel and scalable regression-based training objective that bypasses the numerical instability and computational challenge of conventional maximum likelihood training in favour of a simple $\ell_2$-regression objective. Specifically, RegFlow maps prior samples under our flow to targets computed using optimal transport couplings or a pre-trained continuous normalizing flow (CNF). To enhance numerical stability, RegFlow employs effective regularization strategies such as a new forward-backward self-consistency loss that enjoys painless implementation. Empirically, we demonstrate that RegFlow unlocks a broader class of architectures that were previously intractable to train for BGs with maximum likelihood. We also show RegFlow exceeds the performance, computational cost, and stability of maximum likelihood training in equilibrium sampling in Cartesian coordinates of alanine dipeptide, tripeptide, and tetrapeptide, showcasing its potential in molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Predictive Causal Inference via Spatio-Temporal Modeling and Penalized Empirical Likelihood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an integrated framework for predictive causal inference designed to overcome limitations inherent in conventional single model approaches. Specifically, we combine a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for spatial health state estimation with a Multi Task and Multi Graph Convolutional Network (MTGCN) for capturing temporal outcome trajectories. The framework asymmetrically treats temporal and spatial information regarding them as endogenous variables in the outcome regression, and exogenous variables in the propensity score model, thereby expanding the standard doubly robust treatment effect estimation to jointly enhance bias correction and predictive accuracy. To demonstrate its utility, we focus on clinical domains such as cancer, dementia, and Parkinson disease, where treatment effects are challenging to observe directly. Simulation studies are conducted to emulate latent disease dynamics and evaluate the model performance under varying conditions. Overall, the proposed framework advances predictive causal inference by structurally adapting to spatiotemporal complexities common in biomedical data.</description>

      <title>Through the River: Understanding the Benefit of Schedule-Free Methods for Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As both model and dataset sizes continue to scale rapidly, conventional pretraining strategies with fixed compute budgets-such as cosine learning rate schedules-are increasingly inadequate for large-scale training. Recent alternatives, including warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedules and weight averaging, offer greater flexibility. However, WSD relies on explicit decay phases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at the cost of additional memory. In search of a more principled and scalable alternative, we revisit the Schedule-Free (SF) method [Defazio et al., 2024], which has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings. We show that SF-AdamW effectively navigates the "river" structure of the loss landscape without decay phases or auxiliary averaging, making it particularly suitable for continuously scaling training workloads. To understand this behavior, we conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of SF dynamics, revealing that it implicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead. Guided by this analysis, we propose a refined variant of SF that improves robustness to momentum and performs better under large batch sizes, addressing key limitations of the original method. Together, these results establish SF as a practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for language model training.</description>

      <title>Generalized Linear Bandits: Almost Optimal Regret with One-Pass Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized linear bandit (GLB) problem, a contextual multi-armed bandit framework that extends the classical linear model by incorporating a non-linear link function, thereby modeling a broad class of reward distributions such as Bernoulli and Poisson. While GLBs are widely applicable to real-world scenarios, their non-linear nature introduces significant challenges in achieving both computational and statistical efficiency. Existing methods typically trade off between two objectives, either incurring high per-round costs for optimal regret guarantees or compromising statistical efficiency to enable constant-time updates. In this paper, we propose a jointly efficient algorithm that attains a nearly optimal regret bound with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space complexities per round. The core of our method is a tight confidence set for the online mirror descent (OMD) estimator, which is derived through a novel analysis that leverages the notion of mix loss from online prediction. The analysis shows that our OMD estimator, even with its one-pass updates, achieves statistical efficiency comparable to maximum likelihood estimation, thereby leading to a jointly efficient optimistic method.</description>

      <title>Distributed optimization: designed for federated learning</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative machine learning (ML) framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation, our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant statistical heterogeneity across clients.</description>

      <title>Chiseling: Powerful and Valid Subgroup Selection via Interactive Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In regression and causal inference, controlled subgroup selection aims to identify, with inferential guarantees, a subgroup (defined as a subset of the covariate space) on which the average response or treatment effect is above a given threshold. E.g., in a clinical trial, it may be of interest to find a subgroup with a positive average treatment effect. However, existing methods either lack inferential guarantees, heavily restrict the search for the subgroup, or sacrifice efficiency by naive data splitting. We propose a novel framework called chiseling that allows the analyst to interactively refine and test a candidate subgroup by iteratively shrinking it. The sole restriction is that the shrinkage direction only depends on the points outside the current subgroup, but otherwise the analyst may leverage any prior information or machine learning algorithm. Despite this flexibility, chiseling controls the probability that the discovered subgroup is null (e.g., has a non-positive average treatment effect) under minimal assumptions: for example, in randomized experiments, this inferential validity guarantee holds under only bounded moment conditions. When applied to a variety of simulated datasets and a real survey experiment, chiseling identifies substantially better subgroups than existing methods with inferential guarantees.</description>

      <title>Linearized Optimal Transport for Analysis of High-Dimensional Point-Cloud and Single-Cell Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells, enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes, offering little biological interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT) framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure. This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \textbf{accurate and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions; and (ii) \textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids, exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug interaction testing.
  Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.</description>

      <title>Direct Debiased Machine Learning via Bregman Divergence Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a direct debiased machine learning framework comprising Neyman targeted estimation and generalized Riesz regression. Our framework unifies Riesz regression for automatic debiased machine learning, covariate balancing, targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and density-ratio estimation. In many problems involving causal effects or structural models, the parameters of interest depend on regression functions. Plugging regression functions estimated by machine learning methods into the identifying equations can yield poor performance because of first-stage bias. To reduce such bias, debiased machine learning employs Neyman orthogonal estimating equations. Debiased machine learning typically requires estimation of the Riesz representer and the regression function. For this problem, we develop a direct debiased machine learning framework with an end-to-end algorithm. We formulate estimation of the nuisance parameters, the regression function and the Riesz representer, as minimizing the discrepancy between Neyman orthogonal scores computed with known and unknown nuisance parameters, which we refer to as Neyman targeted estimation. Neyman targeted estimation includes Riesz representer estimation, and we measure discrepancies using the Bregman divergence. The Bregman divergence encompasses various loss functions as special cases, where the squared loss yields Riesz regression and the Kullback-Leibler divergence yields entropy balancing. We refer to this Riesz representer estimation as generalized Riesz regression. Neyman targeted estimation also yields TMLE as a special case for regression function estimation. Furthermore, for specific pairs of models and Riesz representer estimation methods, we can automatically obtain the covariate balancing property without explicitly solving the covariate balancing objective.</description>

      <title>Localized Kernel Projection Outlyingness: A Two-Stage Approach for Multi-Modal Outlier Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO) that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on 10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage architectures.</description>

      <title>Energy Approach from $\varepsilon$-Graph to Continuum Diffusion Model with Connectivity Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an energy-based continuum limit for $\varepsilon$-graphs endowed with a general connectivity functional. We prove that the discrete energy and its continuum counterpart differ by at most $O(\varepsilon)$; the prefactor involves only the $W^{1,1}$-norm of the connectivity density as $\varepsilon\to0$, so the error bound remains valid even when that density has strong local fluctuations. As an application, we introduce a neural-network procedure that reconstructs the connectivity density from edge-weight data and then embeds the resulting continuum model into a brain-dynamics framework. In this setting, the usual constant diffusion coefficient is replaced by the spatially varying coefficient produced by the learned density, yielding dynamics that differ significantly from those obtained with conventional constant-diffusion models.</description>
