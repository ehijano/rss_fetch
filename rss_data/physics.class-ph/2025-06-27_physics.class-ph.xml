      <title>On the coordinate system-dependence of the accuracy of symplectic numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symplectic numerical methods have become a widely-used choice for the accurate simulation of Hamiltonian systems in various fields, including celestial mechanics, molecular dynamics and robotics. Even though their characteristics are well-understood mathematically, relatively little attention has been paid in general to the practical aspect of how the choice of coordinates affects the accuracy of the numerical results, even though the consequences can be computationally significant. The present article aims to fill this gap by giving a systematic overview of how coordinate transformations can influence the results of simulations performed using symplectic methods. We give a derivation for the non-invariance of the modified Hamiltonian of symplectic methods under coordinate transformations, as well as a sufficient condition for the non-preservation of a first integral corresponding to a cyclic coordinate for the symplectic Euler method. We also consider the possibility of finding order-compensating coordinate transformations that improve the order of accuracy of a numerical method. Various numerical examples are presented throughout.</description>

      <title>A generic framework for extending Miles' approach to wind-wave interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the energy transfer from wind to waves is an important but complex topic, typically based on phenomenology, on pure numerics, or on technically challenging analysis, carried out on a case by case basis. Here we show that the approach by Miles, initially proposed for a still and infinitely deep ocean of inviscid water, is in fact generic: it can easily be adapted, as we demonstrate directly from the mathematical structure of the arguments put forward by Miles. We establish simple transformations, which infer wave growth rates in complex hydrodynamic situations directly from those in Miles' conditions, without any adjustable parameters. The corresponding conversion factors are determined from the hydrodynamic water pressure produced by a propagating surface wave, and can be determined without requiring to further analyse wind and air flow. We reproduce a variety of results for different hydrodynamic situations to show how such generalisations can be achieved with surprisingly simple calculations and without any additional numerical effort, which should make the approach interesting for real-life applications.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from b-EMRIs: Doppler shift and beaming, resonant excitation, helicity oscillations and self-lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves from a stellar-mass binary orbiting a spinning supermassive black hole, a system referred to as a binary extreme mass ratio inspiral (b-EMRI). We use Dixon's formalism to describe the stellar-mass binary as a particle with internal structure, and keep terms up to quadrupole order to capture the generation of gravitational waves by the inner motion of the stellar-mass binary. The problem of emission and propagation of waves is treated from first principles using black hole perturbation theory. In the gravitational waveform at future null infinity, we identify for the first time Doppler shifts and beaming due to the motion of the center of mass, as well as helicity breaking gravitational lensing, and resonances with ringdown modes of the supermassive black hole. We establish that previously proposed phenomenological models inadequately capture these effects.</description>
