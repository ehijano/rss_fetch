      <title>Kelvin-Wave-Inspired Optical Vortex Excitation in Kerr Nonlinear Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a direct one-to-one correspondence between nonlinear optical fields in defocusing Kerr media and wave functions in weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates or quantum fluids. Based on this correspondence, we propose the existence of excitations in an optical vortex beam characterized by a helical deformation of its phase singularity core. These excitations are direct analogues of Kelvin waves known in quantum and classical fluid dynamics. We further show that the excitations exhibit two distinct branches, one of which includes a stationary solution. A feasible experimental scheme for generating these excitations is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermally Induced Refractive Index Trimming of Visible-Light Silicon Nitride Waveguides Using Suspended Heaters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate refractive index trimming of visible-light silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides using suspended heater structures. The thermal isolation of the suspended heaters enabled a semi-uniform temperature distribution with estimated temperatures of $\sim$350{\deg}C in the waveguides without reaching potentially damaging temperatures in the titanium nitride resistive heaters. The thermal isolation also enabled trimming temperatures to be reached with a moderate power dissipation of 30 to 40 mW. At a wavelength of 561 nm, modal effective index changes up to $-8.3 \times 10^{-3}$ were observed following thermal trimming, and the index changes were stable over an observation period of 97 days. The devices were fabricated as part of our visible-light integrated photonics platform on 200-mm diameter silicon wafers. The suspended heaters also functioned as efficient thermo-optic phase shifters with power dissipation for a $\pi$ phase shift of about $1.2-1.8$ mW. The trimming method was applied to set the bias points of thermo-optic Mach-Zehnder interferometer switches to reduce the bias power of five devices from $0.29-2.32$ mW to $0.1-0.16$ mW. Thermal trimming at a wavelength of 445 nm was also demonstrated. Through material analysis before and after thermal treatment, we hypothesize that index trimming of the silica (SiO$_2$) waveguide cladding may be a potential underlying mechanism. Additionally, via extrapolations of the measured trimming data, we estimate the thermal aging behavior of the SiN waveguides in the suspended heaters at lower (125 - 250{\deg}C) operating temperatures.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Single-Pixel Imaging at Ultra-Low Sampling Ratios via Physically Enhanced Laguerre Gaussian Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-pixel imaging (SPI) has offered an unprecedented technique for capturing a targeted scenes without requiring either raster-scanned systems or muti-pixel detectors. However, in the current research, there are rare study reports about achieving both high spatial quality and low sampling ratio below 5% without additional algorithms in the existing SPI architectures. To circumvent these challenges, here we demonstrate a novel Laguerre Gaussian single-pixel imaging (LGSI) technique achieving ultra-low sampling ratio (3%) and super-high spatial imaging quality (Structural Similarity (SSIM) of 0.739 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 20.762 dB). The fundamental methodology relies on the enhancement of the encoded patterns by the differential modulation of discrete orthogonal physical LG moments, enabling the reconstruction of illuminated target object via a linear weighting of the structured light intensity. Leveraging this orthogonal mechanism, LGSI demonstrates superior imaging quality and computational efficiency, surpassing the capabilities of non-orthogonal moments. Comparative analyses of the power spectra from reconstructed images highlight the enhanced efficacy of LGSI over Hadamard SPI (HSI) and Fourier SPI (FSI). Our results suggest the possibility of encoding multi-dimensional structured light fields as a promising pathway for realizing low sampling ratio, universal, and physical-endow SPI.</description>

      <title>Pupil Phase Series: A Fast, Accurate, and Energy-Conserving Model for Forward and Inverse Light Scattering in Thick Biological Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the pupil phase series (PPS), a fast and accurate forward scattering algorithm for simulating and inverting multiple light scattering in large biological samples. PPS achieves high-angle scattering accuracy and energy conservation simultaneously by introducing a spatially varying phase modulation in the pupil plane. By expanding the scattering term into a Taylor series, PPS achieves high precision while maintaining computational efficiency. We integrate PPS into a quasi-Newton inverse solver to reconstruct the three-dimensional refractive index of a 180 um-thick human organoid. Compared to linear reconstruction, our method recovers subcellular features-such as nuclei and vesicular structures-deep within the sample volume. PPS offers a scalable and interpretable alternative to conventional solvers, paving the way for high-throughput, label-free imaging of optically thick biological tissues.</description>

      <title>Analysis of modulated linear wave packets and gap solitons in coupled optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coupled pair of waveguides with refractive indices of different signs is considered. It is shown that the gap in the linear wave spectrum closes if these waves are amplitude modulated. To look for solitons as envelopes of exponentially modulated wave packets, the dispersion law of these packets is used. Different decompositions of the dispersion law lead to solutions related to different parts of the spectrum. Numerical calculations demonstrate a good agreement with analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Mitigation of Crosstalk in a Multi-Parameter Laser Beam Diagnostic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of laser beams is crucial for applications ranging from laser-based material processing to gravitational wave detection, where even minor measurement deviations can significantly impact system performance. This work investigates crosstalk effects in a multi-parameter laser beam diagnostic system designed to simultaneously measure six beam parameters: pointing angles, centroid positions, wavefront curvature, and beam diameter. Using sequential ray-optical simulations in Zemax, a comprehensive analysis of parameter interdependencies is performed through a systematic parameter sweep across 15625 unique combinations within specified measurement ranges. The results reveal significant crosstalk effects between several parameters, which are traced back to specific optical components in the system. To address these issues and improve accuracy, a mathematical framework for crosstalk mitigation based on Taylor series expansions is developed. The mitigation method reduces measurement deviations significantly by up to one order of magnitude. This work provides insights into the origins and mitigation of crosstalk effects in optical measurement systems, particularly relevant for high-accuracy applications.</description>

      <title>Laser injection locking and nanophotonic spectral translation of electro-optic frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution electro-optic frequency combs (EO combs) consisting of thousands to millions of comb teeth across a bandwidth between 1 GHz to 500 GHz are powerful tools for atomic, molecular, and cavity-based spectroscopy, including in the context of deployable quantum sensors. However, achieving sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) EO combs for use across the broad range of wavelengths required in the aforementioned applications is hindered by the corresponding unavailability of relevant components such as narrow-linewidth lasers, electro-optic phase modulators with adequate optical power handling, and low-noise optical amplifiers. Here, we address the latter two points by showing that optical injection locking of commercial Fabry-Perot (FP) laser diodes can help enable high SNR EO combs. We injection lock the FP laser diode to more than 10^6 comb teeth at injected comb powers as low as 1 nW and produce a high SNR replica of the EO comb. In comparison to a commercial semiconductor optical amplifier, injection locking achieves approximately 100x greater SNR for the same input power (when &lt;1 microwatt) and equal SNR for &gt; 35x lower input power. Such low-power injection locking is of particular relevance in conjunction with nanophotonic spectral translation, which extends the range of wavelengths available for EO combs. We show that the usable wavelength range of an EO comb produced by photo-induced second harmonic generation of an EO comb in a silicon nitride resonator is significantly increased when combined with optical injection locking. Our results demonstrate that optical injection locking provides a versatile and high-performance approach to addressing many different scenarios in which EO comb SNR would be otherwise limited.</description>

      <title>Tailored Hotspots from Airy-Based Surface Plasmon Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface plasmons have attracted growing interest from the photonics community due to their inherent ability to controllably confine light below the diffraction limit and their direct application in trapping and transporting matter at the nanoscale. This method, known as plasmonic tweezers, employs confined fields generated by either localized plasmons or surface plasmon polaritons (SPP), which originate in the vicinity of nanostructure-based traps or across structureless platforms, respectively. Herein, we present a new theoretical method for generating intense light hotspots and engineering their features by overlapping Airy SPPs (ASPP) at a smooth dielectric-metal interface. We coherently add pairs of Hermite-Gauss modes that belong to a novel complete basis set of finite-energy ASPPs, which yield highly confined plasmonic hotspots ($\approx \lambda$/10) without the need of using any nanostructured platform. Mode order and relative spacing parameters can be used to tailor the intensity and quality factor of said hotspots, largely outperforming their Gaussian-only-based counterparts. Our method opens a promising venue to confine light at the nanoscale using ASPP-based structured light, which helps to advance the development of structureless plasmonic tweezers and holds promising potential for its application in optical signal processing and plasmonic circuitry.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust Speckle Pattern Authentication by Scale Invariant Feature Transform algorithm in Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, due to the growing phenomenon of forgery in many fields, the interest in developing new anti-counterfeiting device and cryptography keys, based on the Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) paradigm, is widely increased. PUFs are physical hardware with an intrinsic, irreproducible disorder that allows for on-demand cryptographic key extraction. Among them, optical PUF are characterized by a large number of degrees of freedom resulting in higher security and higher sensitivity to environmental conditions. While these promising features led to the growth of advanced fabrication strategies and materials for new PUF devices, their combination with robust recognition algorithm remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a metric-independent authentication approach that leverages the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm to extract unique and invariant features from the speckle patterns generated by optical Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). The application of SIFT to the challenge response pairs (CRPs) protocol allows us to correctly authenticate a client while denying any other fraudulent access. In this way, the authentication process is highly reliable even in presence of response rotation, zooming, and cropping that may occur in consecutive PUF interrogations and to which other postprocessing algorithm are highly sensitive. This characteristics together with the speed of the method (tens of microseconds for each operation) broaden the applicability and reliability of PUF to practical high-security authentication or merchandise anti-counterfeiting.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Approach to Quantum Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors driven into the quantum chaotic regime can have dramatically enhanced sensitivity, which, however, depends intricately on the details of the underlying classical phase space. Here, we develop an accurate semiclassical approach that provides direct and efficient access to the phase-space-resolved quantum Fisher information (QFI), the central quantity that quantifies the ultimate achievable sensitivity. This approximation reveals, in very concrete terms, that the QFI is large whenever a specific dynamical quantity tied to the sensing parameter displays a large variance over the course of the corresponding classical time evolution. Applied to a paradigmatic system of quantum chaos, the kicked top, we show that the semiclassical description is accurate already for modest quantum numbers, i.e. deep in the quantum regime, and extends seamlessly to very high quantum numbers that are beyond the reach of other methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum adaptive imaging by position-correlated biphoton wavefront sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum imaging with spatially entangled photons offers advantages such as enhanced spatial resolution, robustness against noise, and counter-intuitive phenomena. In quantum adaptive optics, biphoton aberration correction has been achieved by using classical beams to detect the aberration source or scanning the correction phase on biphotons if the source is unreachable. Here, we introduce position-correlated biphoton Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing, where the phase pattern added on photon pairs with a strong position correlation is reconstructed from their position centroid distribution at the focal plane of a microlens array. We experimentally demonstrate this method by performing phase measurement and adaptive imaging against the disturbance of a plastic film. Our method involves only one measurement step, so it is a more direct approach to biphoton phase measurement with a greatly improved efficiency, suitable for integration into quantum microscopy and communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems, atomic radiation emission is shaped by the photonic environment and collective atom interactions, offering promising applications in quantum technologies. In particular, atom-photon bound states, inhibiting complete spontaneous decay of the atom, can be realized through waveguide dispersion engineering or by utilizing giant atoms. While steady-state bound states are well understood, transient or virtual bound states remain less explored. Here we investigate transient atom-photon bound states, arising from initial atom-photon entanglement, and propose methods to slow down spontaneous atomic decay.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effect from initial system-reservoir entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect -- where hot systems cool faster than colder ones -- has intrigued both classical and quantum thermodynamics. As compared to classical systems, quantum systems add complexity due to quantum correlations. Recent works have explored anomalous relaxation and Mpemba-like effects in several quantum systems, considering isolated systems at zero temperature or open systems in contact with reservoirs under Markovian or non-Markovian dynamics. However, these models typically assume an initial unentangled system-bath state, overlooking the role of initial system-environment correlations. Here we propose a type of quantum Mpemba effect, distinct from the strong Mpemba effect, originating from initial system-bath entanglement solely. It is shown that the degree of initial entanglement significantly influences the early relaxation dynamics, with certain conditions causing backflow and retarded thermalization. As an example, we investigate the spontaneous emission of a two-level atom in a photonic waveguide at zero temperature, where an initial atom-photon entangled state results in delayed relaxation and pronounced Mpemba effect. These findings highlight the crucial role of quantum correlations in thermalization processes and open new avenues for identifying and engineering quantum Mpemba phenomena. Controlling relaxation dynamics through system-environment entanglement may have potential applications in quantum thermal machines, state initialization protocols, and quantum information processing, where precise control over thermalization is essential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomedical applications of plasmonic nanoparticle conjugates need control over their optical properties modulated by surface coating with stabilizing or targeting molecules often attached to or embedded in the secondary functionalization shell, such as silica. Although current numerical techniques can simulate the plasmonic response of such structures, it is desirable in practice to have analytical models based on simple physical ideas that can be implemented without considerable computer resources. Here, we present two efficient analytical methods based on improved electrostatic approximation (IEA) and modal expansion method (MEM) combined with the dipole equivalence method (DEM). The last approach avoids additional electromagnetic simulations and provides a direct bridge between analytical IEA and MEM models for bare particles and those with multilayer shells. As simple as the original IEA and MEM, the developed analytical extensions provide accurate extinction and scattering spectra for coated particles compared to exact calculations by separation of variable method and COMSOL. The possibility and accuracy of analytical models are illustrated by extensive simulations for prolate and oblate gold and silver nanoparticles with a maximal size of up to 200 nm, aspect ratio from 2 to 6, and 3-30 nm dielectric coating.</description>

Abstract: The interaction of light with objects and media moving at relativistic and superluminal speeds enables unconventional phenomena such as Fresnel drag, Hawking radiation, and light amplification. Synthetic motion, facilitated by modulated internal degrees of freedom, enables the study of relativistic phenomena unrestricted by the speed of light. In this study, we investigate synthetically moving apertures created by high-contrast reflectivity modulations, which are generated by ultrafast laser pulses on a subwavelength thin film of indium tin oxide. The space-time diffraction of a weaker probe beam reveals a complex, non-separable spatio-temporal transformation, where changes in the frequency of the wave are correlated to changes in its momentum. By using schemes of continuous or discrete modulation we demonstrate tunable frequency-momentum diffraction patterns with gradients that depend upon the relative velocity between the modulation and the probe wave. The diffraction patterns are matched by operator-based theory and the gradients are analytically predicted using a super-relativistic Doppler model, where the modulation is described as a superluminally moving scattering particle. Our experiments open a path towards mimicking relativistic mechanics and developing complex and programmable spatio-temporal transformations of light.</description>

      <title>Enhancing light emission with electric fields in polar nitride semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant effort has been devoted to mitigating polarization fields in nitride LEDs, as these fields are traditionally viewed as detrimental to light emission, particularly for red emission. Contrary to this prevailing notion, we demonstrate that strong polarization fields can enhance the optical-transition strength of AlInGaN quantum wells emitting in the red, which has been historically challenging to achieve. By leveraging machine-learning surrogate models trained on multi-scale quantum-mechanical simulations, we globally explore the heterostructure design space and uncover that larger fields correlate with higher electron-hole overlap. This relation arises from the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables thinner wells without requiring higher indium compositions, thus overcoming a key limitation in nitride epitaxy. Structural and compositional engineering of internal fields offers a unique dimension for designing polychromatic nitride LEDs, crucial for miniaturizing LED pixels to the micron scale for extended-reality and biomedical applications. Broadly, our work demonstrates how machine learning can uncover unexpected paradigms for semiconductor design.</description>

      <title>Uncovering hidden resonances in non-Hermitian systems with scattering thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The points where diffraction orders emerge or vanish in the propagating spectrum of periodic non-Hermitian systems are referred to as scattering thresholds. Close to these branch points, resonances from different Riemann sheets can tremendously impact the optical response. However, these resonances were so far elusive for two reasons. First, their contribution to the signal is partially obscured, and second, they are inaccessible for standard computational methods. Here, we explore the interplay of scattering thresholds with resonances and introduce a multi-valued rational approximation to access the hidden resonances. Our theoretical and numerical approach is used to analyze the resonances of a plasmonic line grating. This work elegantly explains the occurrence of pronounced spectral features at scattering thresholds applicable to many nanophotonic systems of contemporary and future interest.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Waves Determined by the Tangential Electric Field of Incident Plane Wave at a Charged and Lossy Planar Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02247v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the normal and tangential decomposition of both the wave vectors and the electric fields of plane electromagnetic waves at a charged and lossy planar interface, all of the incident, reflected, and refracted plane waves are found to be only determined by the tangential electric field of the incident plane wave. The complex wave vectors are easily calculated from the tangential wave vector of the incident plane wave based on the complex angles given by the complex Snell's law. The electric field magnitudes of the incident, reflected and refracted waves are directly derived from the tangential electric field magnitude of the incident plane based on the relationship of the two different types of decomposition and the continuous boundary condition of tangential electric fields. The time-averaged Poynting vectors and the surface Joule heat density at the interface are also given to demonstrate the validity of the formulation by the energy balance condition together with a specific example. This work directly proves the uniqueness theorem of time-varying electromagnetic fields and opens a new and fast route for calculating the reflected and transmitted waves at a charged and lossy planar interface without the need to perform the polarization decomposition of the incident plane wave.</description>

      <title>Low-loss thin-film periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides fabricated by femtosecond laser photolithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically poled lithium niobate on insulator (PPLNOI) ridge waveguides are critical photonic components for both classical and quantum information processing. However, dry etching of PPLNOI waveguides often generates rough sidewalls and variations in the etching rates of oppositely poled lithium niobate ferroelectric domains, leading a relatively high propagation losses (0.25 - 1 dB/cm), which significantly limits net conversion efficiency and hinders scalable photonic integration. In this work, a low-loss PPLNOI ridge waveguide with a length of 7 mm was fabricated using ultra-smooth sidewalls through photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching (PLACE) followed by high-voltage pulse poling with low cost. The average surface roughness was measured at just 0.27 nm, resulting in record-low propagation loss of 0.106 dB/cm in PPLNOI waveguides. Highly efficient second-harmonic generation was demonstrated with a normalized efficiency of 1643%/(W*cm^2) without temperature tuning, corresponding to a conversion efficiency of 805%/W, which is closed to the best conversion efficiency (i.e., 814%/W) reported in nanophotonic PPLNOI waveguide fabricated by expensive electron-beam lithography followed by dry etching. The absolute conversion efficiency reached 15.8% at a pump level of 21.6 mW. And the normalized efficiency can be even improved to 1742%/(W*cm^2) at optimal temperature of 59{\deg}C.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Terahertz Resonances from Ballistic Electron Funnelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new mechanism for second-harmonic generation through geometrically rectifying-funneling-ballistic electrons in THz optical resonators. Our resonant rectifiers inherently act as second-order harmonic generators, rectifying currents without the presence of a potential barrier. Particle-in-cell simulations reveal that femtosecond electron-surface scattering plays a critical role in this process. We differentiate electron funneling from nonlocal plasmonic drag and bulk Dirac anharmonicity, showing that funneling can reduce the required field intensity for second-harmonic generation by 3-4 orders of magnitude. We provide design guidelines for generating funneling-induced second-harmonic generation, including resonance mode matching and materials selection. This approach offers a practical pathway for low-field, geometrically tunable THz upconversion and rectification, operating from sub-10 THz to multiple tens of THz in graphene.</description>
