      <title>Prediction of Alpha-Particle-Immune Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistors (GAA-FET) Based SRAM Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, using 3D Technology Computer-Aided-Design (TCAD) simulations, we show that it is possible to design a static random-access memory (SRAM) using gate-all-around field-effect-transistor (GAA-FET) technology so that it is immune to single alpha particle radiation error. In other words, with the design, there will be no single-event upset (SEU) due to alpha particles. We first use ab initio calculations in PHITS to show that there is a maximum linear energy transfer (LET), LETmax, for the alpha particle in Si and Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$. Based on that, by designing a sub-7nm GAA-FET-based SRAM with bottom dielectric isolation (BDI), we show that the SRAM does not flip even if the particle strike is in the worst-case scenario (LET &gt; LETmax).</description>

      <title>AI-driven Orchestration at Scale: Estimating Service Metrics on National-Wide Testbeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Slicing (NS) realization requires AI-native orchestration architectures to efficiently and intelligently handle heterogeneous user requirements. To achieve this, network slicing is evolving towards a more user-centric digital transformation, focusing on architectures that incorporate native intelligence to enable self-managed connectivity in an integrated and isolated manner. However, these initiatives face the challenge of validating their results in production environments, particularly those utilizing ML-enabled orchestration, as they are often tested in local networks or laboratory simulations. This paper proposes a large-scale validation method using a network slicing prediction model to forecast latency using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and basic ML algorithms embedded within an NS architecture, evaluated in real large-scale production testbeds. It measures and compares the performance of different DNNs and ML algorithms, considering a distributed database application deployed as a network slice over two large-scale production testbeds. The investigation highlights how AI-based prediction models can enhance network slicing orchestration architectures and presents a seamless, production-ready validation method as an alternative to fully controlled simulations or laboratory setups.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing Hyperparameter Analysis for Optimal Sensor Placement in Production Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To increase efficiency in automotive manufacturing, newly produced vehicles can move autonomously from the production line to the distribution area. This requires an optimal placement of sensors to ensure full coverage while minimizing the number of sensors used. The underlying optimization problem poses a computational challenge due to its large-scale nature. Currently, classical solvers rely on heuristics, often yielding non-optimal solutions for large instances, resulting in suboptimal sensor distributions and increased operational costs.
  We explore quantum computing methods that may outperform classical heuristics in the future. We implemented quantum annealing with D-Wave, transforming the problem into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization formulation with one-hot and binary encoding. Hyperparameters like the penalty terms and the annealing time are optimized and the results are compared with default parameter settings.
  Our results demonstrate that quantum annealing is capable of solving instances derived from real-world scenarios. Through the use of decomposition techniques, we are able to scale the problem size further, bringing it closer to practical, industrial applicability. Through this work, we provide key insights into the importance of quantum annealing parametrization, demonstrating how quantum computing could contribute to cost-efficient, large-scale optimization problems once the hardware matures.</description>

      <title>Towards Railway Domain Adaptation for LiDAR-based 3D Detection: Road-to-Rail and Sim-to-Real via SynDRA-BBox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, interest in automatic train operations has significantly increased. To enable advanced functionalities, robust vision-based algorithms are essential for perceiving and understanding the surrounding environment. However, the railway sector suffers from a lack of publicly available real-world annotated datasets, making it challenging to test and validate new perception solutions in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce SynDRA-BBox, a synthetic dataset designed to support object detection and other vision-based tasks in realistic railway scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, is the first synthetic dataset specifically tailored for 2D and 3D object detection in the railway domain, the dataset is publicly available at https://syndra.retis.santannapisa.it. In the presented evaluation, a state-of-the-art semi-supervised domain adaptation method, originally developed for automotive perception, is adapted to the railway context, enabling the transferability of synthetic data to 3D object detection. Experimental results demonstrate promising performance, highlighting the effectiveness of synthetic datasets and domain adaptation techniques in advancing perception capabilities for railway environments.</description>

      <title>Designing for Difference: How Human Characteristics Shape Perceptions of Collaborative Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of assistive robots for social collaboration raises critical questions about responsible and inclusive design, especially when interacting with individuals from protected groups such as those with disabilities or advanced age. Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying robot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since participants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots. In the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that enable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support meaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112 participants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos from a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The experimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise on human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM reflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more pronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human condition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences the assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest, while collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations. Scenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those without them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and interaction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative robots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight the potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback, supporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic systems tailored to diverse populations.</description>

      <title>Active RISs: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)-empowered communication has emerged as a transformative technology for next generation wireless networks, enabling the programmable shaping of the propagation environment. However, conventional RISs are fundamentally limited by the double path loss effect, which severely attenuates the reflected signals. To overcome this, active RIS architectures, capable of amplifying impinging signals, have been proposed. This chapter investigates the modeling, performance analysis, and optimization of active RISs, focusing on two hardware designs: a dual-RIS structure with a single Power Amplifier (PA), and a reflection amplification structure at the unit cell level using tunnel diodes. For the PA-based design, a comprehensive mathematical model is developed, and closed-form expressions for the received signal-to-noise ratio, bit error probability, and Energy Efficiency (EE) are derived. An optimization framework for configuring the phase shifts and amplifier gain is proposed to maximize system capacity under power constraints. Regarding the second design, the integration of a tunnel diode into the unit cell is carefully studied by analyzing its I-V characteristic, enabling the derivation of the negative resistance range and the power consumption model. Furthermore, the intrinsic phase-amplitude coupling of the reflection coefficient is characterized through compact linear algebra formulations, enabling practical optimization of active RISs. Extensive numerical simulations validate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that active RISs can effectively overcome the double path loss limitation and achieve favorable EE trade-offs compared to passive RISs. Finally, the trade-off between the available power budget and the number of active elements is examined, revealing that a higher number of active elements does not always lead to optimal performance.</description>

      <title>AI-enhanced conversational agents for personalized asthma support Factors for engagement, value and efficacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asthma-related deaths in the UK are the highest in Europe, and only 30% of patients access basic care. There is a need for alternative approaches to reaching people with asthma in order to provide health education, self-management support and bridges to care. Automated conversational agents (specifically, mobile chatbots) present opportunities for providing alternative and individually tailored access to health education, self-management support and risk self-assessment. But would patients engage with a chatbot, and what factors influence engagement? We present results from a patient survey (N=1257) devised by a team of asthma clinicians, patients, and technology developers, conducted to identify optimal factors for efficacy, value and engagement for a chatbot. Results indicate that most adults with asthma (53%) are interested in using a chatbot and the patients most likely to do so are those who believe their asthma is more serious and who are less confident about self-management. Results also indicate enthusiasm for 24/7 access, personalisation, and for WhatsApp as the preferred access method (compared to app, voice assistant, SMS or website). Obstacles to uptake include security/privacy concerns and skepticism of technological capabilities. We present detailed findings and consolidate these into 7 recommendations for developers for optimising efficacy of chatbot-based health support.</description>

      <title>Multi-RIS-Empowered Communication Systems: Capacity Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter, using statistical physics methods, asymptotic closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the mutual information for a multi-antenna transmitter-receiver pair in the presence of multiple Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are presented. While nominally valid in the large-system limit, it is shown that the derived Gaussian approximation for the mutual information can be quite accurate, even for modest-sized antenna arrays and metasurfaces. The above results are particularly useful when fast-fading conditions are present, which renders channel estimation challenging. The derived analysis indicates that, when the channel close to an RIS is correlated, for instance due to small angle spread which is reasonable for wireless systems with increasing carrier frequencies, the communication link benefits significantly from statistical RIS optimization, resulting in gains that are surprisingly higher than the nearly uncorrelated case. More importantly, the presented novel asymptotic properties of the correlation matrices of the impinging and outgoing signals at the RISs can be deployed to optimize the metasurfaces without brute-force numerical optimization. The numerical investigation demonstrates that, when the desired reflection from any of the RISs departs significantly from geometrical optics, the metasurfaces can be optimized to provide robust communication links, without significant need for their optimal placement.</description>

      <title>V-RoAst: Visual Road Assessment. Can VLM be a Road Safety Assessor Using the iRAP Standard?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10872v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Road safety assessments are critical yet costly, especially in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), where most roads remain unrated. Traditional methods require expert annotation and training data, while supervised learning-based approaches struggle to generalise across regions. In this paper, we introduce \textit{V-RoAst}, a zero-shot Visual Question Answering (VQA) framework using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to classify road safety attributes defined by the iRAP standard. We introduce the first open-source dataset from ThaiRAP, consisting of over 2,000 curated street-level images from Thailand annotated for this task. We evaluate Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o-mini on this dataset and benchmark their performance against VGGNet and ResNet baselines. While VLMs underperform on spatial awareness, they generalise well to unseen classes and offer flexible prompt-based reasoning without retraining. Our results show that VLMs can serve as automatic road assessment tools when integrated with complementary data. This work is the first to explore VLMs for zero-shot infrastructure risk assessment and opens new directions for automatic, low-cost road safety mapping.
