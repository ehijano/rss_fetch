      <title>A Universal Energy Relation between synchrotron and Synchrotron Self-Compton radiation in GRBs and Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent and brightest GRB 221009A observed by LHAASO marked the first detection of the onset of TeV afterglow, with a total of 7 GRBs exhibiting very high energy (VHE) afterglow radiation. However, consensus on VHE radiation of GRBs is still lacking. Multi-wavelength studies are currently a primary research method for investigating high-energy $\gamma$-ray astronomy. The limited sample of VHE GRBs, combined with their transient nature, hinders the progress of physical studies of GRBs. This paper aims to obtain useful information for GRB research through the properties of blazars, which share significant similarities with GRBs. By fitting high-quality and simultaneous multiwavelength spectral energy distributions with a one-zone leptonic model, the study explores the similarity of radiation properties of blazars and GRBs. A tight correlation between synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission luminosities suggests that blazars and GRBs share similar radiation mechanisms, to be specific, synchrotron radiation produces the observed X-ray photons, which also serve as targets for electrons in the SSC process. We hope that ground-based experiments can observe more GRBs in sub-TeV to confirm these findings.</description>

      <title>Extremely luminous optical afterglow of a distant and energetic gamma-ray burst GRB 230204B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic telescope networks play an important role in capturing early and bright optical afterglows, providing critical insights into the energetics and emission mechanisms of GRBs. In this study, we analyze GRB 230204B, an exceptionally energetic and multi-pulsed long GRB, detected by the Fermi GBM and MAXI detectors, with an isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energy exceeding 10$^{54}$ erg. Time-resolved spectral analysis reveals a transition in the prompt emission from hard (sub-photospheric dominated) spectra during early pulses to softer (synchrotron radiation dominated) spectra in later pulses, indicative of a hybrid jet composition. We report the discovery and characterization of the optical afterglow using the MASTER and BOOTES robotic telescope networks, alongside long-term radio observations extending to 335 days post-burst with the ATCA. At ~1.3 ks post-burst, the optical luminosity was exceptionally high, surpassing even other bright GRBs, such as GRB 221009A (the ``BOAT"). Multi-wavelength modeling, incorporating data from MASTER, BOOTES, DOT, Swift/XRT, and radio observations, was conducted using an external ISM forward-shock top-hat jet model with afterglowpy. The results reveal a narrow and highly collimated jet with a circumburst density of n$_{0}$ ~ 28.12 cm$^{-3}$, kinetic energy E$_{K}$ ~ 4.18 x 10$^{55}$ erg, and a relatively low value of $\epsilon_{B}$ = 2.14 x 10$^{-6}$, indicating shock-compression of the magnetic field in the surrounding interstellar medium. We constrained a low radiative efficiency of ~ 4.3 %. This study highlights the indispensable contribution of robotic networks to early afterglow observations and advances our understanding of GRB 230204B unique characteristics and underlying jet physics.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the estimated electric potential in thunderstorms observed at GRAPES-3 on the hadronic interaction generators used in simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A potential difference of 1.3 Giga-Volts (GV) was inferred across a thundercloud using data from the GRAPES-3 muon telescope (G3MT). This was the first-ever estimation of gigavolt potential in thunderstorms, confirming prediction of C.T.R. Wilson almost a century ago. To infer the thundercloud potential required acceleration of muons in atmospheric electric field to be incorporated in the Monte Carlo simulation software CORSIKA. The G3MT records over 4 billion muons daily that are grouped into 169 directions covering 2.3 sr sky. This enabled changes as small as 0.1% in the muon flux on minute timescale, caused by thunderstorms to be accurately measured. But that requires high statistics simulation of muon fluxes in thunderstorm electric fields. The CORSIKA offers a choice of several generators for low- (FLUKA, GHEISHA, and UrQMD) and high-energy (SIBYLL, EPOS-LHC, and QGSJETII) hadronic interactions. Since it is unclear which combination of the low- and high-energy generators provides the correct description of hadronic interactions, all nine combinations of generators were explored, and they yielded thundercloud potentials ranging from 1.3 GV to 1.6 GV for the event recorded on 1 December 2014. The result of SIBYLL-FLUKA combination yielded the lowest electric potential of 1.3 GV was reported. Furthermore, another seven major thunderstorm events recorded between April 2011 and December 2020 were analyzed to measure the dependence of their thundercloud potential on the hadronic interaction generators. It is observed that the low-energy generators produce larger variation ($\sim$14%) in thundercloud potential than the high-energy generators ($\sim$8%). This probably reflects the fact that the GeV muons are predominantly produced in low-energy ($&lt;$80 GeV) interactions, which effectively magnifies the differences in the meson production cross-sections among the low-energy generators.</description>

      <title>Ejecta Wakes from Companion Interaction in Type Ia Supernova Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae are triggered by accretion onto a white dwarf from a companion which is most likely Roche lobe-filling at the time of the explosion. The collision between the ejecta and a surviving companion carves out a conical wake, which could manifest as an asymmetry when the ejecta reaches the remnant phase. We simulate the companion interaction using the Athena++ hydrodynamics solver to determine the ejecta structure for a double-degenerate type Ia supernova. Ejecta in the wake is of lower density and higher velocity than the unperturbed ejecta. We then evolve the ejecta for several thousand years using the expanding-grid code Sprout. The forward shock within the wake is initially indented, but becomes spherical after roughly a thousand years due to transverse motion of shocked ejecta that fills the wake. The reverse shock travels quickly within the wake, leading to an off-center convergence of the reverse shock and leaving the remnant with an asymmetrical core. This also draws material from the interstellar medium deep into the remnant, eventually reaching the center. Large Rayleigh-Taylor plumes are found around the edge of the wake, creating a toroidal structure composed primarily of ejecta. Estimates of the thermal X-ray emission show that such remnants exhibit observable asymmetries for thousands of years.</description>

      <title>Helical magnetic field structure in 3C 273. A Faraday rotation analysis using multi-frequency polarimetric VLBA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study on rotation measure (RM) of the quasar 3C 273. This analysis aims to discern the magnetic field structure and its temporal evolution. The quasar 3C 273 is one of the most studied active galactic nuclei due to its high brightness, strong polarization, and proximity, which enables resolving the transverse structure of its jet in detail. We used polarized data from 2014, collected at six frequencies (5, 8, 15, 22, 43, 86 GHz) with the Very Long Baseline Array, to produce total and linear polarization intensity images, as well as RM maps. Our analysis reveals a well-defined transverse RM gradient across the jet, indicating a helical, ordered magnetic field that threads the jet and likely contributes to its collimation. Furthermore, we identified temporal variations in the RM magnitude when compared with prior observations. These temporal variations show that the environment around the jet is dynamic, with changes in the density and magnetic field strength of the sheath that are possibly caused by interactions with the surrounding medium.</description>

      <title>Detection of an Orphan X-ray Flare from a Blazar Candidate EP240709a with Einstein Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars are often observed to flare across multiple wavelengths. Orphan flares from blazars have been only detected a few times, providing an opportunity to understand the structure of the jet in the accreting system. We report a remarkable orphan X-ray flare from a blazar candidate EP240709a, detected by Einstein Probe (EP) in July 2024. The multi-band spectral properties and variability support EP240709a as a high-energy peaked BL Lacertae-type object. The flux in 0.5-10 keV increases by at least 28 times to the value of low state in 2020, with non-detection of remarkable flaring in other bands during the same period. EP240709a exhibits the harder-when-brighter tendency in the X-ray band during the orphan flare, while its infrared-optical spectra are featureless. We employ one-zone and two-zone leptonic synchrotron self-Compton models to perform the spectral energy distribution fitting. Detecting this rare orphan flare shows the potential of EP in discovering peculiar activities from AGN in high-cadence X-ray sky surveys.</description>

      <title>The massive fast spinning white dwarf in the HD 49798/RX J0648.0-4418 binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review the properties and discuss some of the puzzling aspects of the unique binary system composed of the luminous hot subdwarf HD 49798 and a white dwarf with mass of 1.2 solar masses and spin period of 13.2 s. This is one of the few massive white dwarfs with a dynamically measured mass and the one with the shortest spin period. It emits pulsed X-rays with a very soft spectrum, powered by accretion from the tenuous stellar wind of its companion of sdO spectral type. The current level of mass accretion cannot provide enough angular momentum to explain the small, but precisely measured, spin-up rate of 72 nanoseconds per year, which is instead best interpreted as the result of the radial contraction of this young white dwarf. The higher mass transfer rate expected during the future evolutionary stages of HD 49798 will drive the white dwarf above the Chandrasekhar limit, but the final fate, a type Ia SN explosion or the collapse to a millisecond pulsar, is uncertain.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Emission Mechanisms of Blazar PKS 1510-089: II. Jet-BLR Connection and Black Hole Mass Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1510-089 is one of the most active blazars across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, displaying periods of flaring activity. This study explores its spectral variability over a decade. By employing the non-thermal dominance parameter, we analyze the H$\beta$ and $\lambda5100\text{ \AA}$ continuum light curves, as well as the full width at half maximum of the H$\beta$ emission line, to identify whether the primary source of the continuum emission is the accretion disk or the jet during activity periods. Our results shows an anti-correlation between the full width at half maximum and the luminosity of the H$\beta$ emission line across all datasets. This indicates, that variations in H$\beta$ luminosity consistently reflects the canonical broad-line region, irrespective of whether the primary ionizing source is the accretion disk or the jet. The anti-correlation persisted when comparing the full width at half maximum of H$\beta$ against the luminosity at $\lambda5100\text{ \AA}$ in the disk dominance regime. These findings, along with the observation that flaring events in the $\lambda5100\text{ \AA}$ continuum, attributed to the jet, coincide with flares in the H$\beta$ emission line, suggest that the base of the jet is located within the broad-line region. Based on the 219 spectra within the disk dominance regime, we estimated a mean black hole mass of $M_{BH}=2.85\pm0.37\times10^{8}\: M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>New Insights on Gamma-Ray Burst Radiation Mechanisms from Multiwavelength Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of high-energy gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) involves complex synchrotron radiation and synchrotron self-Compton scattering (SSC) mechanisms with multiple parameters exhibiting a wide distribution. Recent advancements in GRB research, particularly the observation of very high energy (VHE, $\rm &gt;100~GeV$) radiation, have ushered in a new era of multiwavelength exploration, offering fresh perspectives and limitations for understanding GRB radiation mechanisms. This study aimed to leverage VHE observations to refine constraints on synchrotron + SSC radiation from electrons accelerated by forward shocks. By analyzing two external environments - the uniform interstellar medium and stratified stellar wind medium, we conducted spectral and variability fitting for five specific bursts (GRB~180720B, GRB~190114C, GRB~190829A, GRB~201216C, and GRB~221009A) to identify the optimal parameters characterizing these events. A comparative analysis of model parameter distributions with and without VHE radiation observations reveals that the magnetic energy equipartition factor $\epsilon_B$ is more concentrated with VHE emissions. This suggests that VHE emissions may offer greater constraints on this microphysical parameter. Additionally, we found that the energy budget between VHE and keV-MeV $\gamma$-ray emissions under the SSC radiation exhibits an almost linear relationship, which may serve as a tool to differentiate radiation mechanisms. We anticipate future statistical analyses of additional VHE bursts to validate our findings.</description>

      <title>Axion effects on quark matter and quark-matter cores in massive hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a three-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to describe the charge-parity violating effects through axion field, we investigate the axion effects on quark matter and quark-matter cores in massive hybrid stars. The properties of quark matter vary with the scaled axion field $a/f_a$ in a periodic manner, with a period of $2\pi$. Within the range from 0 to $\pi $, axion field decrease the baryon chemical potential of the first-order phase transition, leading to an increase in normalized pressure and stiffening of the quark matter equation of state. The effect of axions on hybrid star matter that includes the hadron-quark phase transition is contrary to expectations. The axion field shifts the onset of the hadron-quark mixed phase to lower densities but slightly softens the equation of state of the mixed phase matter, which also results in a slight decrease in the maximum mass and corresponding radius of the hybrid stars. However, we also find that the lowering of the onset of the mixed phase significantly increases the radius and mass of the quark-matter core in the hybrid star. Therefore, our results indicate with axion effects, a sizable quark-matter core can appear in $2M_{\odot}$ massive neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Construction of eccentricity reduced initial data for neutron star binaries with the entropy based flux limiting scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of high-resolution shock-capturing schemes is vital in producing highly accurate gravitational waveforms from neutron star binaries. The entropy based flux limiting (EFL) scheme is able to perform fast converging binary neutron star merger simulations reaching up to fourth-order convergence in the gravitational waveform phase. In these results the EFL method was used only in the dynamical evolution of initial data constructed with the Lorene library. Here, we extend the use of the EFL method to the construction of eccentricity reduced initial data for neutron star binaries and present several new BNS simulations resulting from such initial data and show for the first time up to optimal fifth-order convergence in the gravitational waveform phase.</description>

      <title>Exploring variation of double-peak broad-line profile in strongly variable AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometry and kinematics of the broad-line region (BLR) in AGNs are still unclear, which is crucial for studying the physics and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and AGNs. The broad-line profile provides valuable information on BLR geometry and kinematics. In this work, we explore the evolution of line profiles in variable AGNs based on the BLR model of Czerny \&amp; Hryniewicz, where the BLR is driven by the radiation pressure acting on dust at the surface layers of the accretion disk. The line profiles in the low-Eddington-ratio regime show a double-peak profile, which will become a single peak at high Eddington ratios. The high metallicity of $Z\gtrsim 5Z_{\odot}$ is required to reproduce the observational anti-correlation between the peak separation of broad lines and the Eddington ratio for a sample of AGNs. For the broad lines in variable AGNs, it will take several years to several decades to change their line profile if the disk luminosity suffers strong variation in a much shorter timescale. More monitoring of the broad line and continuum in strongly variable AGNs can shed special light on BLR physics.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Coalescence Gravitational Wave Signals Counting and Separation Using UnMixFormer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) observatories approach unprecedented sensitivities, the need for robust methods to analyze increasingly complex, overlapping signals becomes ever more pressing. Existing matched-filtering approaches and deep-learning techniques can typically handle only one or two concurrent signals, offering limited adaptability to more varied and intricate superimposed waveforms. To overcome these constraints, we present the UnMixFormer, an attention-based architecture that not only identifies the unknown number of concurrent compact binary coalescence GW events but also disentangles their individual waveforms through a multi-decoder architecture, even when confronted with five overlapping signals. Our UnMixFormer is capable of capturing both short- and long-range dependencies by modeling them in a dual-path manner, while also enhancing periodic feature representation by incorporating Fourier Analysis Networks. Our approach adeptly processes binary black hole, binary neutron star, and neutron star-black hole systems over extended time series data (16,384 samples). When evaluating on synthetic data with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 10 to 50, our method achieves 99.89% counting accuracy, a mean overlap of 0.9831 between separated waveforms and templates, and robust generalization ability to waveforms with spin precession, orbital eccentricity, and higher modes, marking a substantial advance in the precision and versatility of GW data analysis.</description>

      <title>Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

      <title>Non-radial oscillations of hadronic neutron stars, quark stars, and hybrid stars : Estimation of $f$, $p$, and $g$ modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composition and equation of state (EoS) of dense matter relevant to compact stars are quite inconclusive. However, certain observational constraints on the structural properties of compact stars help us constrain the EoS to a fair extent. Moreover, gravitational asteroseismology gives us a notion of the interior of the compact star viz., its composition and EoS. The next generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors are likely to detect several oscillation mode frequencies of the GWs, specially the fundamental ($f$) mode frequency. In this work we compute the $f$ and the first pressure ($p_1$) mode frequencies ($f_f$ and $f_{p1}$, respectively) with different compositions viz., hadronic matter, quark matter, and hybrid star (HS) matter. For HSs, we also study the gravity ($g$) mode frequency ($f_g$) arising due to the discontinuity in density. For each phase we also study the correlation between the oscillation frequencies of the 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ and 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ compact stars with the other different properties. We find that the different possible composition of compact stars substantially affects the different oscillation mode frequencies. However, the mass-scaled angular $f$ mode frequency ($\omega_f M$) varies universally with compactness ($C$) for all hadronic, quark and hybrid stars. The $f$ mode frequency ($f_{f_{1.4}}$) of the canonical 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ compact star, obtained with the different composition, is quite correlated with the canonical radius ($R_{1.4}$) and tidal deformability ($\Lambda_{1.4}$) while $f_{p_{1.4}}$ is well correlated with the slope parameter ($L$) of the symmetry energy. We also show that $f_{g_{1.4}}$ of the HSs varies almost linearly with $\Lambda_{1.4}$. Should $g$ modes be detected, they could not only support the existence of HSs, but the magnitude of $f_g$ could be useful to understand the strength of quark repulsion in HSs.</description>

      <title>Warped accretion disks and quasars with episodic periodicity of long-term variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been found that some quasars are undergoing quasi-periodic variations (most of them with damped amplitudes) in optical bands from long-term monitoring campaigns, but how to explain the origin of such light curve variations still remains an open question. In this paper, we use the warped accretion disks model to explain the quasi-periodical variations. This model employs a free-bending wave traveling in an accretion disk which causes the orientation of the central part of the disk to oscillate from the line of sight, resulting in a quasi-periodical variation. We numerically solve the governing equation of warp propagation and calculate the simulated R-band light curves, finding that the periodical light curves generated by this model have damped amplitudes. To compare with observations, we select SDSSJ134820.42+194831.5 as a preliminary example from a sample of periodic quasar candidates by combining CRTS with other public survey data, and fitted its light curve with different observational angles. Our result gives a reduced $\chi^{2}\simeq 2.4$, implying that the model might give insights to future application of warped disk model.</description>

      <title>Semblance study of force-field and convection-diffusion solutions with observations of solar magnetic phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantitative model using the semblance method to evaluate differences in transport equation solutions and Local Interstellar Spectra (LIS) for Cosmic Ray (CR) modulation. The semblance method quantitatively compares transport solutions convection-diffusion and force field-and LIS, providing insights into CR behavior. By integrating these solutions into the atmospheric yield function (Caballero-Lopez &amp; Moraal 2012), the model identifies a correlation between the modulation factor and sunspots, and an anti-correlation with the mean magnetic field. The force field solution shows stronger semblance values, aligning better with neutron detector data. Among LIS, models by Lagner, Potgieter &amp; Webber (2003), and Ghelfi et al. (2017) are most consistent, while the Garcia-Munoz et al. (1975) LIS reveals notable variations. This study underscores the semblance method as a critical tool for comparing CR modulation models, advancing predictive models of cosmic ray behavior influenced by solar and interstellar conditions.</description>

      <title>An X-ray high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation in NGC 1365</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents the detection of a high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1365 based on observational data obtained by \emph{XMM-Newton} in January 2004. Utilizing the weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) methods, a QPO signal is identified at a frequency of $2.19 \times 10^{-4}\ {\rm Hz}$ (4566 s), with a confidence level of 3.6\ $\sigma$. The signal is notably absent in the lower 0.2 -- 1.0 keV energy band, with the primary contribution emerging from the 2.0 -- 10.0 keV band, where the confidence level reaches 3.9 $\sigma$. Spectral analysis shows that there are multiple absorption and emission lines in the high-energy band (&gt; 6\ keV). The correlation between the QPO frequency ($f_{\rm QPO}$) and the mass of the central black hole ($M_{\rm BH}$) of NGC 1365 aligns with the established logarithmic trend observed across black holes, indicating the QPO is of high frequency. This discovery provides new clues for studying the generation mechanism of QPOs in Seyfert galaxies, which helps us understand the accretion process around supermassive black holes and the characteristics of strong gravitational fields in active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies Between JWST Observations and Simulations of Quenched Massive Galaxies at $z &gt; 3$: A Comparative Study With IllustrisTNG and ASTRID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have uncovered an unexpectedly large population of massive quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;3$. Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses $9.5 &lt; \log_{10}{(M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot)} &lt; 12$. We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$ compared to JWST observations by up to $\sim 2$ dex. In both simulations, the high-$z$ quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the local $M_{BH}-M_\star$ relation, implying that AGN feedback is key in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are $\sim 200-600$ Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback at $z &gt; 2.3$, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale. Although these simulations differ in many aspects, making a direct comparison challenging, our findings suggest the need for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. At lower stellar masses, the quenched galaxies have denser local environments than the star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environmental quenching helps quench less massive galaxies. We also study the post-quenching evolution of the high-$z$ massive quiescent galaxies and find that many experience subsequent reactivation of star formation, evolving into primary progenitors of $z=0$ brightest cluster galaxies.</description>

      <title>Spread Complexity of High Energy Neutrino Propagation over Astrophysical Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spread complexity measures the minimized spread of quantum states over all choices of basis. It generalizes Krylov operator complexity to quantum states under continuous Hamiltonian evolution. In this paper, we study spread complexity in the context of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and propose a new flavor ratio based on complexity. Our findings indicate that our proposal might favor an initial ratio of fluxes as $\phi_{\nu_e}^0: \phi_{\nu_\mu}^0: \phi_{\nu_\tau}^0 = 1:0:0$ over a more generally expected ratio of $1:2:0$, when the IceCube neutrino observatory achieves its projected sensitivity to discriminate between flavors. Additionally, complexity-based definitions of flavor ratios exhibit a slight but nonzero sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering, which traditional flavor ratios cannot capture.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signal Denoising and Merger Time Prediction By Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mergers of massive black hole binaries could generate rich electromagnetic emissions, which allow us to probe the environments surrounding these massive black holes and gain deeper insights into the high energy astrophysics. However, due to the short timescale of binary mergers, it is crucial to predict the time of the merger in advance to devise detailed observational plans. The overwhelming noise and the slow accumulation of signal-to-noise ratio in the inspiral phase make this task particularly challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep neural denoising network in this study, capable of denoising a 30-day inspiral phase signal. Following the denoising process, we perform the detection and merger time prediction based on the denoised signals. Our results demonstrate that for a 30-day inspiral phase data with a signal-to-noise ratio between 10 and 50 occurring no more than 10 days before the merger, our absolute prediction error for the merger time is generally within 24 hours.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for two peaks in the sound speed in cold dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08760v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I show that in addition to the well-known peak inside massive neutron stars, the sound speed in cold dense QCD matter likely exhibits another peak above neutron star densities before it asymptotes to $c_s=\sqrt{C_s}=\sqrt{1/3}$. Based on the framework reported in arxiv:2408.16738, this approach does not rely on any assumption about the ultra-dense matter not realized in nature. Current multimessenger observation of neutron stars favors the two-peak scenario with a Bayes factor $5.1_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$, where the uncertainties are systematics due to models of neutron star inner cores. This evidence grows to $27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star. The trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below $0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\%$ level) if $2.6M_\odot$ neutron stars exist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark matter, for instance color superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Bulge Oscillation Driven by Outflows of Active Galactic Nuclei. I. Fast Outflow Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing evidence for star formation inside outflows of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The formed stars are injected into bulges and give rise to perturbation of bulges. In this paper, we investigate the issues of non-rotating, spherically symmetric bulges under the perturbation of fast, massive outflows with stars formed inside. We show that the potential perturbation of outflows together with injection and dynamical friction of these stars could drive bulge oscillations. Still, we find non-zero radial velocity of bulges will be driven by the episodic outflows of AGNs and after the AGN quenched, the radial velocity will tend to zero within a timescale $\sim\tau_{\rm AGN}$, which is the AGN's lifetime. For some typical values of bulges and AGNs, we find the expansion and contraction velocities are of a few $10\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ for $10^{10}\,M_\odot$ bulges and mass outflowing rate $500\,M_\odot/\rm yr$, which would give observational signatures.</description>
