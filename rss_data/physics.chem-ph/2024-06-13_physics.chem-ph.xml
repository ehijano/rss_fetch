      <title>Observation of sequential three-body dissociation of camphor molecule -- a native frame approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-body dissociation dynamics of the dicationic camphor molecule (C$_{10}$H$_{16}$O$^{2+}$) resulting from Auger decay are investigated using soft X-ray synchrotron radiation. A photoelectron-photoion-photoion coincidence (PEPIPICO) method, a combination of a velocity map imaging (VMI) spectrometer and a time-of-flight (ToF) spectrometer is employed to measure the 3D momenta of ions detected in coincidence. The ion mass spectra and the ion-ion coincidence map at photon energies of 287.9 eV (below the C 1s ionization potential) and 292.4 eV (above the C 1s ionization potential for skeletal carbon) reveal that fragmentation depends on the final dicationic state rather than the initial excitation. Using the native frame method, three new fragmentation channels are discussed; (1) CH$_2$CO$^+$ + C$_7$H$_{11}^+$ + CH$_3$, (2) CH$_3^+$ + C$_7$H$_{11}^+$ + CH$_2$CO, and (3) C$_2$H$_5^+$ + C$_6$H$_9^+$ + CH$_2$CO. The dominating nature of sequential decay with deferred charge separation is clearly evidenced in all three channels. The results are discussed based on the experimental angular distributions and momenta distributions, corroborated by geometry optimization of the ground, monocationic, and dicationic camphor molecule.</description>

      <title>RGFN: Synthesizable Molecular Generation Using GFlowNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models hold great promise for small molecule discovery, significantly increasing the size of search space compared to traditional in silico screening libraries. However, most existing machine learning methods for small molecule generation suffer from poor synthesizability of candidate compounds, making experimental validation difficult. In this paper we propose Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), an extension of the GFlowNet framework that operates directly in the space of chemical reactions, thereby allowing out-of-the-box synthesizability while maintaining comparable quality of generated candidates. We demonstrate that with the proposed set of reactions and building blocks, it is possible to obtain a search space of molecules orders of magnitude larger than existing screening libraries coupled with low cost of synthesis. We also show that the approach scales to very large fragment libraries, further increasing the number of potential molecules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across a range of oracle models, including pretrained proxy models and GPU-accelerated docking.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Computational Investigation of the Influence of Ethanol on Auto-ignition of n-Heptane in Non-Premixed Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental and computational investigations are carried out to elucidate the influence of ethanol addition on n-heptane auto-ignition in counterflows. An axisymmetric stream of air, temperature gradually increased, is directed onto the surface of an evaporating pool of a liquid fuel. The air-stream temperature at auto-ignition is measured at various strain rates for n-heptane, ethanol, and various n-heptane/ethanol mixtures. Critical conditions for auto-ignition are predicted employing San Diego Mechanism for both fuels and fuel mixtures, and the results are compared with measurements. Measurements and predictions show that low-temperature chemistry (LTC) plays a significant role in promoting auto-ignition of n-heptane at low strain rates, but there is insufficient residence time at high strain rates for LTC to take place, so auto-ignition is promoted by high-temperature chemistry. Experimental and computational results show addition of ethanol inhibits LTC of n-heptane. To identify the responsible elementary steps, computations are performed to identify those dominate O2 consumption and contribute to the temperature rise in the reaction zone for n-heptane and n-heptane/ethanol mixtures at low strain rates. For n-heptane, O2 is consumed primarily by the low-temperature steps that result in ketohydroperoxide; the temperature rise is produced by subsequent LTC steps. For the mixtures, a key step consuming O2 is O2 + CH3CHOH = HO2 + CH3CHO, and the heat release occurs through the classical high-temperature reaction mechanism. Thus, the inhibition of auto-ignition that is observed to occur when ethanol is added to n-heptane arises from the competition for O2 between this step and the LTC addition of O2 to the heptyl radical and to the radical arising from the subsequent isomerization, for n-heptane.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models in $\textit{De Novo}$ Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for molecular generation, particularly in the context of 3D molecular structures. Inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, these models can generate 3D molecular structures with specific properties or requirements crucial to drug discovery. Diffusion models were particularly successful at learning 3D molecular geometries' complex probability distributions and their corresponding chemical and physical properties through forward and reverse diffusion processes. This review focuses on the technical implementation of diffusion models tailored for 3D molecular generation. It compares the performance, evaluation methods, and implementation details of various diffusion models used for molecular generation tasks. We cover strategies for atom and bond representation, architectures of reverse diffusion denoising networks, and challenges associated with generating stable 3D molecular structures. This review also explores the applications of diffusion models in $\textit{de novo}$ drug design and related areas of computational chemistry, such as structure-based drug design, including target-specific molecular generation, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics of protein-ligand complexes. We also cover conditional generation on physical properties, conformation generation, and fragment-based drug design. By summarizing the state-of-the-art diffusion models for 3D molecular generation, this review sheds light on their role in advancing drug discovery as well as their current limitations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hardware-Enabled Molecular Dynamics via Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations using potential energies calculated on quantum computers would allow virtually exact dynamics for chemical and biochemical systems, with substantial impacts on the fields of catalysis and biophysics. However, noisy hardware, the costs of computing gradients, and the number of qubits required to simulate large systems present major challenges to realizing the potential of dynamical simulations using quantum hardware. Here, we demonstrate that some of these issues can be mitigated by recent advances in machine learning. By combining transfer learning with techniques for building machine-learned potential energy surfaces, we propose a new path forward for molecular dynamics simulations on quantum hardware. We use transfer learning to reduce the number of energy evaluations that use quantum hardware by first training models on larger, less accurate classical datasets and then refining them on smaller, more accurate quantum datasets. We demonstrate this approach by training machine learning models to predict a molecule's potential energy using Behler-Parrinello neural networks. When successfully trained, the model enables energy gradient predictions necessary for dynamics simulations that cannot be readily obtained directly from quantum hardware. To reduce the quantum resources needed, the model is initially trained with data derived from low-cost techniques, such as Density Functional Theory, and subsequently refined with a smaller dataset obtained from the optimization of the Unitary Coupled Cluster ansatz. We show that this approach significantly reduces the size of the quantum training dataset while capturing the high accuracies needed for quantum chemistry simulations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Enhancement of the Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in AuPt Nanoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy- and resource-efficient electrocatalytic water splitting is of paramount importance to enable sustainable hydrogen production. The best bulk catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), i.e., platinum, is one of the scarcest elements on Earth. The use of raw material for HER can be dramatically reduced by utilizing nanoclusters. In addition, nanoalloying can further improve the performance of these nanoclusters. In this paper, we present results for HER on nanometer-sized ligand-free AuPt nanoclusters grafted on carbon nanotubes. These results demonstrate excellent monodispersity and a significant reduction of the overpotential for the electrocatalytic HER. We utilize atomistic machine learning techniques to elucidate the atomic-scale origin of the synergistic effect between Pt and Au. We show that the presence of surface Au atoms, known to be poor HER catalysts, in a Pt(core)/AuPt(shell) nanocluster structure, drives an anomalous enhancement of the inherently high catalytic activity of Pt atoms.</description>

      <title>Restricted Open-shell cluster Mean-Field theory for Strongly Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cluster-based Mean Field method (cMF) and it's second order perturbative correction[1], was introduced by Jim\'enez-Hoyos and Scuseria to reduce the cost of modeling strongly correlated systems by dividing an active space up into small clusters, which are individually solved in the mean-field presence of each other. In that work, clusters with unpaired electrons are treated naturally, by allowing the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ orbitals to spin polarize. While that provided significant energetic stabilization, the resulting cMF wavefunction was spin-contaminated, making it difficult to use as a reference state for spin-pure post-cMF methods. In this work, we propose the Restricted Open-shell cMF (RO-cMF) method, extending the cMF approach to systems with open-shell clusters, while not permitting spin-polarization. While the resulting RO-cMF energies are necessarily higher in energy than the unrestricted orbital cMF, the new RO-cMF provides a simple reference state for post-cMF methods that recover the missing inter-cluster correlations. We provide a detailed explanation of the method, and report demonstrative calculations of exchange coupling constants for three systems: a di-iron complex, a di-chromium complex, and a dimerized organic radical. We also report the first perturbatively corrected RO-cMF-PT2 results as well.</description>

      <title>Overtone Transition $2\nu_1$ of $\text{HCO}^+$ and $\text{HOC}^+$: Origin, Radiative Lifetime, Collisional Quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spectra of the first overtone vibration transition of $\text{C-H}$/$\text{O-H}$ stretch ($2\nu_1$) in $\text{HCO}^+$ and $\text{HOC}^+$, recorded using a laser induced reaction action scheme inside a cryogenic 22 pole radio frequency trap. Band origins have been located at 6078.68411(19) and 6360.17630(26) $\text{cm}^{-1}$, respectively. We introduce a technique based on mass selective ejection from the ion trap for recording background free action spectra. Varying the number density of the neutral action scheme reactant ($\text{CO}_2$ and Ar, respectively) and collisional partner reactant inside the ion trap, permitted us to estimate the radiative lifetime of the state to be 1.53(34) and 1.22(34) ms, respectively, and the collisional quenching rates of $\text{HCO}^+$ ($2\nu_1$) with He, H$_2$, and N$_2$.</description>

      <title>From Biased to Unbiased Dynamics: An Infinitesimal Generator Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate learning the eigenfunctions of evolution operators for time-reversal invariant stochastic processes, a prime example being the Langevin equation used in molecular dynamics. Many physical or chemical processes described by this equation involve transitions between metastable states separated by high potential barriers that can hardly be crossed during a simulation. To overcome this bottleneck, data are collected via biased simulations that explore the state space more rapidly. We propose a framework for learning from biased simulations rooted in the infinitesimal generator of the process and the associated resolvent operator. We contrast our approach to more common ones based on the transfer operator, showing that it can provably learn the spectral properties of the unbiased system from biased data. In experiments, we highlight the advantages of our method over transfer operator approaches and recent developments based on generator learning, demonstrating its effectiveness in estimating eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. Importantly, we show that even with datasets containing only a few relevant transitions due to sub-optimal biasing, our approach recovers relevant information about the transition mechanism.</description>

      <title>An attractive way to correct for missing singles excitations in unitary coupled cluster doubles theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled cluster methods based exclusively on double excitations are comparatively "cheap" and interesting model chemistries, as they are typically able to capture the bulk of the dynamical electron correlation effects. The trade-off in such approximations is that the effect of neglected excitations, particularly single excitations, can be considerable. Using standard and electron pair-restricted $T_2$ operators to define two flavors of unitary coupled cluster doubles (UCCD) methods, we investigate the extent in which missing single excitations can be recovered from low-order corrections in many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) within the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) formalism. Our analysis includes the derivations of finite-order, UCC energy functionals which are used as a basis to define perturbative estimates of missed single excitations. This leads to the novel UCCD[4S] and UCCD[6S] methods, which consider energy corrections for missing singles excitations through fourth- and sixth-order in MBPT, respectively. We also apply the same methodology to the electron pair-restricted ansatz, but the improvements are only marginal. Our findings show that augmenting UCCD with these post hoc perturbative corrections can lead to UCCSD-quality results.</description>

      <title>Prospects for NMR Spectral Prediction on Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a prominent analytical tool, with applications throughout chemistry, medicine and solid-state physics. While conventional NMR spectrometers require large magnetic fields to interrogate a sample, recent advances in atomic magnetometry have enabled this spectroscopy far below geomagnetic field strengths. This zero-to-ultralow (ZULF) field regime can be advantageous since it mitigates relaxation and reveals spin couplings that are otherwise obscured, all while using compact and lower-overhead instrumentation. The resulting spectra are nonetheless difficult to interpret without computation, which can be taxing due to the presence of vector couplings and long-range spin networks. Following recent proposals, we demonstrate how fault-tolerant quantum computation could be used to simulate these spectra. Our analysis spans from input selection to the construction of explicit circuits based on qubitized quantum dynamics. By maintaining parity with experimental requirements, we demonstrate how NMR spectral prediction might be an early application for fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Autocatalytic chemical networks play a predominant role in a large number of natural systems such as in metabolic pathways and in ecological networks. Despite recent efforts, the precise impact of thermodynamic constraints on these networks remains elusive. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that allows determining bounds on the thermodynamic affinity and on the concentrations of autocatalysts in mass-action autocatalytic networks. These bounds can be obtained solely from the stoichiometry of the underlying chemical reaction network, and are independent from the numerical values of kinetic parameters. This property holds in the specific regime where all the fluxes of the network are tightly coupled and maximal. Our method is applicable to large networks, and can be used to complement constraints-based modeling methods of metabolic networks, which typically do not provide predictions about thermodynamic properties or concentration ranges of metabolites</description>

Abstract: This work studies machine learning for electron density prediction, which is fundamental for understanding chemical systems and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. To this end, we introduce the Gaussian plane-wave neural operator (GPWNO), which operates in the infinite-dimensional functional space using the plane-wave and Gaussian-type orbital bases, widely recognized in the context of DFT. In particular, both high- and low-frequency components of the density can be effectively represented due to the complementary nature of the two bases. Extensive experiments on QM9, MD, and material project datasets demonstrate GPWNO's superior performance over ten baselines.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice relaxation with non-linear couplings: Comparison between Fermi's golden rule and extended dissipaton equation of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermi's golden rule (FGR) offers an empirical framework for understanding the dynamics of spin-lattice relaxation in magnetic molecules, encompassing mechanisms like direct (one-phonon) and Raman (two-phonon) processes. These principles effectively model experimental longitudinal relaxation rates, denoted as $T_1^{-1}$. However, under scenarios of increased coupling strength and nonlinear spin-lattice interactions, FGR's applicability may diminish. This paper numerically evaluates the exact spin-lattice relaxation rate kernels, employing the extended dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) formalism. Our calculations reveal that when quadratic spin-lattice coupling is considered, the rate kernels exhibit a free induction decay-like feature, and the damping rates depend on the interaction strength. We observe that the temperature dependence predicted by FGR significantly deviates from the exact results since FGR ignores the non-Markovian nature of spin-lattice relaxation. Our methods can be readily applied to other systems with nonlinear spin-lattice interactions and provide valuable insights into the temperature dependence of $T_1$ in molecular qubits.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Flame Structure and Interactions Between Chemical Reactions, Species Transport and Heat Release in Laminar Flames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel method for analyzing counterflow diffusion flames, inspired by Zurada's sensitivity approach for neural networks, is proposed to identify critical species influencing the heat release rate. By further analyzing concentration changes, this method reveals complex interactions among critical radicals across different temperature zones. The study investigates the auto-ignition temperature of n-heptane and ethanol mixtures within a counterflow flame configuration under low strain rates. In n-heptane dominant mixtures, the inhibition of low-temperature chemistry (LTC) by additional ethanol impacts the heat release rate in the high-temperature zone through the diffusion of specific radicals such as \chto, \cthfo, \ctrhs, and \htot. In ethanol-dominant mixtures, higher ethanol fractions increase the heat release rate, primarily due to ethanol decomposition and its subsequent reactions. This method effectively quantifies and compares the influence of both chemical kinetics and species diffusion effects, providing detailed insights into the interactions among species across the reactive field when analyzing the counterflow configuration of complex fuel mixtures.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Dynamics in Wigner Phase Space I : Adiabatic Hybrid Wigner Dynamics</title>

Abstract: The Wigner phase space formulation of quantum mechanics is a complete framework for quantum dynamic calculations that elegantly highlights connections with classical dynamics. In this series of two articles, building upon previous efforts, we derive the full hierarchy of approximate semiclassical (SC) dynamic methods for adiabatic and non-adiabatic problems in Wigner phase space. In paper I, focusing on adiabatic single surface processes, we derive the well-known Double Herman-Kluk (DHK) approximation for real-time correlation functions in Wigner phase space, and connect it to the Linearized SC (LSC) approximation through a stationary phase approximation. We exploit this relationship to introduce a new hybrid SC method, termed Adiabatic Hybrid Wigner Dynamics (AHWD) that allows for a few important `system' degrees of freedom (dofs) to be treated at the DHK level, while treating the rest of the dofs (the `bath') at the LSC level. AHWD is shown to accurately capture quantum interference effects in models of coupled oscillators, and the decoherence of vibrational probability density of a model I$_2$ Morse oscillator coupled to an Ohmic thermal bath. We show that AHWD significantly mitigates the sign-problem and employs a reduced dimensional prefactor bringing calculations of complex system-bath problems within the reach of SC methods. Paper II focuses on extending this hybrid SC dynamics to nonadiabatic processes.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Dynamics in Wigner Phase Space II : nonadiabatic Hybrid Wigner Dynamics</title>

Abstract: We present an approximate semiclassical (SC) framework for mixed quantized dynamics in Wigner phase space in a two-part series. In the first article, we introduced the Adiabatic Hybrid Wigner Dynamics (AHWD) method that allows for a few important `system' degrees of freedom to be quantized using high-level Double Herman-Kluk SC theory while describing the rest (the `bath') using classical-limit Linearized SC theory. In this second article, we extend our hybrid Wigner dynamics to nonadiabatic processes. The resulting Nonadiabatic Hybrid Wigner Dynamics (NHWD) has two variants that differ in the choice of degrees of freedom to be quantized. Specifically, we introduce NHWD(E) where only the electronic state variables are quantized and the NHWD(V) where both electronic state variables and a handful of strongly coupled nuclear modes are quantized. We show that while NHWD(E) proves accurate for a wide range of scattering models and spin-boson models, systems where a few nuclear modes are strongly coupled to electronic states require NHWD(V) to accurately capture the long-time dynamics. Taken together, we show that AHWD and NHWD represent a new framework for SC simulations of high-dimensional systems with significant quantum effects.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Model for Catalytic Methane Pyrolysis</title>

Abstract: Methane pyrolysis provides a scalable alternative to conventional hydrogen production methods, avoiding greenhouse gas emissions. However, high operating temperatures limit economic feasibility on an industrial scale. A major scientific goal is, therefore, to find a catalyst material that lowers operating temperatures, making methane pyrolysis economically viable. In this work, we derive a model that provides a qualitative comparison of possible catalyst materials. The model is based on calculations of adsorption energies using density functional theory. Thirty different elements were considered. Adsorption energies of intermediate molecules in the methane pyrolysis reaction correlate linearly with the adsorption energy of carbon. Moreover, the adsorption energy increases in magnitude with decreasing group number in the $d$-block of the periodic table. For a temperature range between 600 and 1200 K and a normalized partial pressure range for $\mathrm{H_2}$ between $10^{-1}$ and $10^{-5}$, a total of eighteen different materials were found to be optimal catalysts at least once. This indicates that catalyst selection and reactor operating conditions should be well-matched. The present work establishes the foundation for future large-scale studies of surfaces, alloy compositions, and material classes using machine learning algorithms.</description>
