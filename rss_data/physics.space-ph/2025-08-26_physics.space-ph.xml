      <title>Auto-Cal: Automated and Continuous Geo-Referencing of All-Sky Imagers Using Fisheye Lens Modeling and Star Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully automated and continuous calibration framework for All-Sky Imagers (ASIs) that significantly enhances the spatial accuracy and reliability of geo-referenced ASI data is presented. The technique addresses a critical bottleneck in ASI image data reliability and usability for real time space weather via automated geo-referencing under real-world field conditions. The system corrects the lens distortion in ASIs using a well-established fisheye lens model and automatically estimates camera orientation in terms of roll, pitch, and yaw angles relative to True North and the horizontal plane perpendicular to the zenith using star tracking. Unlike traditional methods that require manual intervention and periodic recalibration, Auto-Cal performs nightly unattended recalibrations using observed stellar motion, adapting to mechanical shifts or environmental changes. Each calibration step includes formal error estimates, allowing end users to assess the confidence of geo-located data in real-time. This capability enables dependable ASI operations in remote or unmanned settings and supports higher-fidelity integration with other geophysical instruments. Auto-Cal provides a scalable foundation for maintaining a large array of ASIs, thus enabling long-term atmospheric monitoring and real-time space weather alerts.</description>

      <title>Magnetic interaction analysis of multiple interplanetary coronal mass ejections leading to a historic geomagnetic storm in May 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), the large-scale eruptive phenomena capable of shedding a huge amount of solar magnetic helicity and energy are potential in driving strong geomagnetic storms. They complexly evolve while preceded and followed by other large-scale structures e.g. ICMEs. Magnetic interaction among multiple ICMEs may result intense and long-lived geomagnetic storms. Our aim is to understand the reason of substantial changes in the geoeffectivity of two meso-scale separated counterparts of a complex solar wind structure through investigating their magnetic content e.g. helicity, energy and magnetic interaction among multiple ICMEs. We utilized the insitu observations of solar wind from Wind and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-A (STA) spacecraft during the strongest geomagnetic storm period in past two decades on May 10-11, 2024 and heliospheric imagers onboard STA. Our investigation confirms complex interactions among five ICMEs resulting in distinct counterparts within a coalescing large-scale structure. These counterparts possess substantially different magnetic contents. We conclude that the complex counterpart resulted from the interaction among common-origin ICMEs observed by STA, favorably orientated for magnetic reconnection, had 1.6 and 2.8 times higher total magnetic energy and helicity, respectively, than the counterpart containing a left-handed filament-origin ICME observed by Wind. The left-handed ICME non-favorably oriented for magnetic reconnection with the surrounding right-handed, common-origin ICMEs. Therefore, two medium-separated counterparts despite belonging to a common solar wind structure, were potential to lead different geoeffectivity. This ultimately challenges space weather predictions based on early observations.</description>

      <title>TheUse of Conditional Variational Autoencoders in Generating Stellar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) that generates stellar spectra covering 4000 $\le$ $T_{\mathrm{eff}$ $\le$ 11,000 K, $2.0 \le \log g \le 5.0$ dex, $-1.5 \le [\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{H}] \le +1.5$ dex, $v\sin i \le 300$ km/s, $\xi_t$ between 0 and 4 km/s, and for any instrumental resolving powers less than 115,000. The spectra can be calculated in the wavelength range 4450-5400 \AA. Trained on a grid of \textsc{SYNSPEC} spectra, the network synthesizes a spectrum in around two orders of magnitude faster than line-by-line radiative transfer. We validate the CVAE on $10^4$ test spectra unseen during training. Pixel-wise statistics yield a median absolute residual of &lt;$1.8\times10^{-3}$ flux units with no wavelength-dependent bias. A residual error map across the parameters plane shows $\langle|\Delta F|\rangle&lt;2\times10^{-3}$ everywhere, and marginal diagnostics versus $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, $v\sin i$, $\xi_t$, and $[Fe/H]$\ reveal no relevant trends. These results demonstrate that the CVAE can serve as a drop-in, physics-aware surrogate for radiative transfer codes, enabling real-time forward modeling in stellar parameter inference and offering promising tools for spectra synthesis for large astrophysical data analysis.</description>

      <title>On the analysis of eruptive events with non-radial evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of space weather disturbances, and their deflection from the radial direction critically affects their potential impact on Earth. While the influence of the surrounding magnetic field in guiding CME trajectories is well established, accurately predicting non-radial propagation remains a challenge.
  In this work, we introduce and compare recently developed techniques for analyzing the early deflection of eruptive events. We revisit a largely deflected prominence-CME event of 2010 December 16 using an improved tracking framework and a new application of the topological path method. Our results suggest the deflection of the eruption is dominated by the channeling of the magnetic field lines. This study offers new physical insight into CME guidance mechanisms and validates the predictive capability of the topological path, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic tool for estimating the propagation direction of strongly deflected events.</description>

      <title>Energetic ($&lt;$ 2 MeV) ion fluxes measured by ASPEX-STEPS on board Aditya-L1 during its earth-bound phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During its earth-bound phase of the Aditya-L1 spacecraft of India, the Supra-Thermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of the Aditya Solar wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) was operated whenever the orbit was above 52000 km during 11 - 19 September 2023. This phase of operation provided measurements of energetic ions (with energies 0.1--2 MeV) in the magnetosphere, magnetosheath, and interplanetary medium. Three interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICME) hit the magnetosphere during this period. This provided opportunity to examine the relative roles of ICME-generated solar energetic particles (SEPs) and substorm generated energetic ions on the magnetosphere. We approach this objective by detailed spectral analyses of energetic ion fluxes measured by two units of ASPEX-STEPS. We identify three distinctly different conditions of the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF $B_z$ = 0, $&gt;$ 0, and $&lt;$ 0) and use the derived spectral indices to understand this relative role. By combining these with the simultaneous energetic ion flux variations from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) around the Sun-Earth first Lagrangian (L1) point and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) in the Earth's magnetosphere, we show that the polarity of IMF $B_z$ influences the energetic ion spectra in the magnetosphere by modulating the interplay of the ICME-generated SEP with the energetic particles generated inside the magnetosphere by substorms. Interestingly, ASPEX-STEPS observations also indicate towards directional anisotropy based on spectral indices. This suggests spatially inhomogeneous mixing of energetic ions coming from different source processes.</description>
