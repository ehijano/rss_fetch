      <title>Symmetry and symmetry-breaking in soil pores and climate change mitigation: What fractal geometry can tell us?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soil is a critical component of terrestrial ecosystems, directly influencing global biogeochemical cycles. Despite its importance, the complex architecture of soil pores and their impact on greenhouse gas emissions remain poorly understood. This perspective aims to address this gap by applying symmetry and symmetry-breaking concepts through fractal geometry to elucidate the structural and functional complexities of soil pores. We highlight how fractal parameters can quantify the self-similar nature of soil pore structures, revealing their size, shape, and connectivity. These geometric attributes influence soil properties such as permeability and diffusivity, which are essential for understanding gas exchange and microbial activity within the soil matrix. Furthermore, we emphasize the effects of various land management practices, including tillage and wetting-drying cycles, on soil pore complexity using three-dimensional multi-fractal analysis. Literature indicates that different agricultural practices significantly alter pore heterogeneity and connectivity, affecting greenhouse gas emissions. Conventional tillage decreases pore connectivity and increases randomness, whereas no-tillage preserves larger, more complex pore structures. We propose that integrating combinatorial, geometric, and functional symmetry concepts offers a comprehensive framework for examining the structure-property-function relationships in soil. This novel approach could enhance our understanding of soil's role in the global cycle of greenhouse gases and provide insights into sustainable land management practices aimed at mitigating climate change.</description>

      <title>Turing instabilities for three interacting species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Turing instabilities in a general system with three interacting species. Turing instabilities describe situations when a stable steady state of a reaction system (ordinary differential equation) becomes an unstable homogeneous steady state of the corresponding reaction-diffusion system (partial differential equation). Similarly to a well-known inequality condition for Turing instabilities in a system with two species, I find a set of inequality conditions for a system with three species. Furthermore, I distinguish conditions for the Turing instability when spatial perturbations grow steadily and the Turing-Hopf instability when spatial perturbations grow and oscillate in time simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Robustly encoding certainty in a metastable neural circuit model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localized persistent neural activity has been shown to serve delayed estimation of continuous variables. Common experiments require that subjects store and report the feature value (e.g., orientation) of a particular cue (e.g., oriented bar on a screen) after a delay. Visualizing recorded activity of neurons according to their feature tuning reveals activity bumps whose centers wander stochastically, degrading the estimate over time. Bump position therefore represents the remembered estimate. Recent work suggests that bump amplitude may represent estimate certainty reflecting a probabilistic population code for a Bayesian posterior. Idealized models of this type are fragile due to the fine tuning common to constructed continuum attractors in dynamical systems. Here we propose an alternative metastable model for robustly supporting multiple bump amplitudes by extending neural circuit models to include quantized nonlinearities. Asymptotic projections of circuit activity produce low-dimensional evolution equations for the amplitude and position of bump solutions in response to external stimuli and noise perturbations. Analysis of reduced equations accurately characterizes phase variance and the dynamics of amplitude transitions between stable discrete values. More salient cues generate bumps of higher amplitude which wander less, consistent with the experimental finding that greater certainty correlates with more accurate memories.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation of an optical thermodynamic system into a solitonic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in multimode fibers due to their intriguing physics and applications, with spatial beam self-cleaning (BSC) having received special attention. In BSC light condenses into the fundamental fiber mode at elevated intensities. Despite extensive efforts utilizing optical thermodynamics to explain such counterintuitive beam reshaping process, several challenges still remain in fully understanding underlying physics. Here we provide compelling experimental evidence that BSC in a dissipative dual-core fiber can be understood in full analogy to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in dilute gases. Being ruled by the identical Gross-Pitaevskii Equation, both systems feature a Townes soliton solution, for which we find further evidence by modal decomposition of our experimental data. Specifically, we observe that efficient BSC only sets in after an initial thermalization phase, causing converge towards a Townes beam profile once a threshold intensity has been surpassed. This process is akin to a transition from classical to quantum-mechanical thermodynamics in BEC. Furthermore, our analysis also identifies dissipative processes as a crucial, yet previously unidentified component for efficient BSC in multimode fiber. This discovery paves the way for unprecedented applications of multimode-fiber based systems in ultrafast lasers, communications, and fiber-based delivery of high-power laser beams.</description>

      <title>Active Magnetic Matter: Propelling Ferrimagnetic Domain Walls by Dynamical Frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active matter encompasses many-particle systems with self-propelling units, such as flocks of birds or schools of fish. Here, we show how self-propelling domain walls can be realised in a solid-state system when a ferrimagnet is weakly driven out of thermal equilibrium by an oscillating field. This activates the Goldstone mode, inducing a rotation of the antiferromagnetic xy-order in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction, determined by the sign of the ferromagnetic component. Two opposite directions of rotation meet at a ferromagnetic domain wall, resulting in 'dynamical frustration', with three main consequences. (i) Domain walls move actively in a direction chosen by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Their speed is proportional to the square root of the driving power across large parameter regimes. (ii) In one dimension (1D), after a quench into the ferrimagnetic phase, this motion and strong hydrodynamic interactions lead to a linear growth of the magnetic correlation length over time, much faster than in equilibrium. (iii) The dynamical frustration makes the system highly resilient to noise. The correlation length of the weakly driven 1D system can be orders of magnitude larger than in the corresponding equilibrium system with the same noise level.</description>

      <title>Space-time statistics of 2D soliton gas in shallow water studied by stereoscopic surface mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe laboratory experiments in a 2D wave tank that aim at building up and monitor 2D shallow water soliton gas. The water surface elevation is obtained over a large ($\sim 100\,\text{m}^2$) domain, with centimetre-resolution, by stereoscopic vision using two cameras. Floating particles are seeded to get surface texture and determine the wave field by image correlation. With this set-up, soliton propagation and multiple interactions can be measured with a previously unreachable level of detail. The propagation of an oblique soliton is analysed, the amplitude decay and local incidence are compared to analytical predictions. We further present two cases of 2D soliton gas, emerging from multiple line solitons with random incidence ($|\theta|&lt;30^\circ$) and from irregular random waves forced with a {\sc jonswap} spectrum ($|\theta|&lt;45^\circ$). To our knowledge, those are the first observations of random 2D soliton gas for gravity waves. In both cases Mach reflections and Mach expansions result in solitons that mainly propagate in directions perpendicular to the wave-makers.</description>

      <title>Thermocapillary Thin Films: Periodic Steady States and Film Rupture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stationary, periodic solutions to the thermocapillary thin-film model
  \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t h + \partial_x \Bigl(h^3(\partial_x^3 h - g\partial_x h) + M\frac{h^2}{(1+h)^2}\partial_xh\Bigr) = 0,\quad t&gt;0,\ x\in \mathbb{R},
  \end{equation*} which can be derived from the B\'enard-Marangoni problem via a lubrication approximation. When the Marangoni number $M$ increases beyond a critical value $M^*$, the constant solution becomes spectrally unstable via a (conserved) long-wave instability and periodic stationary solutions bifurcate. For a fixed period, we find that these solutions lie on a global bifurcation curve of stationary, periodic solutions with a fixed wave number and mass. Furthermore, we show that the stationary periodic solutions on the global bifurcation branch converge to a weak stationary periodic solution which exhibits film rupture. The proofs rely on a Hamiltonian formulation of the stationary problem and the use of analytic global bifurcation theory. Finally, we show the instability of the bifurcating solutions close to the bifurcation point and give a formal derivation of the amplitude equation governing the dynamics close to the onset of instability.</description>
