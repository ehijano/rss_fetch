      <title>Quantum Combine and Conquer and Its Applications to Sublinear Quantum Convex Hull and Maxima Set Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm design paradigm called combine and conquer, which is a quantum version of the "marriage-before-conquest" technique of Kirkpatrick and Seidel. In a quantum combine-and-conquer algorithm, one performs the essential computation of the combine step of a quantum divide-and-conquer algorithm prior to the conquer step while avoiding recursion. This model is better suited for the quantum setting, due to its non-recursive nature. We show the utility of this approach by providing quantum algorithms for 2D maxima set and convex hull problems for sorted point sets running in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nh})$ time, w.h.p., where $h$ is the size of the output.</description>

      <title>Embedding Graphs as Euclidean kNN-Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph on n vertices where each vertex has out-degree k. We say that G is kNN-realizable in d-dimensional Euclidean space if there exists a point set P = {p1, p2, ..., pn} in R^d along with a one-to-one mapping phi: V -&gt; P such that for any u, v in V, u is an out-neighbor of v in G if and only if phi(u) is one of the k nearest neighbors of phi(v); we call the map phi a "kNN realization" of G in R^d. The kNN realization problem, which aims to compute such a mapping in R^d, is known to be NP-hard already for d = 2 and k = 1 (Eades and Whitesides, Theoretical Computer Science, 1996), and to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied in dimension d = 1. The main results of this paper are the following: (1) For any fixed dimension d &gt;= 2, we can efficiently compute an embedding realizing at least a (1 - epsilon) fraction of G's edges, or conclude that G is not kNN-realizable in R^d. (2) For d = 1, we can decide in O(kn) time whether G is kNN-realizable and, if so, compute a realization in O(n^{2.5} * polylog(n)) time.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Color Voronoi Diagrams and the Colorful Clarkson-Shor Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $S$ of $n$ colored sites, each $s\in S$ associated with a distance-to-site function $\delta_s \colon \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$, we consider two distance-to-color functions for each color: one takes the minimum of $\delta_s$ for sites $s\in S$ in that color and the other takes the maximum. These two sets of distance functions induce two families of higher-order Voronoi diagrams for colors in the plane, namely, the minimal and maximal order-$k$ color Voronoi diagrams, which include various well-studied Voronoi diagrams as special cases. In this paper, we derive an exact upper bound $4k(n-k)-2n$ on the total number of vertices in both the minimal and maximal order-$k$ color diagrams for a wide class of distance functions $\delta_s$ that satisfy certain conditions, including the case of point sites $S$ under convex distance functions and the $L_p$ metric for any $1\leq p \leq\infty$. For the $L_1$ (or, $L_\infty$) metric, and other convex polygonal metrics, we show that the order-$k$ minimal diagram of point sites has $O(\min\{k(n-k), (n-k)^2\})$ complexity, while its maximal counterpart has $O(\min\{k(n-k), k^2\})$ complexity. To obtain these combinatorial results, we extend the Clarkson--Shor framework to colored objects, and demonstrate its application to several fundamental geometric structures, including higher-order color Voronoi diagrams, colored $j$-facets, and levels in the arrangements of piecewise linear/algebraic curves/surfaces. We also present an iterative approach to compute higher-order color Voronoi diagrams.</description>

      <title>Faster Algorithms for Reverse Shortest Path in Unit-Disk Graphs and Related Geometric Optimization Problems: Improving the Shrink-and-Bifurcate Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a series of papers, Avraham, Filtser, Kaplan, Katz, and Sharir (SoCG'14), Kaplan, Katz, Saban, and Sharir (ESA'23), and Katz, Saban, and Sharir (ESA'24) studied a class of geometric optimization problems -- including reverse shortest path in unweighted and weighted unit-disk graphs, discrete Fr\'{e}chet distance with one-sided shortcuts, and reverse shortest path in visibility graphs on 1.5-dimensional terrains -- for which standard parametric search does not work well due to a lack of efficient parallel algorithms for the corresponding decision problems. The best currently known algorithms for all the above problems run in $O^*(n^{6/5})=O^*(n^{1.2})$ time (ignoring subpolynomial factors), and they were obtained using a technique called \emph{shrink-and-bifurcate}. We improve the running time to $\tilde{O}(n^{8/7}) \approx O(n^{1.143})$ for these problems. Furthermore, specifically for reverse shortest path in unweighted unit-disk graphs, we improve the running time further to $\tilde{O}(n^{9/8})=\tilde{O}(n^{1.125})$.</description>

      <title>Single-Source Shortest Path Problem in Weighted Disk Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present efficient algorithms for the single-source shortest path problem in weighted disk graphs. A disk graph is the intersection graph of a family of disks in the plane. Here, the weight of an edge is defined as the Euclidean distance between the centers of the disks corresponding to the endpoints of the edge. Given a family of $n$ disks in the plane whose radii lie in $[1,\Psi]$ and a source disk, we can compute a shortest path tree from a source vertex in the weighted disk graph in $O(n\log^2 n \log \Psi)$ time. Moreover, in the case that the radii of disks are arbitrarily large, we can compute a shortest path tree from a source vertex in the weighted disk graph in $O(n\log^4 n)$ time. This improves the best-known algorithm running in $O(n\log^6 n)$ time presented in ESA'23.</description>
