      <title>Bricks and $\tau$-tilting theory under base field extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K:k$ be a field extension and let $\Lambda$ be a finite-dimensional $k$-algebra. We investigate the relationship between $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda_K = \Lambda \otimes_k K$ with particular emphasis on various aspects of $\tau$-tilting theory and bricks. We show that many types of objects for $\Lambda$ lift injectively to the same type of object for $\Lambda_K$, and many common constructions in $\tau$-tilting theory commute with the process of extending the base field. One of our main applications is the construction of a faithful functor from the $\tau$-cluster morphism category $\mathfrak{W}(\Lambda)$ of $\Lambda$ to the $\tau$-cluster morphism category $\mathfrak{W}(\Lambda_K)$ of $\Lambda_K$. In particular, this establishes a faithful functor from $\mathfrak{W}(\Lambda)$ to a group whenever $k$ is of characteristic zero which has many important consequences. In the appendix, E. J. Hanson shows the analogous result whenever $k$ is a finite field. Moreover, we give some nontrivial examples to illustrate the behaviour of $\tau$-tilting finiteness under base field extension.</description>

      <title>Semi-infinite parabolic IC-sheaf II: the Ran space version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a sequel to arXiv:2310.0638. Let G be a split reductive group. We define the parabolic semi-infinite category on the Ran version of the affine Grassmanian Gr_{G,Ran}. We study the semi-infinite parabolic IC-sheaf in this category. We provide several descriptions of this object, one as certain colimit, another as an intermediate extension in certain category. We relate the global and local semi-infinite categories of sheaves. We also relate the intersection cohomology sheaf of the Drinfeld compactification of Bun_P with the semi-infinite parabolic IC-sheaf.</description>

      <title>Exceptional dual pair correspondences; case of real groups of split rank one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional real groups have quaternionic forms of split rank 4 that contain dual pairs $G\times G'$, where $G'$ is the split Lie group of the type $G_2$, and $G$ a Lie group of split rank one. In this paper we restrict the minimal representation of the quaternionic group to the dual pair and prove some significant results for the resulting correspondence of representations.</description>

      <title>A Mackey embedding for reduced C*-algebras of real reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is construct an embedding of the C*-algebra of the Cartan motion group of a real reductive group G into the reduced C*-algebra of G itself. The embedding has a number of applications: we shall use it to characterize the Mackey bijection from the tempered dual of G into the unitary dual of the motion group; to characterize the continuous field of reduced group C*-algebras arising from the contraction of G to its Cartan motion group; and to characterize the Connes-Kasparov assembly map in operator K-theory. Our results continue and complete a project that was begun several years ago by the last two authors, who considered the case of complex groups. In the real case, detailed information from the theory of R-groups is used in the construction.</description>

      <title>The Order of the Monster Finite Simple Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the order of the largest of the twenty-six sporadic simple groups known as the Monster, using a straightforward computational approach. The Monster is here defined as a subgroup of the symmetry group of the 196884-dimensional Griess algebra generated by a group of type $2^{1+24}_+.Co_1$ and an additional triality automorphism. Our approach is based on counting arguments for certain idempotents of the Griess algebra called axes. Our proof is self-contained, requiring only established properties of the Conway group as the automorphism group of the Leech lattice, and some of its subgroups.
  Although our approach is conceptually simple, it requires extensive calculation inside a 196884-dimensional matrix group that current computer algebra systems cannot easily handle directly. Instead, we use the software package mmgroup, developed by the second author, which supports fast calculations inside the Monster. To our knowledge, this paper contains the first self-contained computation of the order of the Monster.
  The Monster also acts on the Moonshine module V^#, which is a vertex operator algebra of central charge c=24. We provide a new proof that the Monster is the full automorphism group of the Griess algebra and of the Moonshine module using Borcherds' proof of the Monstrous Moonshine conjectures. In addition, we show that the Monster has exactly two conjugacy classes of involutions. The order of the Baby Monster, the second largest of the sporadic simple groups, is also determined.</description>

      <title>Rings Whose Non-Units are Square-Nil Clean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider in-depth and characterize in certain aspects the class of so-called {\it strongly NUS-nil clean rings}, that are those rings whose non-units are {\it square nil-clean} in the sense that they are a sum of a nilpotent and a square-idempotent that commutes with each other. This class of rings lies properly between the classes of strongly nil-clean rings and strongly clean rings. In fact, it is proved the valuable criterion that a ring $R$ is strongly NUS-nil clean if, and only if, $a^4-a^2\in Nil(R)$ for every $a\not\in U(R)$. In particular, a ring $R$ with only trivial idempotents is strongly NUS-nil clean if, and only if, $R$ is a local ring with nil Jacobson radical. Some special matrix constructions and group ring extensions will provide us with new sources of examples of NUS-nil clean rings.</description>

      <title>Brace $B_{\infty}$ algebras associated with Hopf algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the operadic modeling of brace $B_{\infty}$ algebras, as developed by Gerstenhaber and Voronov, to the context of Hopf algebroids in the sense of Xu. Specifically, we construct a strict $B_{\infty}$ isomorphism between the type I and type II twisted brace $B_{\infty}$ algebras arising from any twistor of a Hopf algebroid. As an application of this framework, we examine two specific brace $B_{\infty}$ algebras derived from Lie algebra pairs, and reveal previously obscured relationships between them. One of these is the dg Lie algebra governing deformations of algebraic dynamical twists, while the other arises from the quantum groupoid comprised of particular invariant differential operators.</description>

      <title>The tensor triangular geometry of fully faithful functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the map on Balmer spectra induced by a fully faithful geometric functor is a quotient map whose fibers are connected. This is an analogue of the Zariski Connectedness Theorem in algebraic geometry and it can be applied to a plethora of examples in equivariant and motivic mathematics. We isolate a significant source of examples by introducing the "concentration" of a tt-category at a well-behaved chosen set of compact generators. Various categories of cellular objects arise in this way. In particular, the "unitation" of a tt-category is the concentration at the unit object. We compute the Balmer spectrum of the unitation of the equivariant stable homotopy category as well as related categories arising in equivariant higher algebra. We also apply our results to the study of the comparison map of a tt-category. Among other results, we prove that the comparison map of a connective category is a quotient map with connected fibers. This involves studying the tt-geometry of weight complex functors, which may be of independent interest. We also study the relationship between the comparison map and the affinization of the Balmer spectrum viewed as a locally ringed space. These results provide a layered approach to understanding the spectrum of a given tt-category, by starting with the Zariski spectrum of the endomorphism ring of the unit, and then passing backwards to larger and larger concentrations (through quotient maps with connected fibers). Significant stages along the way include the passage to the unitation and the passage to the concentration at the Picard group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a locally finite tree T where every vertex has degree &gt;= 3, and a closed noncompact subgroup G of the automorphism group Aut(T), with Tits' independence property (P) and with transitive action on the boundary of the tree. We show that G does not have continuous irreducible representations to a locally convex topological vector space over R, C or H that preserve a continuous nondegenerate sesquilinear form of index p &gt; 1. As the representations of index 1 are already classified, this gives a complete classification of continuous irreducible representations of G that preserve a continuous nondegenerate sesquilinear form of finite index.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct the stable derivator associated to a homotopically complete and cocomplete dg-category by explicitly defining homotopy Kan extensions via suitable weighted homotopy limits and colimits in dg-categories. By restricting the domain of the derivator to finite direct categories, we obtain a well-defined derivator even for pretriangulated dg-categories. This definition enables an explicit description of the derivator associated to a weakly idempotent complete Frobenius exact category, leading to a more direct characterization in terms of Gorenstein projective (equivalently, Gorenstein injective) diagrams.</description>

Abstract: We give a purely derivator-theoretical reformulation and proof of a classic result of Happel and Ladkani, showing that it occurs uniformly across stable derivators and it is then independent of coefficients. The resulting equivalence provides a bridge between homotopy theory and representation theory: indeed, our result is a derivator-theoretic version of the $\infty$-Dold-Kan correspondence for bounded chain complexes. Moreover, our equivalence can also be realized as an action of a spectral bimodule in the setting of universal tilting theory developed by Groth and \v{S}\v{t}ov\'i\v{c}ek.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article develops a practical technique for studying representations of $\Bbbk$-linear categories arising in the categorification of quantum groups. We work in terms of locally unital algebras which are $\mathbb{Z}$-graded with graded pieces that are finite-dimensional and bounded below, developing a theory of graded triangular bases for such algebras. The definition is a graded extension of the notion of triangular basis introduced in previous joint work with Stroppel. However, in the general graded setting, finitely generated projective modules often fail to be Noetherian, so that existing results from the study of highest weight categories are not directly applicable. Nevertheless, we show that there is still a good theory of standard modules. In motivating examples arising from Kac-Moody 2-categories, these modules categorify the PBW bases for the modified forms of quantum groups constructed by Wang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a triangulated category $D$ with an action of a fusion category $C$, we study the moduli space $Stab_{C}(D)$ of fusion-equivariant Bridgeland stability conditions on $D$. The main theorem is that the fusion-equivariant stability conditions form a closed, complex submanifold of the moduli space of stability conditions on $D$. As an application of this framework to finite group actions on categories, we generalise a result of Macr\`{i}--Mehrotra--Stellari by establishing a biholomorphism between the space of $G$-invariant stability conditions on $D$ and the space of $rep(G)$-equivariant stability conditions on the equivariant category $D^G$. We also describe applications to the study of stability conditions associated to McKay quivers and to geometric stability conditions on free quotients of smooth projective varieties.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of Derived Delooping Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finitistic dimension conjecture is closely connected to the symmetry of the finitistic dimension. Recent work indicates that such connection extends to one of its upper bounds, the delooping level. In this paper, we show that the same holds for the derived delooping level, which is an improvement of the delooping level. This reduces the finitistic dimension conjecture to considering algebras whose opposite algebra has (derived) delooping level zero. We thereby demonstrate ways to utilize the new concept of derived delooping level to obtain new results and present additional work involving tensor product of algebras.</description>

      <title>Deformation of the heat kernel and the Brownian motion from the perspective of the Ben Sa\"id--Kobayashi--{\O}rsted $(k,a)$-generalized Laguerre semigroup theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deform the heat kernel and the Brownian motion on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ from the perspective of "$(k,a)$-generalized Fourier analysis" with $k=0$. This is a new type of harmonic analysis proposed by S.Ben Sa\"id--T.Kobayashi--B.{\O}rsted from the representation theoretic viewpoint. In this paper, we construct the $a$-deformed heat kernel and $a$-deformed Brownian motion, and explore their some basic properties. We also prove that the $(k,a)$-generalized Fourier integral kernels are polynomial growth when $k=0$, for a justification of some discussions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group with simply connected derived subgroup. Over the complex numbers there exists a local method to study the geometric properties of a point $g$ in the closure of a Jordan class of $G$ in terms of Jordan classes of a maximal rank reductive subgroup $M \leq G$ depending on the point $g$, and further to the closures of certain decomposition classes in Lie($M$). We adapt this method to the case of an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$, and we give sufficient restrictions on $p$ for it to hold.</description>

      <title>Sharp character bounds and cutoff for symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a flexible technique to bound the characters of symmetric groups, via the Naruse hook length formula, the Larsen--Shalev character bounds, and appropriate diagram slicings. It allows us to prove a uniform exponential character bound with optimal constant $1/2$. We furthermore prove sharp character bounds for conjugacy classes having a macroscopic number of fixed points, and deduce that the random walks on the associated Cayley graphs exhibit a total variation and $L^2$ cutoff.</description>

      <title>Geometric construction of Kashiwara crystals on multiparameter persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a geometric construction of Kashiwara crystals on the irreducible components of the varieties of multiparameter persistence modules. Our approach differs from the seminal work of Kashiwara and Saito, as well as subsequent related works, by emphasizing commutative relations rather than preprojective relations for a given quiver. Furthermore, we provide explicit descriptions of the Kashiwara operators in the fundamental cases of 1- and 2-parameter persistence modules, offering concrete insights into the crystal structure in these settings.</description>

      <title>Principal blocks, irreducible restriction, fields and degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several recent problems in the representation theory of finite groups require determining whether certain characters of almost simple groups belong to the principal block. Since the values of these characters are not yet known, we employ alternative group-theoretical techniques to address the "going down" case. This approach enables us to reduce the block version of well-known results by the third and fourth authors to a question about almost simple groups. Moreover, this suggests a Galois analogue of the height-zero-equal-degree conjecture of Malle and Navarro, which we formulate. However, the "going up" case of irreducible extensions of principal block characters remains unresolved.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Log-concavity of Dominant Lower Bruhat Intervals via Brunn--Minkowski Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bj\"orner and Ekedahl [Ann. of Math. (2), 170.2(2009), pp. 799--817] pioneered the study of length-counting sequences associated with parabolic lower Bruhat intervals in crystallographic Coxeter groups. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of these sequences in affine Weyl groups. Let $W$ be an affine Weyl group with corresponding Weyl group $W_f$ and ${}^{f}{W}$ be the set of minimal representatives for the right cosets $W_f \backslash W$. Let $t_{\lambda}$ be the translation by a dominant coroot lattice element $\lambda$ and ${}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{\lambda}}$ be the number of elements of length $i$ below $t_\lambda$ in the Bruhat order on ${}^{f}{W}$. We show that the sequence $({}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{\lambda}})_i$ is ''asymptotically log-concave'' in the following sense: The sequence of discrete measures $(\mathfrak{m}_k)_k$ constructed from the $k$-fold dilated sequence $({}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{k\lambda}})_i$, as $k$ tends to infinity, converges weakly to a continuous measure obtained from a polytope $P^\lambda$. Moreover, the sequence of step functions $(S_k)_k$ of $({}^{f}{b}_i^{t_{k\lambda}})_i$ converges uniformly to the density function of this continuous measure. By Brunn--Minkowski inequality, this density is log-concave.</description>

      <title>Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras III: The Sewing-Factorization Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite VOA, not necessarily rational or self-dual. In this paper, we establish various versions of the sewing-factorization (SF) theorems for conformal blocks associated to grading-restricted generalized modules of $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$ (where $N\in\mathbb N$). In addition to the versions announced in the Introduction of [GZ23], we prove the following coend version of the SF theorem:
  Let $\mathfrak F$ be a compact Riemann surface with $N$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points, and let $\mathfrak G$ be another compact Riemann surface with $K$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points. Assign $\mathbb W\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes N})$ and $\mathbb X\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes K})$ to the incoming marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. For each $\mathbb{M} \in \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes R})$, assign $\mathbb{M}$ and its contragredient $\mathbb M'$ to the outgoing marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. Denote the corresponding spaces of conformal blocks by $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb W)$ and $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak{G}}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes\mathbb X)$. Let the $\mathfrak X$ be the $(N+K)$-pointed surface obtained by sewing $\mathfrak F$, $\mathfrak G$ along their outgoing marked points. Then the sewing of conformal blocks-proved to be convergent in [GZ24]-yields an isomorphism of vector spaces $$\int^{\mathbb{M}\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes R})}\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb{W})\otimes_{\mathbb C} \mathscr T_{\mathfrak G}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes \mathbb X)\simeq\mathscr T_{\mathfrak X}^*(\mathbb W\otimes \mathbb X)$$
  We also discuss the relation between conformal blocks and the modular functors defined using Lyubashenko's coend in the case where $\mathbb V$ is strongly finite and rigid.</description>

      <title>Color rules for cyclic wreath products and semigroup algebras from projective toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of "color rules" for computing class functions of $Z_k \wr S_n$, where $Z_k$ is the cyclic group of order $k$ and $S_n$ is the symmetric group on $n$ letters. Using a general sign-reversing involution and a map of order $k$, we give a combinatorial proof that the irreducible decomposition of these class functions is given by a weighted sum over semistandard tableaux in the colors. Since using two colors at once is also a color rule, we are consequently able to decompose arbitrary tensor products of representations whose characters can be computed via color rules. This method extends to class functions of $G \wr S_n$ where $G$ is a finite abelian group. We give a number of applications, including decomposing tensor powers of the defining representation, along with a combinatorial proof of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for $Z_k \wr S_n$.
  Our main application is to the study of the linear action of $Z_k \wr S_n$ on bigraded affine semigroup algebras arising from the product of projective toric varieties. In the case of the product of projective spaces, our methods give the decomposition of these bigraded characters into irreducible characters, thus deriving equivariant generalizations of Euler-Mahonian identities.</description>

      <title>A proof of the $q$-Foulkes conjecture for Gaussian coefficients when $a$ divides $c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foulkes' conjecture has several generalisations due to Doran, Abdesselam--Chipalkatti, Bergeron, and Troyka. For the special linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$, these assert that given $a \le c \le d \le b$ with $ab=cd$, the $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$-representation $\mathrm{Sym}^a\mathrm{Sym}^b\mathbb{C}^2$ is a subrepresentation of $\mathrm{Sym}^c\mathrm{Sym}^d\mathbb{C}^2$. We present a short proof in the case where $a$ divides $c$ or $d$, which includes all prime values of $a$. This is the first proof in this family of conjectures valid for infinitely many values of $a$; previously only the cases $a=2$ and $a=3$ were known.</description>

      <title>The Integral Chow Rings of the Moduli Stacks of Hyperelliptic Prym Pairs II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series devoted to describing the integral Chow ring of the moduli stacks $\mathcal{RH}_g$ of hyperelliptic Prym pairs. For fixed genus $g$, the stack $\mathcal{RH}_g$ is the disjoint union of $\lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$ components $\mathcal{RH}_g^n$ for $n = 1, \ldots, \lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$. In this paper, we give presentations and compute the integral Chow rings of the components $\mathcal{RH}_g^{(g+1)/2}$ for odd $g$. As an application, we also obtain presentations and Chow rings for all irreducible components of the moduli stack of hyperelliptic Spin curves of odd genus. An intermediate result of independent interest is the computation of the integral Chow ring of the moduli stack of unordered pairs of divisors of the same even degree in $\mathbb{P}^1$.</description>
