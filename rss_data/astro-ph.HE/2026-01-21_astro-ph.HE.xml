      <title>Discovery of High X-Ray Polarization from the Neutron Star Low-Mass X-Ray Binary Cyg X-2 in the Horizontal Branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from simultaneous X-ray polarimetric and spectroscopic observations of the bright neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Cyg X-2, performed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). IXPE detected significant polarization (15 sigma) from the source in the 2-8 keV energy band with an average polarization degree (PD) of 4.5% +/- 0.3% and a polarization angle (PA) of 128 +/- 2 degrees as the source moved along the horizontal branch of its Z-track. The PD increases with energy reaching 9.9% +/- 2.8% in the 7-8 keV band, with no evidence for energy-dependent variation in the PA. The PA is roughly consistent with previous measurements obtained during the normal and flaring branches and also with the known radio jet axis. From spectropolarimetric analysis, the main contribution to the polarized radiation is due to Comptonized photons, but the polarization is higher than predicted in typical spreading layer geometries. The observed high polarization may be due to a combination of a highly polarized reflected component and a moderately polarized spreading layer on the neutron star surface or produced by electron scattering in an equatorial wind.</description>

      <title>Black hole accretion disks with outflows II. Time dependent Green's function solutions in Newtonian gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Green's function solutions of the Newtonian time-dependent thin disk equations in the presence of outflows, showing that simple and exact analytical expressions exist in various natural limits of the problem. These Green's functions are mathematically very similar to the classical Lynden-Bell &amp; Pringle solutions in the absence of outflows, but differ strongly in their precise physical details and observational implications. Solutions are presented for phenomenological radius-dependent outflows which both do and do not torque the local accretion flow, and for outflows which are launched proportional to the local accretion rate. Generically, outflows lead to a more rapid decay of the bolometric luminosity of the disk, flatten the radial dependence of the disk temperature, and suppress variability in the accretion rate at small radii and low frequencies (on long timescales). Observational implications of these four results are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Einstein Probe discovery of EP J171159.4-333253: an eclipsing neutron star low-mass X-ray binary with clocked bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EP J171159.4-333253 is a new neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary discovered in outburst by the Einstein Probe (EP) on 2025 June 23, exhibiting clocked type-I X-ray bursts, eclipses and dips. In this paper, we report on the results of the X-ray spectral and timing analyses for EP J171159.4-333253 using data collected by EP and NuSTAR during the first 21 days of the outburst. The X-ray burst recurrence time can be characterized over a subset of nine bursts spanning 1.6 days around the NuSTAR observation, and the result is $t_{\rm rec}=8196 \pm 177\,$s with indications of a possible decreasing trend. From the X-ray eclipse events, the binary orbital period and the eclipse duration are estimated to be $P_{\rm orb}=6.48301 \pm 0.00003\,$hr and $D_{\star,X} = 1245.5^{+6.9}_{-6.5}\,$s, respectively. These enable an estimate of the mass and radius of the companion star and the binary inclination, which are $M_2\approx0.6-0.8\,M_\odot$, $R_2\approx0.7-0.8\,R_\odot$ and $i\approx73-75^\circ$, respectively. We also report on joint ULTRACAM and EP observations on 2025 July 21--22, detecting the source optical counterpart and covering an eclipse in both X-ray and optical bands. The optical eclipse is wavelength-dependent and broader than in X-rays, indicating that part of the optical emission arises from an extended region in the accretion flow. Despite a moderate variation in the source flux, the properties of the persistent X-ray emission are typical of a hard spectral state. We further evaluated the ratio of the accretion energy to the thermonuclear energy to be 120--130, implying helium bursts with the accreted hydrogen being depleted in-between bursts.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Multi-Wavelength Afterglows Associated with FRB 20200120E and FRB 20201124A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious radio transients with uncertain origins and environments. Recent studies suggest that some active FRBs may originate from compact objects in binary systems. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework to model the multi-wavelength afterglows of FRBs resided in binary systems and apply it to two representative repeaters, FRB 20200120E and FRB 20201124A. By solving the dynamics and radiation processes of FRB ejecta interacting with the surrounding medium, we compute afterglow light curves in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands. Our results show that radio afterglows offer the best prospects for detection, with their brightness highly sensitive to ejecta kinetic energy and ambient density. Future high-sensitivity radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), could detect these signals. Optical afterglows, though short-lived and challenging to observe, may be significantly enhanced in dense environments, potentially making them detectable with facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). In contrast, X-ray afterglows are predicted to be too faint for detection with current instruments. Our study highlights the potential of multi-wavelength afterglows as probes of FRB progenitors and their surrounding environments, offering crucial insights into the nature of these mysterious transients.</description>

      <title>Possible Multi-band Afterglows of FRB 20171020A and its Implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of mysterious origin, with growing evidence linking at least some of them to magnetars. While FRBs are primarily observed in the radio band, their potential multi-wavelength afterglows remain largely unexplored. We investigate the possible afterglow of FRB 20171020A, a rare nearby and bright FRB localized in a galaxy at only 37 Mpc. Assuming that this source produces a future bright burst, we model the expected afterglow emission in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands under both uniform and wind-like ambient media, within the framework of the magnetar model. Our results show that the optical afterglow is the most promising for detection, but it fades rapidly and requires follow-up within a few hundred seconds post-burst. The radio afterglow may be detectable under favorable conditions in a dense stellar wind, whereas the X-ray counterpart is too faint for current telescopes. These findings suggest that rapid optical follow-up offers the best opportunity to detect the afterglow of the next bright burst from FRB 20171020A, providing unique insights into the progenitor and its environment. To assess observational feasibility, we estimate the event rate of nearby FRBs with sufficient energy to power detectable afterglows, finding a rate of $\sim$0.3 per year for CHIME surveys. Although this rate is low and the optical detection timescale is short, coordinated fast-response strategies using global telescope networks could significantly improve the chance of success. As more nearby FRBs are discovered, multi-wavelength observations will be essential in unveiling the physical nature of these enigmatic events.</description>

      <title>Evidence for 1.01 s Pulsations of the Central Compact Object in the Supernova Remnant RCW 103 with ASCA, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron-star X-ray source 1E 161348-5055, associated with the supernova remnant RCW 103, exhibits clear intensity variations with a period of 6.67 hr. To clarify the nature of this object and its long periodicity, detailed timing studies were applied to its archival X-ray data, taken with ASCA (in 1993), XMM-Newton (in 2001, 2005, and 2016), and NuSTAR (2016 and 2017). It was assumed that the 6.67 hr period arises due to the beat between the rotation and free precession periods of the star that is slightly aspherical. By removing timing perturbations to be caused by this long periodicity, the six data sets consistently yielded evidence for pulsations at periods of P~1.01 s, to be interpreted as the objects' spin period, although the optimum energy range differed among the data sets. The measured six periods accurately line up on a linear spin-down trend of dP/dt = 1.097x 10^{-12} s/s. The object is implied to have a characteristic age of 14.7 kyr, a spin-down luminosity of 4.2x10^{34} erg/s, which is insufficient to power the X-ray luminosity, a dipole magnetic field of ~4.6x10^{13} G, and a toroidal field of ~7 x10^{15} G. Its similarity and dissimilarity to magnetars are discussed. An emission geometry, which crudely explain these results, is presented.</description>

      <title>Captured are circularized: A relativistic treatment of extreme mass ratio inspirals crossing accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A small body orbiting around an accreting massive object and periodically crossing its accretion disk is a common configuration in astrophysics. In this work, we investigate the secular evolution of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass object (SMO), e.g., a star or a stellar-mass black hole (sBH), collides with the accretion disk of a central supermassive black hole (SMBH), within a fully relativistic framework. We find (1) the disk always tends to align the SMO no matter what the initial orbital inclination $\iota$ relative to the disk is, (2) the final orbital eccentricity of the SMO captured by the disk is always low though the orbital eccentricity may temporarily grow when the orbital inclination $\iota$ is large and the SMO is an sBH, and (3) via collisions with the accretion disk only, only a small fraction of sBHs that are initially close to the SMBH and close to the disk can be captured by the disk within typical disk lifetime of active galactic nuclei. Two-body scatterings between SMOs in the nuclear stellar cluster play an essential role in randomly kicking sBHs towards the disk and boosting the capture rate.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transient (LPA J0108+13) with repeated bursts was detected on the Large Phased Array (LPA) radio telescope at a central frequency of 110.4 MHz in the direction of the radio galaxy 3C 33. The flux density of bursts ranges from tens to hundreds of Jy, and the duration of the bursts is \approx 1^m - 4^m. In daily observations, the total duration of which at the location of the transient exceeds 200 hours in the observation interval 2013-2025, 6 bursts were found. The nature of the source could not be determined. We believe that a new type of transients has been discovered.</description>

      <title>Detection of a Millisecond Periodicity in BATSE Short Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent oscillations at kilohertz frequencies have recently been detected in a small number of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), suggesting quasi-periodic dynamics in their central engines. A prominent example is GRB~230307A, which exhibited a brief, highly coherent, energy-dependent periodic signal interpreted as the possible spin signature of a nascent millisecond magnetar formed after a compact binary merger. Motivated by these developments, we conducted a comprehensive search for similar signals, accounting for both temporal and spectral dependencies, in 532 short GRBs with time-tagged event data recorded by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) onboard the \textit{Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory}. Within this sample, we identify a single statistically significant case: GRB~960616 (BATSE trigger~5502), in which the $\sim$30~ms main emission episode is coherently modulated at 1100~Hz, with the strongest modulation above 320~keV and a fractional amplitude of $\sim$47\%. Assuming the presence of a coherent periodic modulation, we use data-driven Monte Carlo simulations to place an upper limit of $\sim$8\% on the fraction of the total radiated energy that can be modulated by the QPO. This event, exhibiting a periodicity at $\sim$0.91~ms, further supports the possibility that millisecond periodicities can arise during GRBs in merger-driven scenarios.</description>

      <title>Timing analysis of a sample of five cataclysmic variable candidates observed by the XMM-Newton satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate polars are a class of cataclysmic variables in which a white dwarf accretes material from a companion star. The intermediate polar nature confirmation usually derives from the detection of two periods in both $X$-ray and optical photometry. In this respect, the high energy signal is often characterized by modulations on the white dwarf spin and the orbital period. However, noting that the periodograms may be characterized by strong features also at the synodic period and/or other sidebands, the timing analysis of the $X$-ray signal may offer the unique possibility to firmly discover an intermediate polar candidate. Here, we concentrate on a sample of five cataclysmic variable {binary} candidates: {i.e. SAXJ1748.2-2808, 1RXS J211336.1+542226, CXOGC J174622.7-285218, CXOGC J174517.4-290650, and V381 Vel, listed in the IPHome catalogue. Our main aim is to confirm if they belong to the intermediate polar class or not. The results of our analysis show that we can safely assess the intermediate polar nature of all the considered sources, apart for the case of V381 Vel which instead behaves like a cataclysmic variable of the polar subclass. Moreover, the source SAXJ1748.2-2808, previously classified as a HMXB, appears to be, most likely, an intermediate polar variable.</description>

      <title>Exploring Superfluid Angular Momentum Reservoir Effect on Pulsar Glitches and Forecasting Next Glitches of the Crab Pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar glitches are generally viewed as stochastic events driven by sudden angular momentum transfer from the neutron star's superfluid interior to its crust. Except two peculiar pulsars with quasi-periodic glitches, this stochastic view has prevailed. Here, by clustering temporally proximate small glitches of the Crab pulsar, we uncover clear evidence of an underlying quasi-periodic modulation, challenging the paradigm of purely random behavior. Furthermore, our correlation analyses reveal a strong positive relationship between glitch cluster size and waiting time since the preceding clusters. These findings demonstrate the effect of angular momentum reservoir operating over long-term scales and enable the predictions of next glitching window. Remarkably, two minor glitches detected in July and August 2025, which align with our initial prediction made in June, should be confirmed as the onset of this predicted activity. Inspired by the initial success, we forecast the occurrence of a major glitch from now until August 2026, with possible glitch size up to a relative change in rotational frequency of $697.2 \times 10^{-9}$. Physically, the observed long-term quasi-periodicity and cluster size-waiting time correlations imply that each glitch event releases only a fraction of the stored superfluid angular momentum. This partial-release mechanism provides a unified framework for both stochastic and quasi-periodic glitch behaviors across different pulsars, underscoring the universality of the superfluid angular momentum reservoir effect. As the most intensively monitored object, the Crab pulsar serves as a natural laboratory for studying angular momentum inside neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a soft X-ray lag in the tidal disruption event AT2021ehb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report the detection of soft X-ray time lags-i.e. variability in the softer photons lagging behind that in the harder photons-in seven XMM-Newton observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT2021ehb. We find correlated variability between the soft (0.3-0.7 keV) and hard (0.9-10 keV) bands on about 10^4 s time-scales, and measure a soft lag of about 500 s. This behaviour is broadly consistent with the disk-corona reverberation scenario established in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Together with the previously reported strong hard X-ray emission and broad Fe K line, our results suggest the presence of a compact corona and prominent relativistic disk reflection in AT2021ehb. The unusually high blackbody temperature (peaking at about 200 eV) is difficult to reconcile with thermal emission from a standard accretion disk around a about 10^7 Msun black hole, and may instead be analogous to the soft excess commonly observed in AGNs, whose physical origin remains debated. Finally, the measured lags offer a possible explanation for the rapid X-ray flux decline that occurred only three days after the peak, pointing to a scenario in which the corona cools following a sudden loss of the magnetic support required to sustain it.</description>

Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) have been proposed as evolutionary products of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) through a stage in which they are spider pulsars (i.e., redbacks and black widows). However, recent work has found that the systemic kicks of observed MSPs are significantly lower than the kicks of LMXBs and spiders, which appears to be in tension with this evolutionary model. We argue that this tension can be relieved, at least to some degree, by considering the fact that the observed MSPs are located at relatively short distances, whereas spider pulsars are located at greater distances and LMXBs are situated even further away. We model the distance-dependent kinematic bias for dynamically old objects, which favors observing objects that have received low kicks at short distances and correct the observed systemic kicks for this bias. We find that this kinematic bias can be big enough to close the gap between the MSP and LMXB kicks, although the spider pulsars appear to come from a slightly different systemic kick distribution, but this difference is not necessarily physical. All corrected systemic kick distributions are consistent with predictions from binary population synthesis for progenitor systems with a post-supernova orbital period of $P_{\text{orb}}\leq10\,$d and a companion mass of $M_{c}\leq1\,M_{\odot}$, where the natal kicks are calibrated to the velocities of young isolated pulsars. We conclude that the difference in observed systemic kicks is not necessarily in tension with a common origin for MSPs, spider pulsars, and LMXBs.</description>

      <title>Probing Circumstellar Material and Shock Acceleration in Core-Collapse Supernovae with High-Energy Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study high-energy (HE) neutrino production from interactions between supernova (SN) ejecta and the surrounding circumstellar material (CSM), focusing on regular Type~II and Type~IIn SNe. Using observationally inferred CSM density distributions, we calculate the resulting neutrino fluxes and examine their dependence on key parameters, including the CSM density normalization $D_*$, outer radius $R_{\rm csm}$, proton acceleration efficiency $\epsilon_p$, and magnetic energy fraction $\epsilon_B$. Detection prospects are assessed with a binned likelihood analysis for IceCube, indicating that nearby SNe with moderately dense, confined CSM can produce detectable signals, with a typical detection horizon of $\sim 0.1$ - 1 Mpc. For a Galactic SN at $\sim 10$ kpc, high-statistics neutrino data with detailed temporal and spectral information can constrain $D_*$, $R_{\rm csm}$, and $\epsilon_p$ to within a factor of $\sim 10$ or to a precision of $\sim 20\%$, depending on the assumed values of $D_*$ and $R_{\rm csm}$. These neutrino signals thus provide a complementary probe of the CSM profile and shock acceleration, alongside traditional electromagnetic observations.</description>

      <title>Modified hadronic interactions in 3-dimensional simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to test the impact of ad-hoc modifications of some of the generic parameters of hadronic interactions -- cross section, elasticity, and multiplicity -- on any observable quantity using full 3-dimensional simulations of extensive air showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Our approach not only extends the existing 1-dimensional tools to three dimensions, but also introduces more flexible features to better respond to the needs of both theory and experiment. We first thoroughly validate the \conexD framework for the simulation of both longitudinal and lateral features of air showers, in particular for a non-standard configuration of the framework in which different energy thresholds for modifications are applied. Moreover, we show that the implementations of the ad-hoc modifications in this configuration are consistent with the previous one-dimensional simulations. Lastly, we discuss the importance of studying the interaction modifications in three dimensions and the effects of parallel modifications of multiple parameters.</description>

      <title>A long-term multiwavelength study of the flat spectrum radio quasar OP 313</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar OP 313 is a high-redshift (z = 0.997) blazar that entered an intense gamma-ray active phase from November 2023 to March 2024, as observed by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We present a multiwavelength analysis covering 15 years of data, from August 2008 to March 2024, to contextualize this period of extreme gamma-ray activity within the long-term emission of the source. We analyzed a long-term, comprehensive, multiwavelength dataset from different facilities and projects from radio to gamma-rays. We identified the 7 most intense gamma-ray flaring periods and performed a kinematic analysis of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data to determine whether new jet components emerged before or during these flares. For 2 of these flaring periods, we performed the modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED). The VLBA-BU-BLAZAR and MOJAVE datasets reveal a new jet component appearing in both visibility datasets prior to the onset of one of the strongest gamma-ray flares. By comparing the timing of the VLBA-BU-BLAZAR knots ejection with the gamma-ray flaring periods, we constrained the setup of the SED modeling. We also found that the first gamma-ray flaring period is less Compton-dominated than the others. Our results suggest that the recent activity of OP 313 is triggered by new jet components emerging from the core and interacting with a standing shock. The {\gamma}-ray emission likely arises from dusty torus photons upscattered via Inverse Compton (IC) by relativistic jet electrons. The SED modeling indicates that this component is less dominant during the first {\gamma}-ray flaring period than the later ones.</description>

Abstract: Reactions between atomic nuclei are measured in great detail in terrestrial laboratory experiments; transferring and extrapolating this knowledge to how the same reactions act within cosmic environments presents major challenges. Cross-disciplinary efforts are needed in view of the many nuclear reactions that govern the chemical evolution of the universe, and occur in a broad range of stellar plasma conditions that require astrophysical exploration. Since the early identification of 'processes' of nucleosynthesis, new insights have been obtained on the complexity of nuclear reaction mechanisms. We use 12C induced capture and fusion processes to illustrate the challenge of low-energy measurements and of using theoretical methods to extrapolate measurements towards energy regimes within cosmic sources. Particle beam experiments at accelerator facilities above and deep underground simulate stellar reactions, new experimental facilities and methods complement these, and this is further complemented by improved theoretical tools to calculate the quantum effects of nuclear reactions at the various cosmic conditions. Astronomical signatures of cosmic nuclear reactions are deduced from light curves characterizing cosmic explosions through gamma-ray lines and presolar grains to the detection of rare neutrino particles from our Sun to distant cosmic events. High resolution spectroscopy of stars has been expanded to objects measured in the X-ray and the gamma energy range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Astro-seismology and isotopic analysis of meteoritic inclusions provide new tools. Chemical-evolution models describe the complex dynamics during the evolution of galaxies. This article summarizes the experimental and theoretical work, and the broad range of observational tools that test the experimental data and the theoretical interpretation of nuclear processes in the cosmos.</description>

      <title>The DESI Transients Survey: Legacy Classifications and Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first systematic spectroscopic observations of extragalactic transients from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), as part of the DESI Transients Survey program. With 5,000 fibers and an ${\sim} 8$ deg$^2$ field of view, we exploit DESI as a machine for the discovery and classification of transients. We present transient classifications from archival DESI data in Data Releases 1 and 2, relying on a combination of a secondary target program and serendipitous observations. We also present observations from the first 6 months of the DESI spare fiber program dedicated to transients. The program is run in coordination with a dedicated DECam time-domain survey, serving as a pathfinder for what we will be able to achieve in conjunction with the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We classify over 250 transients, of which the majority were previously unclassified. The sample comprises thermonuclear and core-collapse supernovae and tidal disruption events (TDEs), including a TDE observed before its discovery in imaging. We demonstrate DESI's ability to classify a population of faint transients down to $r\sim 22.5$ mag during main survey operations, with negligible impacts on DESI's main observations. can you make this plain text for arxiv abstarct</description>

      <title>Rate of Repeating Tidal Disruption Events with 5--19 years interval constrained by CRTS and ZTF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistics on tidal disruption events (TDEs) may be contaminated by repeating TDEs (rTDEs), which have been extensively discovered recently. However, the origin of rTDEs remains unclear. In addition, no statistical research on rTDEs with time intervals $&gt;5$ years has been made yet. In this work, we searched for rTDEs with time intervals of 5--19 years using CRTS data in a sample of 16 ZTF BTS TDEs at $z&lt;0.05$. We found 2 rTDE candidates, AT 2019azh and AT 2024pvu, with time intervals of 13.2 and 17.1 years, respectively. The peak luminosities of CRTS flares are close to those of ZTF flares. For the CRTS flare of AT 2024pvu, using GALEX UV observations near the peak, we measured a blackbody temperature of $\sim19500$ K, consistent with TDEs and higher than SNe. Moreover, we estimated the expected number of SNe in the sample to be $\lesssim0.08$, and hence the probability that both CRTS flares are SNe is only 0.3\%. Therefore, the possibility that both CRTS flares are SNe can be ruled out, and it is likely that both are TDEs. Using the two rTDEs, we inferred that the TDE rate is 2--3 orders of magnitude higher than the average over 5--19 years prior to TDE detection. Considering another two rTDEs with intervals of $\sim$2 years in the sample and possible rTDEs missed by CRTS, rTDEs with intervals of $&lt;20$ years may account for 25\%--60\% of the TDE sample. We prefer to explain rTDEs as repeating partial TDEs, but the possibility of independent TDEs cannot be ruled out and requires future observational tests.</description>

      <title>Simulating the quasi-ballistic regime of a short Gamma-Ray Burst jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extends the 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a jet emerging from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger presented in Pavan et al. (2023), in which an incipient jet was manually injected into the realistic environment imported from a previous general-relativistic MHD simulation of a merging BNS system. The jet evolution is followed up to almost 10 seconds without loss of resolution. Our results reveal that the jet faces challenges in penetrating the dense surroundings, leading to a barely successful outflow that exhibits structural asymmetries and low Lorentz factors. By the end of the extended simulation, 98% of the jet energy is converted to kinetic form and its angular structure is stabilized. The physical quantities inferred thus provide reliable inputs for afterglow emission calculations. This work demonstrates a method for simulating jets in 3D up to nearly ballistic regimes that is general and ready to be applied to any jet in a BNS merger context.</description>

      <title>Tidal capture and repeating partial tidal disruption events of giant stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an object is scattered near a supermassive black hole (SMBH), tidal oscillations excited within it reduce its orbital energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This process, called tidal capture, can also occur when the object approaches even closer to the SMBH, resulting in a partial tidal disruption event (pTDE). Previous studies on pTDEs of main-sequence stars have shown that as the disruption intensifies, dynamical effects dominate over tidal oscillations, causing the remnant material to acquire a kick velocity instead of being captured by the SMBH. In this work, we performed hydrodynamic numerical simulations of pTDEs involving giant stars. We found that for weaker disruptions, the dynamical behavior of the remnant material resembles that of main-sequence stars. However, as the disruptions deepen, the remnant material transitions from gaining energy to losing energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This behavior markedly differs from that of main-sequence stars, demonstrating that the presence of a compact core significantly influences the dynamical processes in pTDEs. Our simulations reveal that the energy change of the remnant material strongly correlates with asymmetric mass -- lossspecifically, the difference in mass outflow between the Lagrange points L1 and L2. This suggests that the energy change stems from asymmetric mass loss, consistent with conclusions from previous studies on main-sequence stars. However, quantitative analysis contradicts earlier models, indicating that the dynamical model of pTDEs requires further refinement. Finally, we discuss the characteristics of repeating pTDEs produced by this process and their potential observability, as well as the implications for the long-term orbital evolution of high eccentricity extreme mass ratio inspiral systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating radio emission from flickering AGN jets: travelling shocks and hotspot brightening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of flickering variability in jet power on the luminosity and morphology of radio galaxies. We use a Lagrangian particle method together with relativistic hydrodynamics simulations using the PLUTO code to track the evolution of electron spectra through particle acceleration at shocks and cooling processes. We introduce an adapted version of this method which improves tracking of adiabatic cooling in regimes where low density jet material mixes with high density from the ambient medium in the lobes. We find that rapid increases in jet power can lead to large increases in hotspot luminosity due to the interaction of a travelling shock structure with the pre-existing shock structure at the jet head. We show that in some cases it may be possible to identify a bright region of emission corresponding to a shock travelling along the jet axis. We find that the time-averaged radiative efficiency of variable jets is similar to their steady counterparts, but find significant departures from this on an instantaneous basis. We suggest that, together with environmental effects and differences in the average powers of jets, variable jet powers may have a significant impact on how we understand the diversity of radio jets seen in observations and have significant implications for interpretations of jet powers, energy budgets and luminosity-linear size diagrams.</description>

      <title>Broadband Variability Analysis of FSRQ PKS\,0402-362 with Indications of Quasi-Periodic Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral study of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS~0402$-$362 using \textit{Fermi}-LAT/Swift-XRT/UVOT observations spanning from MJD 54686-60321. The $\gamma$-ray light curve exhibits multiple phases of enhanced activity, with the fractional variability parameter ($F_{\mathrm{var}}$) showing larger amplitudes at longer timescales, consistent with variability trends observed in other FSRQs. Statistical analysis of the flux and spectral index distributions using the Anderson--Darling test and histogram fitting reveals that both distributions deviate from a single log-normal form and are better represented by a double log-normal profile, indicating two distinct flux states. A search for quasi-periodic oscillations in the $\gamma$-ray emission using the Lomb--Scargle periodogram identified a significant periodic signal at $\sim$413~days with a confidence level exceeding $3\sigma$. However the proximity of the timescale to one year and limited number of observed cycles prevents a definitive interpretation. Broadband spectral energy distributions for six flux states were modeled using a one-zone leptonic framework incorporating synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC), and external Compton (EC) components. The SEDs are well reproduced with physically reasonable parameters: high-flux states exhibit harder electron spectra and lower magnetic field strengths ($B \sim 0.2--0.6\,\mathrm{G}$), while low-flux states show softer spectra and stronger magnetic fields ($B \sim 1.3\,\mathrm{G}$). The fitted break energy decreases during high-flux states, suggesting enhanced radiative cooling and a transition toward a particle- or kinetic-energy-dominated jet. These trends are consistent with the ``harder-when-brighter'' behavior commonly observed in blazars.</description>

Our work generalizes the face-on results of Gelles et al. (2025) to arbitrary viewing inclination. Due to a combination of geometry and relativistic aberration, the polarization of the jet is not left-right symmetric, and the degree of asymmetry can shed light on both the viewing angle and the plasma bulk Lorentz factor. We show that there is always a radius in the jet at which the polarization transitions from azimuthal to radial; this radius is different along the spine and limb of the jet. We propose metrics that can be used to constrain the black hole spin, inclination angle, and plasma Lorentz factor from these polarimetric signatures, and we discuss the impact of limb-brightening on these measurements. We anticipate that these polarimetric signatures can be studied with current or forthcoming data in M87, NGC 315, NGC 4261, Centaurus A, Cygnus A, and other systems. Observations of the polarization of the base of the counter-jet in higher inclination sources would provide a particularly promising probe of black hole spin.</description>

      <title>Variability as a new discovery channel for Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in the Time Domain Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Between the groundbreaking detections of stellar-mass black holes by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA and JWST's revelation of a surprisingly abundant population of supermassive black holes, one crucial missing link remains: the elusive intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). IMBHs represent a key phase in the hierarchical growth of black holes, yet they have persistently evaded detection. Traditional methods, effective for both actively accreting and quiescent black holes, have largely failed to uncover this hidden population. Here, we argue that novel observational strategies--particularly time-domain variability studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and tidal disruption events--provide a promising path forward. Finding IMBHs will resolve critical gaps in our understanding of black hole formation and the various mechanisms driving their subsequent growth. The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory, with its unprecedented capacity to monitor the dynamic sky, stands to revolutionize our ability to detect these long-sought IMBHs, shedding new light on the assembly history of black holes across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Locating the missing large-scale emission in the jet of M87* with short EHT baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Very-Long Baseline Interferometric arrays, nearly co-located stations probe the largest scales and typically cannot resolve the observed source. In the absence of large-scale structure, closure phases constructed with these stations are zero and, since they are independent of station-based errors, they can be used to probe data issues. Here, we show with an expansion about co-located stations, how these trivial closure phases become non-zero with brightness distribution on smaller scales than their short baseline would suggest. When applied to sources that are made up of a bright compact and large-scale diffuse component, the trivial closure phases directly measure the centroid relative to the compact source and higher-order image moments. We present a technique to measure these image moments with minimal model assumptions and validate it on synthetic Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data. We then apply this technique to 2017 and 2018 EHT observations of M87* and find a weak preference for extended emission in the direction of the large-scale jet. We also apply it to 2021 EHT data and measure the source centroid about 1 mas northwest of the compact ring, consistent with the jet observed at lower frequencies.</description>

      <title>The odyssey of the black hole low mass X-ray binary GX339-4: Five years of dense multi-wavelength monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the longest and the densest quasi-simultaneous radio, X-ray and optical campaign of the black hole low mass X-ray binary GX339-4, covering five years of weekly GX339-4 monitoring with MeerKAT, Swift-XRT and MeerLICHT, respectively. Complementary high frequency radio data with the Australia Telescope Compact Array are presented to track in more detail the evolution of GX339-4 and its transient ejecta. During the five years, GX339-4 has been through two "hard-only" outbursts and two "full" outbursts, allowing us to densely sample the rise, quenching and re-activation of the compact jets. Strong radio flares were also observed close to the transition between the hard and the soft states. Following the radio flare, a transient optically thin ejection was spatially resolved during the 2020 outburst, and was observed for a month. We also discuss the radio/X-ray correlation of GX339-4 during this five year period, which covers several states in detail from the rising phase to the quiescent state. This campaign allowed us to follow ejection events and provide information on the jet proper motion and its intrinsic velocity. With this work we publicly release the weekly MeerKAT L-band radio maps from data taken between September 2018 and October 2023.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from hidden ultraluminous X-ray sources in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are point-like sources that exhibit apparent X-ray luminosities exceeding the Eddington limit for stellar-mass compact objects. A widely accepted interpretation is that these systems are X-ray binaries accreting matter possibly at super-Eddington rates. In this regime, photon trapping inflates the accretion disk, making it geometrically and optically thick. Radiation-driven winds launched from the supercritical disk form funnel-shaped walls along the symmetry axis. While the apparent X-ray luminosity can exceed the Eddington limit due to geometrical beaming within this funnel, a misalignment with the observer's line of sight strongly suppresses the X-ray emission, rendering the ULX electromagnetically obscured.
  This work explores the potential for high-energy neutrino production in black hole-hosting ULXs. We model proton acceleration via magnetic reconnection in the region above the super-accreting black hole. Although electromagnetic emission is efficiently absorbed by the dense wind and radiation fields, neutrinos generated from photomeson interactions can escape. Our model self-consistently accounts for energy losses of pions and muons in this environment. The results indicate that misaligned, electromagnetically obscured Galactic ULXs could produce a neutrino flux detectable by instruments like KM3NeT and IceCube within several years of observation.</description>

      <title>Observational Relationship between Spectral Properties of Gamma-ray and X-ray Emissions from Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations between gamma-ray and X-ray spectral properties of pulsars are investigated in order to provide observational hints on physics involved in pulsars' high-energy emissions. Using a sample of 43 pulsars detected in both X-ray and gamma-ray bands, we find that pulsars' gamma-ray luminosity, $L_\gamma$, clearly correlates with the luminosity of non-thermal X-ray emission, $L_{\rm p}$, and anti-correlates with non-thermal X-ray photon index. Other gamma-ray spectral parameters show weaker or negligible correlations. The found relation that $L_\gamma \propto L_{\rm p}^{0.49\pm 0.05}$ implies a certain connection between radiation mechanisms and energy distributions of radiating particles for these high-energy emissions. Pulsars with and without detected thermal emissions seem to show different dependencies in those correlations, suggesting the possible existence of two different kinds of pulsars. The ones without detected thermal emissions may represent a population of pulsars with low surface temperature. The origin and energetics of high-energy emitting electron-positron pairs for this group of pulsars probably do not depend on their surface thermal emissions, while that of the other group do. The low surface temperatures might be evidence for the working of some exotic processes of neutron-star cooling. Similar to $L_{\rm p}$, some tempting relationships are found among each gamma-ray spectral parameter, surface temperature and thermally radiating area radius. It again strengthens the connection between gamma-ray and X-ray emissions from pulsars.</description>

      <title>XPE and VLT /FORS2 polarimetry challenge the Seyfert-1.9 classification of MCG-05-23-16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the third observation of the Seyfert-1.9 active galactic nucleus (AGN) MCG-05-23-16 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (\textit{IXPE}), together with optical spectro-polarimetry obtained at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), and combined with archival near-ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared polarimetric data. No X-ray polarization was detected in the 2-8 keV band, with a 99\% confidence upper limit of $\leq$2.9\%, further reduced to $\leq$2.5\% when combined with the two past IXPE observations of the same target. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that equatorial coronal models are disfavored if the AGN is indeed a type-1.9/2 AGN, but coronae coplanar to the accretion disk remain consistent if the source is less inclined than previously assumed. \textit{VLT}/FORS2 data reveal a typical type-2 spectrum in total flux, a broad H$\alpha$ line in polarized flux, and strongly wavelength dependent polarization degree and angle, rotating by nearly 70$^\circ$ across the optical band. Comparison with historical measurements confirms long-term stability of the polarization spectrum and a $\sim$90$^\circ$ rotation in the near-ultraviolet. Interpreting the multi-wavelength polarization relative to the AGN ionization axis indicates that the main obscurer is not a compact circumnuclear torus, but a distant kpc-scale dust lane crossing the galaxy. This result implies that MCG-05-23-16 is in fact a type-1 AGN seen through foreground dust. The low X-ray column density becomes consistent with the absence of polarization, provided that the nuclear inclination is low.</description>

      <title>Secular Evolution of PSR J2021+4026: Long-Term {\gamma}-Ray Flux and Spin-Down Variability Beyond State Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR J2021+4026 is a remarkable $\gamma$-ray pulsar exhibiting repeated transitions between high $\gamma$-ray flux (HGF) and low $\gamma$-ray flux (LGF) states. With 17-yr Fermi-LAT monitoring, we reveal persistent secular evolution and enhanced spin-down rate variability within individual emission states -- beneath the quasi-periodic state transitions. After removing discrete jumps, the jump-corrected flux $\delta F_\gamma$ shows a three-phase evolution: rise ($+2.02^{+0.17}_{-0.15}\%~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), decline ($-3.72^{+0.34}_{-0.47}\%~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), and rapid rise ($+14.9^{+6.4}_{-4.4}\%~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), with all rates quoted relative to the long-term mean flux $\langle F_\gamma \rangle=7.8\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Moreover, the flux of the LGF state is gradually approaching the stable HGF level at a rate of $+0.72 \pm 0.11\%~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. These results demonstrate that secular flux evolution in PSR J2021+4026 operates largely independently of discrete state transitions, yet jointly with them drives the system toward a stable high-flux equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Rotational enhancement and stability of protoquark stars during thermal evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first systematic study of rigidly rotating protoquark stars based on isentropic equations of state (EOS) within the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) framework. Using a quasi-static equilibrium approach, we follow the Kelvin--Helmholtz evolution from hot, lepton-rich matter to a cold, catalyzed quark star. Rotation substantially enhances the maximum stable mass (by up to $\sim 40\%$), equatorial radius, and key rotational observables, with the ratio of rotational kinetic to gravitational potential energy, $T_{\rm kin}/|W|$, reaching $0.18$--$0.19$ near the Keplerian limit, indicating a heightened susceptibility to gravitational-wave--emitting instabilities. Thermal evolution introduces a clear ordering: all stellar properties peak during the lepton-rich stages and decrease monotonically as the star cools. Compared to hadronic stars, rotating protoquark stars exhibit larger radii, higher moments of inertia, and stronger quadrupolar deformation, producing a distinct signature in the mass--radius--spin plane that can accommodate objects such as HESS~J1731--347 and PSR~J0740+6620. These results demonstrate that future multimessenger observations must account for both thermal history and rotation to robustly identify quark matter in compact stars.</description>

      <title>X-ray Analysis and Photon-transport Simulations of SMC X-1: A Warped-disc Origin of the Superorbital Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The luminous accreting pulsar SMC X-1 is an appropriate target to explore the accretion dynamics. SMC X-1 shows unique quasi-periodic flux variability of 40-65$\,$days known as superorbital modulation. To constrain the accretion structure of SMC X-1 based on timing and spectral study, we have analysed X-ray data of SMC X-1 observed by Suzaku and NuSTAR at various epochs between 2011 and 2022. The spectral analysis shows that the hydrogen column density ($N_\mathrm{H}$) increases from $1.1 \times 10^{22}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ to $1.24 \times 10^{23}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ as the flux decreases with the superorbital modulation. The neutral iron K$\alpha$ line at 6.4$\,$keV has a broad width of 0.3$\,$keV, and its equivalent width increases as toward superorbital low states. The line broadening is consistent with Keplerian motion at the inner disc rather than the stellar wind velocity of the donor star. These findings support that the superorbital modulation is a consequence of X-ray attenuation by the warped accretion disc. To test this interpretation, we have conducted photon transport simulations of a system consisting of a neutron star, a warped disc, and optically-thin disc atmosphere. Occultation of the central source by the disc successfully reproduces the observed variations in the equivalent width of neutral iron K$\alpha$ line, pulse profiles, and flux in hard X-rays. Notably, a disc precession angle of approximately $30^\circ$ can account for the observational features. For the radiation pattern of the photon source, the preferred beam width corresponds to a standard deviation of $30^\circ$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Hidden Clustering: An Unsupervised Machine Learning Study of Repeating FRB 20220912A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin. Classifying repeating FRBs is essential for understanding their emission mechanisms, but remains challenging due to their short durations, high variability, and increasing data volume. Traditional methods often rely on subjective criteria and struggle with high-dimensional data. In this study, we apply an unsupervised machine learning framework that combines Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to eight observed parameters from FRB 20220912A. Our analysis reveals three distinct clusters of bursts with varying spectral and fluence properties. Comparisons with clustering studies on other repeaters show that some of our clusters share similar features with sources such as FRB 20201124A and FRB 121102, suggesting possible common emission mechanisms. We also provide qualitative interpretations for each cluster, highlighting the spectral diversity within a single source. Notably, one cluster shows broadband emission and high fluence, which are typically seen in non-repeating FRBs. This raises the possibility that some non-repeaters may be misclassified repeaters due to observational limitations. Our results demonstrate the utility of machine learning in uncovering intrinsic diversity in FRB emission and provide a foundation for future classification studies.</description>

      <title>Accretion flow around Kerr metric in the infra-red limit of asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate accretion disk dynamics and the formation of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the infrared limit around Kerr-like black holes in asymptotically safe gravity. Relativistic hydrodynamic solutions of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion reveal that quantum corrections significantly modify the structure of the shock cone formed around the black hole. The black hole spin controls the asymmetric of the shock cone through frame-dragging effects, whereas the quantum correction parameter softens the effective gravitational potential, resulting in a wider shock opening angle, weaker post-shock compression, and reduced density concentration within the cone. Time-dependent mass accretion rates reveal oscillation modes trapped within the shock cone. The power spectral density (PSD) investigations suggest that these modes naturally generate low-frequency QPOs, whose amplitudes, coherence, and harmonic structure depend on both the spin and the quantum correction parameter. The PSD analyses performed at different radial locations reveal that identical QPO frequencies are obtained in all cases. The numerically detected frequencies result from the excitation of global oscillation modes trapped within the post-shock region. The resulting global modes are found to consist of fundamental frequencies, their associated harmonic overtones, and near-commensurate frequency ratios such as 2:1 and 3:2. Coherent oscillations are enhanced and near-commensurate frequency ratios are produced when moderate rotation and moderate quantum corrections are coupled. Large quantum correction parameters, on the other hand, wash out unique spectral peaks and suppress oscillation amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Minutes-long soft X-ray prompt emission from a compact object merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact object mergers are multi-messenger sources and progenitors of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), primarily understood by gamma-ray observations, while poorly constrained in the prompt low-energy phase. A long-lasting X-ray emission was discussed as afterglows following several short-duration ($\lesssim$2 s) bursts, yet this prompt X-ray component was not directly observed or confirmed. Here we report the discovery of a minutes-long ($\sim$560 s) flash of soft X-rays immediately following the short ($\sim$0.4 s) GRB 250704B. The long-soft bump points to a distinct phase of prompt emission in X-rays detected by Einstein Probe in an event that otherwise appear as an ordinary short GRB, showing that long-lasting X-ray emission is likely a common feature of merger-driven bursts and a promising electromagnetic counterpart to gravitational-wave sources.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength study of the 2025 low state of the intermediate polar BG CMi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multi-wavelength observations of the first recorded low state of the intermediate polar BG CMi. Optical monitoring of the source by members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers reveals a decrease of ~0.5 mag that lasted ~50 d in early 2025. During the low state the optical timing properties imply that BG CMi underwent a change in the accretion mode, as power at the spin frequency $\omega$ dramatically dropped. An XMM-Newton observation revealed a substantial decrease in intrinsic absorption and a slight increase in intrinsic X-ray luminosity, compared to archival Suzaku data. Timing analysis of the X-ray light curves shows that power shifted from the orbital frequency $\Omega$ (prominent in Suzaku data) to $2\Omega$ in the low state XMM-Newton data, along with the strengthening of certain orbital sidebands. We suggest that BG CMi transitioned to disk-overflow accretion, where the white dwarf accreted matter via both a disk and a stream, the latter becoming more dominant during the low state due to a decrease in the mass and size of the disk.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent explanation of the MeV line in GRB 221009A unveils a dense circum-stellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB~221009A has been the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) observed to date, and its afterglow has been characterised with unprecedented detail at TeV energies by LHAASO. Quite puzzlingly, it is also the most energetic GRB known. Among the riddles posed by this mysterious source, however, the sheer energetics are hardly the most intriguing: an unprecedented, narrow, luminous emission line at around 10 MeV has been uncovered by a detailed spectral analysis of \textit{Fermi}/GBM data immediately following the brightest peak in the GRB prompt emission and the peak of the TeV afterglow. As noted in the discovery article, the temporal evolution of the line properties can be explained as being due to high-latitude emission from a geometrically thin, relativistically expanding shell where annihilation of a large number of electron-positron pairs took place. We show that this interpretation yields stringent constraints on the properties of such shell, that point to a process that happens at radii typical of external shocks. We then demonstrate that the shell could have been the blastwave associated with the GRB precursor, with the line arising after pair loading of such blastwave as it was illuminated by the bright and hard radiation of the GRB main event. The scenario, which also explains the abrupt initial rise of the LHAASO afterglow, requires the progenitor of the GRB to have been surrounded by a circum-stellar medium (CSM) extending out to a few $10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}$, with a density $n_\mathrm{ext}\sim 10^{8}-10^{9}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ reminiscent of those found from studies of Type IIn supernovae. This provides a precious clue to the nature of the progenitor of this peculiar GRB, which could also be present in other bursts that feature a long quiescence followed by a bright emission episode with a hard spectrum.</description>

      <title>Probing super-heavy dark matter with ultra-high-energy gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine the constraints on the lifetime of decaying super-heavy dark matter particles (SHDM), with masses ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{15}$ GeV, by analyzing ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray data. Our approach involves an accurate comparison of the primary gamma-ray emissions resulting from prompt SHDM decays in the galactic halo with the most recent upper limits on isotropic UHE gamma-ray fluxes provided by various extensive air shower experiments. We demonstrate that a precise consideration of the field of view and the geometric acceptance of different UHE gamma-ray observatories has significant implications for the inferred limits of dark matter lifetime. In addition, we examine the influence of uncertainties linked to the current models of the galactic dark matter distribution, employing diverse halo density profiles while varying both their radial extent and the local dark matter density. Our findings indicate that the newly established UHE gamma-ray constraints are marginally less stringent than earlier evaluations, thereby revisiting the SHDM parameter space and allowing for observable neutrino fluxes.</description>

      <title>Stimulated radiation from superradiant scalar cloud in scalar-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories predict fundamental scalar fields of considerable interest in astrophysics and cosmology. We investigate the superradiant instability of scalar clouds around Kerr black holes, showing that stimulated decay generates detectable electromagnetic signals. The growth of the superradiant scalar cloud differs from that of other bosonic fields and depends sensitively on the matter distribution surrounding the black hole, which originates from the scalar-matter coupling realized by the chameleon mechanism in modified gravity theories. In non-uniform matter distributions, stimulated emission from scalar clouds offers an observational signature that distinguishes fundamental scalars from other light bosonic fields.</description>

      <title>The gravitational energy-momentum pseudo-tensor in $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the affine tensor associated with the energy and momentum densities of both gravitational and matter fields, the complex pseudo-tensor, for $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity, the straightforward extension of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR), characterized by a flat, torsion-free, non-metric connection. The local conservation of energy-momentum complex on-shell is satisfied through a continuity equation. An important analogy is pointed out between gravitational pseudo-tensor of teleparallel $f(T)$ gravity, in the Weitzenb\"ock gauge, and the same object of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, in the coincident gauge. Furthermore, we perturb the gravitational pseudo-tensor $\tau^{\alpha}_{\phantom{\alpha}\lambda}$ in the coincident gauge up to the second order in the metric perturbation, obtaining a useful expression for the power carried by the related gravitational waves. We also present an application of the gravitational pseudotensor, determining the gravitational energy density of a Schwarzschild spacetime in STEGR gravity, adopting the concident gauge. Finally, analyzing the conserved quantities on manifolds, the Stokes theorem can be formulated for generic affine connections</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Next Galactic Supernova with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernovae are observed to occur approximately 1-2 times per century in a galaxy like the Milky Way. Based on historical records, however, the last core-collapse galactic supernova observed by humans occurred almost 1,000 years ago. Luckily, we are well positioned to catch the next one with the advent of new neutrino detectors and astronomical observatories. Neutrino observatories can provide unprecedented triggers for a galactic supernova event as they are likely to see a supernova neutrino signal anywhere from minutes to days before the shock breakout causes the supernova to brighten in optical wavelengths. Given its large etendue, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is ideally positioned to rapidly localize the optical counterpart based on the neutrino trigger. In this paper we simulate events to study the efficiency with which supernovae are optimally localized by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We find that the observatory is ideal for initial localization of nearly all observable supernova triggers and has a 57-97% chance of catching any supernova based on theoretical stellar mass density predictions and observations. We provide an analysis of optimal filter selection and exposure times and discuss observational caveats.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $^7$Be Weak and Radiative Transition Rates in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: Implications for the Primordial Lithium Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primordial 7Li abundance predicted by standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) exceeds that inferred from old, metal-poor stars by a factor of about 3-4. In standard BBN, most primordial 7Li is produced as 7Be in the early Universe and later converted by electron capture. Additional production or destruction channels of 7Be, such as proton capture or antineutrino capture during BBN, may therefore affect the final lithium yield. We quantify the depletion of 7Be due to in-situ electron capture, including the associated antineutrino channel, positron decay from nuclear excited states, and proton capture through the radiative 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction. We also investigate stimulated emission induced by the dense photon background during the nuclear statistical equilibrium epoch, as well as a three-body Auger-like variant transferring the capture energy to a continuum electron. Decay rates are computed using first-order perturbation theory, modelling weak interactions with a Fermi contact term and factorising hadronic and leptonic currents. Thermally averaged rates are obtained by folding cross-sections with Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions and accounting for particle densities in the temperature range 10-100 keV. We find that the electron-capture rate decreases rapidly with temperature and is significantly enhanced by the inclusion of the antineutrino channel. Stimulated emission and plasma screening increase the radiative proton-capture rate by only 1-3 percent at temperatures around 87 keV. The Auger-like channel contributes at the level of a few thousandths of a percent and becomes negligible at lower temperatures. Overall, our total rate revises previous estimates by nearly an order of magnitude. Electron capture, proton capture, and positron decay provide corrections to the dominant depletion channel 7Be(n,p)7Li.</description>

      <title>BE Lyncis: An Extremely Eccentric Binary with the Nearest Known Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an exceptionally eccentric binary system, BE Lyncis (BE Lyn), which hosts the nearest known black hole (BH) to Earth. Through the analysis of $\textit{TESS}$ photometry combined with an extensive set of times of maximum light spanning 39 years, we identify BE Lyn as a high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti star in a binary with an orbital period of $\approx15.9$ years and an extraordinary orbital eccentricity of $e=0.9989^{+0.0008}_{-0.0021}$ ($&gt;0.9968$ at 95% confidence) -- the highest reliably measured for any binary system. Dynamical constraints impose an upper limit on the orbital inclination of $i \lesssim 4.0^{\circ}$, corresponding to a companion mass of $M_2 \gtrsim 17.5~M_{\odot}$, which unequivocally favors a black hole. This system provides a unique laboratory for studying asteroseismology in strong gravitational fields, the formation of black holes via asymmetric supernovae, and the evolution of extreme binary systems. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, the successful application of the light-travel time effect in a pulsating variable to unveil a dormant black hole, establishing a novel method for BH detection in non-interacting binaries.</description>

Abstract: Our understanding of the $\gamma$-ray sky has greatly advanced, yet studying the unresolved $\gamma$-ray background (UGRB) can unveil the nature of the faintest $\gamma$-ray source populations in the Universe. Statistical cross-correlations between the UGRB and tracers of large-scale cosmic structure allow us to infer which sources contribute the most to this emission. In this work, we examine the angular correlation between the UGRB and the matter distribution traced by galaxies, using twelve years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations along with three years of Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. We detect a correlation with a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.96, primarily driven by large angular scales. We then perform a multi-tracer analysis that combines this measurement with the cross-correlation between $\gamma$ rays and DES weak lensing. The two single-tracer results are mutually consistent, and their combination yields a total significance of 8.6, firmly establishing the extragalactic origin of the UGRB. Intriguingly, the properties inferred for the sources contributing to the UGRB show departures from those of the resolved {\gamma}-ray population, suggesting that the faint end of the $\gamma$-ray sky is not a simple extrapolation of currently resolved sources.</description>

      <title>Universal Dense-Matter Trace Anomaly Inferred from Collective Flow in Heavy-Ion Collisions and Global Properties of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trace anomaly of dense matter, $\Delta \equiv 1/3 - P/\varepsilon$, defined in terms of the ratio of pressure $P$ to energy density $\varepsilon$, quantifies deviations from conformal symmetry and plays a central role in both the hydrodynamic response and gravitational equilibrium. While $\Delta(\varepsilon)$ has recently been inferred from neutron star observations, we report the first Bayesian extraction of the trace anomaly from collective flow observables in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions. By employing transport-model simulations that explicitly decouple the cold-matter mean-field potential from thermal effects, we directly constrain the cold dense-matter equation of state (EOS). Remarkably, the trace anomaly inferred from laboratory flow data agrees quantitatively, within $68\%$ credible intervals, with independent astrophysical posterior bands. This nontrivial agreement demonstrates that heavy-ion collisions and neutron star observations probe the same universal macroscopic properties of dense matter, establishing the trace anomaly as a composition-insensitive descriptor of dense matter across widely different physical environments.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Budget of Entropy from Merging Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes contain more entropy than any other component of the observable universe. Gravitational-wave observations from LIGO and Virgo have shown evidence of a previously unknown black hole mass range, which provides new information to update the entropy budget. Increases in entropy due to binary black hole mergers, as implied in the second law of thermodynamics, should also be added to the budget. In this study, we update the cosmological entropy budget for black holes in the stellar to lite-intermediate-mass range $(5-300~M_\odot)$, originating from either supernovae or binary mergers, by utilizing a suite of population synthesis models and phenomenological fits derived from numerical relativity. We report three new insights: Firstly, the cumulative entropy from merging black holes surpasses the total entropy from cosmic microwave background photons around the onset of the Over-massive Black Hole Galaxy phase at $z\sim 12$, suggesting that mergers played a more significant role in shaping the thermodynamic state of the early universe than relic radiation. Secondly, if primordial black holes constitute a nonzero fraction of dark matter, their early binary mergers establish an ``entropy floor" in the Dark Ages and can dominate the cumulative merger-generated entropy history even for small abundances. Thirdly, by computing the cosmological density parameters, we highlight the thermodynamic asymmetry in black hole mergers, where the production of gravitational-wave energy is inefficient compared to the immense generation of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</description>

      <title>Optimising gravitational-wave sky maps for pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have recently reported compelling evidence for the presence of a gravitational-wave background signal. Mapping the gravitational-wave background is key to understanding how it is formed, since anisotropy is a tracer for, for example, a supermassive black hole binary origin. In this work we refine the frequentist regularised gravitational-wave mapping analysis developed in our previous work (as part of the MeerKAT PTA 4.5-year data release). We derive a point-spread function describing the angular resolution of a PTA. We investigate how the point spread function changes for different PTA constellations and determine the best possible angular resolution achievable within our framework. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that previous methods do not capture the actual resolution - especially in regions of the sky with a high density of pulsars. We propose an improved scheme that accounts for a variable local resolution and test it using realistic simulations of the latest MeerKAT dataset. We demonstrate that we are able to identify a continuous gravitational wave signal in a region with good pulsar sky coverage with approximately a factor of two increase in significance compared to our previous method.</description>

      <title>Influence of Finite-Nuclei Constraints on High-Density Transitions and Neutron Star Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct posterior distributions of the equation of state (EoS) for matter beyond the inner crust of neutron stars by incorporating finite nuclei (FN) constraints within relativistic mean field models. These constraints are implemented in three complementary ways: (i) through theoretical bounds on the EoS, (ii) implicitly via nuclear matter parameters, and (iii) explicitly by enforcing consistency with experimental binding energies and charge radii of selected nuclei. The resulting low-density nucleonic EoSs are subsequently matched to a model-agnostic speed-of-sound parametrization, constrained by astrophysical observations, including NICER mass-radius measurements, tidal deformability limits from GW170817, and lower bounds on the maximum neutron-star mass inferred from radio pulsar observations. We find that the admissible range of the transition density is strongly sensitive to the choice of the low-density EoS. In particular, the inclusion of explicit FN constraints significantly reduces the allowed parameter space of the nucleonic EoS at low densities, narrowing the transition-density range by nearly a factor of two. Consequently, neutron-star properties inferred from EoSs with explicit FN constraints differ substantially, with especially pronounced effects for low-mass neutron stars and their correlations with nuclear matter parameters. A quantitative comparison, using metrics based on Mahalanobis distance, shows consistency of the explicit constraints with PSRs J0740+6620, J0030+0451, and J0437-4715, but suggest a possible tension with PSR J0614-3329. These findings underscore the critical importance of a consistent treatment of finite-nuclei properties for reliably inferring the behavior of high-density matter and the presence of possible phase transitions from astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>The compact object of HESS J1731-347 and its implication on neutron star matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of the possibility of a small, subsolar mass compact star, such as the recently reported central compact object of HESS J1731-347, on the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars. We have used a hybrid approach to the nuclear EOS developed recently where the matter around nuclear saturation density is described by a parametric expansion in terms of nuclear empirical parameters and represented in an agnostic way at higher density using piecewise polytropes. We have incorporated the inputs provided by the latest neutron skin measurement experiments from PREX-II and CREX, simultaneous mass-radius measurements of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, and the gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190425. The main results of the study show the effect of HESS J1731-347 on the nuclear parameters and neutron star observables. Our analysis yields the slope of symmetry energy $L=45.71^{+38.18}_{-22.11}$ MeV, the radius of a $1.4 M_\odot$ star, $R_{1.4}=12.18^{+0.71}_{-0.88}$ km, and the maximum mass of a static star, $M_{\rm max}= 2.14^{+0.26}_{-0.17} M_\odot$ within $90\%$ confidence interval, respectively.</description>

      <title>Searching for New Physics in Ultradense Environment: a Review on Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron Stars (NSs), among the densest objects in the Universe, are exceptional laboratories for investigating Dark Matter (DM) properties. Recent theoretical and observational developments have heightened interest in exploring the impact of DM on NS structure, giving rise to the concept of Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars (DANSs). This review examines how NSs can accumulate DM over time, potentially altering their fundamental properties. We explore leading models describing DM behavior within NSs, focusing on the effects of both bosonic and fermionic candidates on key features such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Additionally, we review how DM can modify the cooling and heating processes, trigger the formation of a black hole, and impact Gravitational Waves (GWs) emissions from binary systems. By synthesizing recent research, this work highlights how DANSs might produce observable signatures, offering new opportunities to probe DM properties through astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Impact of multi-messenger spectral modelling on blazar-neutrino associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blazars are interesting source candidates for astrophysical neutrino emission. Multi-messenger lepto-hadronic models based on proton-photon (p-gamma) interactions result in predictions for the neutrino spectra (''p-gamma spectra'') which are typically strongly peaked at PeV energies. In contrast, statistical analyses looking to associate blazars and high-energy neutrinos often assume a power-law spectral shape, putting the emphasis at lower energies. We aim to examine the impact of such spectral modelling assumptions on the associations of neutrinos with blazars. We use hierarchical_nu, a Bayesian framework for point source searches, and incorporate the theoretical predictions for neutrino spectra through a dedicated spectral model and priors on the relevant parameters. Our spectral model is based on recent predictions for a selection of intermediate and high synchrotron peaked blazars that have been found to be spatially close to high-energy events detected by IceCube. We apply our model to the 10 years of publicly available muon track IceCube data aimed at point source searches, focusing on the Northern hemisphere. Out of 29 source candidates, we find five sources, including TXS 0506+056, that have an association probability $P_\mathrm{assoc} &gt; 0.5$ to at least one event. The p-gamma spectra typically lead to a lower overall number of associated events compared to the power-law case, but retain or even enhance strong associations to high-energy events. Our results demonstrate that including more information from theoretical predictions can allow for more interpretable source-neutrino connections.</description>

      <title>An Accretion Flare Interpretation for the Ultra-High-Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A</title>

Abstract: We study the origin of the ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino event KM3-230213A detected by KM3NeT, focusing on MRC 0614-083 which has been pinpointed as the closest blazar to the neutrino localization exhibiting variable multi-wavelength emission. A joint interpretation of the optical, infrared, and X-ray light curves suggests that MRC 0614-083 has undergone a super-Eddington accretion flare accompanied by efficient proton acceleration. That flare has initiated a delayed infrared echo within the surrounding dust torus, which serves as a target for photomeson ($p\gamma$) interactions such that a self-consistent picture emerges that complements the blazar jet scenario: the predicted UHE neutrino flux is at the level expected from joint $E^{-2}$ fit with the IceCube measurements at lower energies, the variable nature of the event alleviates the tension with IceCube limits, and the accompanying electromagnetic cascade describes the X-ray flare around the neutrino detection time. Since a key remaining uncertainty is the unknown redshift of the source, we strongly encourage optical/ultraviolet spectroscopic measurements to determine its redshift.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger Emission from Very-High-Energy Black Hole-Jet Systems in the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microquasars, compact binary systems with an accreting stellar-mass black hole or neutron star, are promising candidates for high-energy particle acceleration. Recently, the LHAASO collaboration reported on the detection of $&gt;100$ TeV $\gamma$-ray emission from five microquasars, suggesting that these sources are efficient particle accelerators. In microquasars, high-energy $\gamma$-rays can be produced in large-scale jets or winds. In this work, we explore the X-ray, $\gamma$-ray and neutrino emission from SS 433, V4641 Sgr and GRS 1905+105. We consider leptonic and hadronic scenarios to explain the spectra observed by LHAASO and other high-energy $\gamma$-ray detectors. We estimate the neutrino flux associated with the hadronic component and investigate the detectability of neutrinos from these sources in current and future neutrino telescopes. We find that among the three sources, V4641 Sgr has the best prospects of observation with a combined next-generation neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>The diffuse supernova neutrino background: an update with modern population synthesis and core-collapse simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new, state-of-the-art computation of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), where we use neutrino spectra from multi-dimensional, multi-second core collapse supernova simulations - including both neutron-star and black-hole forming collapses - and binary evolution effects from modern population synthesis codes. Large sets of numerical results are processed and connected in a consistent manner, using two key quantities: the mass of the star's Carbon-Oxygen (CO) core at an advanced pre-collapse stage - which depends on binary evolution effects - and the compactness parameter, which is the main descriptor of the post-collapse neutrino emission. The method enables us to model the neutrino emission of a very diverse, binary-affected population of stars, which cannot unambiguously be mapped in detail by existing core collapse simulations. We find that including black hole-forming collapses enhances the DSNB by up to 50% at energies greater than 30-40 MeV. Binary evolution effects can change the total rate of collapses and generate a sub-population of high core mass stars that are stronger neutrino emitters. However, the net effect on the DSNB is moderate - up to a 15% increase in flux - due to the rarity of these super-massive cores and to the relatively modest dependence of the neutrino emission on the CO core mass. The methodology presented here is suitable for extensions and generalizations, and therefore it lays the foundation for modern treatments of the DSNB.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing rarely produces high-mass outliers to the compact binary population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All gravitational-wave signals are inevitably gravitationally lensed by intervening matter as they propagate through the Universe. When a gravitational-wave signal is magnified, it \emph{appears} to have originated from a closer, more massive system. Thus, high-mass outliers to the gravitational-wave source population are often proposed as natural candidates for strongly lensed events. However, when using a data-driven method for identifying population outliers, we find that high-mass outliers are not necessarily strongly lensed, nor will the majority of strongly-lensed signals appear as high-mass outliers. This is both because statistical fluctuations produce a larger effect on observed binary parameters than does lensing magnification, and because lensing-induced outliers must originate from intrinsically high-mass sources, which are rare. Thus, the appearance of a single lensing-induced outlier implies the existence of many other lensed events within the catalog. We additionally show that it is possible to constrain the strong lensing optical depth, which is a fundamental quantity of our Universe, with the detection or absence of high-mass outliers. However, constraints using the latest gravitational-wave catalog are weak$\unicode{x2014}$we obtain an upper limit on the optical depth of sources at redshift $1$ magnified by a factor of $5$ or more of $\tau(\mu\geq5,z=1)\leq 0.035 \unicode{x2014}$and future observing runs will not make an outlier-based method competitive with other probes of the optical depth. However, the full inferred population of compact binaries may be more informative of the distribution of lenses in the Universe, opening a unique opportunity to access the high-redshift Universe and constrain cosmic structures.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Numerical Simulations of Magnetar Crust Quakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crust quakes are frequently invoked as a mechanism to trigger sudden transients in the magnetospheres of magnetars. In this picture, a mechanical failure of the crust excites seismic motions of the magnetar surface that launch force-free waves into the magnetosphere. We first investigate this problem analytically and then perform three-dimensional numerical simulations. Our simulations follow the propagation of high-frequency magneto-elastic waves in the entire crust, and include magnetic coupling to the dipolar magnetosphere and liquid core through simplified radiation boundary conditions. We observe seismic waves bouncing between the crust-core interface and the surface with a characteristic frequency $\sim 1$~kHz, which could appear as a modulation of the magnetospheric radiation. Both the star quake and its associated magnetospheric wave emission are strongly damped on a timescale $\sim 10 \ \rm ms$ by magnetic coupling to the liquid core. Since the seismic waves are significantly damped before they can spread laterally around the crust, magnetospheric wave emission occurs primarily near the initial epicenter of the quake. Our simulations suggest that non-axisymmetric quakes will launch a mixture of Alfv\'en and fast magnetosonic waves into the magnetosphere. The results will be important for interpreting magnetar bursts and understanding the possible trigger mechanisms of fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>A multiwavelength study of the new Galactic center black hole candidate MAXI J1744-294</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time in nearly a decade, a bright new transient was detected in the central parsec (pc) of the Galaxy. MAXI J1744-294 was never observed in outburst prior to January 2025. We present the results of a broadband, multi-wavelength study of MAXI J1744-294, including data from the NuSTAR, Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, and NICER X-ray telescopes, as well as complementary radio and near-infrared observations. We analyze the changing X-ray emission as the outburst evolved from the high/soft to the low/hard state. Using relativistic reflection features in the data, we estimate a spin of $a&gt;0.92$ and viewing inclination $\theta=28^{+3}_{-4}$ deg. Based on the spectral and temporal characteristics of the source, we identify MAXI J1744-294 as a candidate black hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) -- the fourth candidate BH transient discovered within a (projected) distance of one pc from the Galactic supermassive black hole Sgr A*. This discovery provides further evidence for a cusp of BH-LMXBs in the central pc of our Galaxy, as argued for in previous observational studies and suggested by analytical and theoretical work. Our ongoing multi-wavelength study, involving a complementary range of observatories and spanning different outburst states, can serve as a model for future time domain astrophysics research.</description>

      <title>A HyperFlash and \'ECLAT view of the local environment and energetics of the repeating FRB 20240619D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-variable propagation effects provide a window into the local plasma environments of repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources. Here we report high-cadence observations of FRB 20240619D, as part of the HyperFlash and \'ECLAT programs. We observed for $500$h and detected $217$ bursts, including $10$ bursts with high fluence ($&gt;25$ Jy ms) and implied energy. We track burst-to-burst variations in dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM), from which we constrain the parallel magnetic field strength in the source's local environment: $0.27\pm0.13$ mG. Apparent DM variations between sub-bursts in a single bright event are interpreted as coming from plasma lensing or variable emission height. We also identify two distinct scintillation screens along the line of sight, one associated with the Milky Way and the other likely located in the FRB's host galaxy or local environment. Together, these (time-variable) propagation effects reveal that FRB 20240619D is embedded in a dense, turbulent and highly magnetised plasma. The source's environment is more dynamic than that measured for many other (repeating) FRB sources, but less extreme compared to several repeaters that are associated with a compact, persistent radio source. FRB 20240619D's cumulative burst fluence distribution shows a power-law break, with a flat tail at high energies. Along with previous studies, this emphasises a common feature in the burst energy distribution of hyperactive repeaters. Using the break in the burst fluence distribution, we estimate a source redshift of $z=0.042$-$0.240$. We discuss FRB 20240619D's nature in the context of similar studies of other repeating FRBs.</description>

      <title>Light curves of time-dependent accretion disk in tidal disruption events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are believed to be an ideal laboratory for studying the evolution of accretion flow around a supermassive black hole (BH). In general, the mass feeding rate to the BH is suggested to be super-Eddington initially, and evolves to be sub-Eddington on timescales of years. In this paper, we carry out calculations of the time-dependent evolution of accretion disk in the standard environment of TDE, i.e., injecting matter at the circularization radius of the stellar debris in the form of $\dot M_{\rm inject} \propto t^{-5/3}$. One of the main findings is that when $\dot M_{\rm inject}$ evolves to a value around the Eddington accretion rate, the radiation pressure instability occurs. We test the influence of the model parameters on the light curves, such as the BH mass $M_{\rm BH}$, viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and mass-injecting radius $R_{\rm{out}}$, all of which are found to affect the light curves to some extent. In most cases, we find that the light curves oscillate significantly due to the radiation pressure instability. As an exception, when $\alpha$ is small or $R_{\rm{out}}$ is large, we find that the oscillations are completely suppressed. In this case, the light curve drops steeply and then becomes flat in the late-time evolution, which we apply to explain the observed ultraviolet (UV) light curves of ASASSN-15oi and ASASSN-14ae together with the assumption of a photosphere. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of our time-dependent accretion disk model to explaining multi-band light curves of TDEs in the future.</description>

      <title>Binding energy of compact stars and their non-radial oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past years, a significant effort has been made with the scope of determining correlations, involving compact star properties, that are independent of the nuclear equation of state. Such universal relations are of utmost importance as they allow for the imposition of constraints on stellar properties without directly measuring them and they may also serve as a probe of General Relativity. In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation.</description>

      <title>Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission as the Driving Mechanism in Long-Period Radio Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPRTs) are highly polarised, coherent radio sources with periods of minutes to hours and bursts typically lasting 10 to 100 s. Here we consider the apparently isolated subclass of LPRTs and argue that electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) explains their narrow duty cycles and polarisation properties. In particular, we show that intrinsically circular ECME can emerge as predominantly linear after undergoing Faraday conversion in an overlying magnetospheric plasma layer, thus reconciling the observed high linear fractions with a circularly polarised maser. In this picture, a rotating oblique magnetosphere beams radiation into a thin, hollow emission cone whose surface lies almost perpendicular to the local magnetic field. The observed very narrow pulses arise when the line of sight skims the cone, while broader profiles and weak leading or trailing components occur when multiple azimuths along the emission ring meet the maser resonance condition. The observed isotropic-equivalent luminosities of about 10^30 to 10^31 erg s^-1 correspond to modest intrinsic powers once strong ECME beaming is taken into account. We show that such power levels can be supplied by accretion from the interstellar medium (ISM), and that detectability at kiloparsec distances favours slowly rotating neutron stars with comparatively low surface magnetic fields below about 10^10 Gauss and low space velocities.</description>

      <title>Explosions in the Empty: A Survey of Transients in Local Void Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of transient astrophysical events -- including supernovae (SNe), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and fast radio bursts (FRBs) -- in void and non-void galaxies within the local universe ($0.005 &lt; z &lt; 0.05$). Cosmic voids, defined by low galaxy densities and characterized by minimal environmental interactions, offer a natural laboratory for isolating the impact of large-scale underdensities on stellar evolution and transient production. Using multi-wavelength data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Supernova Catalogue, and high-energy space observatories, we compare transient occurrence rates and host galaxy properties across environments. We find that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are significantly more common in void galaxies, indicating that massive star formation remains active in underdense regions. In contrast, Type Ia supernovae are less frequent in voids, consistent with a scarcity of older stellar populations. Notably, we identify a short-duration GRB hosted by a void galaxy, demonstrating that compact object mergers can occur in isolated environments. Additionally, we find no FRBs associated with void galaxies. Taken together, these results show that cosmic voids exert a measurable influence on the star formation history of galaxies and hence on the production of transients.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning approaches to dispersion measure estimation for fast radio bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, mostly millisecond-duration transients of extragalactic origin whose emission mechanisms remain unknown. As FRB signals propagate through ionized media, they experience frequency-dependent delays quantified by the dispersion measure (DM), a key parameter for inferring source distances and local plasma conditions. Accurate DM estimation is therefore essential for characterizing FRB sources and testing physical models, yet current dedispersion methods can be computationally intensive and prone to human bias. In this proof-of-concept study, we develop and benchmark three deep-learning architectures, a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), a fine-tuned ResNet-50, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, for automated DM estimation. All models are trained and validated on a large set of synthetic FRB dynamic spectra generated using CHIME/FRB-like specifications. The hybrid CNN-LSTM achieves the highest accuracy and stability while maintaining low computational cost across the investigated DM range. Although trained on simulated data, these models can be fine-tuned on real CHIME/FRB observations and extended to future facilities, offering a scalable pathway toward real-time, data-driven DM estimation in large FRB surveys.</description>

      <title>A spectroscopically confirmed, strongly lensed, metal-poor Type II supernova at z = 5.13</title>

Abstract: Observing supernovae (SNe) in the early Universe (z &gt; 3) provides a window into how both galaxies and individual stars have evolved over cosmic time, yet a detailed study of high-redshift stars and SNe has remained difficult due to their extreme distances and cosmological redshifting. To overcome the former, searches for gravitationally lensed sources allow for the discovery of magnified SNe that appear as multiple images - further providing the opportunity for efficient follow-up. Here we present the discovery of "SN Eos": a strongly lensed, multiply-imaged, SN II at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 5.133 +/- 0.001. SN Eos exploded in a Lyman-{\alpha} emitting galaxy when the Universe was only ~1 billion years old, shortly after it reionized and became transparent to ultraviolet radiation. A year prior to our discovery in JWST data, archival HST imaging of SN Eos reveals rest-frame far ultraviolet (~1,300{\AA}) emission, indicative of shock breakout or interaction with circumstellar material in the first few (rest-frame) days after explosion. The JWST spectroscopy of SN Eos, now the farthest spectroscopically confirmed SN ever discovered, shows that SN Eos's progenitor star likely formed in a metal-poor environment (&lt;= 0.1 Z_{\odot}), providing the first direct evidence of massive star formation in the metal-poor, early Universe. SN Eos would not have been detectable without the extreme lensing magnification of the system, highlighting the potential of such discoveries to eventually place constraints on the faint end of the cosmic star-formation rate density in the very early Universe.</description>

      <title>Triaxial Magnetars as Sources of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I suggest that some of the mysterious temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) may be explained if they are produced by dynamically triaxial magnetars. If the bursts are narrowly collimated along open field lines, then observed repeating FRB may be those in which the moment of inertia tensor is only slightly triaxial and the rotation axis, open field lines and radiation point nearly to the observer. Apparently non-repeating FRB may be triaxial with the direction of open field lines and radiation wandering across the sky, reducing their duty factors by several orders of magnitude. A slightly triaxial moment tensor in repeaters moves the line of sight into or out of the radiation pattern or within it, explaining periods of greater or lesser (or absent) activity, and making the probability of detecting a burst and hence the burst rate vary aperiodically. The dynamics of triaxial bodies might thwart the coherent integration of gravitational signals from rotating accreting neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Radiative Cooling Effects on Plasmoid Formation in Black Hole Accretion Flows with Multiple Magnetic Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of radiative cooling on plasmoid formation in black hole accretion flows using 2D and 3D two-temperature GRMHD simulations with multi-loop magnetic fields. Our results show that radiative cooling suppresses the transition to a MAD state by reducing magnetic flux accumulation near the horizon, modifies the disk structure via lower electron temperatures and increased equatorial density, and alters reconnection properties:compressing current sheets, shortening plasmoid lifetimes, and increasing their frequency. We also find enhanced negative energy-at-infinity density in plasmoids near the ergosphere. These findings indicate that radiative cooling critically shapes both large scale accretion dynamics and small-scale reconnection phenomena, potentially modulating black hole energy extraction through reconnection-driven Penrose processes.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter may accumulate in neutron stars given its gravitational interaction and abundance. We investigate the modification of neutron star properties and confront them with the observations in the context of strongly-interacting dark matter scenario, specifically for a QCD-like theory with G$_2$ gauge group for which a first-principles equation-of-state from lattice calculations is available. We study the impact of various observational constraints and modeling of the QCD equation of state on the combined neutron stars. The results indicate that dark matter masses of a few hundred MeV to a few GeV are consistent with the latest observed neutron star properties.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit for static and axisymmetric spacetimes: Local curvature, matter fields, and quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07906v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the deflection of photons in the strong deflection limit within static and axisymmetric spacetimes possessing reflection symmetry. As the impact parameter approaches its critical value, the deflection angle exhibits a logarithmic divergence. This divergence is characterized by a logarithmic coefficient and a constant offset, which we express in terms of the coordinate-invariant curvature quantities evaluated at the unstable circular photon orbit. The curvature contribution is encoded in the electric part of the Weyl tensor, reflecting tidal effects, and the matter contribution is encoded in the Einstein tensor, capturing the influence of local energy and pressure. We also express these coefficients using the Newman--Penrose scalars. By exploiting the relationship between the strong deflection limit and the quasinormal modes, we derive a new expression for the quasinormal mode frequency in the eikonal limit in terms of the curvature scalars. Our results provide a unified and coordinate-invariant framework that connects observable lensing features and quasinormal modes to the local geometry and matter distribution near compact objects.</description>

      <title>Hawking Radiation Signatures from Primordial Black Holes Transiting the Inner Solar System: Prospects for Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) arise from the collapse of density perturbations in the early universe and serve as a dark matter (DM) candidate and a probe of fundamental physics. There remains an unconstrained ``asteroid-mass'' window where PBHs of masses $10^{17} {\rm g} \lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} {\rm g}$ could comprise up to $100\%$ of the dark matter. Current $e^{\pm}$ Hawking radiation constraints on the DM fraction of PBHs are set by comparing observed spatial- and time-integrated cosmic ray flux measurements with predicted Hawking emission fluxes from the galactic DM halo. These constraints depend on cosmic ray production and propagation models, the galactic DM density distribution, and the PBH mass function. We propose to mitigate these model dependencies by developing a new local, time-dependent Hawking radiation signature to detect low-mass PBHs transiting through the inner Solar System. We calculate transit rates for PBHs that form with initial masses $M \lesssim 5\times10^{17}\text{g}$. We then simulate time-dependent positron signals from individual PBH flybys as measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment in low-Earth orbit. We find that AMS is sensitive to PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 2\times10^{14} \, {\rm g}$ due to its lower energy threshold of $500 \, {\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that a dataset of daily positron fluxes over the energy range $5-500 \, {\rm MeV}$, with similar levels of precision to the existing AMS data, would enable detection of PBHs drawn from present-day distributions that peak within the asteroid-mass window. Our simulations yield ${\cal O} (1)$ detectable PBH transits per year across wide regions of parameter space, which may be used to constrain PBH mass functions. This technique could be extended to detect $\gamma$-ray and X-ray Hawking emission to probe further into the asteroid-mass window.</description>

      <title>Optical and near-infrared nebular-phase spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi: constraints on the structure of the inner ejecta, progenitor mass, and dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type II supernova SN\,2024ggi from 250 and 581 days after the explosion. Comparing the evolution of the [\ion{O}{1}] at 6300, 6363 \text{\AA} doublet normalized to the continuum with spectral models from the literature, we estimate a progenitor star zero-age main-sequence mass ($M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$) of $\approx 14$ M$_\odot$. This value is consistent with $M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$ reported in the literature from independent methodologies. The nebular spectra are used to study the structure of the inner ejecta. The broad H$\alpha$ line has a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\simeq 3900$ km s$^{-1}$, with small deviations from a symmetric Gaussian profile centred at zero velocity, and the [\ion{O}{1}] doublet is blue-shifted by $\approx -940$ km s$^{-1}$. In the NIR, the nebular spectra reveal double-peaked emission features of \ion{Mg}{1} and [\ion{Fe}{2}] lines between +250 and +319 days, suggesting a bipolar distribution of intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the line-of-sight. Such a double-peaked feature in these NIR lines has not been previously reported. No corresponding asymmetries are observed in the hydrogen lines, suggesting that the asymmetry is mostly confined to intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the innermost core of the supernova ejecta. Additionally, we detect first-overtone carbon monoxide (CO) emission at 2.3,$\mu$m between 250 and 319 days, and a blueshift in the emission lines of H$\alpha$, [\ion{O}{1}], \ion{Mg}{1}], and [\ion{Fe}{2}] in the +581 day optical spectrum, consistent with dust formation in the ejecta.</description>

      <title>SISSI: Supernovae in a stratified, shearing interstellar medium. II. Star formation near the Sun is quenched by expansion of the Local Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The age of the Local Bubble (LB) constrains the timescale on which the interstellar medium in the solar neighborhood evolves. Previous estimates placed the age of the LB at \sim 14 Myr, and attributed its expansion to \sim 15-20 supernovae (SNe), yet a companion paper suggests this age may be overestimated. We place new constraints on the age of the LB and re-evaluate the question whether its expansion triggered or suppressed local star formation. We reconstruct the LB's geometry and momentum using publicly available 3D dust maps and compare them to the high-quality sample of simulated supernova remnants in the SISSI project. Independent constraints on the star-formation history and supernova rate are obtained from a Gaia DR3-based census of nearby star clusters. We find that \sim 7-59 SNe over \sim 5.8 Myr to \sim 2.8 Myr, respectively, are required to explain both the LB's momentum and size and confirm that such a high supernova rate can be sustained by local star clusters. Our analysis yields a substantially smaller LB age than previous estimates, requiring a correspondingly larger number of SNe, driving its expansion. We show that this result is in tension with the conclusion that the LB is powered solely by SNe from the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, which ceased star formation around the time the LB formed. If our estimates are correct, it follows that the majority of star formation in the solar neighborhood happened before the formation of the LB and was not triggered by its expansion. Instead, the SNe that powered the LB appear to overall have quenched the ongoing star formation process. This does not rule out that star formation in the clouds, located near its current edge, could have been affected by the LB expansion.</description>

      <title>Hyperons in Neutron Stars across the observed mass range: Insights from realistic $\Lambda$-N and $\Lambda$-$\Lambda$ interactions within a Microscopic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the equation of state (EOS) and macroscopic properties of neutron stars (NSs) and hyperonic stars within the framework of the lowest order constrained variational (LOCV) method, extended to include interacting $\Lambda$ hyperons. The nucleon-nucleon interaction is modeled using the AV18 potential supplemented by Urbana three-body forces, while $\Lambda N$ and $\Lambda \Lambda$ interactions are described by realistic spin- and parity-dependent potentials fitted to hypernuclear data. Cold, charge-neutral, and $\beta$-equilibrated matter composed of neutrons, protons, electrons, muons, and $\Lambda$ hyperons is considered. We compute particle fractions, chemical potentials, the EOS, speed of sound, tidal deformability, and stellar structure by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, and compare our results with recent NICER and gravitational-wave observations. The inclusion of $\Lambda$ hyperons leads to EOS softening, reducing the maximum NS mass from $2.34M_\odot$ to $2.07M_\odot$, while keeping it consistent with the $2M_\odot$ mass constraint. At $1.4M_\odot$, the model satisfies observational limits on radius and tidal deformability, with the $\Lambda$ onset occurring below this mass. Comparison with other microscopic and relativistic mean-field models shows that our EOS remains consistent with the allowed pressure-energy density range, while also permitting even canonical-mass NSs of about $1.4M_{\odot}$ to accommodate hyperons. These results suggest that hyperons can appear in NSs across the observed mass range without violating current astrophysical constraints, and that the extended LOCV method provides a consistent, microscopic approach to modeling dense hypernuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Charged particle dynamics in singular spacetimes: hydrogenic mapping and curvature-corrected thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of charged test particles in a singular, horizonless spacetime arising as the massless limit of a charged wormhole in the Einstein--Maxwell--Scalar (EMS) framework. The geometry, sustained solely by an electric charge $Q$, features an infinite sequence of curvature singularity shells, with the outermost at \( r_* = \frac{2|Q|}{\pi} \) acting as a hard boundary for nonradial motion, while radial trajectories can access it depending on the particle charge-to-mass ratio \( |q|/m \). Exploiting exact first integrals, we construct the effective potential and obtain circular orbit radii, radial epicyclic frequencies, and azimuthal precession rates. In the weak-field limit (\( r \gg |Q| \)), the motion reduces to a Coulombic system with small curvature-induced retrograde precession. At large radii, the dynamics maps to a hydrogenic system, with curvature corrections inducing perturbative energy shifts. Approaching \( r_* \), the potential diverges, producing hard-wall confinement. Curvature corrections also modify the spectral thermodynamics, raising energies and slightly altering entropy and heat capacity. Our results characterize the transition from Newtonian-like orbits to strongly confined, curvature-dominated dynamics.</description>

      <title>Anderson self-localization of light in pair plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in pair plasma weakly nonlinear electromagnetic waves, $a_0 \leq 1$, experience Anderson self-localization. The beat between the driver and a back-scattered wave creates charge-neutral, large random density fluctuations $\delta n/n_0 \gg 1$, and corresponding fluctuations of the dielectric permittivity $\epsilon$ (random plasma density grating). Propagating in quasi-1D, waves in a medium with spatially random self-created fluctuations of dielectric permeability experience localization. {In the linear regime, the instability can be classified as Induced Brillouin Scattering; it is described by the parameter $\rho _L = \left( a_0 { \omega_{p}/ }{\omega}\right)^{2/3} \leq 1 $, related to the Pierce parameter of Free Electron Lasers. In the cold case, the growth rate is $\Gamma \approx \rho _{L} \omega$ ($a_0 $ is laser nonlinearity parameter, $\omega_p$ is plasma frequency, $\omega$ is the laser frequency). } Anderson self-localization of light leads to (i) reflection of EM waves by the under-dense pair plasma; (ii) a wave already present inside the plasma separates into bright trapped pockets and dark regions. Mild initial thermal spread with $\Theta \equiv k_B T/(m_e c^2) \approx a_0^2$, restores wave propagation by suppressing the seeds of parametrically unstable density fluctuations. A circularly polarized driver produces linearly polarized structures, with position angle varying randomly between the bright pulses. Time-variability of the resulting density structures does not suppress localization due to remaining corrections (not white noise). We discuss possible applications to astrophysical Fast Radio Bursts.</description>

      <title>Is the high-energy environment of K2-18b special?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: K2-18b lies near the radius valley that separates super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, marking a key transitional regime in planetary and atmospheric composition. The system offers a valuable opportunity to study how M-dwarf high-energy stellar radiation influences atmospheric stability and the potential for sustaining volatile species, especially important in the context of the upcoming ELT and its ANDES spectrograph. This study characterizes the high-energy environment of K2-18 with X-ray observations from eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, Chandra, and XMM-Newton. We derive a representative 0.2-2 keV X-ray flux with an APEC thermal plasma model fitted with the Bayesian X-ray Analysis (BXA). With the observed X-ray flux from the exoplanet host star, we estimate the photoevaporative mass loss of exoplanet K2-18b using the energy-limited model. In addition, we examine the thermal structure of the system based on a hydrodynamic model. In 100 ks XMM-Newton observation we identified K2-18 as a very faint X-ray source with $\mathrm{F_X = 10^{-15}\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, with an activity level of (Lx/Lbol) $\sim 10^{-5}$. A small flare has been detected during the observation. The planet is irradiated by an X-ray flux of $\mathrm{F_{pl,X} = 12\pm3\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. The X-ray flux measurement of K2-18 gives important limitations for atmospheric escape and photochemical modeling of its exoplanets. Despite its near orbit around an M-dwarf star, K2-18b's low activity level environment suggests that it can retain an atmosphere, supporting recent tentative detections of atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Strong Evidence for Cosmic Ray-Supported $\sim$L$^{\ast}$ Galaxy Halos via X-ray \&amp; tSZ Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many state-of-the-art galaxy simulations featuring traditional feedback modes have significant challenges producing enough extended soft X-ray ($\sim 0.5-2$ keV) emission at R $\sim 0.5-1$ R$_{\rm vir}$ observed around galaxies with stellar masses M$_{\rm \ast} \lesssim 10^{11} \rm M_\odot$, without violating galaxy mass function constraints. Moreover, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) measurements probing the thermal pressure of similar galaxies indicate it is orders-of-magnitude lower than predictions from simple halo hydrodynamics and many hydrodynamical simulations. We demonstrate that these constraints can be met congruously with a large non-thermal pressure contribution in the form of cosmic rays (CRs) from SNe and/or AGN, which lowers the tSZ signal while CR leptons produce plentiful soft X-rays via inverse Compton scattering of the CMB. The combination of these two observations is far more constraining on the pressure budget of galactic halos than either alone -- if these novel tSZ and X-ray observations are borne out by future studies, then taken together they reveal \textit{the strongest evidence for CR support in halos to date}. Conversely, it is very difficult to produce the extended X-rays via traditional thermal emission without increasing the overall thermal pressure and thus tSZ signal in tandem, making these tensions even worse. Finally, tSZ \&amp; X-rays together unlock a novel observational method to constrain halo CR pressure relative to thermal pressure, with implications for CR transport parameters and AGN feedback energetics across various galaxy mass scales. Taking the currently observed constraints at M$_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{\rm 12} \rm M_\odot$ imply the halo CR pressure must at least be equal to the gas thermal pressure.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of periodic orbits and gravitational waves in a deformed Schwarzschild black hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate periodic orbits of test particles around a deformed Schwarzschild black hole and the resulting gravitational waves. Firstly, we examine the properties of circular orbits and find that circular orbits could disappear when the deformation is large enough. Then, using an orbital taxonomy, we characterize various periodic orbits with a set of triples, which describes the zoom-whirl behaviours. We also calculate the gravitational waveform signals generated by different periodic orbits, revealing the influence of the deformation on the gravitational wave, which can be potentially picked up by future space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Effects of spontaneous Lorentz Symmetry breaking on Letelier-AdS charged black holes within Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of massless particles -- specifically photons -- in the spacetime of a charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) surrounded by a cloud of strings (CoS) within the framework of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We analyze the effective potential that governs photon trajectories, explore the properties and location of the photon sphere (PS), and examine the effective radial force acting on photons. The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $\alpha$ and the KR field parameter $\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field. Our results reveal the rich structure of AdS-BH spacetimes influenced by string clouds and antisymmetric tensor fields, with potential observational consequences in gravitational wave and BH imaging astronomy.</description>

      <title>KiDS-Legacy: WIMP dark matter constraints from the cross-correlation of weak lensing and Fermi-LAT gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter dominates the matter content of the Universe, and its properties can be constrained through large-scale structure probes such as the cross-correlation between the unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) and weak gravitational lensing. We analysed 15 years of Fermi-LAT data, constructing UGRB intensity maps in ten energy bins (0.5-1000 GeV), and cross-correlated them with KiDS-Legacy shear in six tomographic bins. The measurements were performed using angular power spectra estimated with the pseudo-$C_\ell$ method. No significant cross-correlation is found. Based on this non-detection, we present 95% upper bounds on the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) decay rate $\Gamma_{\rm dec}$ and velocity-averaged annihilation cross-section $\langle\sigma_{\rm ann} v\rangle$ as functions of mass. We compare our results with bounds from other cosmological tracers and from local probes, and found them to be complementary, particularly at low masses ($\rm GeV/TeV$). In addition, using a Euclid-like lensing survey cross-correlated with Fermi-LAT, we forecast $\sim$2 times tighter limits, highlighting the potential of forthcoming data to strengthen constraints on dark matter annihilation and decay.</description>
