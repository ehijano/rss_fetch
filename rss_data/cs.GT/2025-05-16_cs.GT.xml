      <title>On Signed Network Coordination Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study binary-action pairwise-separable network games that encompass both coordinating and anti-coordinating behaviors. Our model is grounded in an underlying directed signed graph, where each link is associated with a weight that describes the strenght and nature of the interaction. The utility for each agent is an aggregation of pairwise terms determined by the weights of the signed graph in addition to an individual bias term. We consider a scenario that assumes the presence of a prominent 'cohesive' subset of players, who are either connected exclusively by positive weights, or forms a structurally balanced subset that can be bipartitioned into two adversarial subcommunities with positive intra-community and negative inter-community edges. Given the properties of the game restricted to the remaining players, our results guarantee the existence of Nash equilibria characterized by a consensus or, respectively, a polarization within the first group, as well as their stability under best response transitions. Our results can be interpreted as robustness results, building on the supermodular properties of coordination games and on a novel use of the concept of graph cohesiveness.</description>

      <title>Variety-Seeking Jump Games on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of jump games in which agents of different types occupy the nodes of a graph aiming to maximize the variety of types in their neighborhood. In particular, each agent derives a utility equal to the number of types different from its own in its neighborhood. We show that the jump game induced by the strategic behavior of the agents (who aim to maximize their utility) may in general have improving response cycles, but is a potential game under any of the following four conditions: there are only two types of agents; or exactly one empty node; or the graph is of degree at most 2; or the graph is 3-regular and there are two empty nodes. Additionally, we show that on trees, cylinder graphs, and tori, there is always an equilibrium. Finally, we show tight bounds on the price of anarchy with respect to two different measures of diversity: the social welfare (the total utility of the agents) and the number of colorful edges (that connect agents of different types).</description>

      <title>Price of Anarchy for Congestion and Scheduling Games via Vector Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a dual fitting technique on a semidefinite program yielding simple proofs of tight bounds for the robust price of anarchy of several congestion and scheduling games under the sum of weighted completion times objective. The same approach also allows to bound the approximation ratio of local search algorithms for the scheduling problem $R || \sum w_j C_j$. All of our results are obtained through a simple unified dual fitting argument on the same semidefinite programming relaxation, which can essentially be obtained through the first round of the Lasserre/Sum of Squares hierarchy.
  As our main application, we show that the known coordination ratio bounds of respectively $4, (3 + \sqrt{5})/2 \approx 2.618,$ and $32/15 \approx 2.133$ for the scheduling game $R || \sum w_j C_j$ under the coordination mechanisms Smith's Rule, Proportional Sharing and Rand (STOC 2011) can be extended to congestion games and obtained through this approach. For the natural restriction where the weight of each player is proportional to its processing time on every resource, we show that the last bound can be improved from 2.133 to 2. This improvement can also be made for general instances when considering the price of anarchy of the game, rather than the coordination ratio. As a further application of the technique, we show that it recovers the tight bound of $(3 + \sqrt{5})/2$ for the price of anarchy of weighted affine congestion games and the Kawaguchi-Kyan bound of $(1+ \sqrt{2})/2$ for the pure price of anarchy of $P || \sum w_j C_j$. In addition, this approach recovers the known tight approximation ratio of $(3 + \sqrt{5})/2 \approx 2.618$ for a natural local search algorithm for $R || \sum w_j C_j$, as well as the best currently known combinatorial approximation algorithm for this problem achieving an approximation ratio of $(5 + \sqrt{5})/4 + \varepsilon \approx 1.809 + \varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>The Art of Two-Round Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the voting problem with two alternatives where voters' preferences depend on a not-directly-observable state variable. While equilibria in the one-round voting mechanisms lead to a good decision, they are usually hard to compute and follow. We consider the two-round voting mechanism where the first round serves as a polling stage and the winning alternative only depends on the outcome of the second round. We show that the two-round voting mechanism is a powerful tool for making collective decisions. Firstly, every (approximated) equilibrium in the two-round voting mechanisms (asymptotically) leads to the decision preferred by the majority as if the state of the world were revealed to the voters. Moreover, there exist natural equilibria in the two-round game following intuitive behaviors such as informative voting, sincere voting [Austen-Smith and Banks, 1996], and the surprisingly popular strategy [Prelec et al., 2017]. This sharply contrasts with the one-round voting mechanisms in the previous literature, where no simple equilibrium is known. Finally, we show that every equilibrium in the standard one-round majority vote mechanism gives an equilibrium in the two-round mechanisms that is not more complicated than the one-round equilibrium. Therefore, the two-round voting mechanism provides a natural equilibrium in every instance, including those where one-round voting fails to have a natural solution, and it can reach an informed majority decision whenever one-round voting can. Our experiments on generative AI voters also imply that two-round voting leads to the correct outcome more often than one-round voting under some circumstances.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Best-Response Dynamics in Random Potential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the convergence behaviour of simultaneous best-response dynamics in random potential games. We provide a theoretical result showing that, for two-player games with sufficiently many actions, the dynamics converge quickly to a cycle of length two. This cycle lies within the intersection of the neighbourhoods of two distinct Nash equilibria. For three players or more, simulations show that the dynamics converge quickly to a Nash equilibrium with high probability. Furthermore, we show that all these results are robust, in the sense that they hold in non-potential games, provided the players' payoffs are sufficiently correlated. We also compare these dynamics to gradient-based learning methods in near-potential games with three players or more, and observe that simultaneous best-response dynamics converge to a Nash equilibrium of comparable payoff substantially faster.</description>

      <title>Aggregating Information and Preferences with Bounded-Size Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a voting scenario with two groups of agents whose preferences depend on a ground truth that cannot be directly observed. The majority's preferences align with the ground truth, while the minorities disagree. Focusing on strategic behavior, we analyze situations where agents can form coalitions up to a certain capacity and adopt the concept of ex-ante Bayesian $k$-strong equilibrium, in which no group of at most $k$ agents has an incentive to deviate. Our analysis provides a complete characterization of the region where equilibria exist and yield the majority-preferred outcome when the ground truth is common knowledge. This region is defined by two key parameters: the size of the majority group and the maximum coalition capacity. When agents cannot coordinate beyond a certain threshold determined by these parameters, a stable outcome supporting the informed majority emerges. The boundary of this region exhibits several distinct segments, notably including a surprising non-linear relationship between majority size and deviation capacity. Our results reveal the complexity of the strategic behaviors in this type of voting game, which in turn demonstrate the capability of the ex-ante Bayesian $k$-strong equilibrium to provide a more detailed analysis.</description>

      <title>Bridging Theory and Perception in Fair Division: A Study on Comparative and Fair Share Notions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The allocation of resources among multiple agents is a fundamental problem in both economics and computer science. In these settings, fairness plays a crucial role in ensuring social acceptability and practical implementation of resource allocation algorithms. Traditional fair division solutions have given rise to a variety of approximate fairness notions, often as a response to the challenges posed by non-existence or computational intractability of exact solutions. However, the inherent incompatibility among these notions raises a critical question: which concept of fairness is most suitable for practical applications? In this paper, we examine two broad frameworks -- threshold-based and comparison-based fairness notions -- and evaluate their perceived fairness through a comprehensive human subject study. Our findings uncover novel insights into the interplay between perception of fairness, theoretical guarantees, the role of externalities and subjective valuations, and underlying cognitive processes, shedding light on the theory and practice of fair division.</description>

      <title>Study and improvement of search algorithms in two-players perfect information games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Games, in their mathematical sense, are everywhere (game industries, economics, defense, education, chemistry, biology, ...).Search algorithms in games are artificial intelligence methods for playing such games. Unfortunately, there is no study on these algorithms that evaluates the generality of their performance. We propose to address this gap in the case of two-player zero-sum games with perfect information. Furthermore, we propose a new search algorithm and we show that, for a short search time, it outperforms all studied algorithms on all games in this large experiment and that, for a medium search time, it outperforms all studied algorithms on 17 of the 22 studied games.</description>

      <title>Epistemic vs. Counterfactual Fairness in Allocation of Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resource allocation is fundamental to a variety of societal decision-making settings, ranging from the distribution of charitable donations to assigning limited public housing among interested families. A central challenge in this context is ensuring fair outcomes, which often requires balancing conflicting preferences of various stakeholders. While extensive research has been conducted on theoretical and algorithmic solutions within the fair division framework, much of this work neglects the subjective perception of fairness by individuals. This study focuses on the fairness notion of envy-freeness (EF), which ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent according to their own preferences. While the existence of exact EF allocations may not always be feasible, various approximate relaxations, such as counterfactual and epistemic EF, have been proposed. Through a series of experiments with human participants, we compare perceptions of fairness between three widely studied counterfactual and epistemic relaxations of EF. Our findings indicate that allocations based on epistemic EF are perceived as fairer than those based on counterfactual relaxations. Additionally, we examine a variety of factors, including scale, balance of outcomes, and cognitive effort involved in evaluating fairness and their role in the complexity of reasoning across treatments.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Chores with Information Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-regarded fairness notion when dividing indivisible chores is envy-freeness up to one item (EF1), which requires that pairwise envy can be eliminated by the removal of a single item. While an EF1 and Pareto optimal (PO) allocation of goods can always be found via well-known algorithms, even the existence of such solutions for chores remains open, to date. We take an epistemic approach utilizing information asymmetry by introducing dubious chores--items that inflict no cost on receiving agents but are perceived costly by others. On a technical level, dubious chores provide a more fine-grained approximation of envy-freeness than EF1. We show that finding allocations with minimal number of dubious chores is computationally hard. Nonetheless, we prove the existence of envy-free and fractional PO allocations for $n$ agents with only $2n-2$ dubious chores and strengthen it to $n-1$ dubious chores in four special classes of valuations. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that often only a few dubious chores are needed to achieve envy-freeness.</description>

      <title>A decomposition from a many-to-one matching market with path-independent choice functions to a one-to-one matching market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a many-to-one market where firms are endowed with path-independent choice functions, based on the Aizerman-Malishevski decomposition, we define an associated one-to-one market. Given that the usual notion of stability for a one-to-one market does not fit well for this associated one-to-one market, we introduce a new notion of stability. This notion allows us to establish an isomorphism between the set of stable matchings in the many-to-one market and the matchings in an associated one-to-one market that meet this new stability criterion. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the well-known deferred acceptance algorithm to compute a matching that satisfies this new notion of stability for the associated one-to-one market. Finally, as a byproduct of our isomorphism, we prove an adapted version of the so-called Rural Hospital Theorem.</description>
