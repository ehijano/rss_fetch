      <title>Higher-order topological bound states in the continuum in a topoelectrical lattice with long-range coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear electric circuits composed of inductors and capacitors can serve as analogues of tight-binding models that describe the electronic band structure of materials. This mapping provides a versatile approach for exploring topological phenomena within engineered electrical lattices. In this work, the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model is examined through electric circuit analogues to study the interplay between higher-order topology, bound states in the continuum, and disorder. Building upon this model, the effect of introducing next-nearest-neighbour interactions that preserve chiral and spatial symmetries of the system is analyzed. The results reveal that even without Hamiltonian separability, corner-localized bound states in the continuum remain protected by symmetry in the long-range coupled lattice. This robustness highlights the potential of circuit-based platforms for probing advanced topological phenomena in a highly controllable setting.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory approach for multistage chemical kinetics in liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes play an important role in a variety of physical, chemical, and biological systems. Conventionally, the kinetics of these processes are described by the law of mass action. However, there are various cases where these equations are insufficient. A fundamental challenge lies in accurately accounting for the microscopic correlations that inevitably arise in bimolecular reactions. While approaches to describe microscopic correlations in many specific cases exist, no general theory for multistage reactions has been established. In this article, we apply the quantum field theory approach to derive kinetic equations for general multistage reactive systems termed CMET (complete modified encounter theory). CMET can be formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations that can be easily integrated numerically, thereby serving as a versatile tool for investigating reaction-diffusion processes. Across multiple case studies, we demonstrated that CMET reproduces the kinetics predicted by many other theories within their respective scopes of applicability.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of bosonic Thouless pump due to interaction in a quasiperiodic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of inter-particle interaction on the quantized Thouless pump in the bosonic quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr{\'e} model and find that the quantization of the pumped charge breaks down already for weak interactions. Furthermore, the pumped charge undergoes sharp changes as a function of interaction strength that we can attribute to the closing of specific doublon channels. As expected, the quantization revives in the hard-core limit at very large interaction strengths where the bosons are subject to a hardcore constraint. Interestingly, the stability of isolated doublons under the pump depends on the band they are in. For repulsive interactions and a suitably fixed pump period, doublons in the lowest band are pumped stably while doublons in higher bands dissociate during the pump with one particle decaying into a lower band. This asymmetry leads to the decay of the total energy over time, in stark contrast to the typical Floquet heating expected for a driven many-body system.</description>

      <title>A quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for arbitrary high-spin Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a universal quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating arbitrary high-spin (spin greater than 1/2) Hamiltonians, based on the recently developed permutation matrix representation (PMR) framework. Our approach extends a previously developed PMR-QMC method for spin-1/2 Hamiltonians [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013281 (2024)]. Because it does not rely on a local bond decomposition, the method applies equally well to models with arbitrary connectivities, long-range and multi-spin interactions, and its closed-walk formulation allows a natural analysis of sign-problem conditions in terms of cycle weights. To demonstrate its applicability and versatility, we apply our method to spin-1 and spin-3/2 quantum Heisenberg models on the square lattice, as well as to randomly generated high-spin Hamiltonians. Additionally, we show how the approach naturally extends to general Hamiltonians involving mixtures of particle species, including bosons and fermions. We have made our program code freely accessible on GitHub.</description>
