      <title>Impurity-induced Friedel oscillations in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Friedel oscillations of the local density of states (LDOS) induced by a single impurity with both a spin-independent potential and an exchange coupling to the electrons in altermagnets and unconventional $p$-wave magnets. We identify features that make the Friedel oscillations and magnetization distinct from other materials with nontrivial spin texture such as Rashba metals. Because time-reversal symmetry is broken in altermagnets, both magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities lead to local magnetization with the spatial pattern that reflects the symmetry of the altermagnetic splitting. The period of the corresponding oscillations provides an alternative way to quantify the altermagnetic spin splitting and the shape of the altermagnetic bands. The LDOS pattern in $p$-wave magnets, which respect combined time-reversal and translation symmetries, is rich. It reveals anisotropy related directly to the spin splitting, but surprisingly also features LDOS oscillations with a doubled period in the proximity of the impurity. The latter effect is also observed in a Rashba metal with an exchange field and originates from the interplay of propagating and evanescent waves. The obtained results are instrumental for investigating altermagnets and unconventional $p$-wave magnets and impurity effects via tunneling probes.</description>

      <title>Instanton analysis for the spin quantum Hall symmetry class: Non-perturbative corrections to physical observables and generalized multifractal spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been renewed interest in studies of criticality in the spin quantum Hall effect, realized in the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry class C of disordered, noninteracting fermions in two spatial dimensions. In our study, we develop a nonperturbative analysis of the replica two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model in class C. We explicitly construct the instanton solution with a unit topological charge. By treating fluctuations around the instanton at a Gaussian level, we calculate the instanton correction to the free energy. We compute non-perturbative corrections to the anomalous dimensions of pure power-law scaling local operators, which determine the spectrum of generalized multifractality. We also calculate instanton corrections to the renormalized longitudinal and Hall spin conductivities and determine the topology of the phase diagram for class C. Our results demonstrate that the spin quantum Hall effect is indeed a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Strongly interacting Hofstadter states in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) hosts a multitude of strongly correlated states at partial fillings of its flat bands. In a magnetic field, these flat bands further evolve into a unique Hofstadter spectrum renormalized by strong Coulomb interactions. Here, we study the interacting Hofstadter states spontaneously formed within the topological magnetic subbands of an ultraclean MATBG device, notably including symmetry-broken Chern insulator (SBCI) states and fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states. The observed SBCI states form a cascade with their Chern numbers mimicking the main sequence correlated Chern insulators. The FQH states in MATBG form in Jain sequence; however, they disappear at high magnetic field, distinct from conventional FQH states which strengthen with increasing magnetic field. We reveal a unique magnetic field-driven phase transition from composite fermion phases to a dissipative Fermi liquid. Our theoretical analysis of the magnetic subbands hosting FQH states predicts non uniform quantum geometric properties far from the lowest Landau level. This points towards a more natural interpretation of these FQH states as in-field fractional Chern insulators of the magnetic subbands.</description>

      <title>Generalized fractional approach to solving partial differential equations with arbitrary dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional calculus has been used to describe physical systems with complexity. Here, we show that a fractional calculus approach can restore or include complexity in any physical systems that can be described by partial differential equations. We argue that the dispersion relation contains the required information relating the energy and momentum space of the system and thus fully describes their dynamics. The approach is demonstrated by two examples: the Landau-Lifshitz equation in a 1D ferromagnetic chain, an example of a periodic crystal system with a bounded dispersion relation; and a modified KdV equation supporting surface gravity waves or Euler dispersion, an example of an unbounded system in momentum space. The presented approach is applicable to fluids, soft matter, and solid-state matter and can be readily generalized to higher dimensions and more complex systems. While numerical calculations are needed to determine the fractional operator, the approach is analytical and can be utilized to determine analytical solutions and investigate nonlinear problems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling behaviors of free fermions on hyperbolic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, tight-binding models on hyperbolic lattices (discretized AdS space), have gained significant attention, leading to hyperbolic band theory and non-Abelian Bloch states. In this paper, we investigate these quantum systems from the perspective of quantum information, focusing particularly on the scaling of entanglement entropy (EE) that has been regarded as a powerful quantum-information probe into exotic phases of matter. It is known that on $d$-dimensional translation-invariant Euclidean lattice, the EE of band insulators scales as an area law ($\sim L^{d-1}$; $L$ is the linear size of the boundary between two subsystems). Meanwhile, the EE of metals (with finite Density-of-State, i.e., DOS) scales as the renowned Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law ($\sim L^{d-1}\log L$). The appearance of logarithmic divergence, as well as the analytic form of the coefficient $c$ is mathematically controlled by the Widom conjecture of asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices and can be physically understood via the Swingle's argument. However, the hyperbolic lattice, which generalizes translational symmetry, results in inapplicability of the Widom conjecture and thus presents significant analytic difficulties. Here we make an initial attempt through numerical simulation. Remarkably, we find that both cases adhere to the area law, indicating that the logarithmic divergence arising from finite DOS is suppressed by the background hyperbolic geometry. To achieve the results, we first apply the vertex inflation method to generate hyperbolic lattice on the Poincar\'{e} disk, and then apply the Haydock recursion method to compute DOS. Finally, we study the scaling of EE for different bipartitions via exact diagonalization and perform finite-size scaling. We also investigate how the coefficient of the area law is correlated to bulk gap and DOS. Future directions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of topological phase transitions in quantum spin Hall $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet engineering of topological phase transitions driven by a high-frequency time-periodic field is a promising approach to realizing new topological phases of matter distinct from static states. Here, we theoretically investigate Floquet engineering topological phase transitions in the quantum spin Hall $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ system driven by an off-resonant circularly polarized light. In addition to the quantum spin (anomalous) Hall insulator phase with multiple helical (chiral) edge states, spin-polarized topological metallic phases are expected, where the bulk topological band gap of one spin sub-band overlaps with the other gapless spin sub-band. Moreover, with a staggered potential, the topological invariants of the system depend on whether the middle band is occupied because of the breaking of particle-hole symmetry. Our work highlights the significance of Floquet engineering in realizing new topological phases in the $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ lattice.</description>

      <title>Gain and Threshold Improvements of 1300 nm Lasers based on InGaAs/InAlGaAs Superlattice Active Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed experimental analysis of the impact of active region design on the performance of 1300 nm lasers based on InGaAs/InAlGaAs superlattices is presented. Three different types of superlattice active regions and waveguide layer compositions were grown. Using a superlattice allows to downshift the energy position of the miniband, as compared to thin InGaAs quantum wells, having the same composition, being beneficial for high-temperature operation. Very low internal loss (~6$cm^{-1}$), low transparency current density of ~500$ A/cm^2$, together with 46$ cm^{-1}$ modal gain and 53 % internal efficiency were observed for broad-area lasers with an active region based on a highly strained $In_{0.74}Ga_{0.26}As/In_{0.53}Al_{0.25}Ga_{0.22}As$ superlattice. Characteristic temperatures $T_0$ and $T_1$ were improved up to 76 K and 100 K, respectively. These data suggest that such superlattices have also the potential to much improve VCSEL properties at this wavelength.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in metallic collinear antiferromagnets with charge-density wave order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a theoretical model of a metallic N\'{e}el ordered antiferromagnet with charge-density wave order which shows anomalous Hall effect. In our model a combination of the N\'{e}el order and the charge-density wave order results in spin splitting of the conducting fermions. Addition of Rashba spin-orbit coupling results in momentum-spin locking of conducting fermions required for the existence of the anomalous Hall effect.</description>

Abstract: Developing permanent magnets with fewer critical elements requires understanding hysteresis effects and coercivity through visualizing magnetization reversal. Here, we numerically investigate the effect of the geometry of nanoscale ferromagnetic inclusions in a paramagnetic/non-magnetic matrix to understand the key factors that maximize the magnetic energy product of such nanocomposite systems. Specifically, we have considered a matrix of 3 micron x 3 micron x40 nanometer dimension, which is a sufficiently large volume, two-dimensional representation considering that the ferromagnetic inclusions thickness is less than 3.33% of the lateral dimensions simulated. Using this approach that is representative of bulk behavior while being computationally tractable for simulation, we systematically studied the effect of the thickness of ferromagnetic strips, the separation between the ferromagnetic strips due to the nonmagnetic matrix material, and the length of these ferromagnetic strips on magnetic coercivity and remanence by simulating the hysteresis loop plots for each geometry. Furthermore, we study the underlying micromagnetic mechanism for magnetic reversal to understand the factors that could help attain the maximum magnetic energy densities for ferromagnetic nanocomposite systems in a paramagnetic/non-magnetic material matrix. In this study, we have used material parameters of an exemplary Alnico alloy system, a rare-earth-free, thermally stable nanocomposite, which could potentially replace high-strength NdFeB magnets in applications that don't require large energy products. This can stimulate further experimental work on the fabrication and large-scale manufacturing of RE-free PMs with such nanocomposite systems.</description>

      <title>Terahertz high-harmonic generation in gapped antiferromagnetic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear dynamics of magnetization in antiferromagnets, resulting in high-frequency spin waves (high-order harmonics) as signal carriers, enable fast magnetic state switching in spintronic devices. More harmonic orders potentially allow more information to be conveyed by the spins. Developing theoretical models to describe these waves in antiferromagnets is essential for predicting their properties and guiding experimental efforts. Here, we consider the role of linear and quadratic spin-phonon couplings (SPCs) in achieving high-order harmonics in the THz magnetization of a gapped antiferromagnetic spin chain. A THz steady laser's electric field indirectly drives spins via phonons. Using spin-wave theory, mean-field theory, and the Lindblad formalism, we analyze the resulting nonlinear dynamics. We highlight the distinct mechanisms for harmonic generation when a phonon is coupled to the easy-plane and easy-axis of spins. Moreover, we observe that quadratic SPC blocks odd harmonics due to invariant inversion symmetry, while linear SPC generates both odd and even harmonics. We also investigate the effects of drive frequency, drive amplitude, phonon damping, and spin damping on the number of harmonics. Our findings offer an alternative pathway for developing nonlinear magnonics.</description>

      <title>First-principles investigation of the emergence of multiferroicity and skyrmions in CrI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrI2 shows promise for spintronic applications. Its electronic and magnetic properties are known to be strongly influenced by electronic correlations. In this work, we employ density functional theory calculations where electronic correlations in CrI2 are considered within an on-site Coulomb interaction, U, with U being determined using the perturbative approach based on the linear response method. We show that the accuracy of an on-site Coulomb interaction is essential for predicting the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic ground state of CrI2, which allows the existence of ferroelectricity and non-zero Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) interaction. Our calculation shows that the ground state of bulk CrI2 has electric polarization of 0.15 {\mu}C/cm-2 pointing along the z-axis and the small DMI energy that changes sign with the ferroelectric polarization switching. The DMI and polarization are enhanced to 0.28 meV/formula-unit and 0.63 {\mu}C/cm-2 when Pt intercalates bilayers of CrI2, due to its large spin-orbit coupling strength and large off-center displacement. Such an enhanced DMI leads to the N\'eel skyrmions, whose handedness is controlled by ferroelectric polarization. Our work contributes to the creation and manipulation of bits in skyrmions-based memory devices.</description>

      <title>Double-leaf Riemann surface topological converse magnetoelectricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric field control of magnetism in solids, i.e. the converse magnetoelectricity, is highly desired for applications of scalable energy-efficient logic devices. However, it is not only a technical challenge but also a scientific paradox, since in principle the electric and magnetic degrees of freedom obey distinct rules of symmetries. Despite the great progresses obtained in the community of multiferroics during the past decades, the success of magnetoelectricity remains on its way and more alternative approaches with conceptual revolution are urgently needed. Here, by introducing the concept of topology into multiferroics, an exotic magnetoelectric double-leaf Riemann-surface is unveiled based on the mechanism of spin-dependent $d-p$ hybridization in a two-dimensional magnet: GdI$_2$ monolayer. Protected by the topology, a $180^\circ$ spin reversal can be precisely achieved by an electric cycle, leading to a robust and dissipationless converse magnetoelectric function. Such a topological magnetoelectricity allows the nontrivial manipulation of magnetization by AC electric field. In this category, more candidate materials with better performance are designed targetedly, which pave the road to the potential applications with topological magnetoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall effect in Mott insulators via skew-scattering by the scalar spin chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal transport is a crucial probe for studying excitations in insulators. In Mott insulators, the primary candidates for heat carriers are spins and phonons, and which dominates the thermal conductivity is a persistent issue. Typically, phonons dominate the longitudinal thermal conductivity while the thermal Hall effect (THE) is primarily associated with spins, which requires time-reversal symmetry breaking. The coupling between phonons and spins usually depends on spin-orbit interaction and is relatively weak. Here, we propose a new mechanism for this coupling and the associated THE: the skew scattering of phonons via spin fluctuations by the scalar spin chirality. This coupling does not require spin-orbit interaction and is ubiquitous in Mott insulators, leading to a thermal Hall angle on the order of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$. Based on this mechanism, we investigate the THE in YMnO$_3$ with a trimerized triangular lattice where the THE beyond spins was recognized, and predict the THE in the Kagome and square lattices.</description>

      <title>Something from Nothing: Enhanced Laser Cooling of a Mechanical Resonator via Zero-Photon Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout quantum science and technology, measurement is used as a powerful resource for nonlinear operations and quantum state engineering. In particular, single-photon detection is commonly employed for quantum-information applications and tests of fundamental physics. By contrast, and perhaps counter-intuitively, measurement of the absence of photons also provides useful information, and offers significant potential for a wide range of new experimental directions. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate cooling of a mechanical resonator below its laser-cooled mechanical occupation via zero-photon detection and verify this cooling through heterodyne measurements of the anti-Stokes scattered optical field. Our measurements are well captured by a stochastic master equation and the techniques introduced here open new avenues for cooling, quantum thermodynamics, quantum state engineering, and quantum measurement and control.</description>

      <title>Something from Nothing: A Theoretical Framework for Enhancing or Enabling Cooling of a Mechanical Resonator via the anti-Stokes or Stokes Interaction and Zero-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to describe how zero-photon detection may be utilized to enhance laser cooling via the anti-Stokes interaction and enable cooling via the Stokes interaction. Our description includes both pulsed and continuous measurements as well as optical detection efficiency and open-system dynamics. For both cases, we discuss how the cooling depends on the system parameters such as detection efficiency and optomechanical cooperativity, and we study the continuous measurement-induced dynamics contrasting to single-photon detection events. For the Stokes case, contrary to the common paradigm of heating via optomechanical parametric amplification, we find the efficiency required to cool a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection. This work serves as a companion article to the recent experiment [E. A. Cryer-Jenkins, K. D. Major, et al., arXiv preprint arXiv:0000.00000 (2024)], which demonstrated enhanced laser cooling of a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes signal. The framework developed here provides new approaches for cooling mechanical resonators that can be applied to a wide range of areas including nonclassical state preparation, quantum thermodynamics, and avoiding the unwanted heating effects of parametric amplification.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Topological Ferroelectric Metal with Giant Ghift Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit for "ferroelectric metal" which combines seemingly incompatible spontaneous electric polarization and metallicity, has been assiduously ongoing but remains elusive. Unlike traditional ferroelectrics with a wide band gap, ferroelectric (FE) metals can naturally incorporate nontrivial band topology near the Fermi level, endowing them with additional exotic properties. Here, we show first-principles evidence that the metallic PtBi2 monolayer is an intrinsic two-dimensional (2D) topological FE metal, characterized by out-of-plane polarization and a moderate switching barrier. Moreover, it exhibits a topologically nontrivial electronic structure with Z2 invariant equal to 1, leading to a significant FE bulk photovoltaic effect. A slight strain can further enhance this effect to a remarkable level, which far surpass that of previously reported 2D/3D FE materials. Our work provides an important step towards realizing intrinsic monolayer topological FE metals and paves a promising way for future nonlinear optical devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of many-body localized systems: logarithmic lightcones and $\log \, t$-law of $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the Many-Body-Localization phenomenology we consider arbitrarily large one-dimensional spin systems. The XXZ model with disorder is a prototypical example. Without assuming the existence of exponentially localized integrals of motion (LIOMs), but assuming instead a logarithmic lightcone we rigorously evaluate the dynamical generation of $ \alpha$-R\'enyi entropies, $ 0&lt; \alpha&lt;1 $ close to one, obtaining a $\log \, t$-law. Assuming the existence of LIOMs we prove that the Lieb-Robinson (L-R) bound of the system's dynamics has a logarithmic lightcone and show that the dynamical generation of the von Neumann entropy, from a generic initial product state, has for large times a $ \log \, t$-shape. L-R bounds, that quantify the dynamical spreading of local operators, may be easier to measure in experiments in comparison to global quantities such as entanglement.</description>

      <title>In-depth Understanding of the Band Alignment and Interface States Scenario in Bi2O2Se/SrTiO3 Ultrathin Heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bismuth oxyselenide (Bi2O2Se), a novel quasi-2D charge-carrying semiconductor, is hailed as one of the best emerging platforms for the next generation semiconductor devices. Recent efforts on developing diverse Bi2O2Se heterojunctions have produced extensive potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics. In-depth understanding of the band alignment and especially interface dynamics is, however, still challenging. In this work, a comprehensive experimental investigation on the band alignment is performed by a high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (HRXPS), and the properties of interface states are also fully discussed. The results show that the ultrathin film Bi2O2Se grown on SrTiO3 (TiO2 (001) termination) exhibits Type-I (straddling gap) band alignment with a valence band offset (VBO) of about 1.77\pm0.04 eV and conduction band offset (CBO) of about 0.68\pm0.04 eV. However, further considering the contribution of the interface states, the bands on the interface present a herringbone configuration due to sizable build-in electric fields, which is significantly different from the conventional band alignment. In this sense, our results provide an insightful guidance to the development of high-efficiency electronic and optoelectronic devices, specifically of the devices where the charge transfer is highly sensitive to interface states.</description>

      <title>The Role of Superlattice Phonons in Charge Localization Across Quantum Dot Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) assemblies are utilized in solar cells and light-harvesting devices because of their distinct physical and optical properties. Recent experiments have successfully synthesized QD molecules, arrays, and assemblies with precision by directly attaching QDs. These systems demonstrate high carrier mobility while preserving the optical properties of the individual QD components. However, despite advancements in fabricating these superstructures, a comprehensive understanding of the charge transfer process at the microscopic level is still lacking. Here, we theoretically investigated the electron transfer dynamics across finite 1-dimensional CdSe-CdS core-shell QD arrays, with $N_{\rm dot}=2,3, \cdots$ QDs. The electronic and vibronic properties of the QD arrays were calculated using a semiempirical pseudopotential method and the electron transfer dynamics were studied using a mixed quantum-classical mapping approach. We find that as $N_{\rm dot}$ increases, the superlattice bending and the symmetric stretch modes can significantly localize electron transfer in the nonadiabatic regime, particularly when the connecting neck between the QDs is narrow, resulting in charge localization for large values of $N_{\rm dot}$. This behavior is quite different in the adiabatic limit when the neck connecting the QDs is wide, where such modes can facilitate electron transfer, partially governed by decoherence times. The interplay between electronic and super-lattice couplings is thus crucial for designing high-mobility devices based on QD superlattices and avoiding charge localization.</description>

      <title>Strip-Loaded Nanophotonic Interfaces for Resonant Coupling and Single-Photon Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the design and simulation of strip-loaded nanophotonic interfaces aimed at improving resonant coupling and photon routing efficiency. In our design, the guided mode is confined within a plane by a high-index thin film and is loosely confined laterally by a lower index strip. Using a hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) strip, titanium dioxide core, and silicon dioxide substrate, we optimise the waveguide dimensions for maximum lateral confinement of light. Specifically, we propose a polymer-based Bragg grating cavity and ring resonator that achieve near-optimal mode volumes and high Q-factors. Our simulations suggest that a cavity with a mode volume of V_{\text{eff}} \approx 7.0 \left(\frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^3 and a Q-factor of 7000 can produce photons with 97% indistinguishability at 4K. Additionally, we investigate directional couplers for efficient photon routing, comparing photonic and plasmonic material structures. While pure photonic structures demonstrate lower loss and improved quality factors, they face practical limitations in terms of bending radius. Conversely, plasmonic structures offer shorter bending radii but higher propagation losses. This research lays the groundwork for future nanophotonic designs, aiming to enhance photon generation and routing capabilities for quantum optical applications.</description>

      <title>Moire exciton polaritons in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moire lattices attract intensive attention in the double graphene/TMD layers and photonic crystals due to the interesting exotic physics within these structures. However, precise measurement of the moir'e ground states, excited states and Bloch bands in the twisted photonic lattices is still illusive. In this work we report the strong coupling between the excitons of CsPbBr3 microplates and the photonic modes of the moire lattice at room temperature. Depending on the coupling strength between the nearest potential sites, we observe staggered moire polariton ground states, excited states trapped in the potential sites and moire polariton bands across the twisted photonic lattice. In addition, the phase locking of moire zero (stable in-phase) states and moire pi (metastable antiphase) states with different spatial distributions are measured. Moir'e polariton distribution can be tuned in the shape of parallelogram by controlling the depth and width of the potential in one photonic lattice with another one fixed. Our work lays the foundation to study moir'e exciton polariton Wigner crystals and Luttinger liquid in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of Co-Doped CaKFe4As4 Investigated via Point-Contact Spectroscopy and London Penetration Depth Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The iron-based superconductors (IBSs) of the recently discovered 1144 class, unlike many other IBSs, display superconductivity in their stoichiometric form and are intrinsically hole doped. The effects of chemical substitutions with electron donors are thus particularly interesting to investigate. Here, we study the effect of Co substitution in the Fe site of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ single crystals on the critical temperature, on the energy gaps, and on the superfluid density by using transport, point-contact Andreev-reflection spectroscopy (PCARS), and London penetration depth measurements. The pristine compound (T$_\mathrm{c}\simeq$ 36 K) shows two isotropic gaps whose amplitudes ($\Delta_1$ = 1.4$-$3.9 meV and $\Delta_2$ = 5.2$-$8.5 meV) are perfectly compatible with those reported in the literature. Upon Co doping (up to $\approx$7% Co), T$_\mathrm{c}$ decreases down to $\simeq$ 20 K, the spin-vortex-crystal order appears, and the low-temperature superfluid density is gradually suppressed. PCARS and London penetration depth measurements perfectly agree in demonstrating that the nodeless multigap structure is robust upon Co doping, while the gap amplitudes decrease as a function of T$_\mathrm{c}$ in a linear way with almost constant values of the gap ratios 2$\Delta_i$/k$_\mathrm{B}$T$_\mathrm{c}$.</description>

Abstract: The Keldysh theory of photoionization for solids is generalized to atomically thin two-dimensional semiconductors. We derive a closed-form formula and its asymptotic forms for a two-band model with a Kane dispersion. These formulas exhibit characteristically different behaviors from their bulk counterparts which are attributed to the scaling of the 2D density of states. We validate our formulas by comparing them to recent strong-field ionization experiments in monolayer MoS2 with good agreement. Our work is expected to find a wide range of applications in intense light - 2D material interaction.</description>

Abstract: We study the effect of electron-phonon coupling on the location of the Fermi Liquid to Wigner Crystal transition in the two-dimensional electron gas realized in various material platforms. Based on dimensional estimates of the relevant parameters, we conclude that (as conventionally assumed) phonons are negligible in traditional semiconductor quantum well systems, but likely play a significant role in various recently synthesized atomically thin two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Local ergotropy and its fluctuations across a dissipative quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit open Rabi model, focusing on local ergotropy - the maximum extractable work by acting solely on the two qubits - within a parameter regime where a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dissipative phase transition occurs. First, we aim to define a protocol for charging, storing, and discharging the two-qubit system, interpreted as the working principle of an open quantum battery. Second, we examine the impact of the phase transition on ergotropy and identify potential markers. To achieve these goals, we construct an ad-hoc charging unitary operator, leveraging our knowledge of the ground state near the transition to bring it into a decoherence-free state during storage. Using advanced numerical techniques based on matrix product state representation, we reveal that high couplings to an external bath approximately double the local ergotropy immediately post-charging. Over time we observe oscillatory behaviors in ergotropy and its fluctuations, which undergo significant changes near the transition, signaling its occurrence. Furthermore, we optimize local ergotropy over time using a physically inspired ansatz, enabling continuous work extraction (local ergotropy never reaches zero). Our work proposes a tunable, experimentally realizable protocol for work extraction, leveraging decoherence-free states and phase transitions. Additionally, it sheds light on the complex interaction between ergotropy and quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Topological origin of non-Hermitian skin effect in higher dimensions and uniform spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is an iconic phenomenon characterized by the aggregation of eigenstates near the system boundaries in non-Hermitian systems. While extensively studied in one dimension, understanding the skin effect and extending the non-Bloch band theory to higher dimensions encounters a formidable challenge, primarily due to infinite lattice geometries or open boundary conditions. This work adopts a point-gap perspective and unveils that non-Hermitian skin effect in all spatial dimensions originates from point gaps. We introduce the concept of uniform spectra and reveal that regardless of lattice geometry, their energy spectra are universally given by the uniform spectra, even though their manifestations of skin modes may differ. Building on the uniform spectra, we demonstrate how to account for the skin effect with generic lattice cuts and establish the connections of skin modes across different geometric shapes via momentum-basis transformations. Our findings highlight the pivotal roles point gaps play, offering a unified understanding of the topological origin of non-Hermitian skin effect in all dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Here, we report a new intrinsic magnetic topological insulator FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ based on first-principles calculations and it can achieve a rich topological phase under pressure modulation. Without pressure, we predict that both FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders are non-trivial topological insulators. Furthermore, FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ of FM-z order will undergo a series of phase transitions from topological insulator to semimetals and then to trivial insulator under pressure. Finally, we further clarify and verify topological phase transitions with low-energy effective model calculations. This topological phase transition process is attributed to the synergy of the magnetic moment and the spin-orbit coupling. The unique topological properties of FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ will be of great interest in driving the development of quantum effects.</description>

Abstract: We present a study on inelastic thermoelectric devices, wherein charge currents and electronic and phononic heat currents are intricately interconnected. The employment of double quantum dots in conjunction with a phonon bath positions them as promising candidates for quantum thermoelectric diodes and transistors. Within this study, we illustrate that quantum coherence effects yield significant charge and Seebeck rectification effects. It's worth noting that, while the thermal transistor effect is observable in the linear response regime, especially when phonon-assisted inelastic processes dominate the transport, quantum coherence does not enhance thermal amplification. Our work provides valuable insights for the optimization of general thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Exciton interacting with a moir\'e lattice: Polarons, strings, and optical probing of spin correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory for how an exciton in an atomically thin transition metal dichacogenide (TMD) monolayer couples to spin and charge correlations in an adjacent moire lattice created by a TMD bi-layer. Virtual tunneling of charge carriers, assumed for concreteness to be holes, between the moire lattice and the monolayer combined with the presence of bound hole-exciton states, i.e. trions, give rise to an effective interaction between the moire holes and the exciton. In addition to the Umklapp scattering, we show that this interaction is spin-dependent and therefore couples the exciton to the spin correlations of the moire holes, which may be in- as well as out-of-plane. We then use our theory to examine two specific examples where the moire holes form in-plane ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic order. In both cases, the exciton creates spin waves in the moire lattice, which we analyse by using a self-consistent Born approximation that includes such processes to infinite order. We show that the competition between magnetic order and exciton motion leads to the formation of a well-defined quasiparticle consisting of the exciton surrounded by a cloud of magnetic frustration in the moire lattice sites below. For the anti-ferromagnet, we furthermore demonstrate the presence of the elusive geometric string excitations and discuss how they can be observed via their smoking gun energy dependence on the spin-spin coupling, which can be tuned by varying the twist angle of the moire bi-layer. All these phenomena have clear signatures in the exciton spectrum, and as such our results illustrate that excitons are promising probes providing optical access to the spin correlations of new quantum phases predicted to exist in TMD materials.</description>

      <title>Efficient Cooper Pair Splitting Without Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the three-terminal NSN device with single-mode normal terminals and without Coulomb blockade, we propose the interpretation of charge transfer process which allows us to consistently characterize the device operation as that of a Cooper pair splitter in terms of scattering matrix elements as well as in terms of measurable quantities. The obtained explicit expression for the splitting probability notably contains the two-particle interference term not available from conductance measurements. We show that splitting doesn't necessarily rely on single-particle crossed Andreev reflection amplitude thus allowing for the unit efficiency at zero energy. Our results imply that the current cross-correlator generally doesn't provide definite measure of splitting.</description>

      <title>Microwave-assisted unidirectional superconductivity in Al-InAs nanowire-Al junctions under magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under certain symmetry-breaking conditions, a superconducting system exhibits asymmetric critical currents, dubbed the ``superconducting diode effect". Recently, systems with the ideal superconducting diode efficiency or unidirectional superconductivity have received considerable interest. In this work, we report the study of Al-InAs nanowire-Al Josephson junctions under microwave irradiation and magnetic fields. We observe an enhancement of superconducting diode effect under microwave driving, featured by a horizontal offset of the zero-voltage step in the voltage-current characteristic that increases with microwave power. Devices reach the unidirectional superconductivity regime at sufficiently high driving amplitudes. The offset changes sign with the reversal of the magnetic field direction. Meanwhile, the offset magnitude exhibits a roughly linear response to the microwave power in dBm when both the power and the magnetic field are large. The signatures observed are reminiscent of a recent theoretical proposal using the resistively shunted junction (RSJ) model. However, the experimental results are not fully explained by the RSJ model, indicating a new mechanism for unidirectional superconductivity that is possibly related to non-equilibrium dynamics or dissipation in periodically driven superconducting systems.</description>

      <title>Topological charge and spin Hall effects due to skyrmions in canted antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological charge-Hall effect (TCHE) and the topological spin-Hall effect (TSHE), arising from ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmions, respectively; can be elucidated through the emergence of spin-dependent Berry gauge fields that affect the adiabatic flow of electrons within the skyrmion texture. TCHE is absent in systems with parity-time (PT) symmetry, such as collinear AFM systems. In this paper, we theoretically study TCHE and TSHE in a canted antiferromagnetic within the diffusive transport regime. Spin canting or weak ferromagnetism in canted AFMs, which break the PT symmetry, may arise, e.g., from strong homogeneous Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann approach, we obtain diffusion equations for the spin and charge accumulations in the presence of finite spin-flip and spin-dependent momentum relaxation times. We show that the weak ferromagnetic moment stemming from spin canting and the subsequent breaking of parity-time symmetry results in the emergence of both finite TCHE and TSHE in AFM systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum valley Hall states in low-buckled counterparts of graphene bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With low-buckled structure for each layer in graphene bilayer system, there breaks inversion symmetry (P-symmetry) for one stacking when both A and B sublattices in top layer are aligned with those in bottom layer. In consideration of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), there opens nontrivial topological gap in each monolayer system to achieve quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE). As long as time-reversal symmetry (T-symmetry) is preserved the gapless edge states is robust in each individual layer even for the bilayer absent of PT symmetry. Based on this platform and through tight-binding (TB) model calculations we find it becomes a typical system that can exhibit quantum valley Hall effect (QVHE) when introduced a layer-resolved Rashba SOC that leads to band inversion at each K valley in the hexagonal Brillion zone (BZ). The topological transition comes from that the valley Chern number Cv = CK - CK' switches from 0 to 2, which characterizes the nontrivial QVHE phase transited from two coupled Z2 topological insulators. We also point that the layer-resolved Rashba SOC can be introduced equivalently by twisting two van der Waals touched layers. And through TB calculations, it is shown that the K bands inverts in its corresponding mini BZ when the two layers twisted by a small angle. Our findings advance potential applications for the devices design in topological valleytronics and twistronics.</description>

      <title>Coupled harmonics due to time-modulated point scatterers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the resonance and scattering properties of a composite medium containing scatterers whose properties are modulated in time. When excited with an incident wave of a single frequency, the scattered field consists of a family of coupled harmonics at frequencies differing by the frequency of temporal modulation. Similarly, the temporal modulation induces coupling between the resonance frequencies, leading to exceptional points at certain modulation amplitudes. Moreover, the lack of energy conservation causes scattering coefficients to blow up when (complex) resonances cross the real axis. We have developed an integral operator approach to characterize the scattering problem and, for high-contrast scatterers, we present small-volume asymptotic formulas analogous to the classical results for the static (unmodulated) case. We conclude the paper with a boundary integral formulation of the time-modulated problem, which gives an efficient numerical approach and corroborates the asymptotic formulas.</description>

      <title>Pseudospin density wave instability in two-dimensional electron bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the instability of layer pseudospin paramagnetic (PSP) state to the formation of pseudospin density wave (PSDW) in two-dimensional (2D) electron bilayers, analogous to the formation of Overhauser spin density wave (SDW) in a single-layer 2D electron gas (2DEG) with spin 1/2. Our comprehensive study on phase diagrams, based on the self-consistent Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, reveals that the PSDW has a lower energy than both PSP and pseudospin ferromagnetic (PSF) states near the PSP-PSF phase transition boundary. When the two layers are populated by the same number of electrons, the PSDW momentum $Q_c \sim 2k_F$ near the PSP-PSDW boundary, where $k_F= (2\pi n)^{1/2}$ is the Fermi momentum characterized by the density in one of the two layers, and $Q_c$ decreases as the system transitions to the PSF regime. Extending the HF study to the case of unequal layer densities, the PSP phase is unstable to PSDW for small density imbalances, with momentum $Q_c \sim k_{F,t} + k_{F,b}$, where $k_{F,t}$ and $k_{F,b}$ are Fermi momenta of top and bottom layers, respectively. In PSDW regime, the ground state stability, defined by the energy difference between PSDW and the second lowest-energy state, is one order of magnitude lower than that in PSF regime, and decreases with increasing layer separation $d$. Furthermore, incorporating RPA static screening with the Hubbard-type local field correction leads to disappearance of both SDW and PSDW phases, and pushes the phase boundaries of paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transitions to larger $r_s$ values. Our study on PSDW in 2D electron bilayers is equally applicable to 2D hole bilayers. The idea of pursuing PSDW is, in general, relevant across various 2D bilayer systems, not limited to the parabolic model that we investigate in this paper, and provides a new possibility of exploring novel coherent phases.</description>

      <title>Subharmonic oscillations in the Floquet circuit with the frequency-synthesis dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The period-doubling oscillation emerges with the coexistence between zero and {\pi} modes in Floquet topological insulator. Here, utilized the flexibility of the circuit, we construct the Floquet circuit with frequency-synthetic dimension and find the topological-protected deeply-subharmonic oscillations with the period extensively exceeding the doubling-driven period. In the construction framework, the periodically-driven mechanism is attained by implementing the circuit-oscillator hierarchy with the stepping-variation resonances in frequency domain. The zero and {\pi} modes that arise at the Floquet band in the circuit indicate the anomalous boundary-bulk correspondence. The coexistence of zero and {\pi} modes, results in a subharmonic oscillation with the extremely-low frequency on the edge of the Floquet circuit. Furthermore, we explore the Floquet band with the enhanced periodically-driven strength tailored by the component flexibility of the circuit. Our method provides a flexible scheme to study Floquet topological phases, and open a new path for realizing the deeply subwavelength system.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Debye scaling in the density of states of liquids under nanoconfinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of nanoscience, the dynamic behaviors of liquids at scales beyond the conventional structural relaxation time, $\tau$, unfold a fascinating blend of solid-like characteristics, including the propagation of collective shear waves and the emergence of elasticity. However, in classical bulk liquids, where $\tau$ is typically of the order of 1 ps or less, this solid-like behavior remains elusive in the low-frequency region of the density of states (DOS). Here, we provide evidence for the emergent solid-like nature of liquids at short distances through inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the low-frequency DOS in liquid water and glycerol confined within graphene oxide membranes. In particular, upon increasing the strength of confinement, we observe a transition from a liquid-like DOS (linear in the frequency $\omega$) to a solid-like behavior (Debye law, $\sim\omega^2$) in the range of $1$-$4$ meV. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm these findings and reveal additional solid-like features, including propagating collective shear waves and a reduction in the self-diffusion constant. Finally, we show that the onset of solid-like dynamics is pushed towards low frequency along with the slowing-down of the relaxation processes upon confinement. This nanoconfinement-induced transition, aligning with k-gap theory, underscores the potential of leveraging liquid nanoconfinement in advancing nanoscale science and technology, building more connections between fluid dynamics and materials engineering.</description>

      <title>A simple electronic ladder model harboring $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parafermions are anyons with the potential for realizing non-local qubits that are resilient to local perturbations. Compared to Majorana zero modes, braiding of parafermions implements an extended set of topologically protected quantum gates. This, however, comes at the price that parafermionic zero modes can not be realized in the absence of strong interactions whose theoretical description is challenging. In the present work, we construct a simple lattice model for interacting spinful electrons with parafermionic zero energy modes. The explicit microscopic nature of the considered model highlights new realization avenues for these exotic excitations in recently fabricated quantum dot arrays. By density matrix renormalization group calculations, we identify a broad range of parameters, with well-localized zero modes, whose parafermionic nature is substantiated by their unique $8\pi$ periodic Josephson spectrum.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Quasiparticles and Topological States of Matter: Finite Density Corrections of the Chiral Anomaly Vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the general structure of the chiral anomaly $AVV/AAA$ and $(LLL, RRR)$ vertices, in the presence of chemical potentials in perturbation theory. The study finds application in anomalous transport, whenever chirally unbalanced matter is present, with propagating external currents that are classically conserved. Examples are topological materials and the chiral magnetic effect in the plasma state of matter of the early universe. We classify the minimal number of form factors of the $AVV$ parameterization, by a complete analysis of the Schouten identities in the presence of a heat bath. We show that the longitudinal (anomaly) sector in the axial-vector channel, for on-shell and off-shell photons, is protected against corrections coming from the insertion of a chemical potential in the fermion loop. When the photons are on-shell, we prove that also the transverse sector, in the same channel, is $\mu$-independent and vanishes. The related effective action is shown to be always described by the exchange of a massless anomaly pole, as in the case of vanishing chemical potentials. The pole is interpreted as an interpolating axion-like quasiparticle generated by the anomaly. In each axial-vector channel, it is predicted to be a correlated fermion/antifermion pseudoscalar (axion-like) quasiparticle appearing in the response function, once the material is subjected to an external chiral perturbation. The cancellation of the $\mu$ dependence extends to any chiral current within the Standard Model, including examples like $B$ (baryon), $L$ (lepton), and $B-L$. This holds true irrespective of whether these currents exhibit anomalies.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the stochastic thermodynamics of micro-magnetic systems. We first formulate the stochastic dynamics of micro-magnetic systems by incorporating noises into Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, which describes the irreversible and deterministic dynamics of magnetic moments. The resulting stochastic Landau-Lifshitz (sLL) equation obeys detailed balance, which guarantees that, with the external field fixed, the system converges to thermodynamic equilibrium with vanishing entropy production and with non-vanishing probability current. We then discuss various thermodynamic variables both at the trajectory level and at the ensemble level, and further establish both the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. Finally, we establish fluctuation theorems, and verify them using numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are a compelling platform for analog quantum simulation due to the precision control, fast operation, and site-resolved readout inherent to the hardware. Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits natively emulate the dynamics of interacting particles according to the Bose-Hubbard model. However, many interesting condensed-matter phenomena emerge only in the presence of electromagnetic fields. Here, we emulate the dynamics of charged particles in an electromagnetic field using a superconducting quantum simulator. We realize a broadly adjustable synthetic magnetic vector potential by applying continuous modulation tones to all qubits. We verify that the synthetic vector potential obeys requisite properties of electromagnetism: a spatially-varying vector potential breaks time-reversal symmetry and generates a gauge-invariant synthetic magnetic field, and a temporally-varying vector potential produces a synthetic electric field. We demonstrate that the Hall effect--the transverse deflection of a charged particle propagating in an electromagnetic field--exists in the presence of the synthetic electromagnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the stochastic dynamics of micro-magnetics interacting with a spin-current torque. We extend the previously constructed stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equation to the case with spin-current torque, and verify the conditions of detailed balance. Then we construct various thermodynamics quantities such as work and heat, and prove the second law of thermodynamics. Due to the existence of spin-torque and the asymmetry of the kinetic matrix, a novel effect of entropy pumping shows up. As a consequence, the system may behave as a heat engine which constantly transforms heat into magnetic work. Finally, we derive a fluctuation theorem for the joint probability density function of the pumped entropy and the total work, and verify it using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Scalable tomography of many-body quantum environments with low temporal entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a complex many-body environment is a ubiquitous problem in quantum science. General non-Markovian environments are characterized by their influence matrix~(IM) -- a multi-time tensor arising from repeated interactions between the system and environment. While complexity of the most generic IM grows exponentially with the evolution time, recent works argued that for many instances of physical many-body environments, the IM is significantly less complex. This is thanks to area-law scaling of temporal entanglement, which quantifies the correlations between the past and the future states of the system. However, efficient classical algorithms for computing IM are only available for non-interacting environments or certain interacting 1D environments. Here, we study a learning algorithm for reconstructing IMs of large many-body environments simulated on a quantum processor. This hybrid algorithm involves experimentally collecting quantum measurement results of auxiliary qubits which are repeatedly coupled to the many-body environment, followed by a classical machine-learning construction of a matrix-product (MPS) representation of the IM. Using the example of 1D spin-chain environments, with a classically generated training dataset, we demonstrate that the algorithm allows scalable reconstruction of IMs for long evolution times. The reconstructed IM can be used to efficiently model quantum transport through an impurity, including cases with multiple leads and time-dependent controls. These results indicate the feasibility of characterizing long-time dynamics of complex environments using a limited number of measurements, under the assumption of a moderate temporal entanglement.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-assisted transport in a tight-binding chain with a linear potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An environment interacting with a quantum system can enhance transport through the suppression of quantum effects responsible for localization. In this paper, we study the interplay between bulk dephasing and a linear potential in a boundary-driven tight-binding chain. A linear potential induces Wannier-Stark localization in the absence of noise, while dephasing induces diffusive transport in the absence of a tilt. We derive an approximate expression for the steady-state current as a function of both dephasing and tilt which closely matches the exact solution for a wide range of parameters. From it, we find that the maximum current occurs for a dephasing rate equal to the period of Bloch oscillations in the Wannier-Stark localized system. We also find that the current displays a maximum as a function of the system size, provided that the total potential tilt across the chain remains constant. Our results can be verified in current experimental platforms and represents a step forward in analytical studies of environment-assisted transport.</description>
