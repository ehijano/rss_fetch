      <title>Incubulable hyperbolic 3-pseudomanifold groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds with totally geodesic boundary, such that the closed 3-pseudomanifolds obtained by coning off the boundary components are negatively curved and contain locally convex subspaces whose fundamental groups have property (T). In particular, the fundamental groups of these 3-pseudomanifolds are word hyperbolic but not cubulable.</description>

      <title>The Effective Ehrenpreis Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ and $N$ be two closed hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. The Ehrenpreis Conjecture (proved by Kahn-Markovic) asserts that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ there are finite covers $M_\epsilon \to M$, and $N_\epsilon \to N$, such that the Teichmuller distance (in the suitable moduli space) between $M_\epsilon$ and $N_\epsilon$ is less than $\epsilon$. It is natural to ask how large the degrees of these coverings need to be to achieve that the distance between $M_\epsilon$ and $N_\epsilon$ is less than $\epsilon$. In this paper we show that there exists a constant $k&gt;0$, depending only on $M$ and $N$, so that the covers $M_\epsilon \to M$, and $N_\epsilon \to N$, can be chosen to have the degrees less than $\epsilon^{-k}$. We show that this bound is optimal by considering the case when $M$ and $N$ are arithmetic Riemann surfaces with the same invariant trace field which are not commensurable to each other.</description>

      <title>Minimal Sets of Involution Generators for Big Mapping Class Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S(n)$, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, be the infinite-type surface of infinite genus with $n$ ends, each of which is accumulated by genus. The mapping class groups of these types of surfaces are not countably generated. However, they are Polish groups, so they can be topologically countably generated. This paper focuses on finding minimal topological generating sets of involutions for $\mathrm{Map}(S(n))$. We establish that for $n \geq 16$, $\mathrm{Map}(S(n))$ can be topologically generated by four involutions. Furthermore, we establish that the the mapping class groups of the Loch Ness Monster surface ($n=1$) and the Jacob's Ladder surface ($n=2$) can be topologically generated by three involutions.</description>

      <title>An extended symmetric union with multiple tangle regions and its Alexander polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The authors recently introduced a new construction of a knot as an extended symmetric union of a knot with a single tangle region. In this paper, we generalize the construction to include multiple tangle regions. The constructed knot $K$ with a partial knot $\hat{K}$ and multiple tangle regions satisfies the following two properties: its Alexander polynomial is the product of the Alexander polynomials of the numerators of these tangles and the square of the Alexander polynomial of the partial knot $\hat{K}$, and there exists a surjective homomorphism from the knot group of $K$ to that of $\hat{K}$ which maps the longitude of $K$ to the trivial element.</description>

      <title>Large-scale geometry of graphs interpolating between curve graphs and pants graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two types of graphs interpolating between the curve graph and the pants graph from the viewpoint of large-scale geometry. One was introduced by Erlandsson and Fanoni, and the other by Mahan Mj. These graphs were developed independently in different contexts. In this paper, we provide explicit formulae for computing their quasi-flat ranks. These formulae depend on the genus and the number of boundary components of the underlying surface, as well as the interpolation parameter. We also classify geometries of the interpolating graphs into the hyperbolic, relatively hyperbolic, and thick cases. Our approach relies on the theory of twist-free graphs of multicurves, which is developed by Vokes and Russel.</description>

Abstract: By modifying a construction of Abe and Tange, we exhibit arbitrarily large families of Lagrangian slice disks with Weinstein deformation equivalent exteriors. This answers a Lagrangian version of a question of Hitt and Sumners. We raise other open questions related to Lagrangian slice disks and their exteriors.</description>

      <title>Valuations on polyhedra and topological arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a classical theme of (general or translation invariant) valuations on convex polyhedra. Our setting generalizes the classical one, in a ``dual'' direction to previously considered generalizations: while previous research was mostly concerned with variations of ground fields/rings, over which the vertices of polytopes are defined, we consider more general collections of defining hyperplanes. No algebraic structures are imposed on these collections. This setting allows us to uncover a close relationship between scissors congruence problems on the one hand and finite hyperplane arrangements on the other hand: there are many parallel results in these fields, for which the parallelism seems to have gone unnoticed. In particular, certain properties of the Varchenko--Gelfand algebras for arrangements translate to properties of polytope rings or valuations. Studying these properties is possible in a general topological setting, that is, in the context of the so-called topological arrangements, where hyperplanes do not have to be straight and may even have nontrivial topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use real algebraic geometry to construct an affine $\Lambda$-building $B$ associated to the $\mathbb{F}$-points of a semisimple algebraic group, where $\mathbb{F}$ is a valued real closed field. We characterize the spherical building at infinity and the local building at a base point. We compute stabilizers of various subsets of $B$ and obtain group decompositions.</description>

      <title>Determining subgroups via stationary measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider random walks on the isometry groups of general metric spaces. Under some mild conditions, we show that if two non-elementary random walks on a discrete subgroup of the isometry group have non-singular stationary measures, then subgroups generated by the random walks are commensurable. This result in particular applies to separable Gromov hyperbolic spaces and Teichm\"uller spaces. As a specific application, we prove singularity between stationary measures associated to random walks on different fiber subgroups of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle.</description>

      <title>Trisections and Lefschetz fibrations with $(-n)$-sections</title>

Abstract: Castro and Ozbagci constructed a trisection of a closed 4-manifold admitting a Lefschetz fibration with a $(-1)$-section such that the corresponding trisection diagram can be explicitly constructed from a monodromy of the Lefschetz fibration. In this paper, for a closed 4-manifold $X$ admitting an achiral Lefschetz fibration with a $(-n)$-section, we construct a trisection of $X \# n\mathbb{C}P^2$ if $n$ is positive and $X \# (-n)\overline{\mathbb{C}P^2}$ if $n$ is negative such that the corresponding trisection diagram can be explicitly constructed from a monodromy of the Lefschetz fibration. We also construct a trisection of the fiber sum of two achiral Lefschetz fibrations with $n$- and $(-n)$-sections such that the corresponding trisection diagram can be explicitly constructed from monodromies of the Lefschetz fibrations.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Wave Functions in Complex Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of wave functions in complex Chern-Simons theory on the complement of a hyperbolic knot, emphasizing the similarities with the topological string/spectral theory correspondence. We first conjecture a hidden integrality structure in the holomorphic blocks and show that this structure guarantees the cancellation of potential singularities in the full non-perturbative wave function at rational values of the coupling constant. We then develop various techniques to determine the wave function at such rational points. Finally, we illustrate our conjectures and obtain explicit results in the examples of the figure-eight and three-twist knots. In the case of the figure-eight knot, we also perform a direct evaluation of the state integral in the rational case and observe that the resulting wave function has the features of the ground state for a quantum mirror curve.</description>

Abstract: We compute the topological monodromy of every family of complete intersection curves. Like in the case of plane curves previously treated by the second-named author, we find the answer is given by the $r$-spin mapping class group associated to the maximal root of the adjoint line bundle. Our main innovation is a suite of tools for studying the monodromy of sections of a tensor product of very ample line bundles in terms of the monodromy of sections of the factors, allowing for an induction on (multi-)degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for two subgroups of a hierarchically hyperbolic group to generate an amalgamated free product over their intersection. The result applies in particular to certain geometric subgroups of mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces, that is, those subgroups coming from the embeddings of closed subsurfaces. In the second half of the paper, we study under which hypotheses our amalgamation procedure preserves several notions of convexity, such as hierarchical quasiconvexity (as introduced by Behrstock, Hagen, and Sisto) and strong quasiconvexity (every quasigeodesic with endpoints on the subset lies in a uniform neighbourhood). This answers a question of Russell, Spriano, and Tran.</description>

      <title>Minimal Simplicial Degree $d$ Maps from Genus $g$ Surfaces to the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The degree of a map between orientable manifolds is a fundamental concept in topology, offering deep insights into the structure of the manifolds and the nature of the corresponding maps. This concept has been extensively studied, particularly in the context of simplicial maps between orientable triangulable spaces. In 1982, Gromov proved that if degree $d$ maps exist from a genus $g$ orientable surface to a genus $h$ orientable surface for every $d \in \mathbb{Z}$, then $h$ must be 0 or 1.
  Recently, degree $d$ self-maps on spheres, particularly on genus 0 surfaces, have been investigated. In this paper, we focus on the unique minimal 7-vertex triangulation of the torus. We construct simplicial degree $d$ maps from a triangulation of a genus $g$ surface to the 7-vertex triangulation of the torus for $g \geq 1$. Our construction of degree $d$ maps is minimal for every $d$ when $g = 1,2$. If $g \geq 3$, then our construction remains minimal for $|d| \geq 2g - 1$.
  We believe that this concept will be highly useful in combinatorial topology, as it leads to several intriguing open research problems. In the final section, we propose some of these open research problems.</description>
