      <title>Designing a Light-based Communication System with a Biomolecular Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems transduce signals from their surroundings in numerous ways. This paper introduces a communication system using the light-gated ion channel Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), which causes an ion current to flow in response to light. Our design includes a ChR2-based receiver along with encoding, modulation techniques and detection. Analyzing the resulting communication system, we discuss the effect of different parameters on the performance of the system. Finally, we discuss its potential design in the context of bio-engineering and light-based communication and show that the data rate scales up with the number of receptors, indicating that high-speed communication may be possible.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design to Dual-Scale Channel Estimation for Sensing-Assisted Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing-assisted communication is critical to enhance the system efficiency in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, most existing literature focuses on large-scale channel sensing, without considering the impacts of small-scale channel aging. In this paper, we investigate a dual-scale channel estimation framework for sensing-assisted communication, where both large-scale channel sensing and small-scale channel aging are considered. By modeling the channel aging effect with block fading and incorporating CRB (Cram\'er-Rao bound)-based sensing errors, we optimize both the time duration of large-scale detection and the frequency of small-scale update within each subframe to maximize the achievable rate while satisfying sensing requirements. Since the formulated optimization problem is non-convex, we propose a two-dimensional search-based optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed optimal design over three counterparts.</description>

      <title>Computing the Low-Weight codewords of Punctured and Shortened Pre-Transformed polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a deterministic algorithm to count the low-weight codewords of punctured and shortened pure and pre-transformed polar codes. The method first evaluates the weight properties of punctured/shortened polar cosets. Then, a method that discards the cosets that have no impact on the computation of the low-weight codewords is introduced. A key advantage of this method is its applicability, regardless of the frozen bit set, puncturing/shortening pattern, or pretransformation. Results confirm the method's efficiency while showing reduced computational complexity compared to stateof-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Covariance-Based Device Activity Detection with Massive MIMO for Near-Field Correlated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the device activity detection problem in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for near-field communications (NFC). In this system, active devices transmit their signature sequences to the base station (BS), which detects the active devices based on the received signal. In this paper, we model the near-field channels as correlated Rician fading channels and formulate the device activity detection problem as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem. Compared to the traditional uncorrelated channel model, the correlation of channels complicates both algorithm design and theoretical analysis of the MLE problem. On the algorithmic side, we propose two computationally efficient algorithms for solving the MLE problem: an exact coordinate descent (CD) algorithm and an inexact CD algorithm. The exact CD algorithm solves the one-dimensional optimization subproblem exactly using matrix eigenvalue decomposition and polynomial root-finding. By approximating the objective function appropriately, the inexact CD algorithm solves the one-dimensional optimization subproblem inexactly with lower complexity and more robust numerical performance. Additionally, we analyze the detection performance of the MLE problem under correlated channels by comparing it with the case of uncorrelated channels. The analysis shows that when the overall number of devices $N$ is large or the signature sequence length $L$ is small, the detection performance of MLE under correlated channels tends to be better than that under uncorrelated channels. Conversely, when $N$ is small or $L$ is large, MLE performs better under uncorrelated channels than under correlated ones. Simulation results demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and verify the correctness of the analysis.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Holographic Beamforming via Dynamic Metasurface Antennas in QoS Guaranteed Power Efficient Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on designing a power-efficient network for Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMAs)-aided multiuser multiple-input single output (MISO) antenna systems. The main objective is to minimize total transmitted power by the DMAs while ensuring a guaranteed signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) for multiple users in downlink beamforming. Unlike conventional MISO systems, which have well-explored beamforming solutions, DMAs require specialized methods due to their unique physical constraints and wavedomain precoding capabilities. To achieve this, optimization algorithms relying on alternating optimization and semi-definite programming, are developed, including spherical-wave channel modelling of near-field communication. The dynamic reconfigurability and holography-based beamforming of metasurface arrays make DMAs promising candidates for power-efficient networks by reducing the need for power-hungry RF chains. On the other hand, the physical constraints on DMA weights and wave-domain precoding of multiple DMA elements through reduced number of RF suppliers can limit the degrees of freedom (DoF) in beamforming optimizations compared to conventional fully digital (FD) architectures. This paper investigates the optimization of downlink beamforming in DMA-aided networks, focusing on power efficiency and addressing these challenges.</description>

      <title>ZipNN: Lossless Compression for AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growth of model sizes and the scale of their deployment, their sheer size burdens the infrastructure requiring more network and more storage to accommodate these. While there is a vast model compression literature deleting parts of the model weights for faster inference, we investigate a more traditional type of compression - one that represents the model in a compact form and is coupled with a decompression algorithm that returns it to its original form and size - namely lossless compression.
  We present ZipNN a lossless compression tailored to neural networks. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that specific lossless compression can gain significant network and storage reduction on popular models, often saving 33% and at times reducing over 50% of the model size. We investigate the source of model compressibility and introduce specialized compression variants tailored for models that further increase the effectiveness of compression. On popular models (e.g. Llama 3) ZipNN shows space savings that are over 17% better than vanilla compression while also improving compression and decompression speeds by 62%. We estimate that these methods could save over an ExaByte per month of network traffic downloaded from a large model hub like Hugging Face.</description>

      <title>Integrated Location Sensing and Communication for Ultra-Massive MIMO With Hybrid-Field Beam-Squint Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of ultra-massive multiple-input-multiple output systems holds great promise for next-generation communications, yet their channels exhibit hybrid far- and near- field beam-squint (HFBS) effect. In this paper, we not only overcome but also harness the HFBS effect to propose an integrated location sensing and communication (ILSC) framework. During the uplink training stage, user terminals (UTs) transmit reference signals for simultaneous channel estimation and location sensing. This stage leverages an elaborately designed hybrid-field projection matrix to overcome the HFBS effect and estimate the channel in compressive manner. Subsequently, the scatterers' locations can be sensed from the spherical wavefront based on the channel estimation results. By treating the sensed scatterers as virtual anchors, we employ a weighted least-squares approach to derive UT' s location. Moreover, we propose an iterative refinement mechanism, which utilizes the accurately estimated time difference of arrival of multipath components to enhance location sensing precision. In the following downlink data transmission stage, we leverage the acquired location information to further optimize the hybrid beamformer, which combines the beam broadening and focusing to mitigate the spectral efficiency degradation resulted from the HFBS effect. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed ILSC scheme has superior location sensing and communication performance than conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Sparse Regression Codes for Integrated Passive Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the base station (BS) passively senses the channel parameters using the information carrying signals from a user. To simultaneously guarantee decoding and sensing performance, the user adopts sparse regression codes (SPARCs) with cyclic redundancy check (CRC) to transmit its information bits. The BS generates an initial coarse channel estimation of the parameters after receiving the pilot signal. Then, a novel iterative decoding and parameter sensing algorithm is proposed, where the correctly decoded codewords indicated by the CRC bits are utilized to improve the sensing and channel estimation performance at the BS. In turn, the improved estimate of the channel parameters lead to a better decoding performance. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed iterative decoding and sensing algorithm, where both the sensing and the communication performance are significantly improved with a few iterations. Extensive ablation studies concerning different channel estimation methods and number of CRC bits are carried out for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Semantic Security with Infinite Dimensional Quantum Eavesdropping Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new proof method for direct coding theorems for wiretap channels where the eavesdropper has access to a quantum version of the transmitted signal on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and the legitimate parties communicate through a classical channel or a classical input, quantum output (cq) channel. The transmitter input can be subject to an additive cost constraint, which specializes to the case of an average energy constraint. This method yields errors that decay exponentially with increasing block lengths. Moreover, it provides a guarantee of a quantum version of semantic security, which is an established concept in classical cryptography and physical layer security. Therefore, it complements existing works which either do not prove the exponential error decay or use weaker notions of security. The main part of this proof method is a direct coding result on channel resolvability which states that there is only a doubly exponentially small probability that a standard random codebook does not solve the channel resolvability problem for the cq channel. Semantic security has strong operational implications meaning essentially that the eavesdropper cannot use its quantum observation to gather any meaningful information about the transmitted signal. We also discuss the connections between semantic security and various other established notions of secrecy.</description>

      <title>Maximum Length RLL Sequences in de Bruijn Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-space quantum key distribution requires to synchronize the transmitted and received signals. A timing and synchronization system for this purpose based on a de Bruijn sequence has been proposed and studied recently for a channel associated with quantum communication that requires reliable synchronization. To avoid a long period of no-pulse in such a system on-off pulses are used to simulate a \emph{zero} and on-on pulses are used to simulate a \emph{one}. However, these sequences have high redundancy and low rate. To reduce the redundancy and increase the rate, run-length limited sequences in the de Bruijn graph are proposed for the same purpose. The maximum length of such sequences in the de Bruijn graph is studied and an efficient algorithm to construct a large set of these sequences is presented. Based on known algorithms and enumeration methods, maximum length sequence for which the position of each window can be computed efficiently is presented and an enumeration on the number of such sequences is given.</description>

      <title>Towards the limits: Sensing Capability Measurement for ISAC Through Channel Encoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 6G technology offers a broader range of possibilities for communication systems to perform ubiquitous sensing tasks, including health monitoring, object recognition, and autonomous driving. Since even minor environmental changes can significantly degrade system performance, and conducting long-term posterior experimental evaluations in all scenarios is often infeasible, it is crucial to perform a priori performance assessments to design robust and reliable systems. In this paper, we consider a discrete ubiquitous sensing system where the sensing target has \(m\) different states \(W\), which can be characterized by \(n\)-dimensional independent features \(X^n\). This model not only provides the possibility of optimizing the sensing systems at a finer granularity and balancing communication and sensing resources, but also provides theoretical explanations for classical intuitive feelings (like more modalities and more accuracy) in wireless sensing. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel model through real-case studies, including person identification, displacement detection, direction estimation, and device recognition. The evaluation results indicate a Pearson correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9 between our task mutual information and conventional experimental metrics (e.g., accuracy).</description>

      <title>A High-Performance List Decoding Algorithm for Surface Codes with Erroneous Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) are necessary for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Surface codes are a class of topological QECCs that have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional error-correcting capabilities and easy implementation. In the decoding process of surface codes, the syndromes are crucial for error correction, however, they are not always correctly measured. Most of the existing decoding algorithms for surface codes need extra measurements to correct syndromes with errors, which implies a potential increase in inference complexity and decoding latency. In this paper, we propose a high-performance list decoding algorithm for surface codes with erroneous syndromes, where syndrome soft information is incorporated in the decoding, allowing qubits and syndrome to be recovered without needing extra measurements. Precisely, we first use belief propagation (BP) decoding for pre-processing with syndrome soft information, followed by ordered statistics decoding (OSD) for post-processing to list and recover both qubits and syndromes. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm efficiently recovers erroneous syndromes and significantly improves the decoding performance of surface codes with erroneous syndromes compared to minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM), BP and original BP-OSD algorithms.</description>

      <title>What Roles can Spatial Modulation and Space Shift Keying Play in LEO Satellite-Assisted Communication?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17553v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of satellite communications play a pivotal role in addressing the ever-increasing demand for global connectivity, among which the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites attract a great amount of attention due to their low latency and high data throughput capabilities. Based on this, we explore spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) designs as pivotal techniques to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance in the LEO satellite-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The various performance analysis of these designs are presented in this paper, revealing insightful findings and conclusions through analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the merits and trade-offs associated with the investigated schemes, particularly in terms of BER, computational complexity, and SE. This analysis underscores the potential of both schemes as viable candidates for future 6G LEO satellite-assisted wireless communication systems.</description>

Abstract: Obtaining an accurate estimate of the underlying covariance matrix from finite sample size data is challenging due to sample size noise. In recent years, sophisticated covariance-cleaning techniques based on random matrix theory have been proposed to address this issue. Most of these methods aim to achieve an optimal covariance matrix estimator by minimizing the Frobenius norm distance as a measure of the discrepancy between the true covariance matrix and the estimator. However, this practice offers limited interpretability in terms of information theory. To better understand this relationship, we focus on the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the information lost by the estimator. Our analysis centers on rotationally invariant estimators, which are state-of-art in random matrix theory, and we derive an analytical expression for their Kullback-Leibler divergence. Due to the intricate nature of the calculations, we use genetic programming regressors paired with human intuition. Ultimately, using this approach, we formulate a conjecture validated through extensive simulations, showing that the Frobenius distance corresponds to a first-order expansion term of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, thus establishing a more defined link between the two measures.</description>

      <title>Process-and-Forward: Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding Over Cooperative Relay Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) schemes for image transmission over cooperative relay channels. The relay either amplifies-and-forwards its received signal, called DeepJSCC-AF, or leverages neural networks to extract relevant features from its received signal, called DeepJSCC-PF (Process-and-Forward). We consider both half- and full-duplex relays, and propose a novel transformer-based model at the relay. For a half-duplex relay, it is shown that the proposed scheme learns to generate correlated signals at the relay and source to obtain beamforming gains. In the full-duplex case, we introduce a novel block-based transmission strategy, in which the source transmits in blocks, and the relay updates its knowledge about the input signal after each block and generates its own signal. To enhance practicality, a single transformer-based model is used at the relay at each block, together with an adaptive transmission module, which allows the model to seamlessly adapt to different channel qualities and the transmission powers}. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of DeepJSCC-PF compared to the state-of-the-art BPG image compression algorithm operating at the maximum achievable rate of conventional decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward protocols, in both half- and full-duplex relay scenarios over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels.</description>

      <title>Shift-invariant functions and almost liftings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate shift-invariant vectorial Boolean functions on $n$ bits that are induced from Boolean functions on $k$ bits, for $k\leq n$. We consider such functions that are not necessarily permutations, but are, in some sense, almost bijective, and their cryptographic properties. In this context, we define an almost lifting as a Boolean function for which there is an upper bound on the number of collisions of its induced functions that does not depend on $n$. We show that if a Boolean function with diameter $k$ is an almost lifting, then the maximum number of collisions of its induced functions is $2^{k-1}$ for any $n$. Moreover, we search for functions in the class of almost liftings that have good cryptographic properties and for which the non-bijectivity does not cause major security weaknesses. These functions generalize the well-known map $\chi$ used in the Keccak hash function.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Refinement Protocols for Distributed Distribution Estimation under $\ell^p$-Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the communication-constrained estimation of discrete distributions under $\ell^p$ losses, where each distributed terminal holds multiple independent samples and uses limited number of bits to describe the samples. We obtain the minimax optimal rates of the problem in most parameter regimes. An elbow effect of the optimal rates at $p=2$ is clearly identified. To show the optimal rates, we first design estimation protocols to achieve them. The key ingredient of these protocols is to introduce adaptive refinement mechanisms, which first generate rough estimate by partial information and then establish refined estimate in subsequent steps guided by the rough estimate. The protocols leverage successive refinement, sample compression, thresholding and random hashing methods to achieve the optimal rates in different parameter regimes. The optimality of the protocols is shown by deriving compatible minimax lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Geometric Partition Entropy for the Estimation of Mutual Information in the Presence of Informative Outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent introduction of geometric partition entropy brought a new viewpoint to non-parametric entropy quantification that incorporated the impacts of informative outliers, but its original formulation was limited to the context of a one-dimensional state space. A generalized definition of geometric partition entropy is now provided for samples within a bounded (finite measure) region of a d-dimensional vector space. The basic definition invokes the concept of a Voronoi diagram, but the computational complexity and reliability of Voronoi diagrams in high dimension make estimation by direct theoretical computation unreasonable. This leads to the development of approximation schemes that enable estimation that is faster than current methods by orders of magnitude. The partition intersection ($\pi$) approximation, in particular, enables direct estimates of marginal entropy in any context resulting in an efficient and versatile mutual information estimator. This new measure-based paradigm for data driven information theory allows flexibility in the incorporation of geometry to vary the representation of outlier impact, which leads to a significant broadening in the applicability of established entropy-based concepts. The incorporation of informative outliers is illustrated through analysis of transient dynamics in the synchronization of coupled chaotic dynamical systems.</description>
