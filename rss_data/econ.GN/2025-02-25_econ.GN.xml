      <title>Carbon financial system construction under the background of dual-carbon targets: current situation, problems and suggestions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the guidance of the dual-carbon target, the development of the carbon financial system is of great significance to compensate for the gap between green and low-carbon investment. Considering the current state of the development of carbon financial system, China has initially formed a carbon financial system, including participants, carbon financial products and macro and micro operation structures, but the system is still in the initial development stage. Given the current restrictions on the development of carbon finance, it can be seen that there are still problems such as unreasonable economic structure, insufficient market construction, single product category, low utilization rate and urgent construction of relevant judicial guarantee system. Therefore, the system should be improved at the economic level and the legal level. The economic level includes adjusting the layout of economic development structure, strengthening the construction of market infrastructure, encouraging the diversification of carbon financial products and strengthening publicity and education promotion strategies. The legal level includes improving the top-level design, formulating judicial interpretation to promote carbon financial trading, promoting commercial law amendment, and promoting the linkage mechanism between specialized environmental justice and carbon finance and other safeguard measures. Finally, improving the carbon finance system is required to promote and protect the orderly development of carbon finance. To promote the reform of the pattern of economic development, the concept of ecological and environmental protection in the financial sector needs to be implemented to form an overall pattern of pollution reduction, carbon reduction and synergistic efficiency improvement.</description>

      <title>Sticky information and price controls: Evidence from a natural experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the predictions of the sticky information model using a survey dataset by comparing shoppers accuracy in recalling the prices of regulated and comparable unregulated products. Because regulated product prices are capped, they are sold more than comparable unregulated products, while their prices change less frequently and vary less across stores and between brands, than the prices of comparable unregulated products. Therefore, shoppers would be expected to recall the regulated product prices more accurately. However, we find that shoppers are better at recalling the prices of unregulated products, in line with the sticky information model which predicts that shoppers will be more attentive to prices that change more frequently.</description>

      <title>De facto Openness to Immigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various factors influence why some countries are more open to immigration than others. Policy is only one of them. We design country-specific measures of openness to immigration that aim to capture de facto levels of openness to immigration, complementing existing de jure measures of immigration, based on enacted immigration laws and policy measures. We estimate these for 148 countries and three years (2000, 2010, and 2020). For a subset of countries, we also distinguish between openness towards tertiary-educated migrants and less than tertiary-educated migrants. Using the measures, we show that most places in the World today are closed to immigration, and a few regions are very open. The World became more open in the first decade of the millennium, an opening mainly driven by the Western World and the Gulf countries. Moreover, we show that other factors equal, countries that increased their openness to immigration, reduced their old-age dependency ratios, and experienced slower real wage growth, arguably a sign of relaxing labor and skill shortages.</description>

      <title>Democracy Tribal Core Electoral Competition, Institutions, and Networks Entrenching Identity Politics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Democracy prioritizes deliberation and equality, yet electoral competition, institutional rules, and digital networks consistently elevate group identities over policy agendas. This paper posits tribalism as an inherent democratic feature, integrating social identity theory, institutionalism, and network analysis. Patterns across diverse contexts illustrate this racial voting persists in the United States, caste/religious blocs define India elections, ethnic coalitions shape Kenya outcomes, and racial divides mark Brazil contests. These examples, drawn from election data and surveys, show how group affiliations, institutional advantages, and digital amplification sustain identity politics. Challenging modernization and deliberative theories, this framework reveals tribalism structural role, advocating identity-conscious designs like vote pooling to balance representation and equity. It reframes democratic legitimacy, emphasizing group dynamics over neutrality, and contributes a comparative lens to political science understanding of democratic governance across varied settings.</description>

      <title>Bounded Foresight Equilibrium in Large Dynamic Economies with Heterogeneous Agents and Aggregate Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large dynamic economies with heterogeneous agents and aggregate shocks are central to many important applications, yet their equilibrium analysis remains computationally challenging. This is because the standard solution approach, rational expectations equilibria require agents to predict the evolution of the full cross-sectional distribution of state variables, leading to an extreme curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we introduce a novel equilibrium concept, N-Bounded Foresight Equilibrium (N-BFE), and establish its existence under mild conditions. In N-BFE, agents optimize over an infinite horizon but form expectations about key economic variables only for the next N periods. Beyond this horizon, they assume that economic variables remain constant and use a predetermined continuation value. This equilibrium notion reduces computational complexity and draws a direct parallel to lookahead policies in reinforcement learning, where agents make near-term calculations while relying on approximate valuations beyond a computationally feasible horizon. At the same time, it lowers cognitive demands on agents while better aligning with the behavioral literature by incorporating time inconsistency and limited attention, all while preserving desired forward-looking behavior and ensuring that agents still respond to policy changes. Importantly, in N-BFE equilibria, forecast errors arise endogenously. We measure the foresight errors for different foresight horizons and show that foresight significantly influences the variation in endogenous equilibrium variables, distinguishing our findings from traditional risk aversion or precautionary savings channels. This variation arises from a feedback mechanism between individual decision-making and equilibrium variables, where increased foresight induces greater non-stationarity in agents' decisions and, consequently, in economic variables.</description>

      <title>Determinants of the Spousal Age Gap in India: Analysis of Indian Microdata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the determinants of the spousal age gap (SAG) in India, utilizing data from the 61st and 68th rounds of the National Sample Survey (NSSO). We employ regression analysis, including instrumental variables, to address selection bias and account for unobservable factors. We hypothesize an inverted U-shaped relationship between educational assortative mating and SAG, where, keeping the husband's education constant at the graduation level, the SAG first widens and then narrows as the wife's education level increases from primary to postgraduate. This pattern is shaped by distinct socio-economic factors across rural and urban settings. In rural India, increasing prosperity, changes in family structure, and educational hypergamy contribute to a wider age gap, with the influence of bride squeeze further exacerbating this disparity. Conversely, in urban areas, while the growth of white-collar jobs initially contributed to a narrowing of the SAG in 2004-05, this trend did not persist by 2011-12. Specifically, the influence of income on SAG becomes nonlinear, showing declining trends beyond the 7th income quantile, reflecting limited marriage mobility opportunities for females and hinting at a possible threat to the institution of marriage among the urban upper class. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide empirical evidence on how specific social, economic, and cultural dynamics influence the spousal age gap in Indian society. This increasing and persistent spousal age gap has significant implications for the treatment of women, power dynamics, and violence within marriage.</description>

      <title>Real-time Monitoring of Economic Shocks using Company Websites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the effects of economic shocks on firms is critical for analyzing economic growth and resilience. We introduce a Web-Based Affectedness Indicator (WAI), a general-purpose tool for real-time monitoring of economic disruptions across diverse contexts. By leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) assisted classification and information extraction on texts from over five million company websites, WAI quantifies the degree and nature of firms' responses to external shocks. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a specific application, we show that WAI is highly correlated with pandemic containment measures and reliably predicts firm performance. Unlike traditional data sources, WAI provides timely firm-level information across industries and geographies worldwide that would otherwise be unavailable due to institutional and data availability constraints. This methodology offers significant potential for monitoring and mitigating the impact of technological, political, financial, health or environmental crises, and represents a transformative tool for adaptive policy-making and economic resilience.</description>

      <title>Grounded Persuasive Language Generation for Automated Marketing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of persuasive and grounded marketing content, using real estate listing descriptions as our focal application domain. Our method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while highlighting useful factual attributes. This agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module, mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized features. We conduct systematic human-subject experiments in the domain of real estate marketing, with a focus group of potential house buyers. The results demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are preferred over those written by human experts by a clear margin. Our findings suggest a promising LLM-based agentic framework to automate large-scale targeted marketing while ensuring responsible generation using only facts.</description>

      <title>A Multi-LLM-Agent-Based Framework for Economic and Public Policy Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper pioneers a novel approach to economic and public policy analysis by leveraging multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) as heterogeneous artificial economic agents. We first evaluate five LLMs' economic decision-making capabilities in solving two-period consumption allocation problems under two distinct scenarios: with explicit utility functions and based on intuitive reasoning. While previous research has often simulated heterogeneity by solely varying prompts, our approach harnesses the inherent variations in analytical capabilities across different LLMs to model agents with diverse cognitive traits. Building on these findings, we construct a Multi-LLM-Agent-Based (MLAB) framework by mapping these LLMs to specific educational groups and corresponding income brackets. Using interest-income taxation as a case study, we demonstrate how the MLAB framework can simulate policy impacts across heterogeneous agents, offering a promising new direction for economic and public policy analysis by leveraging LLMs' human-like reasoning capabilities and computational power.</description>

      <title>A data-driven econo-financial stress-testing framework to estimate the effect of supply chain networks on financial systemic risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supply chain disruptions constitute an often underestimated risk for financial stability. As in financial networks, systemic risks in production networks arises when the local failure of one firm impacts the production of others and might trigger cascading disruptions that affect significant parts of the economy. Here, we study how systemic risk in production networks translates into financial systemic risk through a mechanism where supply chain contagion leads to correlated bank-firm loan defaults. We propose a financial stress-testing framework for micro- and macro-prudential applications that features a national firm level supply chain network in combination with interbank network layers. The model is calibrated by using a unique data set including about 1 million firm-level supply links, practically all bank-firm loans, and all interbank loans in a small European economy. As a showcase we implement a real COVID-19 shock scenario on the firm level. This model allows us to study how the disruption dynamics in the real economy can lead to interbank solvency contagion dynamics. We estimate to what extent this amplifies financial systemic risk. We discuss the relative importance of these contagion channels and find an increase of interbank contagion by 70% when production network contagion is present. We then examine the financial systemic risk firms bring to banks and find an increase of up to 28% in the presence of the interbank contagion channel. This framework is the first financial systemic risk model to take agent-level dynamics of the production network and shocks of the real economy into account which opens a path for directly, and event-driven understanding of the dynamical interaction between the real economy and financial systems.</description>

      <title>Trade-Offs Between Ranking Objectives: Reduced-Form Evidence and Structural Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16408v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online retailers and platforms typically present alternatives using ranked product lists. By adjusting the ranking, these platforms influence consumers' choices and, in turn, conversions, platform revenues, and consumer welfare. In this paper, I study the trade-offs between ranking algorithms that target these different objectives. First, I highlight and provide reduced-form evidence for a key factor shaping these trade-offs: cross-product heterogeneity in position effects. To quantify the effects of different rankings, I then develop an empirical framework based on the search and discovery model of Greminger (2022). For this framework, I show that the ranking that maximizes conversions also maximizes consumer welfare, implying no trade-off between these two objectives. Moreover, I develop and test a heuristic ranking algorithm to maximize revenues. Finally, I estimate the model and compare the effects of the rankings developed for the different objectives. The results highlight the effectiveness of the different rankings and reveal that the proposed heuristic to maximize revenues also increases consumer welfare, suggesting that the trade-off between revenue maximization and consumer welfare also is limited.</description>

      <title>How Periodic Forecast Updates Influence MRP Planning Parameters: A Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many supply chains, the current efforts at digitalization have led to improved information exchanges between manufacturers and their customers. Specifically, demand forecasts are often provided by the customers and regularly updated as the related customer information improves. In this paper, we investigate the influence of forecast updates on the production planning method of Material Requirements Planning (MRP). A simulation study was carried out to assess how updates in information affect the setting of planning parameters in a rolling horizon MRP planned production system. An intuitive result is that information updates lead to disturbances in the production orders for the MRP standard, and, therefore, an extension for MRP to mitigate these effects is developed. A large numerical simulation experiment shows that the MRP safety stock exploitation heuristic, that has been developed, leads to significantly improved results as far as inventory and backorder costs are concerned. An interesting result is that the fixed-order-quantity lotsizing policy performs - in most instances - better than the fixed-order-period lotsizing policy, when periodic forecast updates occur. In addition, the simulation study shows that underestimating demand is marginally more costly than overestimating it, based on the comparative analysis of all instances. Furthermore, the results indicate that the MRP safety stock exploitation heuristic can mitigate the negative effects of biased forecasts.</description>

      <title>Learning to Import through Production Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using administrative data on the universe of inter-firm transactions in Spain, we show that firms learn to import from their domestic suppliers and customers. Our identification strategy exploits the panel structure of the data, the firm-time variation across import origins, and the network structure. We find evidence of both upstream and downstream network effects, even after accounting for sectoral and spatial spillovers. We estimate that an increase of 10 percentage points in the share of suppliers (customers) that are importing from a given region increases the probability of starting importing from that region by 10.7\% (19.2\%). Connections with geographically distant domestic firms provide more useful information to start importing. Larger firms are more responsive to this information but less likely to disseminate it.</description>

      <title>Data Analysis of Decision Support for Sustainable Welfare in The Presence of GDP Threshold Effects: A Case Study of Interactive Data Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09711v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy usage and GDP have been the subject of numerous studies over the past decades. It has been overlooked by previous studies that energy consumption correlates with economic growth in relation to GDP. This study uses threshold regression and Granger causality testing to identify GDP-dependent causality in ten OECD countries over the last 10 years. There is a significant correlation between economic growth and energy consumption. Energy consumption and short-term economic growth are statistically significantly correlated. There is a significant positive effect of energy consumption (EC) on GDP in the short run below the threshold of $10,936 USD since the coefficient is 3.34 and the p-value is 0.0252. There is a -0.0127 correlation coefficient and a 0.0327 p-value associated with GDP Granger-cause EC over the long run. EC and GDP are not causally related for GDP per capita above $10,936 USD. In the long run, GDP Granger causes EC with a coefficient of -0.1638 and a p-value of 0.0675. According to the study, sustainable development requires sustainable use of natural resources, technological investment, foreign direct investment, and gross fixed capital formation. Economic growth can be boosted while adhering to sustainability goals by implementing these recommendations.</description>

      <title>NGO Activism: Exposure vs. Influence</title>

Abstract: We analyze the timing of NGO campaigns to shed light on NGOs' strategies and how they evolve over time. Data from 2,500 campaigns show that NGOs are six times more likely to launch campaigns on their target's Annual General Meeting (AGM) date. Although this strategy increases media exposure and stakeholder scrutiny, resulting in consumer backlash and related shareholder proposals at the following AGM of the targeted firm, it has no impact on current AGM votes. As NGOs build reputational capital, they adjust their timing to influence AGM votes, revealing the trade-offs they face to drive corporate change.</description>

      <title>A Sustainable Circular Framework for Financing Infrastructure Climate Adaptation: Integrated Carbon Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08004</link>

Abstract: Climate physical risks pose an increasing threat to urban infrastructure, necessitating urgent climate adaptation measures to protect lives and assets. Implementing such measures, including the development of resilient infrastructure and retrofitting existing systems, demands substantial financial investment. Unfortunately, due to the unprofitability stemming from the long-term returns, uncertainty, and complexity of infrastructure adaptation projects and the short-term profit-seeking objectives of private capital, a massive financial gap remains. This study suggests incentivizing private capital to bridge financial gaps through integrated carbon markets. Specifically, the framework combines carbon taxes and carbon markets to involve infrastructure and individuals in the climate mitigation phase, using the funds collected for climate adaptation. Moreover, it integrates lifestyle reformation, environmental mitigation, and infrastructure adaptation to establish harmonized standards and provide circular positive feedback to sustain the markets. We further explore how integrated carbon markets can facilitate fund collection and discuss the challenges of incorporating them into infrastructure climate adaptation. This study aims to foster collaboration between private and public capital to enable a more scientific, rational, and actionable implementation of integrated carbon markets, thus supporting sustainable financial backing for infrastructure climate adaptation</description>

      <title>Words or Numbers? How Framing Uncertainties Affects Risk Assessment and Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The communication of uncertainties needs to be as precise as possible to enable the receiver of risk-messages to adapt their behavior appropriately. However, the communication of uncertainties comes with its own set of challenges as most senders prefer to communicate uncertainty through verbal probability phrases (e.g., likely) - a communication form characterized by its ambiguity and (framed) directionality. While it is well known that receivers often do not translate such phrases into the numerical probability intended by the sender, it is less clear how this discrepancy influences subsequent behavioral actions. By implementing a laboratory experiment, we show that individuals value uncertain options with medium to high likelihoods significantly lower when uncertainty is communicated verbally rather than numerically. This effect may lead to less rational decisions under verbal communication, particularly at high likelihoods. Those results remain consistent even if individuals translate verbal uncertainty correctly into the associate numerical uncertainty, implying that a biased behavioral response is not only induced by mistranslations. Instead, ambiguity about the exact meaning of a verbal phrase interferes with decision-making even beyond mere mistranslations. These findings tie in with previous research on ambiguity aversion, which has predominantly operationalized ambiguity through numerical ranges rather than verbal phrases. We conclude that managers and firms should carefully consider the impact of uncertainty framing on employees' decision-making and customer purchasing behavior, opting for numerical probabilities when possible.</description>
