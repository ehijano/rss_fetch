      <title>Quantum law of large numbers for Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random operators $\Omega \to \mathcal{L}(\ell_p, \ell_p)$ for some $1 \leqslant p &lt; \infty$. The law of large numbers is known in the case $p=2$ in the form of usual law of large numbers. Instead of sum of i.i.d. variables there may be considered the composition of random semigroups $e^{A_i t/n}$. We obtain the law of large numbers for the case $p \leqslant 2$.</description>

      <title>Moments of Characteristic Polynomials of Non-Symmetric Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the moments of the absolute characteristic polynomial of the real elliptic ensemble, including the case of the real Ginibre ensemble. We obtain asymptotics for all integral moments inside the real bulk to order 1 + o(1). In particular, for the real Ginibre ensemble, this extends known computations for even moments, and confirms a recent conjecture of Serebryakov and Simm [48] in the integral case. For the elliptic case, this generalizes computations of first two moments by Fyodorov [25] and Fyodorov and Tarnowski [31]. We additionally find uniform asymptotics for the multi-point correlations of the absolute characteristic polynomial. Our proof relies on a relation between expectations for the absolute characteristic polynomial and the real correlation functions, as well as an algebraic method of obtaining asymptotics for the behavior of these correlation functions near the diagonal.</description>

      <title>The structure of entrance and exit at infinity for time-changed L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the behaviour of Markov processes at boundary points of the state space has a long history, dating back all the way to William Feller. With different motivations in mind entrance and exit questions have been explored for different discontinuous Markov processes in the past two decades. Proofs often use time-change techniques and rely on problem specific knowledge such branching or scaling properties. In this article we ask how far techniques can be pushed with as little as possible model assumptions. We give sharp conditions on time-changed L\'evy processes to allow entrance and regular boundary point at infinity. The main tool we introduce is a generalised scaling property that holds for all time-changed L\'evy processes and can be used to extend scaling arguments for self-similar Markov processes.</description>

      <title>General Airy-type equations, heat-type equations and pseudo-processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of higher-order Airy-type differential equations providing the explicit form of the solutions, deriving their power series expansions and a probabilistic interpretation. Under suitable convergence hypotheses, we compute their integral on the real line and, by means of complex integration, we provide alternative explicit forms. We then focus on the differential equations governing their derivatives, their products, their convolutions and higher-order Scorer type equations. Then, we study higher-order heat-type fractional Cauchy, showing that their fundamental solutions can be expressed in terms of Airy-type functions and their convolutions, recovering as special cases several results of appeared in previous papers. Furthermore, pseudo-processes theory permits us to give nice interpretations of the results, extending them in the case of equations involving different fractional operators and study the moments of the solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of the propagation of convexity by semi-groups of stochastic differential equations and convex comparison between the distributions of solutions of two such equations, we study the comparison for the convex order between a Gaussian distribution and a Gaussian mixture. We give and discuss intrinsic necessary and sufficient conditions for convex ordering. On the examples that we have worked out, the two conditions appear to be closely related.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare a mean-field Gibbs distribution on a finite state space on $N$ spins to that of an explicit simple mixture of product measures. This illustrates the situation beyond the so-called increasing propagation of chaos introduced by Ben Arous and Zeitouni 1999, where marginal distributions of size $k=o(N)$ are compared to product measures.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing in a hydrodynamic pilot--wave theory with singular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct an analysis of a stochastic hydrodynamic pilot-wave theory, which is a Langevin equation with a memory kernel that describes the dynamics of a walking droplet (or "walker") subjected to a repulsive singular potential and random perturbations through additive Gaussian noise. Under suitable assumptions on the singularities, we show that the walker dynamics is exponentially attracted toward the unique invariant probability measure. The proof relies on a combination of the Lyapunov technique and an asymptotic coupling specifically tailored to our setting. We also present examples of invariant measures, as obtained from numerical simulations of the walker in two-dimensional Coulomb potentials. Our results extend previous work on the ergodicity of stochastic pilot-wave dynamics established for smooth confining potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of the mesoscopic fluctuations of certain orthogonal polynomial ensembles on the real line utilizing the recurrence relation of the associated orthogonal polynomials. We prove that under a sparse enough decaying perturbation of the recurrence coefficients the limiting distribution is stable. As a corollary we prove a mesoscopic central limit theorem (at any scale) for a family of singular continuous measures on $[-2,2]$.</description>

      <title>Correction to Doi type models for suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from microscopic $N$ particle systems, we study the derivation of Doi type models for suspensions of non-spherical particles in Stokes flows. While Doi models accurately describe the effective evolution of the spatial particle density to the first order in the particle volume fraction, this accuracy fails regarding the evolution of the particle orientations. We rigorously attribute this failure to the singular interaction of the particles via a $-3$-homogeneous kernel. In the situation that the particles are initially distributed according to a stationary ergodic point process, we identify the limit of this singular interaction term. It consists of two parts. The first corresponds to a classical term in Doi type models. The second new term depends on the (microscopic) $2$-point correlation of the point process. By including this term, we provide a modification of the Doi model that is accurate to first order in the particle volume fraction.</description>

      <title>A Generalization Result for Convergence in Learning-to-Optimize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convergence in learning-to-optimize is hardly studied, because conventional convergence guarantees in optimization are based on geometric arguments, which cannot be applied easily to learned algorithms. Thus, we develop a probabilistic framework that resembles deterministic optimization and allows for transferring geometric arguments into learning-to-optimize. Our main theorem is a generalization result for parametric classes of potentially non-smooth, non-convex loss functions and establishes the convergence of learned optimization algorithms to stationary points with high probability. This can be seen as a statistical counterpart to the use of geometric safeguards to ensure convergence. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to prove convergence of optimization algorithms in such a probabilistic framework.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time persuasion by filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We frame dynamic persuasion in a partial observation stochastic control game with an ergodic criterion. The Receiver controls the dynamics of a multidimensional unobserved state process. Information is provided to the Receiver through a device designed by the Sender that generates the observation process. The commitment of the Sender is enforced. We develop this approach in the case where all dynamics are linear and the preferences of the Receiver are linear-quadratic. We prove a verification theorem for the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the HJB equation satisfied by the Receiver's value function. An extension to the case of persuasion of a mean field of interacting Receivers is also provided. We illustrate this approach in two applications: the provision of information to electricity consumers with a smart meter designed by an electricity producer; the information provided by carbon footprint accounting rules to companies engaged in a best-in-class emissions reduction effort. In the first application, we link the benefits of information provision to the mispricing of electricity production. In the latter, we show that when firms declare a high level of best-in-class target, the information provided by stringent accounting rules offsets the Nash equilibrium effect that leads firms to increase pollution to make their target easier to achieve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantitative direct method of proving the local stability for the trivial solution of a rough differential equation and of its regular discretization scheme. Using Doss-Sussmann technique and stopping time analysis, we prove that the trivial solution of the rough system is exponentially stable as long as the noise is small. The same conclusions hold for the regular discretization scheme with small noise and small step size. Our results are significantly stronger than \cite[Theorem 14]{garrido-atienzaetal} and \cite[Theorem 18]{GABSch18} and can be applied to non-flat bounded or linear noises.</description>

Abstract: We consider two Hamiltonians that are close to each other, $H_1 \approx H_2 $, and analyze the time-decay of the corresponding Loschmidt echo $\mathfrak{M}(t) := |\langle \psi_0, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} t H_2} \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} t H_1} \psi_0 \rangle|^2$ that expresses the effect of an imperfect time reversal on the initial state $\psi_0$. Our model Hamiltonians are deformed Wigner matrices that do not share a common eigenbasis. The main tools for our results are two-resolvent laws for such $H_1$ and $H_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.00358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a one-dimensional jump-type Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process driven by a Brownian motion and a subordinator, whose growth rate is an unknown parameter. Considering the process observed continuously or discretely at high frequency, we derive the local asymptotic properties for the growth rate in both ergodic and non-ergodic cases. Local asymptotic normality (LAN) is proved in the subcritical case, local asymptotic quadraticity (LAQ) is derived in the critical case, and local asymptotic mixed normality (LAMN) is shown in the supercritical case. To obtain these results, techniques of Malliavin calculus and a subtle analysis on the jump structure of the subordinator involving the amplitude of jumps and number of jumps are essentially used.</description>

      <title>Precise large deviations of some risk objectives related to the net loss process in two nonstandard risk models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For two nonstandard renewal risk models, we investigate the precise large deviations of the finite-time ruin probability and a random sum of the net-loss process, and the asymptotics of the random-time ruin probability. Notably, in one of these models, claim sizes series and claim interval time series are allowed to be arbitrarily dependent. Subsequently, we apply these results to obtain precise large deviations of proportional-net-loss process and excess-of-net-loss process, as well as asymptotic estimates of the mean of stop-net-loss reinsurance treaty. These results all involve the income items of the risk model, which are relatively rare in the existing references.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for an obstacle problem with T-monotone operator and multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the large deviation principle (LDP) for obstacle problems governed by a T-monotone operator and small multiplicative stochastic reaction. Our approach relies on a combination of new sufficient condition to prove LDP by Matoussi, Sabbagh and Zhang [Appl. Math. Optim. 2021] and Lewy-Stampacchia inequalities to manage the Lagrange-multiplier associated with the obstacle.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the cluster size distribution for the random current measure on the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the percolation configuration arising from the random current representation of the near-critical Ising model on the complete graph. We compute the scaling limit of the cluster size distribution for an arbitrary set of sources in the single and the double current measures. As a byproduct, we compute the tangling probabilities recently introduced by Gunaratnam, Panagiotis, Panis, and Severo in [GPPS22]. This provides a new perspective on the switching lemma for the $\varphi^4$ model introduced in the same paper: in the Gaussian limit we recover Wick's law, while in the Ising limit we recover the corresponding tool for the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Taming the Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithm -- the superlinear case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in stochastic optimization have yielded the interacting particle Langevin algorithm (IPLA), which leverages the notion of interacting particle systems (IPS) to efficiently sample from approximate posterior densities. This becomes particularly crucial in relation to the framework of Expectation-Maximization (EM), where the E-step is computationally challenging or even intractable. Although prior research has focused on scenarios involving convex cases with gradients of log densities that grow at most linearly, our work extends this framework to include polynomial growth. Taming techniques are employed to produce an explicit discretization scheme that yields a new class of stable, under such non-linearities, algorithms which are called tamed interacting particle Langevin algorithms (tIPLA). We obtain non-asymptotic convergence error estimates in Wasserstein-2 distance for the new class under an optimal rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the numerical approximation for a class of radial Dunkl processes corresponding to arbitrary (reduced) root systems in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. This class contains some well-known processes such as Bessel processes, Dyson's Brownian motions, and Wishart processes. We propose some semi--implicit and truncated Euler--Maruyama schemes for radial Dunkl processes, and study their rate of convergence with respect to the $L^{p}$-sup norm.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds on aggregate expert error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the classic problem of aggregating binary advice from conditionally independent experts, also known as the Naive Bayes setting. Our quantity of interest is the error probability of the optimal decision rule. In the case of symmetric errors (sensitivity = specificity), reasonably tight bounds on the optimal error probability are known. In the general asymmetric case, we are not aware of any nontrivial estimates on this quantity. Our contribution consists of sharp upper and lower bounds on the optimal error probability in the general case, which recover and sharpen the best known results in the symmetric special case. Since this turns out to be equivalent to estimating the total variation distance between two product distributions, our results also have bearing on this important and challenging problem.</description>

      <title>The KPZ Fixed Point and the Directed Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14920v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The term 'KPZ' stands for the initials of three physicists, namely Kardar, Parisi and Zhang, which, in 1986 conjectured the existence of universal scaling behaviours for many random growth processes in the plane. A process is said to belong to the KPZ universality class if one can associate to it an appropriate 'height function' and show that its 3:2:1 (time : space: fluctuation) scaling limit, see 1.2, converges to a universal random process, the KPZ fixed point. Alternatively, membership is loosely characterised by having: 1. Local dynamics; 2. A smoothing mechanism; 3. Slope-dependent growth rate (lateral growth); 4. Space-time random forcing with the rapid decay of correlations.
  The central object that we will study is the so-called KPZ fixed point, which belongs to the KPZ universality class. Many strides have been made in the last couple of decades in this field, with constructions of the KPZ fixed point from certain processes such as the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (with arbitrary initial condition) and Brownian last passage percolation.
  In this article, we: 1. delineate the origins of KPZ universality; 2. describe and motivate canonical models; 3. give an overview of recent developments, especially those in the 2018 Dauvergne, Ortmann and Virag (DOV) paper; 4. present the strategy of and key points in the proof of the absolute continuity result of the KPZ fixed point by Sarkar and Virag; 5. conclude with remarks for future directions. The presentation is such that the content is displayed in a way that is as self-contained as possible and aimed at a motivated audience that has mastered the fundamentals of the theory of probability.</description>

      <title>Stretching of Polymers and turbulence: Fokker Planck equation, special stochastic scaling limit and stationary law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this work is understanding the stretching mechanism of stochastic models of turbulence acting on a simple model of polymer. We consider a turbulent model that is white noise in time and activates frequencies in a shell $N\leq |k|\leq 2N$ and investigate the scaling limit as $N\rightarrow \infty$, under suitable intensity assumption, such that the stretching term has a finite limit covariance. The polymer density equation, initially an SPDE, converges weakly to a limit deterministic equation with a new term. Stationary solutions can be computed and show power law decay in the polymer length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is devoted to studying asymptotic behaviors for Volterra type McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with small noise. By applying the weak convergence approach, we establish the large and moderate deviation principles. In addition, we obtain the central limit theorem and find the Volterra integral equation satisfied by the limiting process, which involves the Lions derivative of the drift coefficient.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Approximate Message Passing and Low-Degree Polynomials in Rank-One Matrix Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating an unknown parameter vector ${\boldsymbol \theta}\in{\mathbb R}^n$, given noisy observations ${\boldsymbol Y} = {\boldsymbol \theta}{\boldsymbol \theta}^{\top}/\sqrt{n}+{\boldsymbol Z}$ of the rank-one matrix ${\boldsymbol \theta}{\boldsymbol \theta}^{\top}$, where ${\boldsymbol Z}$ has independent Gaussian entries. When information is available about the distribution of the entries of ${\boldsymbol \theta}$, spectral methods are known to be strictly sub-optimal. Past work characterized the asymptotics of the accuracy achieved by the optimal estimator. However, no polynomial-time estimator is known that achieves this accuracy.
  It has been conjectured that this statistical-computation gap is fundamental, and moreover that the optimal accuracy achievable by polynomial-time estimators coincides with the accuracy achieved by certain approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms. We provide evidence towards this conjecture by proving that no estimator in the (broader) class of constant-degree polynomials can surpass AMP.</description>

      <title>Stationary solution to Stochastically Forced Euler-Poisson Equations in Bounded Domain: Part 1. 3-D Insulating Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the asymptotic stability of steady-state for $3$-D stochastic Euler-Poisson equations with insulating boundary conditions forced by the Wiener process. We use Banach's fixed point theorem and the a priori energy estimates uniformly in time to get the global existence of solutions around the steady state. Compared with the deterministic case, due to the stochastic forces, the momentum does not have the temporal derivative, which causes troubles to the energy estimates. We establish the asymptotic stability about the spatial derivatives by the weighted energy estimates for the estimates of stochastic integrals, employing a technique distinct from the deterministic case. The existence of invariant measure generated by the solutions to the evolving semiconductor equations is shown from the a priori energy estimates. Furthermore, the invariant measure is exactly the Dirac measure generated by the steady state, in which the exponential decay of perturbed solutions around the steady state plays an essential role.</description>
