      <title>Many-body Physics of Ultracold Alkaline-Earth atoms with SU($N$)-symmetric interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries play a crucial role in understanding phases of matter and the transitions between them. Theoretical investigations of quantum models with SU($N$) symmetry have provided important insights into many-body phenomena. However, these models have generally remained a theoretical idealization, since it is very difficult to exactly realize the SU($N$) symmetry in conventional quantum materials for large $N$. Intriguingly however, in recent years, ultracold alkaline-earth-atom (AEA) quantum simulators have paved the path to realize SU($N$)-symmetric many-body models, where $N$ is tunable and can be as large as 10. This symmetry emerges due to the closed shell structure of AEAs, thereby leading to a perfect decoupling of the electronic degrees of freedom from the nuclear spin. In this work, we provide a systematic review of recent theoretical and experimental work on the many-body physics of these systems. We first discuss the thermodynamic properties and collective modes of trapped Fermi gases, highlighting the enhanced interaction effects that appear as $N$ increases. We then discuss the properties of the SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard model, focusing on some of the major experimental achievements in this area. We conclude with a compendium highlighting some of the significant theoretical progress on SU($N$) lattice models and a discussion of some exciting directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods and analytic results for one-dimensional strongly interacting spinor gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of quantum physics's fundamental, but largely unsolved, problems is the computation of the correlation functions in many-body systems. In this paper we address this problem in the case of one-dimensional spinor gases with repulsive contact interactions in the presence of a confining potential. We take advantage of the fact that in the strong coupling limit, the wavefunction factorizes with the charge degrees of freedom expressed as a Slater determinant of spinless fermions and the spin sector described by a spin chain of Sutherland type with exchange coefficients that depend only on the trapping potential. This factorization is also present in the expressions for the correlation functions. Still, analytical and numerical investigations were hindered by the fact that the local exchange coefficients and the charge component of the correlators are expressed as $N-1$ multidimensional integrals, with $N$ the number of particles, which are notoriously hard to compute using conventional methods. We introduce a new approach to calculating these integrals that is extremely simple, scales polynomially with the number of particles, and is several orders of magnitude faster than the previous methods reported in the literature. This allows us to investigate the static and dynamic properties, temperature dependence, and nonequilibrium dynamics for systems with larger number of particles than previously considered and discover new phenomena. We show that, contrary to natural expectations, the momentum distribution of strongly interacting trapped spinor gases becomes narrower as we increase the temperature and derive simple determinant representations for the correlators in the spin incoherent regime valid for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations.</description>

      <title>Quantum corrections at second order in derivatives to the dynamics of small non-relativistic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To capture the dynamics of macroscopic non-relativistic fluids consisting of very many atoms, it is typically sufficient to truncate the gradient expansion at order zero, leading to ideal fluid dynamics, or at order one, leading to the Navier-Stokes theory. For mesoscopic fluids consisting of a small number of atoms, second-order corrections can become significant. We investigate here specifically superfluids at vanishing temperature, and identify relevant second-order terms of quantum origin that contribute already in a static situation. The general form of these terms arises from an extension of the Gross-Pitaevskii theory. In the context of density functional theory, they are named after C. von Weizs\"acker. We assess the influence of these terms on numerical solutions of second-order fluid dynamic equations for the expansion of a mesoscopic ultra-cold Fermi gas released from an anisotropic harmonic trap in two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Engineering the Bogoliubov Modes through Geometry and Interaction: From Collective Edge Modes to Flat-band Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a procedure to engineer solid-state lattice models with superlattices of interaction-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates. We show that the dynamical equation for the excitations of Bose-Einstein condensates at zero temperature can be expressed in an eigenvalue form that resembles the time-independent Schr{\"o}dinger equation. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this equation correspond to the dispersions of the collective modes and the amplitudes of the density oscillations. This alikeness opens the way for the simulation of different tight-binding models with arrays of condensates. We demonstrate, in particular, how we can model a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice supporting topological edge modes and a two-dimensional Lieb lattice with flat-band excitations with superlattices of Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetism Mechanism in a Geometrically Frustrated Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emergent itinerant ferromagnetism and propose its underlying mechanism in the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice. Based on large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations and unrestricted Hartree-Fock mean-field analysis, we identify itinerant ferromagnetic phases in the intermediate-$U$ Hubbard model with finite doping and reveal the kinetic mechanisms assisted by geometric frustration. Notably, we find that the doublon-singlon exchange process among other microscopic charge hoppings solely drives the fully polarized ferromagnetism for geometrically frustrated triangular lattice. Additionally, we establish the whole magnetic phase diagram and illustrate itinerant ferromagnetism within a finite range of electron doping for finite on-site Coulomb repulsion. The comparison of local spin correlations with recent cold-atom experiments is also discussed. Our work enhances the understanding of ferromagnetism mechanisms at intermediate coupling strength and finite doping concentrations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Lifetime of Quasiparticles in Fermi Liquids as a Precursor of the Density-Wave Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically study the inelastic lifetime of quasiparticles due to particle-particle interactions in a three-dimensional Fermi liquid approaching a density-wave instability. Using the G$_0$W approximation, we find that the softening of the dielectric function significantly enhances the quasiparticle decay rate near the instability. While the zero-temperature quasiparticle lifetime at the Fermi surface generally follows a $|\varepsilon_k-\varepsilon_{\rm F}|^{-\alpha}$ divergence with $\alpha=2$, we observe $\alpha=0.5$ at the instability point and $\alpha=1$ within the density-wave phase. Moreover, we demonstrate that the renormalization constant $Z$ is substantially suppressed as the instability is approached, enhancing the effective mass. We extend our analysis to ultra-cold Rydberg-dressed Fermi liquids, where the soft-core interactions promote density-wave instability, and find that our numerical G$_0$W results are in excellent agreement with our analytic predictions for quasiparticle lifetime, renormalization constant, and effective mass.</description>

      <title>In situ observation of chemistry in Rydberg molecules within a coherent solvent</title>

Abstract: We often infer the state of systems in nature indirectly, for example, in high-energy physics by the interaction of particles with an ambient medium. We adapt this principle to energies $9$ orders of magnitude smaller, to classify the final state of exotic molecules after internal conversion of their electronic state, through their interaction with an ambient quantum fluid, a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The BEC is the ground-state of a million bosonic atoms near zero temperature, and a single embedded ultra-long range Rydberg molecule can coherently excite waves in this fluid, which carry telltale signatures of its dynamics. Bond lengths exceeding a micrometer allow us to observe the molecular fingerprint on the BEC in-situ, via optical microscopy. Interpreting images in comparison with simulations strongly suggests that the molecular electronic state rapidly converts from the initially excited S and D orbitals to a much more complex molecular state (called "trilobite''), marked by a maximally localized electron. This internal conversion liberates energy, such that one expects final-state particles to move rapidly through the medium, which is however ruled out by comparing experiment and simulations. The molecule thus must strongly decelerate in the medium, for which we propose a plausible mechanism. Our experiment demonstrates a medium that facilitates and records an electronic state change of embedded exotic molecules in ultra-cold chemistry, with sufficient sensitivity to constrain velocities of final-state particles.</description>

      <title>Observable signatures of Hall viscosity in lowest Landau level superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hall viscosity is a nondissipative viscosity occurring in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry, such as quantum Hall phases and $p+ip$ superfluids. Despite Hall viscosity's expected ubiquity and past observations in: classical soft matter, optical, and graphene systems, it has yet to be measured experimentally in any macroscopic quantum state of matter. Toward this end, we describe the observable effects of Hall viscosity in a simple family of rotating Bose-Einstein condensates of electrically neutral bosons, in which all of the bosons condense into a single lowest Landau level (LLL) orbital. Such phases are accessible to current cold atom experiments, and we dub them LLL superfluids. We demonstrate that LLL superfluids possess a nonuniversal Hall viscosity, leading to a range of observable consequences such as rotation of vortex-antivortex dipoles and wave-vector dependent corrections to the speed of sound. Furthermore, using a coherent state path integral approach, we present a microscopic derivation of the Landau-Ginzburg equations of a LLL superfluid, showing explicitly how Hall viscosity enters.</description>

      <title>Extended degenerate perturbation theory for the Floquet-Hilbert space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider construction of effective Hamiltonians for periodically driven interacting systems in the case of resonant driving. The standard high-frequency expansion is not expected to converge due to the resonant creation of collective excitations, and one option is to resort to the application of degenerate perturbation theory (DPT) in the Floquet-Hilbert space. We propose an extension of DPT whereby the degenerate subspace includes not only the degenerate levels of interest but rather all levels in a Floquet zone. The resulting approach, which we call extended DPT (EDPT), is shown to resemble a high-frequency expansion, provided the quasienergy matrix is constructed such that each $m$th diagonal block contains energies reduced to the $m$th Floquet zone. The proposed theory is applied to a driven Bose-Hubbard model and is shown to yield more accurate quasienergy spectra than the conventional DPT. The computational complexity of EDPT is intermediate between DPT and the numerically exact approach, thus providing a practical compromise between accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for a coherent phenomenon of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it is known that Hamiltonian systems may undergo a phenomenon of condensation akin to Bose-Einstein condensation, not all the manifestations of this phenomenon have been uncovered yet. In this work we present a novel form of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems that stands out due to its evolution through highly coherent states. The result is based on a deterministic approach to obtain exact explicit solutions representing the dynamical formation of condensates in finite time. We reveal a dual-cascade behavior during the process, featuring inverse and direct transfer of conserved quantities across the spectrum. The direct cascade yields the excitation of arbitrarily high modes in finite time, being associated with the formation of a small-scale coherent structure. We provide a fully analytic description of the processes involved.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Nonlinear Effects and Dynamical Boson Condensation in a Driven-Dissipative Wannier-Stark Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven-dissipative light-matter systems can exhibit collective nonequilibrium phenomena due to loss and gain processes on the one hand and effective photon-photon interactions on the other hand. As generic example we study a bosonic lattice system implemented via an array of driven-dissipative coupled nonlinear resonators with linearly increasing resonance frequencies across the lattice. The model also describes a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model in a tilted potential without a particle-conservation constraint. We numerically predict a diverse range of stationary and non-stationary states resulting from the interplay of the tilt, tunneling, on-site interactions and loss and gain processes. Our key finding is that, under weak on-site interactions, the bosons mostly condense into a selected, single-particle Wannier-Stark state without exhibiting the expected Bloch oscillations. As the strength of the onsite interactions increase, a non-stationary regime emerges which, surprisingly, exhibits periodic Bloch-type oscillations. As a direct consequence of the driven-dissipative nature of the system we predict a highly nontrivial phase diagram including regular oscillating as well as chaotic dynamical regimes. While a straightforward photonic implementation using microwave or optical modes is possible, such dynamics might also be observable for an ultracold gas in a vertical lattice with gravity or a tilted external potential.</description>
