      <title>Radiation reaction in weakly magnetized black holes: can the tail term be ignored in the strong field regime?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study radiation from charged particles in circular motion around a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. In curved space, the radiation reaction force is described by the DeWitt-Brehme equation, which includes a complicated, non-local tail term. We show that, contrary to some claims in the literature, this term cannot, in general, be neglected. We account for self-force effects directly by calculating the electromagnetic energy flux at infinity and on the horizon. The radiative field is obtained using black hole perturbation theory. We solve the relevant equations analytically, in the low-frequency and slow-motion approximation, as well as numerically in the general case. Our results show that great care must be taken when neglecting the tail term, which is often fundamental to capture the dynamics of the particle: in fact, it only seems to be negligible when the magnetic force greatly dominates the gravitational force, so that the motion is well described by the Abraham--Lorentz--Dirac equation. We also report a curious "horizon dominance effect" that occurs for a radiating particle in a circular orbit around a black hole (emitting either scalar, electromagnetic or gravitational waves): for fixed orbital radius, the fraction of energy that is absorbed by the black hole can be made arbitrarily large by decreasing the particle velocity.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormholes and light rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracompact objects (UCOs) are horizonless compact objects that present light rings (LRs) - circular photon orbits. As a result, they could be black hole mimickers. Some years ago, Cunha et al. established a theorem stating that, under general assumptions, UCOs formed from smooth, quasi-Minkowski initial data, must have at least a pair of LRs, one of which must be stable. These stable LRs are supposed to trigger a non-linear instability in spacetime, potentially weakening UCOs' ability to replicate black hole phenomenology. However, this LR theorem does not extend to wormholes, which represent topologically nontrivial spacetimes. We address the wormhole case by proving the following theorem: a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically flat, traversable wormhole in 1+3 dimensions, connecting two different asymptotic regions, has at least one standard LR for each rotation sense. Thus, any (such) wormhole is an UCO. By filling this gap, our results not only broaden the horizon of knowledge on UCOs but also highlight their potential to closely mimic black hole phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Late time tail of waves on dynamic asymptotically flat spacetimes of odd space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general method for understanding the late time tail for solutions to wave equations on asymptotically flat spacetimes with odd space dimensions. In particular, for a large class of equations, we prove that the precise late time tail is determined by the limits of higher radiation field at future null infinity.
  In the setting of stationary linear equations, we recover and generalize the Price law decay rates. In particular, in addition to reproving known results on $(3+1)$-dimensional black holes, this allows one to obtain the sharp decay rate for the wave equation on higher dimensional black hole spacetimes, which exhibits an anomalous rate due to subtle cancellations. More interesting, our method goes beyond the stationary linear case and applies to both equations on dynamical background and nonlinear equations. In this case, our results can be used to show that in general there is a correction to the Price law rates.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Heavy Lifting: Yang-Mills, Spin, and Torsion in Dynamical Projective Gravitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thomas-Whitehead (TW) gravity is a gauge theory of gravitation based on projective geometry. The theory maintains projective symmetry through the TW connection, an affine connection over the volume bundle of the spacetime manifold. TW gravity obtains dynamics through Lovelock expansions in the action while preserving general relativity as a weak field limit. In this paper we clarify the process of lifting tensor and spinor fields from spacetime to the volume bundle and demonstrate that a choice of lifting amounts to a gauge fixing condition. This leads to a natural extension of previous work, where we now realize these prior constructions have been restricted to a particular gauge. In pursuit of generality, we also introduce torsion to the TW connection, leading to new dynamics. In particular, the appearance of torsion induces interaction terms involving gravitational coupling with Yang-Mills fields and Dirac spinors. An explicit realization of this is a geometrically sourced chiral mass term arising from the torsion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fast marginalization algorithm for optimizing gravitational wave detection, parameter estimation and sky localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm to marginalize the likelihood for a gravitational wave signal from a quasi-circular binary merger over its extrinsic parameters, accounting for the effects of higher harmonics and spin-induced precession. The algorithm takes as input the matched-filtering time series of individual waveform harmonics against the data in all operational detectors, and the covariances of the harmonics. The outputs are the Gaussian likelihood marginalized over extrinsic parameters describing the merger time, location and orientation, along with samples from the conditional posterior of these parameters. Our algorithm exploits the waveform's known analytical dependence on extrinsic parameters to efficiently marginalize over them using a single waveform evaluation. Our current implementation achieves a 10% precision on the marginalized likelihood within $\approx 50$ ms on a single CPU core and is publicly available through the package `cogwheel`. We discuss applications of this tool for gravitational wave searches involving higher modes or precession, efficient and robust parameter estimation, and generation of sky localization maps in low latency for electromagnetic followup of gravitational-wave alerts. The inclusion of higher modes can improve the distance measurement, providing an advantage over existing low-latency localization methods.</description>

      <title>Axial perturbations of hairy black holes in generalised scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations can test the validity of General Relativity (GR) in the strong field regime. Certain classes of scalar-tensor theories indeed predict that compact objects can exhibit significant deviations from their GR counterparts. Here we explore the quasinormal modes of axial perturbations in spherically symmetric black holes in three such classes: (i) dilatonic black holes with an additional scalar-Ricci coupling (EdRGB), (ii) spontaneously scalarized black holes (EsRGB) with a quadratic coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant and the Ricci scalar, (iii) spontaneously scalarized black holes with a quadratic and a quartic coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Casimir effect with screened scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of dark energy and dark matter is one of modern physics' greatest open problems. Scalar-tensor theories with screened scalar fields like the chameleon model are among the most popular proposed solutions. In this article, we present the first analysis of the impact of a chameleon field on the dynamical Casimir effect, whose main feature is the particle production associated with a resonant condition of boundary periodic motion in cavities. For this, we employ a recently developed method to compute the evolution of confined quantum scalar fields in a globally hyperbolic spacetime by means of time-dependent Bogoliubov transformations. As a result, we show that particle production is reduced due to the presence of the chameleon field. In addition, our results for the Bogoliubov coefficients and the mean number of created particles agree with known results in the absence of a chameleon field. Our results initiate the discussion of the evolution of quantum fields on screened scalar field backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Ultralight scalar dark matter versus non-adiabatic perfect fluid dark matter in pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent evidence of direct detection of stochastic gravitational waves reported by pulsar timing array collaborations might open a new window for studying cosmology and astrophysical phenomena. In addition to signals from gravitational waves, there is motivation to explore residual signals from oscillating dark matter, which might partially comprise the galactic halo. We investigate fluctuations in pulsar timing originating from the coherent oscillation of scalar dark matter up to the subleading order of $\mathcal{O}(k/m)$, as well as from acoustic oscillations of non-adiabatic perfect fluid dark matter. Both types of dark matter can generate oscillating Newtonian potential perturbations and curvature perturbations, thereby affecting pulsar timing. Our results show distinctive signatures in pulsar timing residuals and angular correlations for these dark matters. Specifically, pulsar timing residuals from non-adiabatic perfect fluid dark matter exhibit different directional dependence and are shown to be more sensitive to the distance to a pulsar. We also study the angular correlation patterns from these dark matters in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. The best fit might suggest that the composition of non-adiabatic perfect fluid dark matter in our galaxy is much greater than that of ultralight scalar dark matter.</description>

      <title>Spin foam amplitude of the black-to-white hole transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been conjectured that quantum gravity effects may cause the black-to-white hole transition due to quantum tunneling. The transition amplitude of this process is explored within the framework of the spin foam model on a 2-complex containing 56 vertices. We develop a systematic way to construct the bulk triangulation from the boundary triangulation to obtain the 2-complex. By using Thiemann's complexifier coherent state as the boundary state to resemble the semiclassical geometry, we introduce a procedure to calculate the parameters labeling the coherent state from the continuous curved geometry. Considering that triad fields of different orientations, i.e., $e_i^a$ and $-e_i^a$, give the same intrinsic geometry of the boundary, we creatively adopt the boundary state as a superposition of the coherent states associated with both orientations. We employ the method of complex critical point to numerically compute the transition amplitude. Despite the numerical results, it is interestingly found that the transition amplitude is dominated by the terms allowing the change in orientation. This suggests that the black-to-white hole transition should be accompanied by quantum tunneling process of a change in orientation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Big-Bounce as a phenomenology of RQM in the Mini-superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a quantum Big-Bounce in the context of an isotropic Universe, filled by a self-interacting scalar field, which plays the role of a physical clock. The bouncing cosmology is the result of a scattering process, driven by the scalar field potential, which presence breaks down the frequency separation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, treated in strict analogy to a relativistic quantum system. Differently from previous analyses, we consider a really perturbative self-interaction potential, affecting the dynamics in a finite range of the time labeled by the scalar clock (and in particular we remove the divergent character previously allowed). The main result of the present analysis is that, when the Relativistic Quantum Mechanics formalism is properly implemented in the Mini-superspace analogy, the probability amplitude for the bounce is, both in the standard and polymerized case, characterized by a maximum in correspondence of the quasi-classical condition of a Universe minimum volume.</description>

      <title>Dancing above the abyss: Environmental effects and dark matter signatures in inspirals into massive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this dissertation, we look at environmental effects in extreme and intermediate mass ratio inspirals into massive black holes. In these systems, stellar mass compact objects orbit massive black holes and lose orbital energy due to gravitational wave emission and other dissipative forces. We explore environmental interactions with dark matter spikes, stellar distributions, accretion disks, and combine and compare them. We discuss the existence and properties of dark matter spikes in the presence of these environmental effects. The signatures of the environmental effects, such as the phase space flow, dephasing, deshifting of the periapse, and alignment with accretion disks, are examined. These signatures are quantified in isolated spike systems, in dry, and in wet inspirals. We generally find dark matter effects to be subdominant to the other environmental effects, but their impact on the waveform is still observable and identifiable. Lastly, the rates of inspirals and the impact of spikes are estimated. All of these results are obtained with the help of a code imripy that is published alongside. If dark matter spikes exist, they should be observable with space-based gravitational wave observatories</description>

      <title>Dark energy as a geometrical effect in geodetic brane gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the modified geodetic brane gravity, conformed by the Regge-Teitelboim model and enhanced with a linear term in the extrinsic curvature of the brane, the possibility that under an FRW geometry this theory emulates the so-called dark energy is discussed. The cosmological behavior of this model displays a self-(non-self)-accelerated expansion of this universe which is caused by a combination of usual matter and gravitational geometric effects controlled by a $\beta$ parameter that accompanies the correction $K$ term. Indeed, the self-accelerated branch, provided by the trace $K$ model raises the question of whether the extrinsic curvature correction terms might be suitable for dark energy candidates. We discuss the analytical expression obtained for $\rd$ in addition to the main cosmological parameters such as the state parameter $\omega_{\text{\tiny eff}}$ and the deceleration parameter $q$. Moreover, when we call for the contribution of dark radiation-like energy to be switched off, $\Odr \to 0$, we find the same acceleration behavior, as well as the same dark energy content provided by the DGP theory.</description>

      <title>Constraining ultra slow roll inflation using cosmological datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the detection of gravitational waves by LIGO and PTA collaborations have raised the intriguing possibility of excess matter power at small scales. Such an increase can be achieved by ultra slow roll (USR) phase during inflationary epoch. We constrain excess power over small scales within the framework of such models using cosmological datasets, particularly of CMB anisotropies and Lyman-$\alpha$. We parameterize the USR phase in terms of the e-fold at the onset of USR (counted from the end of inflation) $\bar N_1$ and the duration of USR phase $\Delta N$. The former dictates the scale of enhancement in the primordial power spectrum, while the latter determines the amplitude of such an enhancement. From a joint dataset of CMB, SNIa and galaxy surveys, we obtain $\bar N_1 \lesssim 45$ with no bound on $\Delta N$. This in turn implies that the scales over which the power spectrum can deviate significantly from the nearly scale invariant behavior of a typical slow-roll model is $k \gtrsim 1 \, \rm Mpc^{-1}$. On the other hand, the Lyman-$\alpha$ data is sensitive to baryonic power spectrum along the line of sight. We consider a semi-analytic theoretical method and high spectral-resolution Lyman-$\alpha$ data to constrain the model. The Lyman-$\alpha$ data limits both the USR parameters: $\bar N_1 \lesssim 41$ and $\Delta N \lesssim 0.4$. This constrains the amplitude of the power spectrum enhancement to be less than a factor of hundred over scales $1 \lesssim k/{\rm Mpc^{-1}} \lesssim 100$, thereby considerably improving the constraint on power over these scales as compared to the bounds arrived at from CMB spectral distortion.</description>

      <title>Large curvature fluctuations from no-scale supergravity with a spectator field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the large curvature perturbations which can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the context of no-scale supergravity. Our study does not depend on any exotic scenario, such as scalar potentials with inflection points or bulks, and aims to avoid the fine-tuning of model parameters to achieve the formation of PBHs. This formation relies on the quantum fluctuations of a light spectator stochastic field after the inflationary period. Our analysis is based on the SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry, considering both the inflaton and the spectator field. Specifically, we examine existing no-scale models with Starobinsky-like scalar potentials that are consistent with observable constraints on inflation from measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These models involve two chiral fields: the inflaton and the modulus field. We propose a novel role for the modulus field as a spectator field, responsible for generating PBHs. Our hypothesis suggests that while the inflaton field satisfies the CMB constraints of inflation, it is the modulus field acting as the spectator that leads to large curvature perturbations, capable to explain the production of PBHs. Additionally, we prioritize retaining the inflationary constraints from the CMB through the consideration of spectator fluctuations. Therefore, by exploring the relationship between these fields within the framework of the SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry, our aim is to unveil their implications for the formation of PBHs.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy in type II$_1$ von Neumann algebra: examples in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An intriguing feature of type II$_1$ von Neumann algebra is that the entropy of the mixed states is negative. Although the type classification of von Neumann algebra and its consequence in holography have been extensively explored recently, there has not been an explicit calculation of entropy in some physically interesting models with type II$_1$ algebra. In this paper, we study the entanglement entropy $S_n$ of the fixed length state $\{|n\rangle\}$ in Double-Scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, which has been recently shown to exhibit type II$_1$ von Neumann algebra. These states furnish an orthogonal basis for 0-particle chord Hilbert space. We systematically study $S_n$ and its R\'enyi generalizations $S_n^{(m)}$ in various limit of DSSYK model, ranging $q\in[0,1]$. We obtain exotic analytical expressions for the scaling behavior of $S_n^{(m)}$ at large $n$ for random matrix theory limit ($q=0$) and SYK$_2$ limit ($q=1$), for the former we observe highly non-flat entanglement spectrum. We then dive into triple scaling limits where the fixed chord number states become the geodesic wormholes with definite length connecting left/right AdS$_2$ boundary in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. In semi-classical regime, we match the boundary calculation of entanglement entropy with the dilaton value at the center of geodesic, as a nontrivial check of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Curvature Perturbation and Primordial Black Hole Formation in Two-stage Inflation with a break</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a model of $R^2$-gravity with a non-minimally coupled scalar field that gives rise to two-stage inflation with a break, that is, with an intermediate stage where inflation momentarily halts. We find that the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation is significantly enhanced at the break scale, which can account for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation, without affecting the CMB constraint on large scales. The behavior of the curvature perturbation is carefully analyzed and we find a few notable new features in the spectrum. In particular, we find that the $k^3$ growth of the spectrum of toward the end of the first stage of inflation. We argue that this is a universal feature common to all two-stage models where the field dominating the second stage is heavy during the first stage. By appropriately tuning the model parameters, we find that our model can realize the scenario of PBHs as the cold dark matter of the Universe. We also find that we can choose the parameters so that the spectrum of the induced gravitational waves from the enhanced curvature perturbation fits the NANOGrav-15yr data of pulsar timing array observation.</description>

      <title>On the association of GW190425 with its potential electromagnetic counterpart FRB 20190425A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work by Moroianu et al. (2022) has suggested that the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW190425 might have a potential fast radio burst (FRB) counterpart association, FRB 20190425A, at the 2.8$\sigma$ level of confidence with a likely host galaxy association, namely UGC10667. The authors argue that the observations are consistent with a long-lived hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) that formed promptly after the BNS merger and was stable for approximately 2.5 hours before promptly collapsing into a black hole. The HMNS remnant is required to be a highly spinning magnetar, and due to its imminent collapse, its ejected magnetosphere potentially led to the observed FRB emission. Recently, Bhardwaj et al. (2023) conclusively associated FRB 20190425A with UGC10667, potentially providing a direct host galaxy candidate for GW190425. In this work, we examine the multi-messenger association based on the space-time localization overlaps between GW190425 and the FRB host galaxy UGC10667 and find that the odds for a coincident association are $\mathcal{O}(10)$. We validate this estimate by using a Gaussian Process (GP) density estimator. Assuming that the association is indeed real, we then perform Bayesian parameter estimation on GW190425 assuming that the BNS event took place in \GAL. We find that the viewing angle of GW190425 excludes an on-axis system at $p(\theta_v&gt;30^o)\approx99.99$\%, highly favouring an off-axis system similar to GRB 170817A. We also find a slightly higher source frame total mass for the binary, namely, $m_{\rm{total}} = 3.42^{+0.34}_{-0.11} M_{\odot}$, leading to an increase on the probability of prompt collapse into a black hole and therefore disfavors the long-lived HMNS formation scenario.</description>

      <title>Beyond Gaps and Bumps: Spectral Siren Cosmology with Non-Parametric Population Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave standard sirens typically require electromagnetic (EM) data to obtain redshift information to constrain cosmology. Difficult to find EM counterparts for bright sirens and galaxy survey systematics for dark sirens make cosmological constraints with spectral sirens, a gravitational wave data-only approach, extremely appealing. In this work, we use the GWTC-3 BBH detections as spectral sirens to constrain the BBH population and the underlying cosmological expansion with a flexible model for the black hole mass spectrum. We use a binned Gaussian process to model the BBH mass distribution in the source frame without any astrophysical assumptions on the shape and or inclusion (or lack of) features that drive the cosmological constraints as the redshifted detector frame masses become consistent with the underlying astrophysical mass distribution features. For GWTC-3 we find a measurement on the Hubble constant of $H_0=73.0^{+13.3}_{-7.7} \ {\rm{km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}}}$ at $68\%$ C.L. when combined with that obtained from the bright standard siren analysis with GW170817 and its associated host galaxy NGC 4993. We find an improved estimate for the Hubble constant of around a factor of 1.4 times better than the GW170817 measurement alone. We validate our nonparametric spectral siren approach with simulations and benchmark its scalability and constraining performance when compared with parametric methods.</description>

      <title>Revisiting thermodynamic topology of Hawking-Page and Davies type phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a common vector field to study the thermodynamic topology of the Davies type and Hawking-Page phase transitions. Existing literature has shown that studying these two types of phase transitions typically requires defining two separate vector fields . In our approach, we adopt Duan's $\phi$-mapping topological current theory to define a novel vector field, denoted as $\phi$, whose critical points exactly correspond to the Davies point and the Hawking-Page phase transition point. More importantly, we can differentiate between these two points by their topological charge. While, the topological charge for the critical point corresponding to the Davies-type phase transition is found to be $-1$, the same for the Hawking-Page phase transition point, it is $+1$. Although our analysis is applicable to all black hole systems where both types of phase transitions are found, we illustrate it using three simple systems as examples: the Schwarzschild AdS black hole, the Reissner-Nordstr\"om AdS black hole in the grand canonical ensemble, and finally the Kerr AdS black holes in the grand canonical ensemble. It is wellknown that these black holes exhibit both Davies and Hawking-Page phase transitions. With our proposed vector $\phi$, the critical points obtained for these three systems exactly match the Davies-type and Hawking-Page phase transition points, and the associated topological charges are found to be $-1$ for the Davies point and $+1$ for the Hawking-Page phase transition point.</description>

      <title>Revised bounds on local cosmic strings from NANOGrav observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, the NANOGrav collaboration studied new physics explanations of the observed pulsar timing residuals consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), including cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation. Analysing one of current models for the loop distribution, it was found that the cosmic string model is disfavored compared to other sources, for example, super massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). When both SMBHB and cosmic string models are included in the analysis, an upper bound on a string tension $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-10}$ was derived. However, the analysis did not accommodate results from cosmic string simulations in an underlying field theory, which indicate that at most a small fraction of string loops survive long enough to emit GW. Following and extending our previous study, we suppose that a fraction $f_{\rm NG}$ of string loops follow NG dynamics and emit only GWs, and study the three different models of the loop distribution discussed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration analyses. We re-analyze the NANOGrav 15yrs data with our signal models by using the NANOGrav $\texttt{ENTERPRISE}$ analysis code via the wrapper $\texttt{PTArcade}$. We find that loop distributions similar to LVK Model B and C yield higher Bayes factor than Model A analyzed in the NANOGrav paper, as they can more easily accommodate a blue-tilted spectrum of the observed amplitude. Furthermore, because of the degeneracy of $G\mu$ and $f_{\rm NG}$ in determining the signal amplitude, our posterior distribution extends to higher values of $G\mu$, and in some cases the uppermost value of credible intervals is close to the Cosmic Microwave Background limit $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-7}$. Hence, in addition to the pulsar timing array data, further information about the fraction of long-lived loops in a cosmic string network is required to constrain the string tension.</description>

      <title>Conditions on separability in multiqubit systems with an accelerating qubit using a conditional entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The separability in multiqubit pure and mixed GHZ and W states with an accelerating qubit has been characterized using Abe Rajagopal (AR) $ q $-conditional entropy. We observe that the pure multiqubit GHZ and W states in the inertial : non-inertial bipartition with one of their qubits being accelerated will remain non-separable irrespective of the qubit's acceleration. In these systems, we effectively captured the variation of their non-separability with respect to the acceleration of the qubit and the AR $ q $-conditional entropy parameter $ q $. However, in the corresponding multiqubit mixed states obtained by introducing a noise to the above pure states, one could get stronger conditions on their separability in the inertial : non-inertial bipartition, in terms of the mixing parameter, acceleration of the qubit and the number of qubits in the system, in the asymptotic limit of parameter $ q $. These conditions obtained from AR $ q $-conditional entropy serves as a necessary conditions for separability in such multiqubit states with a relativistic qubit.</description>

Abstract: We provide evidence for a correspondence between the formation of primordial black holes and the stability of circular null geodesics around the collapsing perturbation. We first show that the critical threshold of the compaction function to form a black hole in radiation is well approximated by the critical threshold for the appearance of the first unstable circular orbit. We also show that the critical exponent in the scaling law of the primordial black hole mass close to the threshold is set by the inverse of the Lyapunov coefficient of the unstable orbits when a self-similar stage is developed close to criticality.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the sensitivity of Pulsar Timing Arrays to gravitational wave backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations hinted towards the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nHz frequency band. Still, the nature of the SGWB signal cannot be confidently inferred from current data, and the leading explanation invokes mergers of supermassive black holes. If confirmed, such discovery would not only represent a turning point in our understanding of astrophysics, but it may severely limit the capability of searching for additional cosmological sources in the nHz frequency range. In this work, we build a simple framework to forecast the sensitivity of future PTA configurations and assess the parameter estimation of SGWB, which could consist of several contributions. We release the python code fastPTA implementing this framework and ready to use.</description>

Abstract: We analytically extend the 5D Myers-Perry metric through the event and Cauchy horizons by defining Eddington-Finkelstein-type coordinates. Then, we use the orthonormal frame formalism to formulate and perform separation of variables on the massive Dirac equation, and analyse the asymptotic behaviour at the horizons and at infinity of the solutions to the radial ordinary differential equation (ODE) thus obtained. Using the essential self-adjointness result of Finster and R\"oken and Stone's formula, we obtain an integral spectral representation of the Dirac propagator for spinors with low masses and suitably bounded frequency spectra in terms of resolvents of the Dirac Hamiltonian, which can in turn be expressed in terms of Green's functions of the radial ODE.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we generalize the theory of perturbations in a D + 1 dimensional space-time with cosmological constant, studying scalar, vector and tensor perturbations, as well as its structure in Newtonian and Synchronous gauge. We also show the theory of perturbations in the context of brane cosmology, where branes are embedded in a set of D-spatial dimensions, a temporal dimension, and an additional spatial dimension. In both, standard and brane cosmology an unperturbed spacetime is provided with a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric and arbitrary sectional curvature, the matter content has the shape of a perfect fluid. In addition, we consider the arbitrary sectional curvature, obtaining the respective equations in the Newtonian and Synchronous gauge. We highlight that the results presented in this article can be used to treat brane cosmology with two concentric branes or tackle the \sigma_{8} tension with a braneworld approach. Finally, as an example of the utility of all the technology presented in this paper, we show an application to the energy ux and the repercussions in the framework of the brane-worlds.</description>

      <title>Dynamical reconstruction of the $\Lambda$CDM model in scalar-tensor $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we use the dynamical system approach to explore the cosmological background evolution of the scalar-tensor representation of $f(R,T)$ gravity, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T$ is the trace of the stress-energy tensor. The motivation for this work resides in finding dynamical cosmological behaviors comparable with the $\Lambda$CDM model without the necessity of recurring to a dark energy component. We introduce a set of dynamical variables that allow for a direct comparison with the cosmological standard model and the current experimental measurements, and develop a dynamical system framework to analyze the cosmological evolution of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes within this theory. In this framework, we obtain the critical points in the cosmological phase space and perform fully numerical integrations of the dynamical system to extract the cosmological behavior, subjected to initial conditions compatible with the measurements by the Planck satellite. The phase space of the theory is proven to feature fixed points associated with cosmological behaviors analogous to those of GR, whereas variations in the scalar field associated to the dependency in $T$ affect the phase space structure only quantitatively. Our results indicate that cosmological solutions featuring a radiation dominated epoch, followed by a transition into a matter dominated epoch, and finally a transition into an exponentially accelerated epoch, are allowed by the theory, while maintaining a present state compatible with the current measurements from the Planck satellite and solar system dynamics, and preserving the regularity of the scalar fields and their interaction potential.</description>

Abstract: We consider the quasinormal spectrum of scalar and axial perturbations of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS black hole as the horizon approaches extremality. By considering a foliation of the black hole by spacelike surfaces which intersect the future horizon we implement numerical methods which are well behaved up to and including the extremal limit and which admit initial data which is nontrivial at the horizon. As extremality is approached we observe a transition whereby the least damped mode ceases to be oscillatory in time, and the late time signal changes qualitatively as a consequence.</description>

Abstract: We have investigated the motion for photons in the Kerr black hole spacetime under the axion-photon coupling. The birefringence phenomena arising from the axion-photon coupling can be negligible in the weak coupling approximation because the leading-order contributions to the equations of motion come from the square term of the coupling parameter. We find that the coupling parameter makes the size of shadows slightly increase for arbitrary spin parameter. For the rapid rotating black hole case with a larger coupling, we find that there exist a pedicel-like structure appeared in the left of the D-type like shadows.Comparing the shadow size of the Kerr black hole with the shadow size of the Sgr A* and M87* black holes, we find that there is room for such a theoretical model of the axion-photon coupling.</description>

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) produced by merging neutron stars exhibits a peak in the kHz band. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to exploit this distinctive feature through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using a simulated dataset of SGWB measurements within this frequency range. The aim is to use the SGWB peak as an observable to constrain a set of astrophysical and cosmological parameters that accurately describe the sources of the SGWB. We examine how variations in these parameters impact the morphology of the SGWB and investigate the necessary sensitivity to effectively constrain them. Given our priors on astrophysical and cosmological parameters, and assuming a power-law integrated sensitivity curve of the order of $10^{-11}$ between 1 kHz and 5 kHz, we show that the values of the chirp mass and common envelope efficiency of the binary systems are retrieved with percent accuracy. Furthermore, the method allows for the reconstruction of the cosmological expansion history populated by these binaries, encompassing the Hubble constant, matter abundance, and the effective equation of state of dark energy.</description>

Abstract: Asymptotically safe gravity is based on the idea of the dependence of the gravitational coupling upon the distance from the origin, approaching its classical value in the weak field regime. We consider three cases of identifying the cut-off parameter in the asymptotically safe gravity, leading to the three distinctive models for black holes. We find that the deviation of the fundamental mode from the Schwarzschild limit is a few percent, in contrast to the higher overtones, where the deviation reaches hundreds of percent, even when the fundamental mode almost coincides with the Schwarzschild mode. This behavior is connected with the fact that the quantum correction to the black hole spacetime is strong near the event horizon, but quickly falls off with distance and negligible near the peak of the effective potential surrounding the black hole.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, considering critical gravity as a gravity model, an electrically charged topological Anti-de Sitter black hole with a matter source characterized by a nonlinear electrodynamics framework is obtained. This configuration is defined by an integration constant, three key structural constants, and a constant that represents the topology of the event horizon. Additionally, based on the Wald formalism, we probe that this configuration enjoys non-trivial thermodynamic quantities, establishing the corresponding first law of black hole thermodynamics, as well as local stability under thermal and electrical fluctuations. Additionally, via the Gibbs free energy we note that the topology of the base manifold allows us to compare this charged configuration with respect to the thermal AdS space-time, allowing us to obtain a first-order phase transition. The quasinormal modes and the greybody factor are also calculated by considering the spherical situation. We found that the quasinormal modes exhibit a straightforward change for variations of one of the structural constants.</description>

      <title>Study of Orbital Dynamics in Singular and Regular Naked Singularity Space-times</title>

Abstract: The universe is filled with various compact objects and the most attractive of them are the black holes and singularity. But it is also known that at the singularity density becomes so infinitely high that the present physics knowledge breaks down. Thus, the singularity remains a flaw of the present theories. Several methods have been exercised to resolve the singularity. One such mathematical method is through conformal transformations. This paper deals with regularizing a naked singularity space-time using conformal transformations, further studying and comparing its time-like orbits with that of the naked singularity space-time.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly in Brans-Dicke gravity with trace-carrying matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact static spherisymmetric solution for the Brans-Dicke action sourced by a self-gravitating massless Klein-Gordon helicity-0 field. In contrast to the Maxwell electromagnetic field, a Klein-Gordon field possesses an energy-momentum tensor with $\textit{non-vanishing trace}$. Upon a Weyl mapping into the Einstein frame, the transformed Brans-Dicke scalar field takes on the role of a "dilaton" coupled with the Klein-Gordon field. Despite this dilatonic coupling, the field equations of the resulting Einstein-Klein-Gordon-dilaton action are fully soluble when employing the harmonic radial coordinate. The exact solution derived herein can serve as a prototype for future Brans-Dicke gravity studies involving trace-carrying matter fields. Notably, in the limit of infinite $\omega$, the Brans-Dicke scalar field exhibits an anomalous behavior of ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ as opposed to ${\cal O}\,(1/\omega)$. As a consequence, the solution converges to a spacetime configuration of General Relativity sourced by the original Klein-Gordon field and a free scalar field, the latter of which is the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ "remnant" of the Brans-Dicke scalar field. Furthermore, we provide a formal mathematical proof substantiating these two conclusions. Although the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly has been previously discovered for Brans-Dicke vacuum and Brans-Dicke-Maxwell electrovacuum, our findings establish its prevalence in Brans-Dicke gravity $\textit{regardless}$ of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of the source. Taken together, the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly challenges the conventional belief in the ${\cal O}\,(1/\omega)$ signature commonly associated with Brans-Dicke gravity. In particular, it may have implications in improving the relativistic corrections to Newtonian gravity beyond the weak-field parametrized post-Newtonian formalism.</description>

      <title>Spatial Dependence of the Growth Factor in Scalar-Tensor Cosmology</title>

Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have taken on a key role in attempts to confront the growing open questions in standard cosmology. It is important to understand entirely their dynamics at perturbative level including any possible spatial dependence in their growth of large scale structures. In this work, we investigate the spatial dependence of the growth rate of scalar-tensor theories through the M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros equation. We confirm that at subhorizon level this dependence does not play a major role for viable models. However, we establish conditions on which this criterion is met which may be important for developing new models. In our work, we consider three specific models that exhibit spatial dependence of the growth rate at subhorizon modes, which may also be important for early Universe models.</description>

      <title>Sharp departure beyond post-Newtonian formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a concrete example exhibiting marked deviation from the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) approximation in a modified theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Robertson parameter $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity for compact mass sources, explicitly incorporating the pressure content of these sources. We achieve this by exploiting the $\textit integrability$ of the 00-component of the Brans-Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result $\gamma_{\,PPN}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,exact}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\varTheta}$ where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_\parallel^*+2P_\perp^*$ and total energy $E^*$ contained within the mass source. Our non-perturbative formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. We draw four key conclusions: (1) The usual $\gamma_{\,PPN}$ formula is violated in the presence of pressure, viz. when $\varTheta\neq0$, revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans-Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter. Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN $\gamma$ formula. Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when $\varTheta\approx0$, for all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on $\gamma$ set joint bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of a mass source. If the equation of state of matter in the mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing $\varTheta\simeq1$, $\gamma_{\,exact}$ converges to 1 irrespective of $\omega$. (4) In a broader context, our findings indicate the latent significance of considering the interior structure of stars in observational astronomy.</description>

      <title>Global Hyperbolicity through the Eyes of the Null Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.15610v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: No Hopf-Rinow Theorem is possible in Lorentzian Geometry. Nonetheless, we prove that a spacetime is globally hyperbolic if and only if it is metrically complete with respect to the null distance of a time function. Our approach is based on the observation that null distances behave particularly well for weak temporal functions in terms of regularity and causality. Specifically, we also show that the null distances of Cauchy temporal functions and regular cosmological time functions encode causality globally.</description>

      <title>Scalar induced gravity waves from ultra slow-roll Galileon inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the production of secondary gravity waves in Galileon inflation with an ultra-slow roll (USR) phase and show that the spectrum of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in this case is consistent with the recent NANOGrav 15-year data and with sensitivities of other ground and space-based missions, LISA, BBO, DECIGO, CE, ET, HLVK (consists of aLIGO, aVirgo, and KAGRA), and HLV(03). Thanks to the non-renormalization property of Galileon theory, the amplitude of the large fluctuation is controllable at the sharp transitions between SR and USR regions. We show that the behaviour of the GW spectrum, when one-loop effects are included in the scalar power spectrum, is preserved under a shift of the sharp transition scale with peak amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6})$, and hence it can cover a wide range of frequencies within ${\cal O}(10^{-9}{\rm Hz} - 10^{7}{\rm Hz})$. An analysis of the allowed mass range for primordial black holes (PBHs) is also performed, where we find that mass values ranging from ${\cal O}(1M_{\odot} - 10^{-18}M_{\odot})$ can be generated over the corresponding allowed range of low and high frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the absence of a lightcone structure, some solutions of Carroll gravity show black hole-like behaviour. We define Carroll black holes as solutions of Carroll gravity that exhibit Carroll thermal properties and have a Carroll extremal surface, notions introduced in our work. The latter is a Carroll analogue of a Lorentzian extremal surface. As examples, we discuss the Carroll versions of Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstroem, and BTZ black holes and black hole solutions of generic 1+1 dimensional Carroll dilaton gravity, including Carroll JT and Carroll Witten black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the renormalization of a particular sector of Horndeski theory. In particular, we focus on the nonminimal coupling of a scalar field to the Gauss-Bonnet term and its kinetic coupling to the Einstein tensor. Adopting a power expansion on the scalar function that couples the Gauss-Bonnet term, we find specific conditions on their coefficients such that the action and charges are finite. To accomplish the latter, we add a finite set of intrinsic boundary terms. The contribution of the nonminimal coupling generates an effective scalar mass, allowing us to recover a modified Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. Furthermore, we compute the holographic 1-point functions and Ward identities associated with the scalar field and the metric. We constrain the parameter space of the theory by taking into account the preservation of scaling symmetry at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian Multipoles from the Next-to-Leading Post-Minkowskian Gravitational Waveform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the frequency-domain LO and NLO post-Minkowskian (PM) waveforms obtained from the tree-level and one-loop amplitudes describing the scattering of two massive scalar objects and the emission of one graviton. We explicitly calculate their post-Newtonian (PN) limit obtaining an expansion up to the third subleading PN order in all ingredients: the tree-level amplitude, the odd and even parts of the real one-loop kernel, and the Compton or "rescattering" cuts, thus reaching 3PN precision for the latter. We provide explicit expressions for the multipole decomposition of these results in the center-of-mass frame and compare them with the results obtained from the classical Multipolar post-Minkowskian (MPM) method. We find perfect agreement between the two, once the BMS supertranslation frame is properly adjusted and the infrared divergences due to rescattering are suitably subtracted in dimensional regularization. This shows that the approach proposed in arXiv:2312.07452 can be applied beyond the soft-regime ensuring the agreement between amplitude-based and MPM results for generic frequencies.</description>

      <title>Spinning Particle Geometries in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spinning particle/defect geometries in the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. These solutions lie below the BTZ threshold, and can be obtained from identifications of AdS$_3$. We construct the Feynman propagator by solving the bulk equation of motion in the spinning particle geometry, summing over the modes of the fields and passing to the boundary. The quantization of the scalar fields becomes challenging when confined to the regions that are causally well-behaved. If the region containing closed timelike curves (CTCs) is included, the normalization of the scalar fields enjoys an analytical simplification and the propagator can be expressed as an infinite sum over image geodesics. In the dual CFT$_2$, the propagator can be recast as the HHLL four-point function, where by taking into account the $PSL (2,\mathbb{Z})$ modular images, we recover the bulk computation. We comment on the casual behavior of bulk geometries associated with single-trace operators of spin scaling with the central charge below the BTZ threshold.</description>
