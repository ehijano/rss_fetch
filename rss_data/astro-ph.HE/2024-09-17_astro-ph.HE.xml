      <title>Quantum-Mechanical Suppression of Gas Accretion by Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schwarzschild radii of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mass range of 6x10^{14}g to 4x10^{19}g match the sizes of nuclei to atoms. I discuss the resulting quantum-mechanical suppression in the accretion of matter by PBHs within gaseous astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flux sensitivity to the next galactic core-collapse supernova in COSINUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While neutrinos are often treated as a background for many dark matter experiments, these particles offer a new avenue for physics: the detection of core-collapse supernovae. Supernovae are extremely energetic, violent and complex events that mark the death of massive stars. During their collapse stars emit a large number of neutrinos in a short burst. These neutrinos carry 99\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in understanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic Observatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a sodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next galactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate detectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae. The inner core of the experiment will consist of NaI crystals operating as scintillating calorimeters, mainly sensitive to the Coherent Elastic Scattering of Neutrinos (CE$\nu$NS) against the Na and I nuclei. The low mass of the cryogenic detectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc without pileup. They will see up to hundreds of CE$\nu$NS events from a supernova happening at 200pc. The crystals reside at the center of a cylindrical 230T water tank, instrumented with 30 photomultipliers. This tank acts as a passive and active shield able to detect the Cherenkov radiation induced by impinging charged particles from ambient and cosmogenic radioactivity. A supernova near the Milky Way Center (10kpc) will be easily detected inducing $\sim$60 measurable events, and the water tank will have a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity to supernovae up to 22kpc, seeing $\sim$10 events. This paper shows how, even without dedicated optimization, modern dark matter experiments will also play their part in the multi-messenger effort to detect the next galactic core-collapse supernova.</description>

      <title>AGN STORM 2. VII. A Frequency-resolved Map of the Accretion Disk in Mrk 817: Simultaneous X-ray Reverberation and UVOIR Disk Reprocessing Time Lags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray reverberation mapping is a powerful technique for probing the innermost accretion disk, whereas continuum reverberation mapping in the UV, optical, and infrared (UVOIR) reveals reprocessing by the rest of the accretion disk and broad-line region (BLR). We present the time lags of Mrk 817 as a function of temporal frequency measured from 14 months of high-cadence monitoring from Swift and ground-based telescopes, in addition to an XMM-Newton observation, as part of the AGN STORM 2 campaign. The XMM-Newton lags reveal the first detection of a soft lag in this source, consistent with reverberation from the innermost accretion flow. These results mark the first simultaneous measurement of X-ray reverberation and UVOIR disk reprocessing lags$\unicode{x2013}$effectively allowing us to map the entire accretion disk surrounding the black hole. Similar to previous continuum reverberation mapping campaigns, the UVOIR time lags arising at low temporal frequencies are longer than those expected from standard disk reprocessing by a factor of 2-3. The lags agree with the anticipated disk reverberation lags when isolating short-timescale variability, namely timescales shorter than the H$\beta$ lag. Modeling the lags requires additional reprocessing constrained at a radius consistent with the BLR size scale inferred from contemporaneous H$\beta$-lag measurements. When we divide the campaign light curves, the UVOIR lags show substantial variations, with longer lags measured when obscuration from an ionized outflow is greatest. We suggest that, when the obscurer is strongest, reprocessing by the BLR elongates the lags most significantly. As the wind weakens, the lags are dominated by shorter accretion disk lags.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Initial-Mass Function via Stellar Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar initial-mass function (IMF) represents a fundamental quantity in astrophysics and cosmology, describing the mass distribution of stars from low to very-high masses. It is intimately linked to a wide variety of topics, including stellar and binary evolution, galaxy evolution, chemical enrichment, and cosmological reionization. Nonetheless, the IMF still remains highly uncertain. In this work, we aim at determining the IMF with a novel approach based on the observed rates of transients of stellar origin. We parametrize the IMF with a simple, but flexible, Larson shape, and insert it into a parametric model for the cosmic UV luminosity density, local stellar mass density, type Ia supernova (SN Ia), core-collapse supernova (CCSN), and long gamma-ray burst (LGRB) rates as function of redshift. We constrain our free parameters by matching the model predictions to a set of empirical determinations for the corresponding quantities, via a Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method. Remarkably, we are able to provide an independent IMF determination, with characteristic mass $m_c=0.10^{+0.24}_{-0.08}\:M_{\odot}$, and high-mass slope $\xi=-2.53^{+0.24}_{-0.27}$, that is in accordance with the widely-used IMF parameterizations (e.g. Salpeter, Kroupa, Chabrier). Moreover, the adoption of an up-to-date recipe for the cosmic metallicity evolution, allows us to constrain the maximum metallicity of LGRB progenitors to $Z_{max}=0.12^{+0.29}_{-0.05}\:Z_{\odot}$. We also find what progenitor fraction actually leads to SN Ia or LGRB emission, put constraints on the CCSN and LGRB progenitor mass ranges, and test the IMF universality. These results show the potential of this kind of approach for studying the IMF, its putative evolution with galactic environment and cosmic history, and the properties of SN Ia, CCSN and LGRB progenitors, especially considering the wealth of data incoming in the future.</description>

      <title>Hanging on the cliff: EMRI formation with local two-body relaxation and post-Newtonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are anticipated to be primary gravitational wave sources for LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna). They form in dense nuclear clusters when a compact object (CO) is captured by the central massive black holes (MBHs) due to frequent two-body interactions among orbiting objects. We present a novel Monte Carlo approach to evolve the post-Newtonian (PN) equations of motion of a CO orbiting an MBH accounting for two-body relaxation locally on the fly, without the assumption of orbit-averaging. We estimate the fraction $S(a_0)$ of EMRIs to total captures (including direct plunges, DPs) as a function of the initial semi-major axis $a_0$ for COs around MBHs of $M_\bullet\in[10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot,4\times10^6\,{\rm M}_\odot]$. Previous results indicate $S(a_0)\rightarrow 0$ at large $a_0$, with a sharp transition from EMRIs to DPs around a critical scale $a_{\rm c}$. This notion has been recently challenged for low-mass MBHs, with EMRIs forming at $a\gg a_{\rm c}$, the so-called "cliffhangers''. Our simulations confirm their existence, at larger numbers than previously expected. Cliffhangers start to appear for $M_\bullet\lesssim3\times 10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and can account for up to 55% of the overall EMRIs formed. We find $S(a_0)\gg 0$ for $a\gg a_{\rm c}$, reaching values as high as 0.6 for $M_\bullet=10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot$, much larger than previously found. We find that the PN description of the system greatly enhances the number of EMRIs by shifting $a_{\rm c}$ to larger values at all MBH masses, and that the local treatment of relaxation significantly boosts the number of cliffhangers for small MBHs. Our work shows the limitations of standard assumptions for estimating EMRI formation rates, most importantly their dynamical models. Future estimates of rates and properties of EMRIs detectable by LISA should account for these improvements.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Neutrino Background from Magnetorotational Stellar Core Collapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A statistically significant detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) is around the corner. To this purpose, we assess the contribution to the DSNB of magnetorotational collapses of massive stars, relying on a suite of state-of-the-art three-dimensional neutrino-magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We find that neutrinos from magnetorotational core collapses boost the high-energy tail of the DSNB spectrum, similar to what is expected from neutrino-driven black hole-forming collapses. The latest data from the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration can already exclude that more than $13\%$ of all collapsing massive stars undergo magnetorotational collapses under optimistic assumptions. A DSNB detection at $3 \sigma$ could take place up to $4$ yr earlier at Super-Kamiokande-Gadolinium or JUNO if the fraction of magnetorotational collapses should be larger than $10\%$. Fascinatingly, if the fraction of magnetorotational stellar collapses should be larger than $7\%$, Hyper-Kamiokande could measure such a fraction at $3\sigma$ after $20$ yr of DSNB data taking. The combination of DSNB and electromagnetic data has the potential to resolve the degenerate contributions from magnetorotational and neutrino-driven black hole-forming collapses, providing crucial insight on the properties of the population of collapsing massive stars.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Muons, Pions, and Trapped Neutrinos on Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The merger of two neutron stars probes dense matter in a hot, neutrino-trapped regime. In this work, we investigate how fully accounting for pions, muons, and muon-type neutrinos in the trapped regime may affect the outcome of the merger. By performing fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of merging neutron stars with equations of state to which we systematically add those different particle species, we aim to provide a detailed assessment of the impact of muons and pions on the merger and post-merger phase. In particular, we investigate the merger thermodynamics, mass ejection and gravitational wave emission. Our findings are consistent with previous expectations, that the inclusion of such microphysical degrees of freedom and finite temperature corrections leads to frequency shifts on the order of 100-200 Hz in the post-merger gravitational wave signal, relative to a fiducial cold nucleonic equation of state model.</description>

      <title>Shock-induced partial alignment in geometrically-thick tilted accretion disks around black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out idealized three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of prograde, weakly magnetized, and geometrically thick accretion flows where the gas distribution is misaligned from the black hole spin axis. We evolve the disk for three black hole spins: $a = 0.5, 0.75$, and $0.9375$, and we contrast them with a standard aligned disk simulation with $a = 0.9375$. The tilted disks achieve a warped and twisted steady-state structure, with the outer disk misaligning further away from the black hole and surpassing the initial $24^\circ$ misalignment. However, closer to the black hole, there is evidence of partial alignment, as the inclination angle decreases with radius in this regime. Standing shocks also emerged in proximity to the black hole, roughly at $\sim$ 6 gravitational radii. We show that these shocks act to partially align the inner disk with the black hole spin. The rate of alignment increases with increasing black hole spin magnitude, but in all cases is insufficient to fully align the gas before it accretes. Additionally, we present a toy model of orbit crowding that can predict the location of the shocks in moderate-to-fast rotating black holes, illustrating a potential physical origin for the behavior seen in simulations\textemdash with possible applications in determining the positions of shocks in real misaligned astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Superradiance and Periodic 6.7 GHz Methanol Flaring in G22.356+0.066</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the periodic flares observed in the 6.7 GHz methanol transition in G22.356+0.066, utilizing the Maxwell-Bloch equations (MBEs) as a framework to model these phenomena. By solving the one-dimensional MBEs, we describe the behavior of both the quasi-steady-state maser and transient superradiance regimes. Our findings indicate that the observed periodic flares, with varying timescales across different velocities, are consistent with the characteristics of Dicke's superradiance, triggered by a common radiative pump in regions of varying inverted column densities. This work provides new insights into the physical processes governing variability in maser-hosting regions and underscores the significance of superradiance as a powerful radiation mechanism in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>The Interplay between the Disk and Corona of the Changing-look Active Galactic Nucleus 1ES 1927+654</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-domain studies of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) offer a powerful tool for understanding black hole accretion physics. Prior to the optical outburst on 23 December 2017, 1ES 1927+654 was classified as a "true" type~2 AGN, an unobscured source intrinsically devoid of broad-line emission in polarized spectra. Through our three-year monitoring campaign spanning X-ray to ultraviolet/optical wavelengths, we analyze the post-outburst evolution of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of 1ES 1927+654. Examination of the intrinsic SED and subsequent modeling using different models reveal that the post-outburst spectrum is best described by a combination of a disk, blackbody, and corona components. We detect systematic SED variability and identify four distinct stages in the evolution of these components. During the event the accretion rate is typically above the Eddington limit. The correlation between ultraviolet luminosity and optical to X-ray slope ($\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$) resembles that seen in previous studies of type 1 AGNs, yet exhibits two distinct branches with opposite slopes. The optical bolometric correction factor ($\kappa_{5100}$) is $\sim 10$ times higher than typical AGNs, again displaying two distinct branches. Correlations among the corona optical depth, disk surface density, and $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$ provide compelling evidence of a disk-corona connection. The X-ray corona showcases systematic variation in the compactness-temperature plot. Between 200 and 650 days, the corona is "hotter-when-brighter", whereas after 650 days, it becomes "cooler-when-brighter". This bimodal behavior, in conjunction with the bifurcated branches of $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$ and $\kappa_{5100}$, offers strong evidence of a transition from a slim disk to thin disk $\sim 650$ days after the outburst.</description>

      <title>A Two-zone Accretion Disk in the Changing-look Active Galactic Nucleus 1ES 1927+654: Physical Implications for Tidal Disruption Events and Super-Eddington Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of slim accretion disks, while crucial for our understanding of black hole growth, have yet to be studied extensively observationally. We analyze the multi-epoch broad-band spectral energy distribution of the changing-look active galactic nucleus 1ES 1927+654 to derive the properties of its complex, time-dependent accretion flow. The accretion rate decays as $\dot{M} \propto t^{-1.53}$, consistent with the tidal disruption of a $1.1\, M_\odot$ star. Three components contribute to the spectral energy distribution: a central overheated zone resembling a slim disk, an outer truncated thin disk, and a hot corona. Photon trapping in the slim disk triggered by the high initial $\dot{M}$ was characterized by a low radiation efficiency ($3\%$), which later more than doubled ($8\%$) after $\dot{M}$ dropped sufficiently low for the disk to transition to a geometrically thin state. The blackbody temperature profile $T \propto R^{-0.60}$ for the inner overheated zone matches the theoretical expectations of a slim disk, while the effective temperature profile of $T \propto R^{-0.69}$ for the outer zone is consistent with the predictions of a thin disk. Both profiles flatten toward the inner boundary of the disk as a result of Compton cooling in the corona. Our work presents compelling observational evidence for the existence of slim accretion disks and elucidates the key parameters governing their behavior, paving the way for further exploration in this area.</description>

      <title>Impact of dark matter on strange quark stars described by different quark models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter is hypothesized to interact with ordinary matter solely through gravity and may be present in compact objects such as strange quark stars. We treat strange quark stars admixed with dark matter as two-fluid systems to investigate the potential effects of dark matter on strange quark stars. Quark matter is described by the quasiparticle model and the extended MIT bag model for comparison. Dark matter is treated as asymmetric, self-interacting, and composed of massive fermionic particles. The two-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations are employed to solve for specific stellar properties. Our analysis yields relations between central energy density and mass, radius and mass, as well as tidal deformability and mass. The calculated curves generally align with observational data. In particular, we find that the pattern in which fermionic asymmetric dark matter affects the properties of strange quark stars may not be influenced by the equation of state (EOS) of strange quark matter.</description>

      <title>Deep view of Composite SNR CTA1 with LHAASO in $\gamma$-rays up to 300 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray source 1LHAASO J0007+7303u is positionally associated with the composite SNR CTA1 that is located at high Galactic Latitude $b\approx 10.5^\circ$. This provides a rare opportunity to spatially resolve the component of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and supernova remnant (SNR) at UHE. This paper conducted a dedicated data analysis of 1LHAASO J0007+7303u using the data collected from December 2019 to July 2023. This source is well detected with significances of 21$\sigma$ and 17$\sigma$ at 8$-$100 TeV and $&gt;$100 TeV, respectively. The corresponding extensions are determined to be 0.23$^{\circ}\pm$0.03$^{\circ}$ and 0.17$^{\circ}\pm$0.03$^{\circ}$. The emission is proposed to originate from the relativistic electrons and positrons accelerated within the PWN of PSR J0007+7303. The energy spectrum is well described by a power-law with an exponential cutoff function $dN/dE = (42.4\pm4.1)(\frac{E}{20\rm\ TeV})^{-2.31\pm0.11}\exp(-\frac{E}{110\pm25\rm\ TeV})$ $\rm\ TeV^{-1}\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}$in the energy range from 8 TeV to 300 TeV, implying a steady-state parent electron spectrum $dN_e/dE_e\propto (\frac{E_e}{100\rm\ TeV})^{-3.13\pm0.16}\exp[(\frac{-E_e}{373\pm70\rm\ TeV})^2]$ at energies above $\approx 50 \rm\ TeV$. The cutoff energy of the electron spectrum is roughly equal to the expected current maximum energy of particles accelerated at the PWN terminal shock. Combining the X-ray and gamma-ray emission, the current space-averaged magnetic field can be limited to $\approx 4.5\rm\ \mu G$. To satisfy the multi-wavelength spectrum and the $\gamma$-ray extensions, the transport of relativistic particles within the PWN is likely dominated by the advection process under the free-expansion phase assumption.</description>

      <title>Binary Stars Approaching Supermassive Black Holes: Tidal Break-up, Double Stellar Disruptions and Stellar Collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In galactic centers, stars and binaries can be injected into low-angular-momentum orbits, resulting in close encounters with the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We use $N$-body simulations to study such encounters systematically under a wide range of conditions. Depending on the system parameters (such as $\beta_b$, the ratio of binary tidal radius to pericenter distance $r_p$ to the SMBH, and the compactness of the binary), such close encounters can lead to the break-up of the binary, disruptions of both stars and collision between the stars. Binary break-up produces a hyper-velocity star and a bound star around the SMBH; the peak value of the orbital binding energy depends weakly on $\beta_b$. When $r_p$ is comparable to the stellar tidal radius, sequential disruptions of the stars occur within a time interval much shorter than the initial binary orbital period, potentially exhibiting distinct double TDE features. Stellar collisions occur for a range of $\beta_b$'s, with a few to 10's percent probabilities (depending on the compactness of the binary). In gentle encounters ($\beta_b\lesssim 1$), stellar collisions occur after the pericenter passage, and the merger remnants are typically ejected from the SMBH at a small velocity. In deep encounters ($\beta_b\gtrsim 1$), collisions occur near the pericenter, and the merger remnants are typically bound to the SMBH. We suggest that stellar collisions induced by binary-SMBH encounters may produce exotic stars in galactic centers, trigger accretion flares onto the SMBH due to the mass loss, and result in bound merger remnants causing repeated partial TDEs.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Potential of LS 5039 as a Triple System Using Fermi-LAT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LS 5039 is one of a handful of $\gamma$-ray binary systems in the Milky Way, comprising a pulsar and a massive O-type companion star with an orbital period of 3.9 day. Recently, we conducted a data analysis using approximately 16 year of Fermi-LAT observations, spanning from 2008 August 4 to 2024 July 8. In our timing analysis, we discovered two new periodic signals with frequencies higher and lower than the known orbital period. The higher-frequency signal has a period of 3.63819 day with a 7.1$\sigma$ confidence level, while the lower-frequency signal has a period of 4.21654 day with a 6.3$\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, in data from the High Energy Stereoscopic System of Cherenkov Telescopes, two potential signals with periods similar to the two newly discovered ones. Considering that these two signals fall within the same frequency interval as the orbital period, we suggest the possibility of a third body orbiting the barycenter of the LS 5039 binary system, with the new periodic signals arising from specific frequency combinations of the two orbital periods.</description>

      <title>2017 Outburst of H 1743-322: AstroSat and Swift View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive timing and broadband spectral analysis using an AstroSat observation of the low-mass black hole X-ray binary H~1743--322 during 2017 outburst. Additionally, we use two Swift/XRT observations, one of which is simultaneous with AstroSat and the other taken three days earlier, for timing analysis. The hardness-intensity diagram indicates that the 2017 outburst was a failed one unlike the previous successful outburst in 2016. We detect type C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the simultaneous AstroSat and Swift/XRT observations at $\sim0.4$ Hz, whereas an upper harmonic is noticed at $\sim0.9$ Hz in the AstroSat data only. Although these features are found to be energy independent, we notice a shift of $\sim0.08$ Hz in the QPO frequency over the interval of three days. We also investigate the nature of variability in the two consecutive failed outbursts in 2017 and 2018. We detect soft time lags of $23.2\pm12.2$ ms and $140\pm80$ ms at the type C QPO frequencies in 2017 Astrosat and 2018 XMM-Newton data, respectively. The lag-energy spectra from both the outbursts suggest that the soft lags may be associated with the reflection features. The broadband spectral analysis indicates that the source was in the low/hard state during our AstroSat observation. Modeling of the disk and reflection continuum suggests the presence of a significantly truncated accretion disk by at least $27.4~r_{\rm{g}}$ from the ISCO when the source luminosity is $\sim1.6\%$ of the Eddington luminosity.</description>

      <title>A View of the Long-Term Spectral Behavior of Ultra Compact X-Ray Binary 4U 0614+091</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine 51 archival NICER observations and 6 archival NuSTAR observations of the neutron star (NS) ultra-compact X-ray binary (UCXB) 4U 0614+091, which span over 5 years. The source displays persistent reflection features, so we use a reflection model designed for UCXBs, with overabundant carbon and oxygen ({\sc xillverCO}) to study how various components of the system vary over time. The flux of this source is known to vary quasi-periodically on a timescale of a few days, so we study how the various model components change as the overall flux varies. The flux of most components scales linearly with the overall flux, while the power law, representing coronal emission, is anti-correlated as expected. This is consistent with previous studies of the source. We also find that during observations of the high-soft state, the disk emissivity profile as a function of radius becomes steeper. We interpret this as the corona receding to be closer to the compact object during these states, at which point the assumed power law illumination of {\sc xillverCO} may be inadequate to describe the illumination of the disk.</description>

      <title>The CRAFT Coherent (CRACO) upgrade I: System Description and Results of the 110-ms Radio Transient Pilot Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results from a new backend on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, the Commensal Realtime ASKAP Fast Transient COherent (CRACO) upgrade. CRACO records millisecond time resolution visibility data, and searches for dispersed fast transient signals including fast radio bursts (FRB), pulsars, and ultra-long period objects (ULPO). With the visibility data, CRACO can localise the transient events to arcsecond-level precision after the detection. Here, we describe the CRACO system and report the result from a sky survey carried out by CRACO at 110ms resolution during its commissioning phase. During the survey, CRACO detected two FRBs (including one discovered solely with CRACO, FRB 20231027A), reported more precise localisations for four pulsars, discovered two new RRATs, and detected one known ULPO, GPM J1839-10, through its sub-pulse structure. We present a sensitivity calibration of CRACO, finding that it achieves the expected sensitivity of 11.6 Jy ms to bursts of 110 ms duration or less. CRACO is currently running at a 13.8 ms time resolution and aims at a 1.7 ms time resolution before the end of 2024. The planned CRACO has an expected sensitivity of 1.5 Jy ms to bursts of 1.7 ms duration or less, and can detect 10x more FRBs than the current CRAFT incoherent sum system (i.e., 0.5-2 localised FRBs per day), enabling us to better constrain the FRB emission mechanism model and use them as cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>Performance-Portable Binary Neutron Star Mergers with AthenaK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an extension to the AthenaK code for general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) in dynamical spacetimes using a 3+1 conservative Eulerian formulation. Like the fixed-spacetime GRMHD solver, we use standard finite-volume methods to evolve the fluid and a constrained transport scheme to preserve the divergence-free constraint for the magnetic field. We also utilize a first-order flux correction (FOFC) scheme to reduce the need for an artificial atmosphere and optionally enforce a maximum principle to improve robustness. We demonstrate the accuracy of AthenaK using a set of standard tests in flat and curved spacetimes. Using a SANE accretion disk around a Kerr black hole, we compare the new solver to the existing solver for stationary spacetimes using the so-called "HARM-like" formulation. We find that both formulations converge to similar results. We also include the first published binary neutron star (BNS) mergers performed on graphical processing units (GPUs). Thanks to the FOFC scheme, our BNS mergers maintain a relative error of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11})$ or better in baryon mass conservation up to collapse. Finally, we perform scaling tests of AthenaK on OLCF Frontier, where we show excellent weak scaling of $\geq 80\%$ efficiency up to 32768 GPUs and $74\%$ up to 65536 GPUs for a GRMHD problem in dynamical spacetimes with six levels of mesh refinement. AthenaK achieves an order-of-magnitude speedup using GPUs compared to CPUs, demonstrating that it is suitable for performing numerical relativity problems on modern exascale resources.</description>

      <title>X-ray reverberation as an explanation for UV/optical variability in nearby Seyferts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all wavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last decade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and densely sampled, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert galaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X-ray/UV/optical continuum time lags. Time-lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical models. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the X-rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X-ray reverberation model). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be used to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to investigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X-ray reverberation model can also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do this, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC 4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from archival long, multi-wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground-based telescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X-ray reverberation model by determining the disc's transfer function and assuming a bending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the model by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion rates and X-ray source heights. We conclude that the X-ray thermal reverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well as the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results suggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed UV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be fully explained by the variable X-rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.</description>

      <title>A Host Galaxy Morphology Link Between Quasi-Periodic Eruptions and Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical processes that produce X-ray Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) recently discovered from the nuclei of several low-redshift galaxies are mysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link between QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal that the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high Sersic indicies, bulge-to-total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass densities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive properties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these parameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy Survey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host galaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host galaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high surface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^-2. These properties are similar to TDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass- and redshift-matched control sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central black holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to their stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host galaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical link between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulations of self-consistent, rotating neutron stars with mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields. Specifically, we investigate the role of resistivity in the dynamical evolution of neutron stars over a period of up to 100 ms and its effects on their quasi-equilibrium configurations. Our results demonstrate that resistivity can significantly influence the development of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in markedly different magnetic field geometries. Additionally, resistivity suppresses the growth of these instabilities, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of emitted gravitational waves. Despite the variations in magnetic field geometries, the ratio of poloidal to toroidal field energies remains consistently 9:1 throughout the simulations, for the models we investigated.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetic Fields on Urca Rates in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isospin-equilibrating weak processes, called ``Urca" processes, are of fundamental importance in astrophysical environments like (proto-)neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and supernovae. In these environments, matter can reach high temperatures of tens of MeVs and be subject to large magnetic fields. We thus investigate Urca rates at different temperatures and field strengths by performing the full temperature and magnetic-field dependent rate integrals for different equations of state. We find that the magnetic fields play an important role at temperatures of a few MeV, especially close to or below the direct Urca threshold, which is softened by the magnetic field. At higher temperatures, the effect of the magnetic fields can be overshadowed by the thermal effects. We observe that the magnetic field more strongly influences the neutron decay rates than the electron capture rates, leading to a shift in chemical equilibrium.</description>

      <title>High-Energy and Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are capable of emitting extremely energetic particles independent of their interactions with the Standard Model. In this work, we investigate a particularly interesting scenario in which PBHs evaporating in the early universe may be responsible for some of the observed high-energy neutrinos above the TeV or PeV scale in the present universe. We compute the energy spectrum of neutrinos directly emitted by PBHs with a monochromatic mass function and estimate the wash-out point, which determines the maximum energy of the spectrum. We find that the spectrum generally extends to high energies following a power law of $E_{\nu}^{-3}$ until it reaches the wash-out point, which crucially depends on the PBH mass. For PBHs of $10^{13}$ grams, the spectrum can extend up to the PeV scale, though the flux is too low for detection. We also consider an indirect production mechanism involving dark particles that are emitted by PBHs and decay into neutrinos at a much later epoch. This mechanism allows lighter (such as those in the gram to kilogram range) PBHs to produce more energetic neutrino fluxes without being washed out by the thermal plasma in the early universe. In this scenario, we find that ultra-high-energy neutrinos around or above the EeV scale can be generated, with sufficiently high fluxes detectable by current and future high-energy neutrino observatories such as IceCube and GRAND.</description>

      <title>Common Envelopes, Gamma Rays, and Sudden Spectral Changes of Novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common envelope (CE) is proposed as the origin of the early postoutburst spectra of many novae. A simple model is proposed to explain the properties of the CE based on the emission line strengths and an assumed density distribution. Rapid changes in the spectrum during postoutburst decline are suggested as possible evidence for a CE. Time-resolved spectra from the ARAS group show sudden spectral shifts that are correlated with detected gamma ray emission, suggestive of its possible origin on the WD that produces a change in condition within the CE. Episodic mass loss, formation of thea transient heavy element absorption systems, and dissipation of the CE may be triggered by gamma ray emission.</description>

      <title>Possible anti-correlations between pulsation amplitudes and the disk growth of Be stars in giant-outbursting Be X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanism of X-ray outbursts in Be X-ray binaries remains a mystery, and understanding their circumstellar disks is crucial for a solution of the mass-transfer problem. In particular, it is important to identify the Be star activities (e.g., pulsations) that cause mass ejection and, hence, disk formation. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between optical flux oscillations and the infrared (IR) excess in a sample of five Be X-ray binaries. Applying the Lomb-Scargle technique to high-cadence optical light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we detected several significant oscillation modes in the 3 to 24 hour period range for each source. We also measured the IR excess (a proxy for disk growth) of those five sources, using J-band light curves from Palomar Gattini-IR. In four of the five sources, we found anti-correlations between the IR excess and the amplitude of the main flux oscillation modes. This result is inconsistent with the conventional idea that non-radial pulsations drive mass ejections. We propose an alternative scenario where internal temperature variations in the Be star cause transitions between pulsation-active and mass-ejection-active states.</description>

      <title>How Long Will the Quasar UV/Optical Flickering Be Damped? II. the Observational Test</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characteristic timescale at which the variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) turns from red noise to white noise can probe the accretion physics around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). A number of works have studied the characteristic timescale of quasars and obtained quite different scaling relations between the timescale and quasar physical properties. One possible reason for the discrepancies is that the characteristic timescale can be easily underestimated if the light curves are not long enough. In this work, we construct well-defined AGN samples to observationally test the relationships between the characteristic timescale and AGN properties obtained by previous works. Our samples eliminate the effects of insufficient light-curve lengths. We confirm that the timescale predictions \citep{Zhou2024} of the Corona Heated Accretion disk Reprocessing model are consistent with our timescale measurements. The timescale predictions by empirically relations \citep[e.g.,][]{Kelly2009} are systematically smaller than our measured ones. Our results provide further evidence that AGN variability is driven by thermal fluctuations in SMBH accretion disks. Future flagship time-domain surveys can critically test our conclusions and reveal the physical nature of AGN variability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore wormhole solutions sourced by Casimir energy density involving generalized uncertainty principle corrections within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow gravity. The questions of traversability and stability, as well as the presence of exotic matter, are carefully investigated. In particular, the stability issue is addressed via an approach that has not been previously employed in the context of wormholes. This method, which represents an improved version of the so-called Herrera cracking technique, has the potential to yield novel insights in the field of wormhole geometries.</description>

      <title>The shape of convection in 2D and 3D global simulations of stellar interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical descriptions of convective overshooting often rely on a one-dimensional parameterization of the flow called the filling factor for convection. Several definitions of the filling factor have been developed, based on: (1) the percentage of the volume, (2) the mass flux, and (3) the convective flux that moves through the boundary. We examine these definitions of the filling factor with the goal of establishing their ability to explain differences between 2D and 3D global simulations of stellar interiors that include fully compressible hydrodynamics and realistic microphysics for stars. We study pairs of identical two- and three-dimensional global simulations of stars produced with MUSIC, a fully compressible, time-implicit hydrodynamics code. We examine (1) a $3 M_\odot$ red giant star near the first dredge-up point, (2) a $1 M_\odot$ pre-main-sequence star with a large convection zone, (3) the current sun, and (4) a $20 M_\odot$ main-sequence star with a large convective core. Our calculations of the filling factor based on the volume percentage and the mass flux indicate asymmetrical convection near the surface for each star with an outer convection zone. However, near the convective boundary, convective flows achieve inward-outward symmetry; for 2D and 3D simulations, these filling factors are indistinguishable. A filling factor based on the convective flux is contaminated by boundary-layer-like flows, making theoretical interpretation difficult. We present two new alternatives to these standard definitions, which compare flows at two different radial points. The first is the penetration parameter of Anders et al. (2022). The second is a new statistic, the plume interaction parameter. We demonstrate that both of these parameters capture systematic differences between 2D and 3D simulations around the convective boundary.</description>

      <title>Exploring the time variability of the Solar Wind using LOFAR pulsar data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision pulsar timing is highly dependent on precise and accurate modeling of any effects that impact the data. It was shown that commonly used Solar Wind models do not accurately account for variability in the amplitude of the Solar wind on both short and long time scales. In this study, we test and validate a new, cutting-edge Solar wind modeling method included in the \texttt{enterprise} software suite through extended simulations, and we apply it to investigate temporal variability in LOFAR data. Our model testing scheme in itself provides an invaluable asset for pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. As improperly accounting for the solar wind signature in pulsar data can induce false-positive signals, it is of fundamental importance to include in any such investigations. We employ a Bayesian approach utilizing a continuously varying Gaussian process to model the solar wind referred to as Solar Wind Gaussian Process (SWGP). We conduct noise analysis on eight pulsars from the LOFAR dataset with most pulsars having a timespan of $\sim 11$ years encompassing one full solar activity cycle. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the electron density at 1 AU and the ecliptic latitude (ELAT) of the pulsar. Pulsars with $|ELAT|&lt; 3^{\circ}$ exhibit significantly higher average electron densities. We observe distinct temporal patterns in electron densities in different pulsars. In particular, pulsars within $|ELAT|&lt; 3^{\circ}$ exhibit similar temporal variations, while the electron densities of those outside this range correlate with the solar activity cycle. The continuous variability in electron density offered in this model represents a substantial improvement over previous models, which assume a single value for piece-wise bins of time. This advancement holds promise for solar wind modeling in future International Pulsar Timing Array data combinations.</description>

      <title>Morphology and Mach Number Distribution of Merger Shock Surfaces in Merging Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a binary merger of two subclusters with comparable masses, a pair of merger shocks are typically generated, often manifesting as double radio relics. Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, we identify major merger events with mass ratio $\mathcal{M}_1/\mathcal{M}_2\lesssim4$ and impact parameter $b/r_{\rm vir,1}\lesssim1$, where $r_{\rm vir,1}$ is the virial radius of the larger subcluster. We analyze merger shock surfaces approximately 1 Gyr after the pericenter passage, focusing on their morphology and the distribution of the Mach number, $M_s$, of their constituent shock zones. The shock surfaces exhibit an elongated shape with a minor-to-major axis ratio of $\sim0.6-0.9$ and cover the area of $\sim5-20\%$ of the enclosed sphere. The area ratio of the two shock surfaces roughly scales with $\mathcal{M}_1/\mathcal{M}_2$, typically positioning the larger shock ahead of the smaller subcluster. The axis connecting the two subclusters generally does not pass through the centers of the shock surfaces, due to the nonzero impact parameter and the turbulent flows around them. The distribution of $M_s$ of shock zones on each surface can be approximated by a log-normal function, peaking at $M_{s,\rm{peak}}\approx2-4.5$ and extending up to $\sim10$. The surface-area-weighted and X-ray-emissivity-weighted average Mach numbers are comparable, with ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{\rm{area}}\approx2.3-4.4$ and ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{X}\approx2-4$. In contrast, the cosmic-ray-energy-flux-weighted average Mach numbers are higher with ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{\rm{CR}}\approx3-5$. This discrepancy aligns with the differences between Mach numbers derived from X-ray and radio observations of radio relic shocks. On the other hand, we find that mostly ${\langle{M_s}\rangle}_{X}\gtrsim2$ for simulated merger shocks, although shocks with $M_{\rm X-ray}\lesssim2$ are often reported in observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the numerical relativity module within AthenaK, an open source performance-portable astrophysics code designed for exascale computing applications. This module employs the Z4c formulation to solve the Einstein equations. We demonstrate its accuracy through a series of standard numerical relativity tests, including convergence of the gravitational waveform from binary black hole coalescence. Furthermore, we conduct scaling tests on OLCF Frontier and NERSC Perlmutter, where AthenaK exhibits excellent weak scaling efficiency of 80% on up to 65,536 AMD MI250X GPUs on Frontier (relative to 4 GPUs) and strong scaling efficiencies of 84% and 77% on AMD MI250X and NVIDIA A100 GPUs on Frontier and Perlmutter respectively. Additionally, we observe a significant performance boost, with two orders of magnitude speedup ($\gtrsim 200\times$) on a GPU compared to a single CPU core, affirming that AthenaK is well-suited for exascale computing, thereby expanding the potential for breakthroughs in numerical relativity research.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Observational Projection Effects with a Simulation-based hot CGM model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) allows us to probe the inflow and outflow of gas within a galaxy, which is responsible for dictating the evolution of the galaxy. Studying the hot CGM sheds light on a better understanding of gas physics, which is crucial to inform and constrain simulation models. With the recent advances in observational measurements probing the hot CGM in X-rays and tSZ, we have a new avenue for widening our knowledge of gas physics and feedback by exploiting the information from current/future observations. In this paper, we use the TNG300 hydrodynamical simulations to build a fully self-consistent forward model for the hot CGM. We construct a lightcone and generate mock X-ray observations. We quantify the projection effects, namely the locally correlated large-scale structure in X-rays and the effect due to satellite galaxies misclassified as centrals which affects the measured hot CGM galactocentric profiles in stacking experiments. We present an analytical model that describes the intrinsic X-ray surface brightness profile across the stellar and halo mass bins. The increasing stellar mass bins result in decreasing values of $\beta$, the exponent quantifying the slope of the intrinsic galactocentric profiles. We carry forward the current state-of-the-art by also showing the impact of the locally correlated environment on the measured X-ray surface brightness profiles. We also present, for the first time, the effect of misclassified centrals in stacking experiments for three stellar mass bins: $10^{10.5-11}\ M_\odot$, $10^{11-11.2}\ M_\odot$, and $10^{11.2-11.5}\ M_\odot$. We find that the contaminating effect of the misclassified centrals on the stacked profiles increases when the stellar mass decreases.</description>

      <title>The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II. Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first 2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays, and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of these observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time, rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately every month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the band-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are 0.3 to 1.0%, with longer-wavelength bands generally having larger uncertainties.</description>

      <title>An extremely active repeating fast radio burst source in a likely non-magneto-ionic environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio bursts originating at cosmological distances. Only three repeating FRBs FRB 20121102A, FRB 20190520B and FRB 20201124A among $\sim$ 60 known repeating FRBs have circular polarization. We observed the FRB 20220912A with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at L-band on 24 October 2022 and detected 128 bursts in 1.4 hours, corresponding to a burst rate of about 90 hr$^{-1}$, which is the highest yet for FRBs observed by the GBT. The average rotation measure (RM) was $-$0.4$\pm$0.3$\,$rad$\,$m$^{-2}$ with negligible intraday RM change, indicating a likely non-magneto-ionic environment. 61% bursts have linear polarization fraction greater than 90%. Approximately 56% of the bright bursts have circular polarization. A downward drift in frequency and polarization angle swings were found in our sample. The characterization of FRB 20220912A indicates that the circular polarization is unlikely to be caused by the magneto-ionic environment for at least some of the repeating FRB population.</description>

Abstract: Magnetar is a neutron star with an ultrahigh magnetic field ($\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}$ G) which usually manifests as soft gamma-ray repeater (SGR) or anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXP). SGR J1935+2154 is not only one of the most active magnetar detected so far, but also the unique confirmed source of fast radio burst (FRB). Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) are dedicated to monitor gamma-ray transients all over the sky, including SGR bursts. Here we report the GECAM observation of the burst activity of SGR J1935+2154 from January 2021 to December 2022, which results in a unique and valuable data set for this important magnetar. With a targeted search of GECAM data, 164 bursts from SGR J1935+2154 are detected by GECAM-B while 97 bursts by GECAM-C, including the X-ray burst associated with a fast radio burst (FRB 20221014). We find that both the burst duration and the waiting time between two successive bursts follow lognormal distributions. The period of burst activity is $134\pm20$ days, thus the burst activity could be generally divided into 4 active episodes over these two years. Interestingly, the hardness ratio of X-ray bursts tends to be softer and more concentrated over these two years, especially during the active episode with FRBs detected.</description>

Abstract: The origin and acceleration mechanisms of energetic particles in the universe remain enigmatic in contemporary astrophysics. Recent efforts have focused on identifying Galactic sources capable of accelerating particles to 1 PeV, known as PeVatrons, and also identifying sources contributing to the spectrum at lower energies. The different morphology of galactic supernova remnants is directly related to the type of stellar explosion and the existence of a possible Compact Central Object (CCO), which possess intense radiative-gravitational fields on their surfaces. These CCOs, due to their strong fields and interactions with surrounding magnetic clouds, are potential candidates for gamma ray production. Through observations of the compact X-ray source 1E 1207.4-5209, located near the remnant G296.5+10.0, and using the enhanced GALPROP code, we analyze the emission of gamma-ray and cosmic-ray production through propagation. Additionally, we calculate the contribution of the G296.5+10.0 source to the overall observed Galactic cosmic-ray flux, taking into account cosmic-ray propagation within the Galaxy, which includes energy losses and particle interactions. Our findings suggest that this setup offers a fertile environment for producing a wide range of cosmic-ray energies at low energy within the Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: The realtime program for high-energy neutrino track events detected by the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory releases alerts to the astronomical community with the goal of identifying electromagnetic counterparts to astrophysical neutrinos. Gamma-ray observations from the $Fermi$-Large Area Telescope (LAT) enabled the identification of the flaring gamma-ray blazar TXS 0506+056 as a likely counterpart to the neutrino event IC-170922A. By continuously monitoring the gamma-ray sky, $Fermi$-LAT plays a key role in the identification of candidate counterparts to realtime neutrino alerts. In this paper, we present the $Fermi$-LAT strategy for following up high-energy neutrino alerts applied to seven years of IceCube data. Right after receiving an alert, a search is performed in order to identify gamma-ray activity from known and newly-detected sources that are positionally consistent with the neutrino localization. In this work, we study the population of blazars found in coincidence with high-energy neutrinos and compare them to the full population of gamma-ray blazars detected by $Fermi$-LAT. We also evaluate the relationship between the neutrino and gamma-ray luminosities, finding different trends between the two blazar classes BL Lacs and flat-spectrum radio quasars.</description>

Abstract: Kilonovae are the electromagnetic transients created by the radioactive decay of freshly synthesized elements in the environment surrounding a neutron star merger. To study the fundamental physics in these complex environments, kilonova modeling requires, in part, the use of radiative transfer simulations. The microphysics involved in these simulations results in high computational cost, prompting the use of emulators for parameter inference applications. Utilizing a training set of 22248 high-fidelity simulations (composed of 412 unique ejecta parameter combinations evaluated at 54 viewing angles), we use a neural network to efficiently train on existing radiative transfer simulations and predict light curves for new parameters in a fast and computationally efficient manner. Our neural network can generate millions of new light curves in under a minute. We discuss our emulator's degree of off-sample reliability and parameter inference of the AT2017gfo observational data. Finally, we discuss tension introduced by multi-band inference in the parameter inference results, particularly with regard to the neural network's recovery of viewing angle.</description>

      <title>The first detection of X-ray polarization in a newly discovered Galactic transient Swift\,J151857.0-572147</title>

Abstract: We study the spectro-polarimetric properties of a newly discovered black hole X-ray binary Swift\,J151857.0-572147 jointly using {\it IXPE} and {\it NuSTAR} observations during March 2024. The analysis of {\it IXPE} data reports the first detection of X-ray polarization with degree (PD) $1.34\pm0.27$ and polarization angle (PA) $-13.69^\circ\pm5.85^\circ$ using model-independent approach, while the model-dependent analysis gives PD $1.18\pm0.23$ and PA $-14.01^\circ\pm5.80^\circ$. The joint spectral analysis of the broadband data and {\it NuSTAR} analysis in isolation constrain the mass of the central black hole between $\sim 9.2\pm1.6-10.1\pm1.7 M_\odot$ and a moderate spin parameter of $\sim0.6\pm0.1-0.7\pm0.2$ with disk inclination $\sim 35^\circ\pm7^\circ-46^\circ\pm15^\circ$. The power-law photon index and cutoff energy are $2.19\pm0.03-2.47\pm0.06$ and $\sim 36\pm4-78\pm10$ keV, suggesting a transition to the soft spectral state (SS). Additionally, a relatively lower corona size of $6\pm1-9\pm2$ $r_S$, a low mass outflow rate ($&lt;3$\% $\dot M_{\rm Edd}$), and the best-fitted halo accretion is less compared to the disk accretion rate further confirms the same state. The low PD detected in the SS can be due to repeated scattering inside the dense corona and the dominant emission from the disk, agrees with the low spin and low disk inclination. The hydrogen column density obtained from the fit is relatively high $\sim 4-5\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Simple fits for the neutrino luminosities from protoneutron star cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple fit function, $L_{\nu_i}(t) = C\, t^{-\alpha}\, e^{-(t/\tau)^{n}}$, to parametrize the luminosities of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors during the protoneutron star (PNS) cooling phase at post-bounce times $t \gtrsim 1$ s. This fit is based on results from a set of neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of core-collapse supernovae in spherical symmetry. The simulations were performed with an energy-dependent transport for six neutrino species and took into account the effects of convection and muons in the dense and hot PNS interior. We provide values of the fit parameters $C$, $\alpha$, $\tau$, and $n$ for different neutron star masses and equations of state as well as correlations between these fit parameters. Our functional description is useful for analytic supernova modeling, for characterizing the neutrino light curves in large underground neutrino detectors, and as a tool to extract information from measured signals on the mass and equation of state of the PNS and on secondary signal components on top of the PNS's neutrino emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) in cosmic filaments are among the least quantified units in modern astrophysics. The Spectrum Roentgen Gamma/eROSITA All Sky Survey ((SRG/eRASS) provides a unique opportunity to study the X-ray emission of the WHIM. We applied both imaging and spectroscopic stacking techniques to the data of the first four eRASS scans to inspect the X-ray emissions from 7817 cosmic filaments identified from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optical galaxy samples. We obtained a $9\sigma$ significant detection of the total X-ray signal from filaments in the 0.3--1.2~keV band. Here, we introduce a novel method to estimate the contamination fraction from unmasked X-ray halos, active galactic nuclei, and X-ray binaries associated with filament galaxies. We found an approximately 40\% contamination fraction for these unmasked sources, suggesting that the remaining 60\% of the signal could be coming from the WHIM and a $5.4\sigma$ detection significance of the WHIM. Moreover, we modeled the temperature and baryon density contrast of the detected WHIM by fitting the stacked spectrum and surface brightness profile. The best-fit temperature $\log(T/\mathrm{K})=6.84\pm0.07$, obtained by using a single temperature model, is marginally higher than in the simulation results. This could be due to the fitting of a single temperature model on a multi-temperature spectrum. Assuming a 0.2 solar abundance, the best-fit baryon density contrast $\log\Delta_\mathrm{b}=1.88\pm0.18$ is in general agreement with the X-ray emitting phases in the IllustrisTNG simulation. This result suggests that the broadband X-ray emission traces the high end of the temperature and density values that characterize the entire WHIM population.</description>

Abstract: Pulsars are highly magnetized rotating neutron stars, emitting in a broad electromagnetic energy range. Reproducing the observed pulsars population refines our understanding of their formation and evolution scenarios as well as their radiation processes and geometry. In this paper, we improve our previous population synthesis by focusing on both the radio and $\gamma$-ray pulsar populations, investigating the impact of the Galactic gravitational potential and of the radio emission death line. In order to elucidate the necessity of a death line, refined initial distributions of spin period and spacial position at birth were implemented, elevating the sophistication of our simulations to the most recent state-of-the-art. The motion of each individual pulsar is tracked in the Galactic potential by a fourth order symplectic integration scheme. Our pulsar population synthesis takes into account the secular evolution of the force-free magnetosphere and magnetic field decay simultaneously and self-consistently. Each pulsar is evolved from its birth up to the present time. The radio and $\gamma$-ray emission locations are modelled respectively by the polar cap geometry and the striped wind model. By simulating ten million pulsars we found that including a death line better reproduces the observational trend. However, when simulating one million pulsars, we obtain an even more realistic $P-\dot{P}$ diagram, whether or not a death line is included. This suggests that the ages of the detected pulsars might be overestimated, therefore questioning the real need for a death line in pulsar population studies. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests confirm the statistical similarity between the observed and simulated $P-\dot{P}$ diagram. Additionally, simulations with increased $\gamma$-ray telescope sensitivities hint to a significant contribution of $\gamma$-ray pulsars to the GeV excess in the Galactic centre.</description>

      <title>Relaxing CMB bounds on Primordial Black Holes: the role of ionization fronts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accretion of matter onto primordial black holes (PBHs) during the dark ages and the subsequent energy injection in the medium should have left imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Recent works have claimed stringent CMB limits on the PBH abundance, hardly compatible with a PBH interpretation of the gravitational-wave observations of binary BH mergers. By using a more realistic accretion model based on hydrodynamical simulations and conservative assumptions for the emission efficiency, we show that CMB limits on the PBH abundance are up to two orders of magnitude less stringent than previously estimated between $10$ and $10^4$ M$_\odot$. This reopens the possibility that PBHs might explain at the same time (at least a fraction of) the dark matter, some of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binary BH mergers and the existence of super-massive BHs. More generally, we emphasize that PBH accretion can be a rather complex physical process with velocity dependences that are hard to assess, which introduces large uncertainties in accretion-based limits on the PBH abundance.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations provide sensitive tests of parity and Lorentz symmetries of gravity. Any violation of these fundamental symmetries induces possible deviations in the GW propagations. Through a systematic parametrization for characterizing possible derivations from GW propagations in general relativity, we construct the modified GW waveforms generated by the coalescence of compact binaries with the effects of the parity and Lorentz violations as predicted by many parity- and Lorentz-violating gravities and then analyze them with the open data of compact binary merging events detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. No signature of gravitational parity and Lorentz violations are found for most GW events, thereby allowing us to place several of the most stringent constraints on parity and Lorentz violations in gravity and a first constraint on the Lorentz-violating damping effect in GW.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) are predicted in various exotic scenarios involving both cosmological and astrophysical sources. These elusive signals have recently sparked the interest of a diverse community of researchers, due to the possibility of HFGW detection in the laboratory through graviton-photon conversion in strong magnetic fields. Notable examples include the redesign of the resonant cavities currently under development to detect the cosmic axion. In this work, we derive the sensitivities of some existing and planned resonant cavities to detect a HFGW background. As a concrete scenario, we consider the collective signals that originate from the merging of compact objects, such as two primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid mass window. Our findings improve over existing work by explicitly discussing and quantifying the loss in the experimental reach due to the actual coherence of the source. We elucidate on the approach we adopt in relation with recent literature on the topic. Most notably, we give a recipe for the estimate of the stochastic background that focuses on the presence of the signal in the cavity at all times and showing that, in the relevant PBH mass region, the signal is dominated by coherent binary mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-radial oscillation modes of a neutron star possess valuable information about its internal structure and nuclear physics. Starting from the quadrupolar order, such modes under general relativity are known as quasi-normal modes since they dissipate energy through gravitational radiation and their frequencies are complex. The stability of these modes is governed by the sign of the imaginary part of the frequency, which determines whether the mode would decay or grow over time. In this Letter, we develop a fully consistent framework in general relativity to study quasi-normal modes of neutron stars with anisotropic pressure, whose motivation includes strong internal magnetic fields and non-vanishing shear or viscosity. We employ parametrized models for the anisotropy and solve the perturbed Einstein field equations numerically. We find that, unlike the case for isotropic neutron stars, the imaginary parts of some of the pressure ($p$-)modes flip signs as the degree of anisotropy deviates from zero, depicting a transition from stable modes to unstable modes. This finding indicates that some anisotropic neutron star models are unstable, potentially restricting the form of sustained anisotropy.</description>

Abstract: The existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is crucial for understanding various astrophysical phenomena, yet their existence remains elusive, except for the LIGO-Virgo detection. We report the discovery of a high-velocity star J0731+3717, whose backward trajectory about 21 Myr ago intersects that of globular cluster M15 within the cluster tidal radius. Both its metallicity [Fe/H] and its alpha-to-iron abundance ratio [$\alpha$/Fe] are consistent with those of M15. Furthermore, its location falls right on the fiducial sequence of the cluster M15 on the color-absolute magnitude diagram, suggesting similar ages. These support that J0731+3717 is originally associated with M15 at a confidence level of "seven nines". We find that such a high-velocity star ($V_{\rm ej} = 548^{+6}_{-5}$ km s$^{-1}$) was most likely tidally ejected from as close as one astronomical unit to the center of M15, confirming an IMBH ($\ge 100 M_{\odot}$ with a credibility of 98%) as the exclusive nature of the central unseen mass proposed previously.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortices in fermionic superfluids: from ultracold atoms to neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superfluid dilute neutron matter and ultracold gas, close to the unitary regime, exhibit several similarities. Therefore, to a certain extent, fermionic ultracold gases may serve as emulators of dilute neutron matter, which forms the inner crust of neutron stars and is not directly accessed experimentally. Quantum vortices are one of the most significant properties of neutron superfluid, essential for comprehending neutron stars' dynamics. The structure and dynamics of quantum vortices as a function of pairing correlations' strength are being investigated experimentally and theoretically in ultracold gases. Certain aspects of these studies are relevant to neutron stars. We provide an overview of the characteristics of quantum vortices in s-wave-type fermionic and electrically neutral superfluids. The main focus is on the dynamics of fermionic vortices and their intrinsic structure.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between two gravitational lens equations in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virbhadra and Ellis have proposed a very accurate equation (referred to as VE equation) for the gravitational lens in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime [Phys. Rev. D 62,084003 (2000)], whereas an improved equation (referred to as OB equation) has been derived by Bozza [Phys. Rev. D 78, 103005 (2008)] based on a relation found by Ohanian [Am. J. Phys. 55, 428 (1987)]. The OB equation was rediscovered later by Takizawa, Ono and Asada [Phys. Rev. D, 102, 064060 (2020)]. VE and OB equations seem to be very different from each other. The present paper shows that there exists an unphysical branch in the VE equation. Consequently, the VE equation can be improved by removing the unphysical branch. The improved version of the VE equation is found to be the same as the OB equation when a suitable transformation is made between the deflection angles defined differently in the two formulations. An explicit expression of the transformation is found. We also argue possible numerical differences when the transformation between the deflection angles is ignored.</description>

      <title>Searching Accretion-Enhanced Dark Matter Annihilation Signals in the Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study reanalyzes the detection prospects of dark matter (DM) annihilation signals in the Galactic Center, focusing on velocity-dependent dynamics within a spike density near the supermassive black hole (Sgr~A$^{\star}$). We investigate three annihilation processes -- $p$-wave, resonance, and forbidden annihilation -- under semi-relativistic velocities, leveraging gamma-ray data from Fermi and DAMPE telescopes. Our analysis integrates a fermionic DM model with an electroweak axion-like particle (ALP) portal, exploring annihilation into two or four photons. Employing a comprehensive six-dimensional integration, we precisely calculate DM-induced gamma-ray fluxes near Sgr~A$^{\star}$, incorporating velocity and positional dependencies in the annihilation cross-section and photon yield spectra. Our findings highlight scenarios of resonance and forbidden annihilation, where the larger ALP-DM-DM coupling constant $C_{a\chi\chi}$ can affect spike density, potentially yielding detectable gamma-ray line spectra within Fermi and DAMPE energy resolution. We set upper limits for $C_{a\chi\chi}$ across these scenarios, offering insights into the detectability and spectral characteristics of DM annihilation signals from the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Higher-derivative corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the most complete analysis so far of quasinormal modes of rotating black holes in a general higher-derivative extension of Einstein's theory. By finding the corrections to the Teukolsky equation and expressing them in a simple form, we are able to apply a generalized continued fraction method that allows us to find the quasinormal mode frequencies including overtones. We obtain the leading-order corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode frequencies of all the $(l,m,n)$ modes with $l=2,3,4$, $-l\le m\le l$ and $n=0,1,2$, and express them as a function of the black hole spin $\chi$ using polynomial fits. We estimate that our results remain accurate up to spins between $\chi\sim 0.7$ and $\chi\sim 0.95$, depending on the mode. We report that overtones are overall more sensitive to corrections, which is expected from recent literature on this topic. We also discuss the limit of validity of the linear corrections to the quasinormal mode frequencies by estimating the size of nonlinear effects in the higher-derivative couplings. All our results are publicly available in an online repository.</description>

      <title>The next frontiers for magnetic monopole searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles (MMs) are well-motivated hypothetical particles whose discovery would symmetrize Maxwell equations, explain quantization of electric charge, and probe the gauge structure of the unified theory. Recent models predict MMs with low masses, reinvigorating searches at colliders. However, most theories predict composite MMs, whose production in parton-parton collisions is expected to be suppressed. The Schwinger process, whereby MM pairs tunnel through the vacuum barrier in the presence of a strong magnetic field, is not subject to this limitation. Additionally, the Schwinger cross section can be calculated nonperturbatively. Together, these make it a golden channel for low-mass MM searches. We investigate the Schwinger production of MMs in heavy-ion collisions at future colliders, in collisions of cosmic rays with the atmosphere, and in decay of magnetic fields of cosmic origin. We find that a next-generation collider would provide the best sensitivity. At the same time, exploiting the infrastructure of industrial ore extraction and Antarctic ice drilling could advance the field at a faster timescale and with only a modest investment. We also propose deploying dedicated MM detectors in conjunction with cosmic ray observatories to directly investigate if the unexplained, highest energy cosmic rays are MMs. Together, the proposed efforts would define the field of MM searches in the next decades.</description>
