      <title>Artificial intelligence in creating, representing or expressing an immersive soundscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's tech-driven world, significant advancements in artificial intelligence and virtual reality have emerged. These developments drive research into exploring their intersection in the realm of soundscape. Not only do these technologies raise questions about how they will revolutionize the way we design and create soundscapes, but they also draw significant inquiries into their impact on human perception, understanding, and expression of auditory environments. This paper aims to review and discuss the latest applications of artificial intelligence in this domain. It explores how artificial intelligence can be utilized to create a virtual reality immersive soundscape, exploiting its ability to recognize complex patterns in various forms of data. This includes translating between different modalities such as text, sounds, and animations as well as predicting and generating data across these domains. It addresses questions surrounding artificial intelligence's capacity to predict, detect, and comprehend soundscape data, ultimately aiming to bridge the gap between sound and other forms of human-readable data.  1.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm for Robust Source Separation in Smart City Acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cacophony of urban sounds presents a significant challenge for smart city applications that rely on accurate acoustic scene analysis. Effectively analyzing these complex soundscapes, often characterized by overlapping sound sources, diverse acoustic events, and unpredictable noise levels, requires precise source separation. This task becomes more complicated when only limited training data is available. This paper introduces a novel Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm (p-QIGA) for source separation, drawing inspiration from quantum information theory to enhance acoustic scene analysis in smart cities. By leveraging quantum superposition for efficient solution space exploration and entanglement to handle correlated sources, p-QIGA achieves robust separation even with limited data. These quantum-inspired concepts are integrated into a genetic algorithm framework to optimize source separation parameters. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on two datasets: the TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2020 Mobile dataset, representing typical urban soundscapes, and the Silent Cities dataset, capturing quieter urban environments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experimental results show that the p-QIGA achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting superior resilience to noise and limited training data, achieving up to 8.2 dB signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) in noisy environments and outperforming baseline methods by up to 2 dB with only 10% of the training data. This research highlights the potential of p-QIGA to advance acoustic signal processing in smart cities, particularly for noise pollution monitoring and acoustic surveillance.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalizability to Tone and Content Variations in the Transcription of Amplifier Rendered Electric Guitar Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcribing electric guitar recordings is challenging due to the scarcity of diverse datasets and the complex tone-related variations introduced by amplifiers, cabinets, and effect pedals. To address these issues, we introduce EGDB-PG, a novel dataset designed to capture a wide range of tone-related characteristics across various amplifier-cabinet configurations. In addition, we propose the Tone-informed Transformer (TIT), a Transformer-based transcription model enhanced with a tone embedding mechanism that leverages learned representations to improve the model's adaptability to tone-related nuances. Experiments demonstrate that TIT, trained on EGDB-PG, outperforms existing baselines across diverse amplifier types, with transcription accuracy improvements driven by the dataset's diversity and the tone embedding technique. Through detailed benchmarking and ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of tone augmentation, content augmentation, audio normalization, and tone embedding on transcription performance. This work advances electric guitar transcription by overcoming limitations in dataset diversity and tone modeling, providing a robust foundation for future research.</description>

      <title>SlimSpeech: Lightweight and Efficient Text-to-Speech with Slim Rectified Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, flow matching based speech synthesis has significantly enhanced the quality of synthesized speech while reducing the number of inference steps. In this paper, we introduce SlimSpeech, a lightweight and efficient speech synthesis system based on rectified flow. We have built upon the existing speech synthesis method utilizing the rectified flow model, modifying its structure to reduce parameters and serve as a teacher model. By refining the reflow operation, we directly derive a smaller model with a more straight sampling trajectory from the larger model, while utilizing distillation techniques to further enhance the model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method, with significantly reduced model parameters, achieves comparable performance to larger models through one-step sampling.</description>

      <title>Empowering Global Voices: A Data-Efficient, Phoneme-Tone Adaptive Approach to High-Fidelity Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) technology has achieved impressive results for widely spoken languages, yet many under-resourced languages remain challenged by limited data and linguistic complexities. In this paper, we present a novel methodology that integrates a data-optimized framework with an advanced acoustic model to build high-quality TTS systems for low-resource scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Thai as an illustrative case, where intricate phonetic rules and sparse resources are effectively addressed. Our method enables zero-shot voice cloning and improved performance across diverse client applications, ranging from finance to healthcare, education, and law. Extensive evaluations - both subjective and objective - confirm that our model meets state-of-the-art standards, offering a scalable solution for TTS production in data-limited settings, with significant implications for broader industry adoption and multilingual accessibility.</description>

      <title>Taming Data and Transformers for Scalable Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scalability of ambient sound generators is hindered by data scarcity, insufficient caption quality, and limited scalability in model architecture. This work addresses these challenges by advancing both data and model scaling. First, we propose an efficient and scalable dataset collection pipeline tailored for ambient audio generation, resulting in AutoReCap-XL, the largest ambient audio-text dataset with over 47 million clips. To provide high-quality textual annotations, we propose AutoCap, a high-quality automatic audio captioning model. By adopting a Q-Former module and leveraging audio metadata, AutoCap substantially enhances caption quality, reaching a CIDEr score of $83.2$, a $3.2\%$ improvement over previous captioning models. Finally, we propose GenAu, a scalable transformer-based audio generation architecture that we scale up to 1.25B parameters. We demonstrate its benefits from data scaling with synthetic captions as well as model size scaling. When compared to baseline audio generators trained at similar size and data scale, GenAu obtains significant improvements of $4.7\%$ in FAD score, $11.1\%$ in IS, and $13.5\%$ in CLAP score. Our code, model checkpoints, and dataset are publicly available.</description>

      <title>TangoFlux: Super Fast and Faithful Text to Audio Generation with Flow Matching and Clap-Ranked Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce TangoFlux, an efficient Text-to-Audio (TTA) generative model with 515M parameters, capable of generating up to 30 seconds of 44.1kHz audio in just 3.7 seconds on a single A40 GPU. A key challenge in aligning TTA models lies in the difficulty of creating preference pairs, as TTA lacks structured mechanisms like verifiable rewards or gold-standard answers available for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose CLAP-Ranked Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that iteratively generates and optimizes preference data to enhance TTA alignment. We demonstrate that the audio preference dataset generated using CRPO outperforms existing alternatives. With this framework, TangoFlux achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective benchmarks. We open source all code and models to support further research in TTA generation.</description>

      <title>EveGuard: Defeating Vibration-based Side-Channel Eavesdropping with Audio Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vibrometry-based side channels pose a significant privacy risk, exploiting sensors like mmWave radars, light sensors, and accelerometers to detect vibrations from sound sources or proximate objects, enabling speech eavesdropping. Despite various proposed defenses, these involve costly hardware solutions with inherent physical limitations. This paper presents EveGuard, a software-driven defense framework that creates adversarial audio, protecting voice privacy from side channels without compromising human perception. We leverage the distinct sensing capabilities of side channels and traditional microphones, where side channels capture vibrations and microphones record changes in air pressure, resulting in different frequency responses. EveGuard first proposes a perturbation generator model (PGM) that effectively suppresses sensor-based eavesdropping while maintaining high audio quality. Second, to enable end-to-end training of PGM, we introduce a new domain translation task called Eve-GAN for inferring an eavesdropped signal from a given audio. We further apply few-shot learning to mitigate the data collection overhead for Eve-GAN training. Our extensive experiments show that EveGuard achieves a protection rate of more than 97 percent from audio classifiers and significantly hinders eavesdropped audio reconstruction. We further validate the performance of EveGuard across three adaptive attack mechanisms. We have conducted a user study to verify the perceptual quality of our perturbed audio.</description>
