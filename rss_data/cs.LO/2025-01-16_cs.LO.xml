      <title>Synthesis of Infinite State Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Church synthesis problem, solved by Buchi and Landweber, treats the synthesis of finite state systems. The synthesis of infinite state systems, on the other hand, has only been investigated few times since then, with no complete or systematic solution.
  We present a systematic study of the synthesis of infinite state systems. The main step involves the synthesis of MSO-definable parity games, which is, finding MSO-definable uniform memoryless winning strategies for these games.</description>

      <title>Formulas as Processes, Deadlock-Freedom as Choreographies (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to studying properties of processes in the {\pi}-calculus based on a processes-as-formulas interpretation, by establishing a correspondence between specific sequent calculus derivations and computation trees in the reduction semantics of the recursion-free {\pi}-calculus. Our method provides a simple logical characterisation of deadlock-freedom for the recursion- and race-free fragment of the {\pi}-calculus, supporting key features such as cyclic dependencies and an independence of the name restriction and parallel operators. Based on this technique, we establish a strong completeness result for a nontrivial choreographic language: all deadlock-free and race-free finite {\pi}-calculus processes composed in parallel at the top level can be faithfully represented by a choreography. With these results, we show how the paradigm of computation-as-derivation extends the reach of logical methods for the study of concurrency, by bridging important gaps between logic, the expressiveness of the {\pi}-calculus, and the expressiveness of choreographic languages.</description>

      <title>Computing Approximated Fixpoints via Dampened Mann Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixpoints are ubiquitous in computer science and when dealing with quantitative semantics and verification one is commonly led to consider least fixpoints of (higher-dimensional) functions over the nonnegative reals. We show how to approximate the least fixpoint of such functions, focusing on the case in which they are not known precisely, but represented by a sequence of approximating functions that converge to them. We concentrate on monotone and non-expansive functions, for which uniqueness of fixpoints is not guaranteed and standard fixpoint iteration schemes might get stuck at a fixpoint that is not the least. Our main contribution is the identification of an iteration scheme, a variation of Mann iteration with a dampening factor, which, under suitable conditions, is shown to guarantee convergence to the least fixpoint of the function of interest. We then argue that these results are relevant in the context of model-based reinforcement learning for Markov decision processes (MDPs), showing that the proposed iteration scheme instantiates to MDPs and allows us to derive convergence to the optimal expected return. More generally, we show that our results can be used to iterate to the least fixpoint almost surely for systems where the function of interest can be approximated with given probabilistic error bounds, as it happens for probabilistic systems, such as simple stochastic games, that can be explored via sampling.</description>

      <title>Formal Model Guided Conformance Testing for Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern blockchains increasingly consist of multiple clients that implement the blockchain protocol. If there is a semantic mismatch between the protocol implementations, the blockchain can permanently split and introduce new attack vectors. Current ad-hoc test suites for client implementations are not sufficient to ensure a high degree of protocol conformance. As an alternative, we present a framework that performs protocol conformance testing using a formal model of the protocol and an implementation running inside a deterministic blockchain simulator. Our framework consists of two complementary workflows that use the components as trace generators and checkers. Our insight is that both workflows are needed to detect all types of violations. We have applied and demonstrated the utility of our framework on an industrial strength consensus protocol.</description>

      <title>Evaluating SAT and SMT Solvers on Large-Scale Sudoku Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern SMT solvers have revolutionized the approach to constraint satisfaction problems by integrating advanced theory reasoning and encoding techniques. In this work, we evaluate the performance of modern SMT solvers in Z3, CVC5 and DPLL(T) against a standard SAT solver in DPLL. By benchmarking these solvers on novel, diverse 25x25 Sudoku puzzles of various difficulty levels created by our improved Sudoku generator, we examine the impact of advanced theory reasoning and encoding techniques. Our findings demonstrate that modern SMT solvers significantly outperform classical SAT solvers. This work highlights the evolution of logical solvers and exemplifies the utility of SMT solvers in addressing large-scale constraint satisfaction problems.</description>

      <title>On the generalized coloring numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08698v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \emph{coloring number} $\mathrm{col}(G)$ of a graph $G$, which is equal to the \emph{degeneracy} of $G$ plus one, provides a very useful measure for the uniform sparsity of $G$. The coloring number is generalized by three series of measures, the \emph{generalized coloring numbers}. These are the \emph{$r$-admissibility} $\mathrm{adm}_r(G)$, the \emph{strong $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{col}_r(G)$ and the \emph{weak $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)$, where $r$ is an integer parameter. The generalized coloring numbers measure the edge density of bounded-depth minors and thereby provide an even more uniform measure of sparsity of graphs. They have found many applications in graph theory and in particular play a key role in the theory of bounded expansion and nowhere dense graph classes introduced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez. We overview combinatorial and algorithmic applications of the generalized coloring numbers, emphasizing new developments in this area. We also present a simple proof for the existence of uniform orders and improve known bounds, e.g., for the weak coloring numbers on graphs with excluded topological minors.</description>

      <title>Taint Analysis for Graph APIs Focusing on Broken Access Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph APIs are capable of flexibly retrieving or manipulating graph-structured data over the web. This rather novel type of APIs presents new challenges when it comes to properly securing the APIs against the usual web application security risks, e.g., broken access control. A prominent security testing approach is taint analysis, which traces tainted, i.e., security-relevant, data from sources (where tainted data is inserted) to sinks (where the use of tainted data may lead to a security risk), over the information flow in an application.
  We present a first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis for Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes in the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use critical pair analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the CPA is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API.</description>

      <title>Local structure of idempotent algebras I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.09599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We refine and advance the study of the local structure of idempotent finite algebras started in [A.Bulatov, The Graph of a Relational Structure and Constraint Satisfaction Problems, LICS, 2004]. We introduce a graph-like structure on an arbitrary finite idempotent algebra including those admitting type 1. We show that this graph is connected, its edges can be classified into 4 types corresponding to the local behavior (set, semilattice, majority, or affine) of certain term operations. We also show that if the variety generated by the algebra omits type 1, then the structure of the algebra can be `improved' without introducing type 1 by choosing an appropriate reduct of the original algebra. Taylor minimal idempotent algebras introduced recently is a special case of such reducts. Then we refine this structure demonstrating that the edges of the graph of an algebra omitting type 1 can be made `thin', that is, there are term operations that behave very similar to semilattice, majority, or affine operations on 2-element subsets of the algebra. Finally, we prove certain connectivity properties of the refined structures.
  This research is motivated by the study of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem, although the problem itself does not really show up in this paper.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we continue the study of edge-colored graphs associated with finite idempotent algebras initiated in arXiv:2006.09599. We prove stronger connectivity properties of such graphs that will allows us to demonstrate several useful structural features of subdirect products of idempotent algebras such as rectangularity and 2-decomposition.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Problems in Protocol Analysis: Extending the Notion of Subterm Convergent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new form of restricted term rewrite system, the graph-embedded term rewrite system. These systems, and thus the name, are inspired by the graph minor relation and are more flexible extensions of the well-known homeomorphic-embedded property of term rewrite systems. As a motivating application area, we consider the symbolic analysis of security protocols, and more precisely the two knowledge problems defined by the deduction problem and the static equivalence problem. In this field restricted term rewrite systems, such as subterm convergent ones, have proven useful since the knowledge problems are decidable for such systems. Many of the same decision procedures still work for examples of systems which are "beyond subterm convergent". However, the applicability of the corresponding decision procedures to these examples must often be proven on an individual basis. This is due to the problem that they don't fit into an existing syntactic definition for which the procedures are known to work. Here we show that many of these systems belong to a particular subclass of graph-embedded convergent systems, called contracting convergent systems. On the one hand, we show that the knowledge problems are decidable for the subclass of contracting convergent systems. On the other hand, we show that the knowledge problems are undecidable for the class of graph-embedded systems. Going further, we compare and contrast these graph embedded systems with several notions and properties already known in the protocol analysis literature. Finally, we provide several combination results, both for the combination of multiple contracting convergent systems, and then for the combination of contracting convergent systems with particular permutative equational theories.</description>
