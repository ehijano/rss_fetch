      <title>Spinning Black Binaries in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct stationary, rotating black binaries in general relativity with a positive cosmological constant. We consider identical black holes with either aligned or anti-aligned spins. Both cases have less entropy than the corresponding single Kerr/Schwarzschild de Sitter black hole with the same total angular momentum and cosmological horizon entropy. Our solutions establish continuous non-uniqueness in general relativity without matter. They also provide initial data for the spinning binary merger problem (when orbital angular momentum is added).</description>

      <title>Flux-balance laws for spinning bodies under the gravitational self-force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of an extended, but still weakly gravitating body in general relativity can often be determined by a set of conserved quantities. If they are sufficient in number, this allows for a complete solution to the equations of motion, much like for geodesic motion. Under the gravitational self-force (relaxing the "weakly gravitating" assumption), these "conserved quantities" evolve with time. This evolution can be calculated using the (local) self-force on the body, but such an approach is computationally intensive. To avoid this, one often instead uses flux-balance laws: relationships between the average evolution (capturing the dissipative dynamics) and the values of the field far away from the body, which are far easier to compute. In the absence of spin, such a flux-balance law has been proven in [Isoyama et al., 2019] for any of the conserved action variables appearing in a Hamiltonian formulation of geodesic motion in the Kerr spacetime. In this paper, we attempt to extend this flux-balance law to linear order in spin, in the context of an arbitrary black hole spacetime, and in a way that directly relates the average rates of change to the flux of a conserved current through the horizon and to infinity. In the absence of spin, we reproduce results consistent with those in [Isoyama et al., 2019]. To linear order in spin we show that most, but not all, constants of motion at linear order in spin appear to possess flux-balance laws.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic non-singular quantum bounce as a seesaw and amplification mechanism for magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of a homogeneous magnetic field within Bianchi-I loop quantum cosmology, in which the big bang singularity is replaced with an anisotropic quantum bounce. Using effective spacetime description, we conduct extensive numerical simulations with randomized initial conditions for two cases: first in the presence of a pure homogeneous magnetic field and then adding a massless scalar field that effectively captures the bounce regime even in the presence of inflationary potentials. For a cigar-like approach to the classical big bang, which is far more prevalent than a point-like approach, the quantum geometric bounce acts as a seesaw mechanism for magnetic field energy density. Due to the seesaw mechanism, the magnetic field energy density gets amplified by several orders of magnitude across the bounce for a small pre-bounce value of magnetic field energy density, or vice versa. In the presence of the scalar field, the seesaw mechanism is completely replaced by amplification of the magnetic field across the bounce when the initial energy density of the scalar field significantly dominates. When the universe has a point-like approach to the classical big bang, the seesaw mechanism is absent, and magnetic field energy density experiences amplification or suppression across the non-singular bounce depending on initial densities.</description>

      <title>Evolution of perturbations in the model of Tsallis holographic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated evolution of metric and density perturbations for Tsallis model of holographic dark energy with energy density $\sim L^{2\gamma - 4}$, where $L$ is length of event horizon or inverse Hubble parameter and $\gamma$ is parameter of non-additivity close to $1$. Because holographic dark energy is not an ordinary cosmological fluid but a phenomena caused by boundaries of the universe, the ordinary analysis for perturbations is not suitable. One needs to consider perturbations of the future event horizon. For realistic values of parameters it was discovered that perturbations of dark energy don't grow infinitely but vanish or freeze. We also considered the case of realistic interaction between holographic dark energy and matter and showed that in this case perturbations also can asymptotically freeze with time.</description>

      <title>Effect of the spatial curvature on light bending and time delay in curved Einstein-Straus-de Sitter solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method of general applicability has been developed, whereby the null geodesic equations of the Einstein-Straus-de Sitter metric can be integrated simultaneously in terms of the curvature constant $k$. The purpose is to generalize the computation of light deflection and time delay by a spherical mass distribution. Assuming a flat Universe with most recent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, five time delays between the four bright images of the lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112 have been forecasted and compared to others in the field. In addition, we have reviewed the question of the possible contribution of a positive $\Lambda$ to reduce the light bending, and concluded that the changes are seemingly too small to be appreciable on cosmological scales. The same conclusion has been reached regarding the time delay. Having addressed the question of the effect of the spatial curvature in both closed and open Universe, we have found that the strong lensing is slightly affected by the expected small curvature density $\Omega_{k0}$ of the current Universe within its error bar $|\Omega_{k0}|\lessapprox 0.001$, in such a way that it may safely be neglected. However, it's only if $\Omega_{k0}$ gets quite larger that the effect being noticeable. While it is only theoretically possible for $\Omega_{k0}$ to be higher, it's worthwhile to stress that this should impact the light bending and time delay, causing them to decrease or increase depending upon whether the spatial curvature is positive or negative. Furthermore, one can infer that the observed light deflection and time delay independently, that are found to be significantly deviated from those of the flat Universe, may serve as a useful means to provide constraints on $\Omega _{k0}$, thus making the approach employed in this work more promising than others.</description>

      <title>Ward identities under the frame transformations in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories of gravity are considered to be competitors to Einstein's theory of general relativity for the description of classical gravity, as they are used to build feasible models for cosmic inflation. These theories can be formulated both in the Jordan and Einstein frame, which are related by a Weyl transformation with a field transformation, known together as a frame transformation. These theories formulated in the above two frames are often considered to be equivalent from the point of view of classical theory. However, this is no longer true from the quantum field theoretical perspective. In the present article, we show that the Ward identities derived in the above two frames are not connected through the frame transformation. This shows that the quantum field theories formulated in these two frames are not equivalent to each other. Moreover, this inequivalence is also shown by comparing the effective actions derived in these two frames.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic relation on higher-dimensional black hole with arbitrary cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the Goon--Penco (GP) relation on higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes with an arbitrary cosmological constant. It was found that the GP relation retained its form in four- and higher-dimensional spacetimes. Thus, the reactions in the black holes are universal with respect to the dimensionality. Furthermore, the GP relation was found to be universal on any state of the black hole including near-extremal and near-Nariai cases. Thus, this study showed that the GP relation was prevalent for higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes with an arbitrary cosmological constant regardless of the initial state.</description>

      <title>Aspects of a novel nonlinear electrodynamics in flat spacetime and in a gravity-coupled scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) model with two dimensionful parameters is introduced and investigated. Our model obeys the Maxwellian limit and exhibits behaviour similar to the Born-Infeld Lagrangian in the weak field limit. It is shown that the electric field of a point charge in this model has a definite maximum value. Thus, the self-energy of the point charge is finite. The phenomenon of vacuum birefringence is found to occur in the presence of an external uniform electric field. Causality and unitarity conditions for all background electric fields hold, whereas, for magnetic fields, a restricted domain of validity is found. Moreover, a minimal coupling of Einstein's General Relativity (GR) with this NLE results in solutions of regular black holes or naked singularities, depending on whether the source is a nonlinear magnetic monopole or an electric charge, respectively.</description>

      <title>The solution to the Black Hole information paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information paradox suggests that the black hole loses information when it emits radiation. In this way, the spectrum of radiation corresponds to a mixed (non-pure) quantum state even if the internal state generating the black-hole is expected to be pure in essence. In this paper we propose an argument solving this paradox by understanding the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking when the black-hole selects one among the many possible ground states, emitting then radiation as a consequence of it. Here the particle operator number is the order parameter. This mechanism explains the connection between the density matrix corresponding to the pure state describing the black-hole state and the density matrix describing the spectrum of radiation (mixed quantum state). From this perspective, we can recover the black-hole information from the superposition principle applied to the different possible order parameters (particle number operators).</description>

      <title>Dynamical system analysis of quintessence dark energy model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our work deals with the dynamical system analysis of quintessence dark energy scalar field model with exponential potential. A dynamical system analysis has been applied at the background level. Using suitable transformation of variables, the evolution equations are reduced to an autonomous system for exponential form of the scalar potential. The critical points are analyzed with center manifold theory and stability has been discussed by using Schwarzian derivative. Finally, cosmological implications of the critical points are discussed and it is found that the stability of the late-time attractor changes for quintessence dark energy model.</description>

      <title>Strong field behavior of Wang-Yau Quasi-local energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look at the strong field behavior of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy. In particular, we examine the limit of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy as the defining spacelike 2-surface {\Sigma} approaches an apparent horizon from outside. Assuming any smooth isometric embedding, we find that the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy blows up in this limit, unless the horizon can be isometrically embedded into R3. Moreover, if the horizon cannot be embedded into R3, the optimal embedding equation is not solvable for {\Sigma} near the horizon. We discuss the implications of our results in the conclusion section.</description>

      <title>Searching for cosmological stochastic backgrounds by notching out resolvable compact binary foregrounds with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds can be of either cosmological or astrophysical origin. The detection of an astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave background with ground-based interferometers is expected in the near future. Perhaps even more excitingly, the detection of stochastic backgrounds of cosmological origin by future ground-based interferometers could reveal invaluable information about the early Universe. From this perspective, the astrophysical background is a {\it foreground} that can prevent the extraction of this information from the data. In this paper, we revisit a time-frequency domain notching procedure previously proposed to remove the astrophysical foreground in the context of next-generation ground-based detectors, but we consider the more realistic scenario where we remove individually detectable signals by taking into account the uncertainty in the estimation of their parameters. We find that time-frequency domain masks can still efficiently remove the astrophysical foreground and suppress it to about $5\%$ of its original level. Further removal of the foreground formed by unresolvable events (in particular, unresolvable binary neutron stars), which is about $10$ times larger than the residual foreground from realistic notching, would require detector sensitivity improvements. Therefore, the main limitation in the search for a cosmological background is the unresolvable foreground itself, and not the residual of the notching procedure.</description>

      <title>On bifurcation and spectral instability of asymptotic quasinormal modes in the modified P\"oschl-Teller effective potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The P\"ochl-Teller effective potential mimics an asymptotically de Sitter black hole bounded by an event horizon and a cosmological one. Owing to the benefit of being analytically soluble, the asymptotic quasinormal modes in the modified P\"oschl-Teller potential have been extensively explored in the literature by various authors, and the results bear distinct features. Specifically, for small discontinuities placed at the potential's peak, Skakala and Visser showed that the resulting modes lie primarily along the imaginary frequency axis, in line with the numerical results encountered for most black hole metrics. However, it was also suggested that under ultraviolet perturbations, asymptotic modes are expected to lie parallel to the real axis, closely intervening with recent developments on spectral instability. In this work, by numerical and semi-analytical approaches, we aim to resolve the above apparent ambiguity. The numerical scheme is based on an improved version of the matrix method, which is implemented in compactified hyperboloidal coordinates on the Chebyshev grid. It is demonstrated that both asymptotic behaviors indeed agree with the numerical findings, which is somewhat to one's surprise. Specifically, we report the emergence of a novel branch of purely imaginary modes originating from a bifurcation in the asymptotic quasinormal mode spectrum. Moreover, we demonstrate how the bifurcation and asymptotic modes evolve as the discontinuity moves away from the potential's peak, furnishing a dynamic picture as the spectral instability unfolds. It is further argued that they can be partly attributed to the observed parity-dependent deviations occurring for the low-lying perturbed modes of the original P\"oschl-Teller effective potential.</description>

      <title>Casimir Wormholes in Brans-Dicke Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years there has been a growing interest in the field of wormhole physics in the presence of the Casimir effect. As this effect provides negative energy density, it can be utilized as an ideal candidate for the exotic matter required for creating a traversable wormhole. In the context of modified theories of gravity such as Brans-Dicke (BD) theory \cite{BDTH}, wormhole geometries {have} been vastly investigated{. However}, the scientific literature is silent on the issue of BD wormholes in the presence of Casimir energy. Our aim in the present study is to seek for static spherically symmetric solutions representing wormhole configurations in BD theory with Casimir energy as the supporting matter. The Casimir {setup} we assume comprises two electrically neutral, infinitely large parallel planes placed in a vacuum. We then consider the Casimir vacuum energy density of a scalar field in such a configuration with Dirichlet {and} mixed boundary conditions. In the former case, the corresponding Casimir force is attractive and in the latter this force is repulsive. We present exact zero tidal force wormhole solutions as well as those with non-vanishing redshift function for both types of Casimir energies. The conditions on wormhole solutions along with the weak (WEC) and null (NEC) energy conditions put constraints on the values of BD coupling parameter. These constraints are also subject to the value of BD scalar field at the throat and the throat radius. We therefore find that BD wormholes in the presence of Casimir energy can exist without violating NEC and WEC (for the repulsive Casimir force). Finally, we examine the equilibrium condition for the stability of the obtained solutions using Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The McVittie-Plummer spacetime is a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological model that represents a spherical star system embedded in a standard FLRW cosmological model. We study the main physical properties of this gravitational field. Regarding the interplay between the physics of the local system and the expanding background, we employ the Misner-Sharp mass-energy function to show that there is a relatively weak time-dependent general relativistic coupling between the astrophysical system and the background FLRW cosmological model. The coupling term is proportional to the inverse of the scale factor and decreases as the universe expands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are open systems which, when perturbed, radiate quasi-normal modes (QNMs) to infinity. By contrast, laboratory analogues are necessarily finite-sized, presenting a potential obstacle to exciting QNMs in the lab. In this study, we investigate how the QNM spectrum of a toy-model black hole is modified when the system is enclosed by a partially reflecting wall. Counter to expectation, we demonstrate that QNMs not only persist in finite-sized systems, but the number of accessible modes increases. Furthermore, we show that QNMs in this set-up can be easily excited by incoherent background noise. Our findings align with studies exploring the spectral stability of black holes, such as those examining small modifications of the surrounding gravitational field. Importantly, our work paves the way for exploring spectral stability in laboratory systems, enabling experimental investigation of black hole features in closed systems.</description>

      <title>Exact black hole solutions in scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Relativity allows for a unique black hole solution, characterized by its mass M, angular momentum J, and electric charge Q. Black holes in General Relativity are thus said to have no hair, that is, no other independent physical quantity (no-hair theorem). Despite the numerous successes of General Relativity, some limitations remain, like the central singularity possessed by black holes, where the curvature of spacetime becomes infinite. Modified theories of gravity try to solve some of these shortcomings. This thesis tests the no-hair theorem in a popular modification of gravity, called scalar-tensor theories, where a unique degree of freedom (a scalar field) is added on top of the usual metric of spacetime of General Relativity. Using various symmetries, new black holes, called hairy black holes, are obtained. Some of them evade strongly the no-hair theorem, being characterized by a new quantity (primary scalar hair), distinct from M, J or Q. An interesting progress is also achieved, since in certain cases, the usual singularity disappears: the curvature of spacetime remains bounded even at the core of the black hole. Moreover, theoretical links are established between scalar-tensor theories (which take place in the usual four dimensions of spacetime), and theories of gravity in higher dimensions, by Kaluza-Klein reduction. Finally, certain particular properties of scalar-tensor theories enable to transform initial black hole solutions into other solutions with very distinct geometry, like wormholes or non-stationary black holes.</description>

      <title>Nonminimally coupled scalar field in Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetime: Geodesic synchrotron radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the scalar radiation emitted by a source interacting with a nonminimally coupled scalar field in four-dimensional Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetime. We obtain the emission probability using quantum field theory in curved spacetimes at tree level. We find that the source emits synchrotron-type radiation for orbits near the photon sphere for all allowed values of the parameters. We also find that the emitted power strongly depends on the coupling to the curvature scalar. In particular, the previously observed enhancement in the contribution of lower multipoles to the emitted power in this spacetime with minimal coupling is absent when conformal coupling is considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superradiant growth of massive vector fields in rotating black hole spacetimes has garnered significant attention in recent literature. However, the majority of these studies overlook the influence of a cosmological constant, which likely constitutes the primary energy content of our universe. In this paper, we extend recent research by incorporating a cosmological constant into the Einstein+Proca system and numerically evolving the resulting equations of motion. Utilizing the newly released GRBoondi numerical relativity code, designed specifically for the numerical evolution of (generalized) Proca fields, we discover that parameters causing a growing instability in the $\Lambda = 0$ scenario transition to a decaying state when $\Lambda &gt; 0$. This results in a more intriguing phenomenology. These simulations pave the way for future full Einstein+Proca simulations to explore the secular decay of the resultant cloud from gravitational emission.</description>

      <title>Enhancing noise characterization with robust time delay interferometry combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time delay interferometry (TDI) is essential for suppressing laser frequency noise and achieving the targeted sensitivity for space-borne gravitational wave (GW) missions. In Paper I, we examined the performance of the fiducial second-generation TDI Michelson configuration versus an alternative, the hybrid Relay, in noise suppression and data analysis. The results showed that both TDI schemes have comparable performances in mitigating laser and clock noises. However, when analyzing a chirp signal from the coalescence of massive binary black holes, the Michelson configuration becomes inferior due to its vulnerable T channel and numerous null frequencies. In contrast, the hybrid Relay is more robust in dynamic unequal-arm scenarios. In this work, we further investigate the noise characterization capabilities of these two TDI configurations. Our investigations demonstrate that hybrid Relay achieves more robust noise parameter inference than Michelson configuration. Moreover, the performance could be enhanced by replacing the T channel of hybrid Relay with the null stream from Sagnac configuration. The combined data streams, two science observables from the hybrid Relay and a null observable from the Sagnac, could form an optimal dataset for characterizing noises.</description>

      <title>Quasicircular Orbital Parameters for Numerical Relativity Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion, we extend the determination of quasicircular orbital parameters to be used by subsequent full numerical simulations to the 3.5PN order, and find that this leads to lower eccentricities, $e$, than with our previous method that used up to 3PN order. We also supplement the computation of the radial infall due to radiation reaction and the location of the center of mass to 3.5PN order, providing explicit formulas. In addition, we consider the small mass ratio limit by explicitly including the Schwarzschild and Kerr limits, the later in quasi-isotropic as well as in our standard use of ADMTT coordinates. We evolve binaries with a $q=1/16$ mass ratio by using 3PN, 3.5PN, 3.5PN+Schwarzschild, 3.5PN+KerrQISO and 3.5PN+KerrADMTT quasicircular data for three different configurations where the larger hole intrinsic spins are $\chi^z=-0.8$, $-0.4$ and $+0.8$. Using different measures of eccentricity from the black hole trajectories and from the waveform amplitudes and phases, we determine a systematic reduction of eccentricities with respect to the 3PN initial values by factors of up to an order of magnitude, and reaching the desired $e\sim10^{-3}$ threshold.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetric tensor influence on charged black hole lensing phenomena and time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the gravitational lensing of a charged black hole (spherically symmetric) within the context of Lorentz violation triggered by an antisymmetric tensor field. Our calculations consider two different scenarios: the weak and strong deflection limits. For the weak deflection limit, we employ the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to obtain our results. In the strong deflection limit, we utilize the Tsukamoto methodology, which provides measurable outcomes such as relativistic image positions and magnifications. Applying the latter methodology, we analyze the gravitational lensing by Sagittarius $A^{*}$ and derive the related observables, which are expressed as functions of the Lorentz violation parameter. Finally, the time delay is addrressed as well.</description>

      <title>Exploring the stability of $f(Q)$ cosmology near general relativity limit with different connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study cosmological spacetime configurations in f(Q) gravity with nonvanishing symmetric teleparallel connections. It is known that the spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic connections can be classified into three sets. Focusing on two of those, we explore the stability of cosmological background evolution near the general relativity regime across radiation, matter, dark energy, and geometric dark energy dominated eras. Our results show that for the standard connection set 1 the general relativity regime can be realized in two ways and both exhibit stable behavior throughout all evolutionary epochs. Conversely, for the alternative connection set 2 the trivial general relativity limit is stable, while the nontrivial option exhibits stability during the radiation era and marginal stability during the matter era, but for the dark energy and geometric dark energy eras our results are inconclusive. Furthermore, we discuss the general conditions on the function f(Q) that physically viable models should obey, and point out that for a generic f(Q) the alternative connection sets 2 and 3 are prone to trigger a sudden singularity. This can happen even near the otherwise good looking general relativity regime, as we demonstrate by an explicit numerical example. Hence the alternative configurations could be problematic already on the background level.</description>

      <title>ExaGRyPE: Numerical General Relativity Solvers Based upon the Hyperbolic PDEs Solver Engine ExaHyPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ExaGRyPE describes a suite of solvers for numerical relativity, based upon ExaHyPE 2, the second generation of our Exascale Hyperbolic PDE Engine. The presented generation of ExaGRyPE solves the Einstein equations in the CCZ4 formulation under a 3+1 foliation and focuses on black hole spacetimes. It employs a block-structured Cartesian grid carrying a higher-order order Finite Difference scheme with adaptive mesh refinement, it facilitates massive parallelism combining message passing, domain decomposition and task parallelism, and it supports the injection of particles into the grid as data probes or tracers. We introduce the ExaGRyPE-specific building blocks within ExaHyPE 2, and discuss its software architecture and compute-n-feel:
  For this, we formalize the creation of any specific simulation with ExaGRyPE as a sequence of lowering operations, where abstract logical tasks are successively broken into finer tasks until we obtain an abstraction level that can be mapped onto a C++ executable. The overall program logic is fully specified via a domain-specific Python interface, we map this logic onto a more detailed set of numerical tasks, subsequently lower this representation onto technical tasks that the underlying ExaHyPE engine uses to parallelize the application, before eventually the technical tasks are mapped onto task graphs including the actual PDE term evaluations, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and so forth. We end up with a rigorous separation of concerns which shields ExaGRyPE users from technical details and hence simplifies the development of novel physical models. We present the simulations and data for the gauge wave, static single black holes and rotating binary black hole systems, demonstrating that the code base is mature and usable. However, we also uncover domain-specific numerical challenges that need further study by the community in future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), an orbiting, multi-band, millimeter radio-telescope, in hybrid combination with millimeter terrestrial radio-telescopes, is designed to discover and measure the thin photon ring around the supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A*. As background to the BHEX instruments, this paper explores various aspects of the photon ring, focusing on the intricate flow of light around a spinning black hole, and tracking, through visual simulations, photons as they course along geodesics. Ultimately, the aim of these visualizations is to advance the foundational aims of the BHEX instrument, and through this experiment to articulate spacetime geometry via the photon ring.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between grey-body factors and quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes and grey-body factors are spectral characteristics corresponding to different boundary conditions: the former imply purely outgoing waves to the event horizon and infinity, while the latter allow for an incoming wave from the horizon, thus describing a scattering problem. Nevertheless, we show that there a link between these two characteristics. We establish an approximate correspondence between the quasinormal modes and grey-body factors, which becomes exact in the high-frequency (eikonal) regime. We show that, in the eikonal regime, the grey-body factors of spherically symmetric black holes can be remarkably simply expressed via the fundamental quasinormal mode, while at smaller l, the correction terms include values of the overtones. This might be interesting in the context of the recently observed connection between grey-body factors and the amplitudes of gravitational waves from black holes. The correspondence might explain why grey-body factors are more stable, i.e. less sensitive, than higher overtones to small deformation of the effective potential.</description>

      <title>Exploring wormhole solutions with global monopole charge in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the potential existence of traversable wormholes influenced by a global monopole charge within the $f(Q)$ gravity framework. To elucidate the characteristics of these wormholes, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of wormhole solutions employing three different forms of redshift function under a linear $f(Q)$ model. Wormhole shape functions were derived for barotropic, anisotropic, and isotropic Equations of State (EoS) cases. However, in the isotropic EoS case, the calculated shape function failed to satisfy the asymptotic flatness condition. Additionally, we observed that our obtained shape functions adhered to the flaring-out conditions under an asymptotic background for the remaining EoS cases. Furthermore, we examined the energy conditions at the wormhole throat with a radius $r_0$. We noted the influences of the global monopole's parameter $\eta$, the EoS parameter $\omega$, and $n$ in violating energy conditions, particularly the null energy conditions. Finally, we conducted a stability analysis utilizing the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equation and found that our obtained wormhole solution is stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future space-borne gravitational wave detector, Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), has the potential of detecting the fundamental fields, such as the charge and mass ultra-light scalar field. In this paper we study the effect of lighter vector field on the gravitational waveforms from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRI) system, consisting of a stellar-mass object and the massive black hole (MBH) in the Einstein-Proca theory of a massive vector field coupling to gravity. Using the perturbation theory, we compute the energy fluxes including the contributions of the Proca field and the gravitational field, then obtain the adiabatic inspiraling orbits and corresponding waveforms. Our results demonstrate that the vector charge and mass carried by the secondary body lead to detectable effects on EMRI waveform, and LISA has the potential to measure the mass of the Proca field with greater precision.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the influence of graviton fluctuations on the inflationary spectrum with a Kucha\v{r}-Torre clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the search for a coherent and consistent formulation to describe quantum gravity corrections to Quantum Field Theory. We implement two fundamental ingredients discussed in previous analyses: on one hand, the construction of the Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin and Born-Oppenheimer picture for the Wheeler-DeWitt theory of gravity and matter by using a reference fluid as physical clock; on the other hand, we explicitly separate in the metric field its own purely classical contribution from the quantum graviton degrees of freedom. This allows to derive, by the expansion in a Planckian parameter, a unitary theory properly evaluating the Quantum Field Theory modifications in the considered regime. More specifically, we recover at zero order the standard theory on curved space-time after averaging over the graviton sector. The physical corrections are induced at first order by (quantum) gravitons, thought as the slow-varying component of the system, as opposed to the fast quantum matter and reference fluid. The genuine contribution due to gravitons, non-factorizable into an independent phase, provides a coherent quantum gravity modification on Quantum Field Theory. We show this by determining the predicted inflationary spectrum during an exact de Sitter phase of the primordial Universe, finding a breaking of the scale invariant morphology even when the inflation potential is modelled by a cosmological constant term. Remarkably, the behavior of such non-scale-invariant spectrum overlaps predictions previously obtained in literature by neglecting non-unitary terms emerging in those formulations. In this respect, the present model provides a satisfactory regularization of such approaches, by virtue of a more realistic construction of the physical clock for the total (gravity + matter) quantum dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inflationary and pre-inflationary evolution of scalar modes of cosmological perturbations in a closed universe is analyzed for a loop quantum cosmology model with an inflationary regime consistent with the constraints on inflation derived from observations of the cosmic microwave background. The effective background dynamics includes a bounce induced by quantum gravity effects. Initial conditions for the perturbations are set before the bounce, and the perturbations are numerically evolved until the end of inflation, allowing the determination of the primordial power spectrum for comoving curvature perturbations. The power spectrum includes corrections due to the presence of spatial curvature and excitations produced before the onset of slow-roll inflation. The deviations from the usual power-law spectrum can be significant for observable modes even for spatial curvatures much smaller than the observational limit obtained without considering the pre-inflationary evolution of the perturbations.</description>

      <title>Getting More Out of Black Hole Superradiance: a Statistically Rigorous Approach to Ultralight Boson Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) superradiance can provide strong constraints on the properties of ultralight bosons (ULBs). Since most of the previous work has focused on the theoretical predictions, here we investigate the most suitable statistical framework to constrain ULB masses and self-interactions. We argue that a Bayesian approach provides a clear statistical interpretation, deals with limitations regarding the reproducibility of existing BH analyses, incorporates the full information from BH data, and allows us to include additional nuisance parameters or to perform hierarchical modelling with BH populations in the future. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using mass and spin posterior samples for the X-ray binary BH M33 X-7 and, for the first time in this context, the supermassive BH IRAS 09149-6206. We explain the differences to existing ULB constraints in the literature and illustrate the effects of various assumptions about the superradiance process (equilibrium regime vs cloud collapse, higher occupation levels). As a result, our procedure yields the most rigorous ULB constraints available in the literature, with important implications for the QCD axion and axion-like particles. We encourage all groups analysing BH data to publish likelihood functions or posterior samples as supplementary material to facilitate this type of analysis.</description>

      <title>Smooth reheating and dark matter via non-Abelian gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how a dark sector can provide a crucial link between a vacuum-dominated early universe and the later radiation-dominated epoch. As an example, we consider a feeble axion-like coupling of dark non-Abelian gauge fields with a single inflaton. In this scenario, a dark heat bath emerges at the end of inflation. As the dark sector cools down, its gauge fields confine into composite glueball states. The reheating of the visible sector is realized through portal interactions. After confinement, discrete symmetries protect part of the glueball states that form relic dark matter, while the others keep decaying into Standard Model degrees of freedom. The dark relic abundance depends mostly on the departure from equilibrium dynamics after the phase transition, constraining the confinement scale of the dark sector. Moreover, indirect detection and Big-Bang nucleosynthesis set bounds on the scale of portal interactions. We show that in a narrow but non-vanishing region of the parameter space, the correct dark matter abundance and sufficient reheating temperature are simultaneously reached.</description>

      <title>Kerr Effective Black Hole Geometries in Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the explicit embedding of the effective Kerr spacetimes, which are pertinent to the vanishing of static Love numbers, soft hair descriptions of Kerr black holes, and low-frequency scalar-Kerr scattering amplitudes, as solutions within N = 2 supergravity. These spacetimes exhibit a hidden $SL(2, R) \times U (1)$ or $SO(4, 2)$ symmetry resembling the so called subtracted geometries with $SL(2, R) \times SL(2, R)$ symmetry, which accurately represent the near-horizon geometry of Kerr black holes and, as we will argue most accurately represents the internal structure of the Kerr black hole. To quantify the differences among the effective Kerr spacetimes, we compare their physical quantities, internal structures, and geodesic equations. Although their thermodynamic properties, including entropy, match those of Kerr, our study uncovers significant differences in the interiors of these effective Kerr solutions. A careful examination of the internal structure of the spacetimes highlights the distinctions between various effective Kerr geometries and their quasinormal spectra.</description>

      <title>QCD-Gravity double-copy in the Regge regime: shock wave propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, we demonstrated a double-copy relation between inclusive gluon radiation in shock wave collisions of ultrarelativistic nuclei and inclusive graviton radiation in trans-Planckian gravitational shock wave collisions. We compute here the corresponding gravitational shock wave propagators in general relativity and demonstrate that they too obey a double copy relation to gluon shock wave propagators computed previously. These results provide key input in a renormalization group approach towards computing the high frequency radiation spectrum in close black hole encounters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For gauged scalar fields minimally coupled to Einstein-Maxwell theory, the Mayo-Bekenstein no-hair theorem can be circumvented when including appropriate scalar self-interactions, allowing static, electrically charged black holes to be endowed with (Abelian) gauged scalar hair. Here we show these spherically symmetric solutions can be extended to include a magnetic charge in a model with scalar multiplets. The resulting dyonic configurations share most of the properties of the electrically charged solutions, in particular satisfying the same {\it resonance} condition, with the existence of a mass gap with respect to the bald Reissner-Nordstr\"om dyonic black holes. A distinctive feature, however, is that no solitonic limit exists for a non-zero magnetic charge.</description>

Abstract: We study timelike and conventional entanglement entropy as potential probes of black hole singularities via the AdS/CFT correspondence. Using an analytically tractable example, we find characteristic behavior of holographic timelike entanglement entropy when the geometry involves a curvature singularity. We also observe interesting phenomena that, in some particular setups, holographic timelike and conventional entanglement entropy are determined from multiple complex saddle points, which fall outside the assumptions of the Lewkowycz-Maldacena type argument.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the binary viewing angle bias for standard sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inconsistency between experiments in the measurements of the local Universe expansion rate, the Hubble constant, suggests unknown systematics in the existing experiments or new physics. Gravitational-wave standard sirens, a method to independently provide direct measurements of the Hubble constant, have the potential to address this tension. Before that, it is critical to ensure there is no substantial systematics in the standard siren method. A significant systematic has been identified when the viewing angle of the gravitational-wave sources, the compact binary coalescences, is inferred inaccurately from electromagnetic observations of the sources. Such systematic has led to more than 10% discrepancy in the standard siren Hubble constant measurements with the observations of binary neutron star merger, GW170817. In this Letter, we develop a new formalism to infer and mitigate this systematic. We demonstrate that the systematic uncertainty of the Hubble constant measurements can be reduced to smaller than their statistical uncertainty with 5, 10, and 20 binary neutron star merger observations. We show that our formalism successfully reduces the systematics even if the shape of the biased viewing angle distribution does not follow precisely the model we choose. Our formalism ensures unbiased standard siren Hubble constant measurements when the binary viewing angles are inferred from electromagnetic observations.</description>

      <title>Kaniadakis entropy in extreme gravitational and cosmological environments: a review on the state-of-the-art and future prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kaniadakis ($\kappa$-deformed) statistics is being widely used for describing relativistic systems with non-extensive behavior and/or interactions. It is built upon a one-parameter generalization of the classical Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy, possessing the latter as a particular sub-case. Recently, Kaniadakis model has been adapted to accommodate the complexities of systems under the influence of gravity. The ensuing framework exhibits a rich phenomenology that allows for a deeper understanding of the most extreme conditions of the Universe. Here we present the state-of-the-art of $\kappa$-statistics, discussing its virtues and drawbacks at different energy scales. Special focus is dedicated to gravitational and cosmological implications, including effects on the expanding Universe in dark energy scenarios. This review highlights the versatility of Kaniadakis paradigm, demonstrating its broad application across various fields and setting the stage for further advancements in statistical modeling and theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Multi-spectral sirens: Gravitational-wave cosmology with (multi-) sub-populations of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic expansion rate can be directly measured with gravitational waves (GWs) of the compact binary mergers, by jointly constraining the mass function of the population and the cosmological model via the so called spectral sirens. Such a method relies on the features in the mass functions, which may originate from some individual sub-populations, and hence become blurred/indistinct due to the superposition of different sub-populations. In this work we propose a novel approach to constrain the cosmic expansion rate with sub-populations of GW events, named multi-spectral sirens. We illustrate the advantage of the multi-spectral sirens compared to the traditional spectral sirens by simulation with mock data. The application of this approach to the GWTC-3 data yields $H_0=73.25^{+29.87}_{-25.55}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ (median and symmetric 68.3\% credible level). The incorporation of the bright standard siren GW170817 with a uniform prior in $ [10,200] ~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ gives $H_0=72.38^{+15.03}_{-9.13}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ (68.3\% confidence level), corresponding to an improvement of $\sim28\%$ with respect to the measurement from sole GW170817.</description>

      <title>AsterX: a new open-source GPU-accelerated GRMHD code for dynamical spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present AsterX, a novel open-source, GPU-accelerated, fully general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code designed for dynamic spacetimes in 3D Cartesian coordinates, and tailored for exascale computing. We utilize block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) through CarpetX, the new driver for the Einstein Toolkit, which is built on AMReX, a software framework for massively parallel applications. AsterX employs the Valencia formulation for GRMHD, coupled with the 'Z4c' formalism for spacetime evolution, while incorporating high resolution shock capturing schemes to accurately handle the hydrodynamics. AsterX has undergone rigorous testing in both static and dynamic spacetime, demonstrating remarkable accuracy and agreement with other codes in literature. Benchmarking the code through scaling tests on OLCF's Frontier supercomputer, we demonstrate a weak scaling efficiency of about 67%-77% on 4096 nodes compared to an 8-node performance.</description>

      <title>Detection Prospects of Gravitational Waves from SU(2) Axion Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study detection prospects of a gravitational-wave background (GWB) sourced by SU(2) gauge fields considering all possible observational constraints. More precisely, we consider bounds set by cosmic microwave background measurements, primordial black hole overproduction, as well as backreaction of the gauge fields on the background evolution. Gravitational-waves data from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration show no evidence for a GWB contribution from axion inflation. However, we are able to place conservative constraints on the parameters of the SU(2) inflation with current data. We investigate conditions on the inflationary potential that would lead to a detectable signal that evades astrophysical and cosmological constraints and discuss detection prospects for third generation networks.</description>

      <title>New construction of a vacuum doubly rotating black ring by the Ehlers transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Ehlers transformation, we derive an exact solution for a doubly rotating black ring in five-dimensional vacuum Einstein theory. It is well-known that the vacuum Einstein theory with three commuting Killing vector fields can be reduced to a non-linear sigma model with $SL(3,{\mathbb R})$ target space symmetry. As shown previously by Giusto and Saxena, the $SO(2,1)$ subgroup in the $SL(3,{\mathbb R})$ can generate a rotating solution from a static solution while preserving asymptotic flatness. This so-called Ehlers transformation actually transforms the five-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole into the five-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole. However, unlike the case with the black hole, applying this method directly to the static black ring or the Emparan-Reall black ring, does not yield a regular rotating black ring due to the emergence of a Dirac-Misner string singularity. To solve this undesirable issue, we use a singular vacuum solution of a rotating black ring/lens that already possesses a Dirac-Misner string singularity as the seed solution for the Ehlers transformation. The resulting solution is regular, indicating the absence of curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and outside the horizon. We show that this solution obtained by the Ehlers transformation coincides precisely with the Pomeransky-Sen'kov solution. We expect that applying this method to other theories may lead to the finding of new exact solutions, such as solutions for black lenses and capped black holes, as well as black ring configurations.</description>

Abstract: A key attribute of dark energy is the equation of state parameter $w={\rm pressure}/{\rm energy~density}$, and this has been recently measured observationally, giving values close to $-1$. In this paper we calculate the $w$ parameter characterizing the novel Weyl scaling invariant dark energy that we have analyzed in a series of papers, and show that it is compatible with experiment. We also derive the atomic electron effective potential induced by dark energy from the electron geodesic equation, which can be applied to the evaluation of energy level shifts in Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>The Buchdahl Bound Denotes The Geometrical Virial Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we geometrically establish yet another correspondence between Newtonian mechanics and general relativity by connecting the Buchdahl bound and the Virial theorem. Buchdahl stars are defined by the saturation of the Buchdahl bound, $\Phi(R) \leq 4/9$ where $\Phi(R)$ is the gravitational potential felt by a radially falling particle. An interesting alternative characterization is given by gravitational energy being half of non-gravitational energy. With insightful identification of the former with kinetic and the latter with potential energy, it has been recently argued that the equilibrium of a Buchdahl star may be governed by the Virial theorem. In this paper, we provide a purely geometric version of this theorem and thereby of the Buchdahl star characterization. We show that the condition for an accreting Buchdahl star to remain in the state of Virial equilibrium is that it must expel energy via heat flux, appearing in the exterior as Vaidya radiation. If that happens then a Buchdahl star continues in the Virial equilibrium state without ever turning into a black hole.</description>

Abstract: Adopting the premise that the expected value of the quantum fluctuating metric is linear, i.e., $\langle g^{\mu\nu}\rangle=\alpha g^{\mu\nu}$, we analyze the modified gravity theory induced by the Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a matter field. This approach engenders the $f(R,T)$ gravity used to investigate the braneworld. In this scenario, considering a thick brane, the influence of metric fluctuations on brane dynamics is investigated. Consequently, one shows how the metric fluctuations influence the vacuum states. This influence has repercussions for modifying the brane energy and the asymptotic profile of the matter field. After noticing these modifications, we analyzed the most likely and stable structures from the matter field. One performs this analysis considering the theoretical measure of differential configurational entropy.</description>

We demonstrate that such a source causes a displacement memory effect close to future infinity that originates, in the even-parity sector, from a $\Lambda$-BMS transition between the two non-radiative regions of future infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15944v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a new solution to calculate the orbital periastron advance of a test body subject to a central gravitational force field, for relativistic theories and models beyond Einstein. This analitycal formula has general validity that includes all the post-Newtonian (PN) contributions to the dynamics and is useful for high-precision gravitational tests. The solution is directly applicable to corrective potentials of various forms, without the need for numerical integration. Later, we apply it to the Scalar Tensor Fourth Order Gravity (STFOG) and NonCommutative Geometry, providing corrections to the Newtonian potential of Yukawa-like form $V(r)=\alpha \frac{e^{-\beta r}}{r}$, and we conduct the first analysis involving all the PN terms for these theories. The same work is performed with a Schwarzschild geometry perturbed by a Quintessence Field, leading to a power-law potential $V(r)=\alpha_q {r}^q$. Finally, by using astrometric data of the Solar System planetary precessions and those of S2 star around Sgr A*, we infer new theoretical constraints and improvements in the bounds for $\beta$. The resulting simulated orbits turn out to be compatible with General Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Area metrics are an intriguing generalization of length metrics which appears in several quantum-gravity approaches. We describe the space of diffeomorphism-invariant area-metric actions quadratic in fluctuations and derivatives. A general theory is found to be specified by four parameters, two of which are mass parameters for the non-length degrees of freedom. We find that a two-parameter subclass of theories exhibits an additional shift symmetry of the kinetic term, and leads to a ghost-free graviton propagator for the effective theory obtained after integrating out the non-length degrees of freedom. One of the two parameters determines the strength of parity violations, the other defines a mass parameter for the non-length degrees of freedom. The same type of action has been found to appear from modified Plebanski theory and in the continuum limit of (effective) spin foams.
  We moreover find that area-metric actions in Lorentzian (but not in Euclidean) signature feature wrong-sign kinetic and mass terms for the non-length degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, despite a coupling of these degrees of freedom to the length metric, the linearized dynamics turns out to be stable for the above subclass of actions.</description>

      <title>Linear vs. nonlinear modeling of black hole ringdowns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ringdown (RD) phase of gravitational waves is of prime interest for testing general relativity (GR). The modelling of the linear quasi-normal modes (QNMs) within the Kerr spectrum -- or with agnostic parameterized deviations to that GR spectrum -- has become ordinary; however, specific attention has recently emerged to calibrate the effects of nonlinear perturbations for the predominant quadrupolar $l=2$, $m=2$ mode. In this paper, we test the performance of a few nonlinear toy models and of the nonlinear inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) model IMRPhenomD for faithfully representing the RD regime and we compare them with the results obtained using linear solutions as sums of QNM tones. Using several quasi-circular, non-precessing numerical waveforms, we fit the dominant $l=2$, $m=2$ mode of the strain, and we assess the results in terms of both the Bayes factor and the inferred posterior distributions for the mass and spin of the final black hole (BH). We find that the nonlinear models can be comparable or preferred over the linear QNM-only solutions when the analysis is performed from the peak of the strain, especially at high signal-to-noise ratios consistent with third-generation observatories. Since the calibration of the tones' relative amplitudes and phases in high-overtone models to the progenitor parameters is still missing, or even not achievable, we consider the use of non-linear models to be more pertinent for performing confident tests of general relativity based on the RD regime starting from early times.</description>

Abstract: This article, produced as part of an undergraduate research class, aims to provide an overview of gravitational waves, though it does not offer a comprehensive review. We begin with a brief discussion regarding the history of gravitational waves, beginning even before Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, highlighting important developments and milestones in the field. We then discuss the scientific significance of gravitational wave detections such as the verification of general relativity and key properties of black holes/neutron stars. We extend our analysis into various detection techniques including interferometer-based detectors (LIGO, Virgo, GEO600), pulsar timing arrays, and proposed space-based detectors (LISA, DECIGO, BBO). Finally, we conclude our review with a brief examination of the captivating event GW190521.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We delve into the first-order thermodynamics of Horndeski gravity, focusing on spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic cosmologies. Our exploration begins with a comprehensive review of the effective fluid representation within viable Horndeski gravity. Notably, we uncover a surprising alignment between the constitutive relations governing the "Horndeski fluid" and those of Eckart's thermodynamics. Narrowing our focus, we specialize our discussion to spatially flat Friedmann-Lema{\^i}tre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes. Within this specific cosmological framework, we systematically analyze two classes of theories: shift-symmetric and asymptotically shift-symmetric. These theories are characterized by a non-vanishing braiding parameter, adding a nuanced dimension to our investigation. On the one hand, unlike the case of the "traditional" scalar-tensor gravity, these peculiar subclasses of viable Horndeski gravity never relax to General Relativity (seen within this formalism as an equilibrium state at zero temperature), but give rise to additional equilibrium states with non-vanishing viscosity. On the other hand, this analysis further confirms previous findings according to which curvature singularities are "hot" and exhibit a diverging temperature, which suggests that deviations of scalar-tensor theories from General Relativity become extreme at spacetime singularities. Furthermore, we provide a novel exact cosmological solution for an asymptotically shift-symmetric theory as a toy model for our thermodynamic analysis.</description>

      <title>Constraining spherically symmetric metrics by the gap between photon rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of luminous matter that surrounds a black hole or some other sufficiently compact object produces an infinite sequence of images. Besides the direct (or primary) image, it comprises demagnified and deformed replicas of the original known as photon rings which are progressively nearing the boundary of the socalled shadow. In the present paper, we present analytical approximation formulas for higher-order photon rings for an asymptotically flat, static, spherically symmetric spacetime that admits a photon sphere. We consider a geometrically thin disk of light sources in the equatorial plane and an observer at arbitrary inclination far away from the center. Fixing the emission radius and leveraging the strong deflection limit, which provides an analytical logarithmic approximation for the deflection angle, we find the deformed shape of higher-order photon rings in the form of a polar equation on the observer's screen. It has been suggested by other authors to use the relative size of photon rings for characterizing the underlying spacetime. In particular, the relative separation between two neighboring photon rings, which we call "gap parameter", was considered. We analytically calculate the gap parameter of higher-order photon rings for metrics of the considered class that may depend on multiple parameters. The advantage of using this quantity is in the fact that, to within the assumed approximations, it is independent of the mass of the central object (or of some other characteristic parameter if the mass is zero) and of the distance of the observer. Measurements of the gap parameter, which may become possible in the near future, will restrict the spacetime models that are in agreement with the observations. Even without knowing the inner and outer radii of the shining disk, it will conclusively rule out some metrics. Some examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear quasinormal mode detectability with next-generation gravitational wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the aftermath of a binary black hole merger event, the gravitational wave signal emitted by the remnant black hole is modeled as a superposition of damped sinusoids known as quasinormal modes. While the dominant quasinormal modes originating from linear black hole perturbation theory have been studied extensively in this post-merger "ringdown" phase, more accurate models of ringdown radiation include the nonlinear modes arising from higher-order perturbations of the remnant black hole spacetime. We explore the detectability of quadratic quasinormal modes with both ground- and space-based next-generation detectors. We quantify how predictions of the quadratic mode detectability depend on the quasinormal mode starting times. We then calculate the signal-to-noise ratio of quadratic modes for several detectors and binary black hole populations, focusing on the ($220\times220$) mode - i.e., on the quadratic term sourced by the square of the linear $(220)$ mode. For the events with the loudest quadratic mode signal-to-noise ratios, we additionally compute statistical errors on the mode parameters in order to further ascertain the distinguishability of the quadratic mode from the linear quasinormal modes. The astrophysical models used in this paper suggest that while the quadratic mode may be detectable in at most a few events with ground-based detectors, the prospects for detection with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are more optimistic.</description>

      <title>Deflection of light rays in a moving medium around a spherically symmetric gravitating object</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In most analytical studies of light ray propagation in curved spacetimes around a gravitating object surrounded by a medium, it is assumed that the medium is a cold nonmagnetized plasma. The distinctive feature of this environment is that the equations of motion of the rays are independent of the plasma velocity, which, however, is not the case in other media. In this paper, we consider the deflection of light rays propagating near a spherically symmetric gravitating object in a moving dispersive medium given by a general refractive index. The deflection is studied when the motion of the medium is defined either as a radially falling onto a gravitating object (e.g., black hole), or rotating in the equatorial plane. For both cases the deflection angles are obtained. These examples demonstrate that fully analytic expressions can be obtained if the Hamiltonian for the rays takes a rather general form as a polynomial in a given momentum component. The general expressions are further applied to three specific choices of refractive indices and these cases are compared. Furthermore, the light rays propagating around a gravitating object surrounded by a generally moving medium are further studied as a small perturbation of the cold plasma model. The deflection angle formula is hence expressed as a sum of zeroth and first order components, where the zeroth order term corresponds to the known cold plasma case and the first order correction can be interpreted as caused by small difference in the refractive index compared to the cold plasma. The results presented in this paper allow to describe the effects caused by the motion of a medium and thus go beyond cold nonmagnetized plasma model.</description>

      <title>A dynamical systems formulation for inhomogeneous LRS-II spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a dynamical system formulation for inhomogeneous LRS-II spacetimes using the covariant 1+1+2 decomposition approach. Our approach describes the LRS-II dynamics from the point of view of a comoving observer. Promoting the covariant radial derivatives of the covariant dynamical quantities to new dynamical variables and utilizing the commutation relation between the covariant temporal and radial derivatives, we were able to construct an autonomous system of first-order ordinary differential equations along with some purely algebraic constraints. Using our dynamical system formulation we found several interesting features in the LRS-II phase space with dust, one of them being that the homogeneous solutions constitute an invariant submanifold. For the particular case of LTB, we were also able to recover the previously known result that an expanding LTB tends to Milne in the absence of a cosmological constant, providing a potential validation of our formalism.</description>

      <title>Radiation reaction in weakly magnetized black holes: can the tail term be ignored in the strong field regime?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study radiation from charged particles in circular motion around a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. In curved space, the radiation reaction force is described by the DeWitt-Brehme equation, which includes a complicated, non-local tail term. We show that, contrary to some claims in the literature, this term cannot, in general, be neglected. We account for self-force effects directly by calculating the electromagnetic energy flux at infinity and on the horizon. The radiative field is obtained using black hole perturbation theory. We solve the relevant equations analytically, in the low-frequency and slow-motion approximation, as well as numerically in the general case. Our results show that great care must be taken when neglecting the tail term, which is often fundamental to capture the dynamics of the particle: in fact, it only seems to be negligible when the magnetic force greatly dominates the gravitational force, so that the motion is well described by the Abraham--Lorentz--Dirac equation. We also report a curious "horizon dominance effect" that occurs for a radiating particle in a circular orbit around a black hole (emitting either scalar, electromagnetic or gravitational waves): for fixed orbital radius, the fraction of energy that is absorbed by the black hole can be made arbitrarily large by decreasing the particle velocity.</description>

      <title>Realistic models of general-relativistic differentially rotating stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General-relativistic equilibria of differentially rotating stars are expected in a number of astrophysical scenarios, from core-collapse supernovae to the remnant of binary neutron-star mergers. The latter, in particular, have been the subject of extensive studies where they were modeled with a variety of laws of differential rotation with varying degree of realism. Starting from accurate and fully general-relativistic simulations of binary neutron-star mergers with various equations of state and mass ratios, we establish the time when the merger remnant has reached a quasi-stationary equilibrium and extract in this way realistic profiles of differential rotation. This allows us to explore how well traditional laws reproduce such differential-rotation properties and to derive new laws of differential rotation that better match the numerical data in the low-density Keplerian regions of the remnant. In this way, we have obtained a novel and somewhat surprising result: the dynamical stability line to quasi-radial oscillations computed from the turning-point criterion can have a slope that is not necessarily negative with respect to the central rest-mass density, as previously found with traditional differential-rotation laws. Indeed, for stellar models reproducing well the properties of the merger remnants, the slope is actually positive, thus reflecting remnants with angular momentum at large distances from the rotation axis, and hence with cores having higher central rest-mass densities and slower rotation rates.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of AdS-Schwarzschild-like black hole in loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtained the metric of Schwarzschild-like black hole with LQG correction in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time under the assumption that cosmological constant is decoupled in loop quantum gravity (LQG), and investigated its thermodynamics, including equation of state, criticality, heat capacity and Gibbs free energy. $P$-$v$ graph is plotted and critical behavior has been calculated. It is found that due to LQG effect, quantum corrected Schwarzschild-AdS black hole has critical point and a critical ratio $7/18$. It is different from RN-AdS black hole $3/8$ (the same as Van der Waals system). But there are still some similarities compared to Van der Waals system, like same critical exponents and a similar $P$-$v$ graph. Moreover, it is concluded that energy-momentum tensor related to black hole's mass could break the usual first law. The modified first law will violate the conservation of Gibbs free energy during the first order phase transition. Joule-Thomson expansion is also studied. It is interesting that compared with Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, LQG effect leads to inversion points. The inversion curve divides $T$-$P$ coordinate system into two zones: heating region and cooling region, which is shown in inversion curves and isenthalpic curves detailedly. The results showed that there is a minimum inversion mass, which makes any black holes with a mass smaller than this value won't have inversion point.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological coupling of spherical, local astrophysical systems. We derive a general formula quantifying the cosmological coupling of the Misner-Sharp mass of these objects. We show that, in the weak-field limit, the cosmological coupling is only allowed if there are pressure anisotropies. We also apply our results to galaxies, modelling them with the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles. We show that the galactic mass can be coupled to the cosmological dynamics and examine its dependence on the scale factor of the universe.</description>

      <title>Structure formation in large-volume cosmological simulations of fuzzy dark matter: Impact of the non-linear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.01828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ultra-light bosonic particle of mass around $10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^2$ is of special interest as a dark matter candidate, as it both has particle physics motivations, and may give rise to notable differences in the structures on highly non-linear scales due to the manifestation of quantum-physical wave effects on macroscopic scales, which could address a number of contentious small-scale tensions in the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using a spectral technique, we here discuss simulations of such fuzzy dark matter (FDM), including the full non-linear wave dynamics, with a comparatively large dynamic range and for larger box sizes than considered previously. While the impact of suppressed small-scale power in the initial conditions associated with FDM has been studied before, the characteristic FDM dynamics are often neglected; in our simulations, we instead show the impact of the full non-linear dynamics on physical observables. We focus on the evolution of the matter power spectrum, give first results for the FDM halo mass function directly based on full FDM simulations, and discuss the computational challenges associated with the FDM equations. FDM shows a pronounced suppression of power on small scales relative to cold dark matter (CDM), which can be understood as a damping effect due to 'quantum pressure'. In certain regimes, however, the FDM power can exceed that of CDM, which may be interpreted as a reflection of order-unity density fluctuations occurring in FDM. In the halo mass function, FDM shows a significant abundance reduction below a characteristic mass scale only. This could in principle alleviate the need to invoke very strong feedback processes in small galaxies to reconcile $\Lambda$CDM with the observed galaxy luminosity function, but detailed studies that also include baryons will be needed to ultimately judge the viability of FDM.</description>

      <title>Brownian Motion in the Hilbert Space of Quantum States along with the Ricci Flow and Stochastically Emergent Einstein-Hilbert Action: Formulating a Well-Defined Feynman Path-Integral Measure for Quantum Fields in the Presence of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.09860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to interpret the background gravitational effects appearing in quantum field theory on curved space-time by studying the Brownian motion of quantum states along with the Hamilton-Perelman Ricci flow. It has been shown that the Wiener measure automatically contains the Einstein-Hilbert action and the path-integral formulation of the scalar quantum field theory on curved space-time at the first order of local approximations. This provides a well-defined formulation of the path-integral measure for quantum field theory in the presence of gravity. However, we establish that the emergence of Einstein-Hilbert action is independent of the matter field interactions and is a merely entropic/geometric effect stemming from the nature of the Ricci flow of the universe geometry. We also extract an explicit formula for the cosmological constant in terms of the Ricci flow and the Hamilton theorem for 3-manifolds. Then, we discuss the cosmological features of the FLRW solution in the LambdaCDM Model via the derived equations of the Ricci flow. We also argue the correlation between our formulations and the entropic aspects of gravity. Finally, we provide some theoretical evidence that proves the second law of thermodynamics is the basic source of gravity and probably a more fundamental concept.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the imaginary-time formalism for field theories in thermal equilibrium in uniformly accelerating frames. We show that under a Wick rotation of Minkowski spacetime, the Rindler event horizon shrinks to a point in a two-dimensional subspace tangential to the acceleration direction and the imaginary time. We demonstrate that the accelerated version of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition implies an identification of all spacetime points related by integer-multiple rotations in the tangential subspace about this Euclidean Rindler event-horizon point, with the rotational quanta defined by the thermal acceleration, $\alpha = a/T$. In the Wick-rotated Rindler hyperbolic coordinates, the KMS relations reduce to standard (anti-)periodic boundary conditions in terms of the imaginary proper time (rapidity) coordinate. Our findings pave the way to study, using first-principle lattice simulations, the Hawking-Unruh radiation in geometries with event horizons, phase transitions in accelerating Early Universe and early stages of quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: We show backreaction of quantum fields on black hole geometries can trigger new thermal phase transitions. Specifically, we study the phase behavior of the three-dimensional quantum-corrected static BTZ black hole, an exact solution to specific semi-classical gravitational equations due to quantum conformal matter, discovered through braneworld holography. Focusing on the canonical ensemble, for large backreaction, we find novel reentrant phase transitions as the temperature monotonically increases, namely, from thermal anti-de Sitter space to the black hole and back to thermal anti-de Sitter. The former phase transition is first-order, a quantum analog of the classical Hawking-Page phase transition, while the latter is zeroth-order and has no classical counterpart.</description>

      <title>Spacetime-Localized Response in Quantum Critical Spin Systems: Insights from Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, certain quantum many-body systems in $d$-dimensions are equivalent to gravitational theories in $(d+1)$-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes. When a massless particle is sent from the AdS boundary to the bulk curved spacetime, it reaches another point of the boundary after a time lag. In the dual quantum system, it should appear as if quasiparticles have been transferred between two separated points. We theoretically demonstrate that this phenomenon, which we call "spacetime-localized response," is actually observed in the dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model near the quantum critical point. This result suggests that, if we can realize a holographic spin system in a laboratory, the experimental probing of the emergent extra-dimension is possible by applying a designed stimulus to a quantum many-body system, which is holographically equivalent to sending a massless particle through the higher-dimensional curved bulk geometry. We also discuss possible experimental realizations using Rydberg atoms in an optical tweezers array.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Double-Cusp Spacetimes and long-time geometrizations</title>

Abstract: Since the early years of General Relativity, understanding the long-time behavior of the cosmological solutions of Einstein's vacuum equations has been a fundamental yet challenging task. Solutions with global symmetries, or perturbations thereof, have been extensively studied and are reasonably understood. On the other hand, thanks to the work of Fischer-Moncrief and M. Anderson, it is known that there is a tight relation between the future evolution of solutions and the Thurston decomposition of the spatial 3-manifold. Consequently, cosmological spacetimes developing a future asymptotic symmetry should represent only a negligible part of a much larger yet unexplored solution landscape. In this work, we revisit a program initiated by the second named author, aimed at constructing a new type of cosmological solution first posed by M. Anderson, where (at the right scale) two hyperbolic manifolds with a cusp separate from each other through a thin torus neck. Specifically, we prove that the so-called double-cusp solution, which models the torus neck, is stable under $S^1 \times S^1$ - symmetry-preserving perturbations. The proof, which has interest on its own, reduces to proving the stability of a geodesic segment as a wave map into the hyperbolic plane and partially relates to the work of Sideris on wave maps and the work of Ringstr\"om on the future asymptotics of Gowdy spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Study of a cubic cavity resonator for gravitational waves detection in the microwave frequency range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) of frequencies above MHz has recently received considerable attention. In this work we present a precise study of the reach of a cubic cavity resonator to GWs in the microwave range, using for the first time tools allowing to perform realistic simulations. Concretely, the BI-RME 3D method, which allows us to obtain not only the detected power but also the detected voltage (magnitude and phase), is used here. After analyzing three cubic cavities for different frequencies and working simultaneously with three different degenerate modes at each cavity, we conclude that the sensitivity of the experiment is strongly dependent on the polarization and incidence angle of the GW. The presented experiment can reach sensitivities up to $ 1 \cdot 10^{-19}$ at 100\, MHz, $ 2 \cdot 10^{-20}$ at 1\, GHz, and $ 6 \cdot 10^{-19}$ at 10\, GHz for optimal angles and polarizations, and where in all cases we assumed an integration time of $\Delta t = 1$ ms. These results provide a strong case for further developing the use of cavities to detect GWs. Moreover, the possibility of analyzing the detected voltage (magnitude and phase) opens a new interferometric detection scheme based on the combination of the detected signals from multiple cavities.</description>

      <title>Boundary Conditions for Extremal Black Holes from 2d Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We devise new boundary conditions for the near-horizon geometries of extremal BTZ and Kerr black holes, as well as for the ultra-cold limit of the Kerr-de Sitter black hole. These boundary conditions are obtained as the higher-dimensional uplift of recently proposed boundary conditions in two-dimensional gravity. Their asymptotic symmetries consist in the semi-direct product of a Virasoro and a current algebra, of which we determine the central extensions.</description>

      <title>Cornering gravitational entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new derivation of gravitational entropy functionals in higher-curvature theories of gravity using corner terms that are needed to ensure well-posedness of the variational principle in the presence of corners. This is accomplished by cutting open a manifold with a conical singularity into a wedge with boundaries intersecting at a corner. Notably, our observation provides a rigorous definition of the action of a conical singularity that does not require regularization. For Einstein gravity, we compute the R\'enyi entropy of gravitational states with either fixed-periodicity or fixed-area boundary conditions. The entropy functional for fixed-area states is equal to the corner term, whose extremization follows from the variation of the Einstein action of the wedge under transverse diffeomorphisms. For general Lovelock gravity the entropy functional of fixed-periodicity states is equal to the Jacobson--Myers (JM) functional, while fixed-area states generalize to fixed-JM-functional states, having a flat spectrum. Extremization of the JM functional is shown to coincide with the variation of the Lovelock action of the wedge. For arbitrary $F$(Riemann) gravity, under special periodic boundary conditions, we recover the Dong--Lewkowycz entropy for fixed-periodicity states. Since the variational problem in the presence of corners is not well-posed, we conjecture the generalization of fixed-area states does not exist for such theories without additional boundary conditions. Thus, our work suggests the existence of entropy functionals is tied to the existence of corner terms which make the Dirichlet variational problem well-posed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comformally flat spacetime converts the Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime into a z-dependent metric. We take advantage of this metric to solve Dirac equations in the AdS geometry analytically, including Dirac, Majorana, Dirac tachyon and Majorana tachyon. Constraints on Majorana wavefunctions limit the mass. Besides, there gives rise flatlands and Majorana particles hop in between, just mimicking the D-brane stack and open strings. Furthermore, a plausible way of ion-trapped experiment is suggested.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Model Proposal for Quantum Gravity and the Quantum Mechanics of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum mechanical theory of quantum spaces described by large $N$ noncommutative geometry as a model for quantum gravity. The theory admits fuzzy sphere as static solution. Over the fuzzy geometry, the quantum mechanics of the fermions is given by a sum of oscillators with equal frequency. The energy state where exactly half of the Fermi sea is filled contains the maximal amount of degeneracy. This state of the fuzzy sphere obeys the mass-radius relation of a Schwarzschild black hole if the fuzzy sphere is identified with the black hole horizon. Moreover the set of states in the Fermi sea gives precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We thus propose that quantum black holes are described by fuzzy spheres with a half-filled Fermi sea in our theory. We also consider a system of two fuzzy spheres by embedding them as blocks in the matrix quantum mechanics. When the distance $r$ between the two fuzzy spheres is small, the total energy of the system can be computed using perturbation theory. We show that in the leading order of large $N$ limit, the interaction energy depends on the product of the black holes masses and the Newton constant exactly as in Newton gravity. To extract the correct $r$ dependence in the long range, a resummation of all the large $N$ corrections is needed. We outline how Newton gravity for static sources may be reproduced in the long distance limit. We also show that the interaction energy is generally finite in the short distance limit, suggesting that the black hole singularity in general relativity is removed in our quantum description of black hole.</description>
