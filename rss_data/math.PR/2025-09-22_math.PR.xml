      <title>Understanding two-scale criteria for Poincar\'{e} and log-Sobolev inequalities in the Euclidean case through \Phi-entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study settings in which mixture and joint distributions satisfy a Poincar\'{e} (or log-Sobolev) inequality induced by a marginal and a collection of conditional distributions that are assumed to satisfy Poincar\'{e} (or log-Sobolev, resp.) inequalities and supported over Euclidean spaces. In this note, we use the framework of $\Phi$-Sobolev inequalities (Chafa\"{i}, 2004) to provide a unified approach to arriving at these inequalities in the Euclidean case. This results in a simpler proof technique for establishing these functional inequalities under certain two-scale criteria. We also discuss applications of these results to certain sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>On the pair correlation function of the Sine$_\beta$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Sine$_\beta$ process, the bulk point process scaling limit of beta-ensembles. We provide a representation of its pair correlation function for all $\beta&gt;0$ via a stochastic differential equation. We show that the pair correlation function is continuous in $\beta$, and provide estimates for its asymptotic decay. We recover the classical explicit formula for the pair correlation function in the $\beta=2$ and $4$ cases. For $\beta=2n$, we derive the power series expansion of the pair correlation function, and express it in terms of a size $n$ linear ordinary differential equation system. We obtain our results by studying the density of the $\operatorname{HP}_{\beta,\delta}$ process, the point process limit of the circular Jacobi beta-ensembles.</description>

      <title>Approximate Modeling for Supercritical Galton-Watson Branching Processes with Compound Poisson-Gamma Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study asymptotic properties of supercritical Galton-Watson (GW) branching processes in the asymptotic where the mean of the offspring distribution approaches 1 from above. We show that the population-size distribution of the GW branching processes at a sufficiently large generation in this asymptotic can be approximated by a compound Poisson-gamma distribution. Numerical experiments revealed that the compound Poisson-gamma models were in good agreement with the corresponding GW models for sufficiently large generations under a reasonable parameter regime. Our results can be regarded as supporting the use of the compound Poisson-gamma model as a model for cascaded multiplication processes, such as detection signals of electron multipliers and population sizes of individuals with specific biological characteristics.</description>

      <title>Continuity in $\xi$ and $\xi \to \infty$ tightness of the LQG metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the law of the $\gamma$-LQG metric (appropriately renormalized) is continuous in $\gamma \in (0,2)$ with respect to the local uniform topology of metrics on $\mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{C}$ whenever $\gamma$ lies on compact subsets of $(0,2)$. Moreover we show that as $\gamma \to 0$, the $\gamma$-LQG metric (appropriately renormalized) converges to the Euclidean metric with respect to the local uniform topology of metrics on $\mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{C}$. More generally, we show that the law of the LQG metric with parameter $\xi&gt;0$ (appropriately renormalized) is tight with respect to the topology on lower semicontinuous functions on $\mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{C}$ whenever $\xi$ lies on compact subsets of $(0,\infty)$, and any subsequential limit in law is non-trivial almost surely. If in addition we assume that the limit satisfies the triangle inequality almost surely, then it has the law of an LQG metric with an appropriate parameter $\xi$. Finally we examine the limit as $\xi \to \infty$, which is a regime that has not been studied before. More precisely we show that if $D_h^{\xi}$ denotes the LQG metric with parameter $\xi&gt;0$ (appropriately renormalized) associated with the whole-plane GFF $h$, the family of metrics $(D_h^{\xi})^{1 / \xi}$ is tight as $\xi \to \infty$ and any subsequential limit is non-trivial almost surely. If in addition we assume that the subsequential limit satisfies the triangle inequality almost surely, then the limit is a metric almost surely.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and Feller property for functional stochastic Hamiltonian systems with singular coefficients and state-dependent switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on a class of functional stochastic Hamiltonian systems with singular coefficients and state-dependent switching, in which the switching process has a countably infinite state space. First, by Girsanov's transformation, we establish the martingale solution of the system in each fixed switching case. Then, since the two components of the system are intertwined and correlated, we investigate the special case when the discrete component is independent of the continuous component. Based on these results, we obtain the well-posedness of the system with the aid of a martingale process. Finally, in order to establish the Feller property, we take advantage of appropriate Radon-Nikodym derivative and introduce a vector valued elliptic equation to handle the effect of the singular coefficients.</description>

      <title>A local limit theorem for lattice oscillating random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a local limit theorem for the Kemperman's model of oscillating random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$; it extends the existing results for classical random walks on $\mathbb Z$ or reflected random walks on $\mathbb N_0$. The key technical point is to control the long-term behavior of the embedding subprocess that characterizes the oscillations of the original random walk between $\mathbb Z^-$ and $\mathbb Z^+$ in both recurrent and transient cases. Then by combining an extension of \cite[Theorem 1.4]{gouezel} for the convergence of aperiodic sequence of renewal operators acting on a suitable functional Banach space and the decomposition of the trajectories of the random walk, we obtain the exact asymptotic for the return probability under some mild assumptions on the increment moments.</description>

      <title>An extended CIR process with stochastic discontinuities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an extension of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process that incorporates jumps at deterministic dates, referred to as stochastic discontinuities. Our main motivation stems from short-rate modelling in the context of overnight rates, which often exhibit jumps at predetermined dates corresponding to central bank meetings. We provide a formal definition of a CIR process with stochastic discontinuities, where the jump sizes depend on the pre-jump state, thereby allowing for both upwarrd and downward movements as well as potential autocorrelation among jumps. Under mild assumptions, we establish existence of such a process and identify sufficient and necessary conditions under which the process inherits the affine property of its continuous counterpart. We illustrate our results with practical examples that generate both upward and downward jumps while preserving the affine property and non-negativity. In particular, we show that a stochastically discontinuous CIR process can be constructed by applying a determinisitic cadlag time-change of a classical CIR process. Finally, we further enrich the affine framework by characterizing conditions that ensure infinite divisibility of the extended CIR process.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyzes and compares the asymptotic properties of the covariance matrices of vectors of volume power functionals of random Vietoris-Rips complexes, as the intensity of the underlying homogeneous Poisson point process grows. Several key results are established which, in particular, generalize well-known facts on random graphs. Findings regarding rank, definiteness, determinant, eigenspaces, and related decompositions are presented within three distinct regimes. Moreover, we derive stochastic applications of these algebraic properties, leading to interesting results for vectors of volume power functionals.</description>

      <title>Regularity properties of distributions of correspondences without countable generation: applications to large games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that each of the regularity properties of regular conditional distributions of correspondences (convexity, closedness, compactness, and preservation of closed graphs) is equivalent to the condition of nowhere equivalence. This result does not require any countable-generation assumptions. As an application, we establish the existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium for large games with general trait spaces. The trait space may be an arbitrary measurable space. As a corollary, we obtain the existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium in semi-anonymous settings in which payoffs depend, in addition to agents' own actions, on the joint distribution over the space of agents and actions.</description>

      <title>Mixing properties of some Markov chains models in random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov chains in random environments (MCREs) have recently attracted renewed interest, as these processes naturally arise in many applications, such as econometrics and machine learning. Although specific asymptotic results, such as the law of the large numbers and central limit theorems, have been obtained for some of these models, their annealed dependence properties, such as strong mixing properties, are not well understood in general. We derive strong mixing properties for a wide range of MCREs that satisfy some drift/small set conditions, with general assumptions on the corresponding stochastic parameters and the mixing properties of the environments. We then demonstrate the wide range of applications of our results in time series analysis and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, with fewer restrictions than those found in existing literature.</description>

      <title>Sharpness of the phase transition for constrained-degree percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider constrained-degree percolation on the hypercubic lattice. Initially, all edges are closed, and each edge independently attempts to open at a uniformly distributed random time; the attempt succeeds if, at that instant, both end-vertices have degrees strictly less than a prescribed parameter. The absence of the FKG inequality and the finite energy property, as well as the infinite range of dependency, make the rigorous analysis of the model particularly challenging. In this work, we show that the one-arm probability exhibits exponential decay in its entire subcritical phase. The proof relies on the Duminil-Copin--Raoufi--Tassion randomized algorithm method and resolves a problem of dos Santos and the second author. At the heart of the argument lies an intricate combinatorial transformation of pivotality in the spirit of Aizenman--Grimmett essential enhancements, but with unbounded range. This technique may be of use in other dynamical settings.</description>

      <title>Kingman's coalescent on a random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of Kingman's coalescent on $[n]$ that we call the Kingman coalescent on a graph $G = ([n],E)$. Specifically, we generalize a forest valued representation of the coalescent introduced in Addario-Berry and Eslava (2018). The difference between the Kingman coalescent on $G$ and the normal Kingman coalescent on $[n]$ is that two trees $T_1,T_2$ with roots $\rho_1,\rho_2$ can merge if and only if $\{\rho_1,\rho_2\} \in E$.
  When this process finishes (when there are no trees left that can merge anymore), we are left with a random spanning forest that we call a Kingman forest of $G$. In this article, we study the Kingman coalescent on Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs, $G_{n,p}$. We derive a relationship between the Kingman coalescent on $G_{n,p}$ and uniform random recursive trees, which provides many answers concerning structural questions about the corresponding Kingman forests. We explore the heights of Kingman forests as well as the sizes of their trees as illustrative examples of how to use the connection. Our main results concern the number of trees, $C_{n,p}$, in a Kingman forest of $G_{n,p}$. For fixed $p \in (0,1)$, we prove that $C_{n,p}$ converges in distribution to an almost surely finite random variable as $n \to \infty$. For $p = p(n)$ such that $p \to 0$ and $np \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$, we prove that $C_{n,p}$ converges in probability to $\frac{2(1-p)}{p}$.</description>

      <title>Weak Error Estimates of Ergodic Approximations for Monotone Jump-diffusion SODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first derive the exponential ergodicity of the stochastic theta method (STM) with $\theta \in (1/2,1]$ for monotone jump-diffusion stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs) under a dissipative condition. Then we establish the weak error estimates of the backward Euler method (BEM), corresponding to the STM with $\theta=1$. In particular, the time-independent estimate for the BEM in the jump-free case yields a one-order convergence rate between the exact and numerical invariant measures, answering a question left in {\it Z. Liu and Z. Liu, J. Sci. Comput. (2025) 103:87}.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition for Stochastic Block Model with more than $\sqrt{n}$ Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictions from statistical physics postulate that recovery of the communities in Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is possible in polynomial time above, and only above, the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold. This conjecture has given rise to a rich literature, proving that non-trivial community recovery is indeed possible in SBM above the KS threshold, as long as the number $K$ of communities remains smaller than $\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the observed graph. Failure of low-degree polynomials below the KS threshold was also proven when $K=o(\sqrt{n})$.
  When $K\geq \sqrt{n}$, Chin et al.(2025) recently prove that, in a sparse regime, community recovery in polynomial time is possible below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths. This breakthrough result lead them to postulate a new threshold for the many communities regime $K\geq \sqrt{n}$. In this work, we provide evidences that confirm their conjecture for $K\geq \sqrt{n}$:
  1- We prove that, for any density of the graph, low-degree polynomials fail to recover communities below the threshold postulated by Chin et al.(2025);
  2- We prove that community recovery is possible in polynomial time above the postulated threshold, not only in the sparse regime of~Chin et al., but also in some (but not all) moderately sparse regimes by essentially counting clique occurence in the observed graph.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of inverse random source problems for stochastic heat and wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates an inverse random source problem for stochastic evolution equations, including stochastic heat and wave equations, with the unknown source modeled as $g(x)f(t)\dot{W}(t)$. The research commences with the establishment of the well-posedness of the corresponding stochastic direct problem. Under suitable regularity conditions, the existence of stochastic strong solutions for both the stochastic heat and wave equations is demonstrated. For the inverse problem, the objective is to uniquely recover the strength $|f(t)|$ of the time-dependent component of the source from the boundary flux on a nonempty open subset. The uniqueness of the recovery for both the stochastic heat and wave equations is proven, and several numerical examples are given to verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Classical first passage problems for $p$-adic stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16096</link>

Abstract: In this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of the solution of the classical problem of finding the distribution density of a random variable - the first passage time to a given domain by the trajectory of a $p$-adic Markov stochastic process with probability density function satisfying the solution of the Cauchy problem for the Vladimirov equation (a $p$-adic analog of the Kolmogorov-Feller equation with the kernel of the Vladimirov operator) with uniform initial distribution in the unit ball. We consider three equivalent approaches to obtain equations for the distribution density of a random variable - the first passage time to a given domain by a stochastic trajectory. We find a solution to these equations for the distribution density, analyze its properties, and compare them with the properties of the distribution density of a random variable - the first return timeof a stochastic trajectory to the support of the initial distribution. We also solve the problem of finding the number of hittings a given domain and analyze the solution obtained. In conclusion, we discuss a class of problems related to the study of the distribution density of the passage time to a given domain and the return time to the initial domain for other types of $p$-adic Markov stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Estimating systematic errors in Bayesian inversion using transport maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In indirect measurements, the measurand is determined by solving an inverse problem which requires a model of the measurement process. Such models are often approximations and introduce systematic errors leading to a bias of the posterior distribution in Bayesian inversion. We propose a unified framework that combines transport maps from a reference distribution to the posterior distribution with the model error approach. This leads to an adaptive algorithm that jointly estimates the posterior distribution of the measurand and the model error. The efficiency and accuracy of the method are demonstrated on two model problems, showing that the approach effectively corrects biases while enabling fast sampling.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the discrete membrane model in four dimensions. We confirm the existence of the scaling limit of the intermediate (i.e., a multiple of the expected maximum) level-sets of the model, and show that it is equal in law to the sub-critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC) measure of the continuum membrane model.</description>

      <title>On the first and second largest components in the percolated Random Geometric Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The percolated random geometric graph $G_n(\lambda, p)$ has vertex set given by a Poisson Point Process in the square $[0,\sqrt{n}]^2$, and every pair of vertices at distance at most 1 independently forms an edge with probability $p$. For a fixed $p$, Penrose proved that there is a critical intensity $\lambda_c = \lambda_c(p)$ for the existence of a giant component in $G_n(\lambda, p)$. Our main result shows that for $\lambda &gt; \lambda_c$, the size of the second-largest component is a.a.s. of order $(\log n)^2$. Moreover, we prove that the size of the largest component rescaled by $n$ converges almost surely to a constant, thereby strengthening results of Penrose.
  We complement our study by showing a certain duality result between percolation thresholds associated to the Poisson intensity and the bond percolation of $G(\lambda, p)$ (which is the infinite volume version of $G_n(\lambda,p)$). Moreover, we prove that for a large class of graphs converging in a suitable sense to $G(\lambda, 1)$, the corresponding critical percolation thresholds converge as well to the ones of $G(\lambda,1)$.</description>

Abstract: The well-posedness is established for multi-dimensional mean-field stochastic Volterra equations with Lipschitz continuous coefficients and allowing for singular kernels as well as for one-dimensional mean-field stochastic Volterra equations with H\"older continuous diffusion coefficients and sufficiently regular kernels. In these different settings, quantitative, pointwise propagation of chaos results are derived for the associated Volterra type interacting particle systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove pathwise uniqueness for stochastic differential equations in infinite dimension. Under our assumptions, we are able to consider the stochastic heat equation up to dimension $3$, the stochastic damped wave equation in dimension $1$ and the stochastic Euler-Bernoulli damped beam equation up to dimension $3$. We do not require that the so-called {\it structure condition} holds true.</description>

      <title>Large graph limits of local matching algorithms on Configuration model graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a large-graph limit estimate of the matching coverage for several matching algorithms, on general graphs generated by the configuration model. For a wide class of {\em local} matching algorithms, namely, algorithms that only use information on the immediate neighborhood of the explored nodes, we propose a joint construction of the graph by the configuration model, and of the resulting matching on the latter graph. This leads to a generalization in infinite dimension of the differential equation method of Wormald: We keep track of the matching algorithm over time by a measure-valued CTMC, for which we prove the convergence, to the large-graph limit, to a deterministic hydrodynamic limit, identified as the unique solution of a system of ODE's in the space of integer measures. Then, the asymptotic proportion of nodes covered by the matching appears as a simple function of that solution. We then make this solution explicit for three particular local algorithms: the classical {\sc greedy} algorithm, and then the {\sc uni-min} and {\sc uni-max} algorithms, two variants of the greedy algorithm that select, as neighbor of any explored node, its neighbor having the least (respectively largest) residual degree.</description>

      <title>Permutation recovery of spikes in noisy high-dimensional tensor estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of gradient flow in high dimensions for the multi-spiked tensor problem, where the goal is to estimate $r$ unknown signal vectors (spikes) from noisy Gaussian tensor observations. Specifically, we analyze the maximum likelihood estimation procedure, which involves optimizing a highly nonconvex random function. We determine the sample complexity required for gradient flow to efficiently recover all spikes, without imposing any assumptions on the separation of the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). More precisely, our results provide the sample complexity required to guarantee recovery of the spikes up to a permutation. Our work builds on our companion paper [Ben Arous, Gerbelot, Piccolo 2024], which studies Langevin dynamics and determines the sample complexity and separation conditions for the SNRs necessary for ensuring exact recovery of the spikes (where the recovered permutation matches the identity). During the recovery process, the correlations between the estimators and the hidden vectors increase in a sequential manner. The order in which these correlations become significant depends on their initial values and the corresponding SNRs, which ultimately determines the permutation of the recovered spikes.</description>

      <title>Gaussian integrals on symmetric spaces (the complex case and beyond)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work is concerned with Gaussian integrals on simply connected non-positively curved Riemannian symmetric spaces. It is motivated by the aim of explicitly finding the high-rank limit of these integrals for each of the eleven families of classical Riemannian symmetric spaces. To begin, it deals with the easier complex case (where the isometry group admits a complex Lie group structure). To go beyond this case, it introduces a variational characterisation of the high-rank limit, as the minimum of a certain energy functional over the space of probability distributions on the real line. Using this new variational formulation, it is possible to recover the high-rank limit in closed form, from the expression originally found in the complex case. This two-step approach is illustrated through the examples of two kinds of symmetric spaces : symmetric cones and classical symmetric domains. Gaussian integrals on symmetric spaces, and particularly their high-rank limits, have proved important in both statistics and theoretical physics. The present work proposes an approach for dealing with these limits, which has the merit of yielding general, concrete, closed-form results.</description>

This new theoretically flexible framework generalizes the classical Cox-Ingersol-Ross model. The existence, uniqueness, and higher moment properties of solutions are analyzed.

Finally, a detailed analysis for It\^o vs Stratonovich interpretations of the proposed model is provided.</description>

      <title>A Parameterized Control Representation of G-Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel perspective that connects the abstract framework of $G$-expectation to a concrete parameterized family of classical stochastic processes, offering a unified viewpoint for nonlinear stochastic calculus under model uncertainty. We demonstrate that $G$-Brownian motion and related stochastic differential equations (G-SDEs) can be effectively interpreted as controlled processes $\{B_t^{\theta}\}_{\theta}$, where $\theta$ denotes an admissible control process taking values in a compact convex parameter set $\Theta$ encoding volatility uncertainty.
  The core contribution is the construction of a correspondence that preserves key operations, including addition, multiplication, function composition, and limit transitions. This perspective provides an alternative mathematical interpretation for understanding $G$-martingales, leading to a natural distinction between symmetric martingales (fair in all volatility scenarios) and asymmetric martingales (favorable but fair only in the worst-case scenario).
  We develop a methodology for solving G-SDEs through their parameterized representations, establishing existence and uniqueness results under standard Lipschitz and growth conditions. The framework illustrates how bounded control sets preserve these classical conditions while capturing volatility ambiguity.
  The parameterized control perspective offers both mathematical insight and computational practicality, facilitating the transfer of classical stochastic calculus results into the $G$-expectation framework while maintaining its essential sublinear structure.</description>

Abstract: This work focuses on a class of stochastic Hamiltonian type jump diffusion systems with state-dependent switching, in which the switching component has countably infinite many states. First,the existence and uniqueness of the underlying processes are obtained with the aid of successive construction methods. Then, the Feller property is established by coupling methods. Furthermore, the strong Feller property is proved by introducing some auxiliary processes and making use of appropriate Radon-Nikodym derivatives. Finally, on the basis of the above results, the exponential ergodicity is obtained under the Foster-Lyapunov drift condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $2023$, Defant and Li defined the Ungarian Markov chain $\mathbf{U}_L$ associated to a finite lattice $L$. This Markov chain has state space $L$, and from any state $x \in L$ transitions to the meet of $\{x\} \cup T$, where $T$ is a randomly selected subset of the elements of $L$ covered by $x$. For any lattice $L$, let $\mathcal{E}(L)$ be the expected number of steps until the maximal element of $L$ transitions into the minimal element in the Ungarian Markov chain. We show that $\mathcal{E}(L)$ is linear in $n$ when $L$ is the weak order on the symmetric group $S_n$, and satisfies an $n^{1-o(1)}$ lower bound when $L$ is the $n^\text{th}$ Tamari lattice. This completely resolves a conjecture by Defant and Li and partially resolves another.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we characterise the statistics of Markov chains by constructing an associated sequence of periodic differential operators. Studying the density of states of these operators reveals the absolutely continuous invariant measure of the Markov chain. This approach also leads to a direct proof of convergence to the invariant measure, along with explicit convergence rates. We show how our method can be applied to a class of related Markov chains including the logistic map, the tent map and Chebyshev maps of arbitrary order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate what we term ``generalized sup-convolutions". We show that functional inequalities that enjoy an interpretation as sup-convolution inequalities can be deduced from the special case of indicator functions corresponding to a geometric inequality. As consequences we derive a Borell-Brascamp Lieb inequality for the Gaussian Brunn-Minkowski inequality and give a functional analog of the log-Brunn-Minkowski conjecture. We also show that Barthe's reverse Brascamp-Lieb inequality is equivalent to the geometric inequality it implies and give a functional formulation of a conjecture of Schneider. Though we focus on Euclidean applications, our results are general and can be directly applied in more abstract settings, like groups or even topological measure spaces without algebraic structure, we instantiate this claim with a Borell-Brascamp-Lieb type inequality for nilpotent Lie groups.</description>
