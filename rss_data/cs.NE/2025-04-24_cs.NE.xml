      <title>DATETIME: A new benchmark to measure LLM translation and reasoning capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces DATETIME, a new high-quality benchmark designed to evaluate the translation and reasoning abilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) on datetimes. A datetime is simply a date and a time, for example '11th.february.2023 ,1:12:31'. Datetimes are an interesting domain because they are intuitive and straightforward for humans to process but present significant challenges for LLMs. At the time of writing, no publicly available benchmark exists for systematically evaluating LLMs on datetime processing. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art models exhibit significant difficulty with tasks involving reasoning on datetimes, and that General Artificial Intelligence is still a distant aspiration. We hypothesize that working with datetimes necessitates translation and/or computation capabilities, and the tasks of the benchmark are organized accordingly. Significant dispersion in performance across models is observed with surprisingly poor performance even on apparently trivial tasks. Whilst frontier models such as ChatGPT, Claude and Llama3.1 have evidently been built and trained with datetime reasoning abilities, significant improvement is required for the open-source models.</description>

      <title>Regularizing Differentiable Architecture Search with Smooth Activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is an efficient Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method but suffers from robustness, generalization, and discrepancy issues. Many efforts have been made towards the performance collapse issue caused by skip dominance with various regularization techniques towards operation weights, path weights, noise injection, and super-network redesign. It had become questionable at a certain point if there could exist a better and more elegant way to retract the search to its intended goal -- NAS is a selection problem. In this paper, we undertake a simple but effective approach, named Smooth Activation DARTS (SA-DARTS), to overcome skip dominance and discretization discrepancy challenges. By leveraging a smooth activation function on architecture weights as an auxiliary loss, our SA-DARTS mitigates the unfair advantage of weight-free operations, converging to fanned-out architecture weight values, and can recover the search process from skip-dominance initialization. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that the SA-DARTS can yield new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on NAS-Bench-201, classification, and super-resolution. Further, we show that SA-DARTS can help improve the performance of SOTA models with fewer parameters, such as Information Multi-distillation Network on the super-resolution task.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Evolutionary Approach to Physics-Aware Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic regression is a technique that can automatically derive analytic models from data. Traditionally, symbolic regression has been implemented primarily through genetic programming that evolves populations of candidate solutions sampled by genetic operators, crossover and mutation. More recently, neural networks have been employed to learn the entire analytical model, i.e., its structure and coefficients, using regularized gradient-based optimization. Although this approach tunes the model's coefficients better, it is prone to premature convergence to suboptimal model structures. Here, we propose a neuro-evolutionary symbolic regression method that combines the strengths of evolutionary-based search for optimal neural network (NN) topologies with gradient-based tuning of the network's parameters. Due to the inherent high computational demand of evolutionary algorithms, it is not feasible to learn the parameters of every candidate NN topology to full convergence. Thus, our method employs a memory-based strategy and population perturbations to enhance exploitation and reduce the risk of being trapped in suboptimal NNs. In this way, each NN topology can be trained using only a short sequence of backpropagation iterations. The proposed method was experimentally evaluated on three real-world test problems and has been shown to outperform other NN-based approaches regarding the quality of the models obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have fueled significant research efforts aimed at integrating these two transformative technologies. Quantum machine learning (QML), an emerging interdisciplinary field, leverages quantum principles to enhance the performance of ML algorithms. Concurrently, the exploration of systematic and automated approaches for designing high-performance quantum circuit architectures for QML tasks has gained prominence, as these methods empower researchers outside the quantum computing domain to effectively utilize quantum-enhanced tools. This tutorial will provide an in-depth overview of recent breakthroughs in both areas, highlighting their potential to expand the application landscape of QML across diverse fields.</description>

      <title>Towards a Distributed Federated Learning Aggregation Placement using Particle Swarm Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning has become a promising distributed learning concept with extra insurance on data privacy. Extensive studies on various models of Federated learning have been done since the coinage of its term. One of the important derivatives of federated learning is hierarchical semi-decentralized federated learning, which distributes the load of the aggregation task over multiple nodes and parallelizes the aggregation workload at the breadth of each level of the hierarchy. Various methods have also been proposed to perform inter-cluster and intra-cluster aggregation optimally. Most of the solutions, nonetheless, require monitoring the nodes' performance and resource consumption at each round, which necessitates frequently exchanging systematic data. To optimally perform distributed aggregation in SDFL with minimal reliance on systematic data, we propose Flag-Swap, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method that optimizes the aggregation placement according only to the processing delay. Our simulation results show that PSO-based placement can find the optimal placement relatively fast, even in scenarios with many clients as candidates for aggregation. Our real-world docker-based implementation of Flag-Swap over the recently emerged FL framework shows superior performance compared to black-box-based deterministic placement strategies, with about 43% minutes faster than random placement, and 32% minutes faster than uniform placement, in terms of total processing time.</description>

      <title>Efficient Design of Compliant Mechanisms Using Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compliant mechanisms achieve motion through elastic deformation. In this work, we address the synthesis of a compliant cross-hinge mechanism capable of large angular strokes while approximating the behavior of an ideal revolute joint. To capture the competing demands of kinematic fidelity, rotational stiffness, and resistance to parasitic motion, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem based on kinetostatic performance measures. A hybrid design strategy is employed: an efficient beam-based structural model enables extensive exploration of a high-dimensional design space using evolutionary algorithms, followed by fine-tuning with high-fidelity three-dimensional finite element analysis. The resulting Pareto-optimal designs reveal diverse geometric configurations and performance trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Noise-Tolerant Coreset-Based Class Incremental Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many applications of computer vision require the ability to adapt to novel data distributions after deployment. Adaptation requires algorithms capable of continual learning (CL). Continual learners must be plastic to adapt to novel tasks while minimizing forgetting of previous tasks.However, CL opens up avenues for noise to enter the training pipeline and disrupt the CL. This work focuses on label noise and instance noise in the context of class-incremental learning (CIL), where new classes are added to a classifier over time, and there is no access to external data from past classes. We aim to understand the sensitivity of CL methods that work by replaying items from a memory constructed using the idea of Coresets. We derive a new bound for the robustness of such a method to uncorrelated instance noise under a general additive noise threat model, revealing several insights. Putting the theory into practice, we create two continual learning algorithms to construct noise-tolerant replay buffers. We empirically compare the effectiveness of prior memory-based continual learners and the proposed algorithms under label and uncorrelated instance noise on five diverse datasets. We show that existing memory-based CL are not robust whereas the proposed methods exhibit significant improvements in maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing forgetting in the noisy CIL setting.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Optimization of Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Advancing Generalizability by the Baldwin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are at the forefront of scientific machine learning, making possible the creation of machine intelligence that is cognizant of physical laws and able to accurately simulate them. However, today's PINNs are often trained for a single physics task and require computationally expensive re-training for each new task, even for tasks from similar physics domains. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a pioneering approach to advance the generalizability of PINNs through the framework of Baldwinian evolution. Drawing inspiration from the neurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and react quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with connection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of physics. A novel two-stage stochastic programming formulation coupling evolutionary selection pressure (based on proficiency over a distribution of physics tasks) with lifetime learning (to specialize on a sampled subset of those tasks) is proposed to instantiate the Baldwin effect. The evolved Baldwinian-PINNs demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities across a range of empirically challenging problem instances with more than an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the computation cost compared to state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning methods. For example, when solving the diffusion-reaction equation, a 70x improvement in accuracy was obtained while taking 700x less computational time. This paper thus marks a leap forward in the meta-learning of PINNs as generalizable physics solvers. Sample codes are available at https://github.com/chiuph/Baldwinian-PINN.</description>

      <title>SNN-Based Online Learning of Concepts and Action Laws in an Open World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the architecture of a fully autonomous, bio-inspired cognitive agent built around a spiking neural network (SNN) implementing the agent's semantic memory. This agent explores its universe and learns concepts of objects/situations and of its own actions in a one-shot manner. While object/situation concepts are unary, action concepts are triples made up of an initial situation, a motor activity, and an outcome. They embody the agent's knowledge of its universe's action laws. Both kinds of concepts have different degrees of generality. To make decisions the agent queries its semantic memory for the expected outcomes of envisaged actions and chooses the action to take on the basis of these predictions. Our experiments show that the agent handles new situations by appealing to previously learned general concepts and rapidly modifies its concepts to adapt to environment changes.</description>

      <title>A Quarter of a Century of Neuromorphic Architectures on FPGAs -- an Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing is a relatively new discipline of computer science, where the principles of biological brain's computation and memory are used to create a new way of processing information, based on networks of spiking neurons. Those networks can be implemented as both analog and digital implementations, where for the latter, the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are a frequent choice, due to their inherent flexibility, allowing the researchers to easily design hardware neuromorphic architecture (NMAs). Moreover, digital NMAs show good promise in simulating various spiking neural networks because of their inherent accuracy and resilience to noise, as opposed to analog implementations. This paper presents an overview of digital NMAs implemented on FPGAs, with a goal of providing useful references to various architectural design choices to the researchers interested in digital neuromorphic systems. We present a taxonomy of NMAs that highlights groups of distinct architectural features, their advantages and disadvantages and identify trends and predictions for the future of those architectures.</description>

      <title>Dynamic hashtag recommendation in social media with trend shift detection and adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hashtag recommendation systems have emerged as a key tool for automatically suggesting relevant hashtags and enhancing content categorization and search. However, existing static models struggle to adapt to the highly dynamic nature of social media conversations, where new hashtags constantly emerge and existing ones undergo semantic shifts. To address these challenges, this paper introduces H-ADAPTS (Hashtag recommendAtion by Detecting and adAPting to Trend Shifts), a dynamic hashtag recommendation methodology that employs a trend-aware mechanism to detect shifts in hashtag usage-reflecting evolving trends and topics within social media conversations-and triggers efficient model adaptation based on a (small) set of recent posts. Additionally, the Apache Storm framework is leveraged to support scalable and fault-tolerant analysis of high-velocity social data, enabling the timely detection of trend shifts. Experimental results from two real-world case studies, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 US presidential election, demonstrate the effectiveness of H-ADAPTS in providing timely and relevant hashtag recommendations by adapting to emerging trends, significantly outperforming existing solutions.</description>

      <title>CAPO: Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by solving a wide range of tasks simply guided by a prompt. Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automated prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.</description>

      <title>AlphaGrad: Non-Linear Gradient Normalization Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce AlphaGrad, a memory-efficient, conditionally stateless optimizer addressing the memory overhead and hyperparameter complexity of adaptive methods like Adam. AlphaGrad enforces scale invariance via tensor-wise L2 gradient normalization followed by a smooth hyperbolic tangent transformation, $g' = \tanh(\alpha \cdot \tilde{g})$, controlled by a single steepness parameter $\alpha$. Our contributions include: (1) the AlphaGrad algorithm formulation; (2) a formal non-convex convergence analysis guaranteeing stationarity; (3) extensive empirical evaluation on diverse RL benchmarks (DQN, TD3, PPO). Compared to Adam, AlphaGrad demonstrates a highly context-dependent performance profile. While exhibiting instability in off-policy DQN, it provides enhanced training stability with competitive results in TD3 (requiring careful $\alpha$ tuning) and achieves substantially superior performance in on-policy PPO. These results underscore the critical importance of empirical $\alpha$ selection, revealing strong interactions between the optimizer's dynamics and the underlying RL algorithm. AlphaGrad presents a compelling alternative optimizer for memory-constrained scenarios and shows significant promise for on-policy learning regimes where its stability and efficiency advantages can be particularly impactful.</description>
