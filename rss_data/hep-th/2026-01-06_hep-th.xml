      <title>On Cosmological Correlators at One Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equal-time in-in correlators of massless scalar fields in flat space at one loop. Using the time-ordered decomposition of correlators together with a cosmological analogue of the Baikov representation, we systematically construct relatively simple loop integrals and make manifest why, in this setting, loop corrections to correlators are simpler than those of wavefunction coefficients. As benchmark examples, we analyse the bubble and triangle diagrams. The bubble exhibits a UV divergence that can be removed by a local counterterm, while the triangle yields a finite result, which we evaluate explicitly in terms of dilogarithms using an integral transform for the Laplacian Green's function. We classify the kinematic singularities of these diagrams using Landau analysis, identifying novel types of singular behaviour, and validate this analysis against the explicit results. Finally, we derive a factorisation property of one-loop cosmological correlators at singular kinematics, relating them to flat-space loop amplitudes and lower-point tree-level correlators.</description>

      <title>Graviton-Photon Mixing by a Kerr-Newman Black Hole with Worldline EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00980v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In black hole perturbation theory, the difficulty in separating electromagnetic and gravitational sectors of the coupled Teukolsky equations has prevented a general treatment of scattering processes involving both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves in presence of a Kerr-Newman black hole. We present the first computation of the gauge-invariant, low-frequency scattering amplitude for graviton photoproduction by a Kerr-Newman black hole at tree level up to $\mathcal{O}\big((\omega/m)^2\big)$ or $\mathcal{O}(S^2)$ and linear in $\kappa$, using the worldline effective field theory. The relevant Wilson coefficients are determined by matching the graviton and photon one-point functions to the Kerr-Newman solution. We obtain the full angular dependence of the conversion cross section in the presence of spin and comment on the factorization relation between the graviton photoproduction amplitude and the photon Compton amplitude for a classical spinning source. The result provides a benchmark for future analyses of coupled gravitoelectromagnetic scattering in spinning charged compact object backgrounds.</description>

      <title>From the Wavefunction of the Universe to In-In-Correlators: A Perturbative Map to All Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both the Wavefunction of the Universe and the Schwinger-Keldysh in-in formalism are central tools for analyzing primordial cosmological observables, such as equal-time correlation functions. While their conceptual equivalence is well established, a systematic and explicit map between their diagrammatic expansions has remained elusive. In this article, I construct such a map by analyzing the relation between the two frameworks at the diagrammatic level. I show that diagrams contributing to correlation functions in the Wavefunction of the Universe approach can be uniquely reorganized into Schwinger-Keldysh diagrams. This correspondence holds to all orders in perturbation theory, including arbitrary numbers of interaction vertices and loops.</description>

      <title>Tori, Klein Bottles, and Modulo 8 Parity/Time-reversal Anomalies of 2+1d Staggered Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the symmetries of lattice staggered fermions in 2+1d. Using the symmetries, we can place the system on any sheared torus or Klein bottle. These different backgrounds provide diagnostics of various 't Hooft anomalies associated with the crystalline symmetries. We then compare the lattice model to its continuum limit. The symmetries of the lattice system are mapped in a nontrivial way to the symmetries of the continuum theories. Using this map, we match the 't Hooft anomalies on the lattice and the continuum. Along the way, we develop a general formalism to study Hamiltonian lattice models on nontrivial, compact, flat spaces.</description>

      <title>Point Particles as Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work surveys a recently developed approach to the study of free point particles on Riemannian manifolds, based on the Kirillov orbit method, geometric quantization, and the geometry of Lagrangian submanifolds. We discuss that given a Lagrangian submanifold $\mathcal{M}$ embedded in a product of coadjoint orbits and a Hamiltonian $H$ attaining its minimum on this submanifold, such a configuration naturally induces free point particle dynamics on $\mathcal{M}$. The metric governing this dynamics is precisely defined by the quadratic expansion of $H$ around its minimum. Upon quantization, this correspondence establishes a relation between the $L^2(\mathcal{M})$ and a corresponding spin chain Hilbert space as well as a spectral equivalence between Laplace-Beltrami operator on $L^2(\mathcal{M})$ and a spin Hamiltonian. Explicit examples of this construction are presented for particles moving on the complex plane, two-dimensional sphere, flag manifolds, and the hyperbolic plane.</description>

      <title>On stability of baryonic black membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-extremal black membranes with topological (baryonic) $U(1)_B$ charge of M-theory compactified on the coset space $M^{1,1,0}$ are stable. $M^{1,1,0}$ coset is a ${\mathbb Z}_2$-invariant truncation of a larger $Q^{1,1,1}$ coset, with diagonal $U(1)_B\equiv U(1)_{B,+}\subset U(1)_B^2$ symmetry of the latter. We show that the baryonic black membranes of M-theory $M^{1,1,0}$ compactifications are unstable to ${\mathbb Z}_2$-odd gravitational bulk gauge and scalar fluctuations, but only if this bulk scalar is identified with the holographically dual $2+1$ dimensional superconformal gauge theory operator of conformal dimension $\Delta=1$. The instability is associated with the unstable charge transport of the off-diagonal $U(1)_{B,-}\subset U(1)_B^2$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Duality and Axion Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prototype of a Euclidean wormhole solution of Einstein gravity coupled to matter is the axion wormhole in four spacetime dimensions. In this primarily expository article, we spell out some details about this construction. The axion wormhole has a semiclassical description, found in the original paper [1], in which the matter system is a two-form gauge field B with three-form field strength H=dB. The two-form is dual to a massless scalar, but the wormhole does not have a semiclassical description in terms of the scalar. There is no contradiction here as the duality between the two-form and the scalar is not a simple transformation of classical fields but involves, in Euclidean signature, a Poisson resummation of the sum over fluxes. Because of the need for this Poisson resummation, the scalar field cannot be treated semiclassically in the wormhole throat. Nonetheless, it is straightforward to compute the effective action derived from the wormhole in the scalar (or two-form) language, recovering standard claims.</description>

      <title>More About the Spontaneous Breaking of Time Reversal in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely thought that the quantum theory of de Sitter space requires the existence of a physical observer in the static patch. What exactly is meant by an observer is unclear; it could be anything from a few photons with energy just above the Gibbons-Hawking temperature to a gravitationally bound cluster of galaxies. In a recent note I explained that the need for observers can arise from the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry. This longer paper expands on the subject, filling in conceptual arguments that were implicit but not explicitly stated in the earlier paper.</description>

      <title>Machine learning modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a transformer based sequence-to-sequence architecture combined with a dynamic batching algorithm, this work introduces a machine learning framework for automatically simplifying complex expressions involving multiple elliptic Gamma functions, including the $q$-$\theta$ function and the elliptic Gamma function. The model learns to apply algebraic identities, particularly the SL$(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and SL$(3,\mathbb{Z})$ modular transformations, to reduce heavily scrambled expressions to their canonical forms. Experimental results show that the model achieves over 99\% accuracy on in-distribution tests and maintains robust performance (exceeding 90\% accuracy) under significant extrapolation, such as with deeper scrambling depths. This demonstrates that the model has internalized the underlying algebraic rules of modular transformations rather than merely memorizing training patterns. Our work presents the first successful application of machine learning to perform symbolic simplification using modular identities, offering a new automated tool for computations with special functions in quantum field theory and the string theory.</description>

      <title>Quark confinement due to unified magnetic monopoles and vortices reduced from symmetric instantons with holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a geometric framework to analyze quark confinement in four-dimensional Euclidean $SU(2)$ Yang--Mills theory in terms of finite-action topological defects. Starting from self-dual Yang--Mills configurations, we restrict to \emph{symmetric instantons} with spatial rotation symmetry so that dimensional reduction preserves conformal equivalence. This requirement maps $\mathbb{R}^4$ to curved backgrounds with compact directions and, in particular, identifies the reduced configurations with (i) hyperbolic magnetic monopoles of Atiyah type on $H^3\simeq \mathrm{AdS}_3$ (from an $SO(2)\simeq S^1$ symmetry) and (ii) hyperbolic vortices of Witten--Manton type on $H^2\simeq \mathrm{AdS}_2$ (from an $SO(3)\simeq SU(2)$ symmetry). We provide an explicit field map relating the monopole and vortex variables, enabling a unified treatment of these defects within the original four-dimensional setting. Moreover, the hyperbolic monopole on $H^3$ is completely determined by its holographic data on the conformal boundary $S^2_\infty$, which reduces a non-Abelian Wilson loop placed on $\partial H^3$ to an Abelian loop determined by the vortex $U(1)$ field (Abelian dominance and monopole dominance), without further dynamical assumptions beyond the symmetry reduction. In the semiclassical dilute-gas regime of these finite-action defects, the framework yields the Wilson area law, thereby providing analytic support for the dual-superconductor picture of confinement.</description>

      <title>Critical Phenomena on the Bethe Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the critical behavior of a family of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric scalar field theories on the Bethe lattice (the tree limit of regular hyperbolic tessellations) using both the non-perturbative Functional Renormalization Group and lattice perturbation theory. The family is indexed by the parameter $\zeta \in (0,1]$, which determines the range of the theory via the kinetic term constructed from the graph Laplacian raised to the power $\zeta$. Specifically, $\zeta=1$ is the short-range theory, while $0&lt;\zeta&lt;1$ defines the long-range model. Due to the hyperbolic nature of Bethe lattices, the Laplacian lacks a zero mode and exhibits a spectral gap. We find that upon closing this spectral gap by a modification of the Laplacian, the scalar field theories exhibit novel critical behavior in the form of non-trivial fixed points with critical exponents governed by $\zeta$ and the spectral dimension $d_s=3$. In particular, our analysis indicates the presence of a Wilson-Fisher fixed point for the short range $\zeta =1$ theory. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor Ising model on the Bethe lattice is known to exhibit mean-field critical exponents. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first evidence that a scalar $\phi^4$ theory and the discrete Ising model on the same underlying lattice may lie in distinct universality classes.</description>

      <title>$SO(1, d + 1)$ symmetry of the Exact RG equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a method for constructing from first principles, a holographic bulk dual action in Euclidean $AdS_{d+1}$ space for a $d$-dimensional Euclidean CFT on the boundary, starting from the Polchinski's Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) equation that describes the RG evolution of the interaction part of the boundary Wilson action. The bulk action in $AdS_{d+1}$ has an $SO(1,d+1)$ symmetry and is obtained from the evolution operator of the Polchinski's ERG equation by a map that involves a field redefinition and requires a $\textit{special}$ form of the UV cutoff function in the ERG equation. In this paper, we show that for $\textit{any form}$ of the cutoff function, the ERG evolution operator has an $SO(1,d+1)$ symmetry. The generators of the special conformal transformation depend on the cutoff function. For the special cutoff function that maps to $AdS$ space, the transformations have the standard form of $AdS$ isometry. We also show that the ERG evolution operator for the $\textit{full}$ Wilson action can be put in the same form as the Polchinski's ERG equation by a field redefinition and consequently also has an $SO(1,d+1)$ symmetry for any cutoff function.</description>

      <title>Wilson-'t Hooft classification and the perimeter law for dyonic loops in 3d monopole semiclassics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long-distance behavior of dyonic loop operators in 4d $SU(N)$ gauge theories on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$ using the 3d monopole semiclassics. If we employ the naive definition of the 't Hooft loop in the Abelianized regime, the dyonic loop operators do not admit the well-defined computations within the effective field theory. Moreover, if one forcibly proceeds with the computations of their expectation values, all the dyonic loops turn out to show the area law, which contradicts the prediction of the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. In this paper, we resolve this puzzle by employing the notion of screening for line operators, and we argue that the dyonic loops are screened by a defect known as the twist vortex, which is non-dynamical in the infrared effective theory but is dynamical in the original ultraviolet theory. The dyonic loops properly dressed by twist vortices admit the well-defined computations within the effective field theory, and we reproduce the kinematic prediction of the Wilson-'t~Hooft classification using the $3$d monopole semiclassics. Furthermore, we apply our framework to the thermal deconfined phase to evaluate the dual string tension, elucidating the topological nature of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ domain walls. We confirm that the domain-wall state has the phase transition at $\theta=\pi$ in the thermal deconfined phase despite the fact that the bulk state is smooth there.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Viscosity: from Unitarity to Irreversibility in Accelerated Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the unitarity of quantum field theory, through the positivity of spectral functions, underlies thermodynamic irreversibility for a subsystem separated by a horizon, in direct analogy with the irreversibility of renormalization-group flows. To this end, we explicitly find the shear and bulk viscosities -- the entanglement viscosities -- for thermal radiation in Rindler space using the universal spectral representation. A direct consequence of the obtained general formulas is the relationship between the acceleration-induced shear viscosity in flat space and the conformal quantum anomaly in curved space, pointing to a possible novel probe of the conformal anomaly in systems with extreme acceleration. Moreover, for conformal field theories, we explicitly show that globally entanglement viscosity saturates the Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound.</description>

Abstract: I generalize the three-point amplitude of curvature perturbations in the climbing scenario inspired by ten-dimensional non-supersymmetric strings to a broader class of exponential potentials, under some assumptions on the smoothing effects of String Theory that favor a bounce Cosmology. The extension can encompass the SO(16)xSO(16) model, together with other scenarios related to supersymmetry breaking in String Theory. The e-fold ranges compatible with Planck data move toward lower values of N for milder potentials and toward larger values for steeper ones. I also compute the three-point amplitudes involving graviton modes in the same bounce scenario, showing in detail their lack of peculiar contributions from the turning point.</description>

      <title>M5 brane to D4 brane via cyclification of rational relative 3-cohomotopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we start by finding the equations of motion for the abelian D4 brane worldvolume. Assuming Hypothesis H that the 4-flux in M-Theory is flux quantized in a non-abelian cohomology theory called 4-cohomotopy, and the three-flux on the M5 brane worldvolume in (twisted) 3-cohomotopy, we compute the minimal model for the cyclification of the quaternionic Hopf fibration which encodes the Bianchi identities for the fluxes on the D4 brane worldvolume after double dimensional reduction. The two pictures can be mapped to each other, and thus at the rational level, we conjecture a non-abelian relative cohomology theory for the D4 brane, fibered over the 10d Type IIA spacetime fluxes.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of cosmological particle production: interacting quantum field theories with matrix product states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding real-time dynamics of interacting quantum fields in curved spacetime remains a major theoretical challenge. We employ tensor network methods to study such dynamics using interacting scalar and gauge theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, subject to a quench modeling a homogeneously expanding gravitational background. The models considered are the scalar $\lambda\phi^4$ theory and the Schwinger model, i.e. a Dirac fermion coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field which is equivalent via bosonization to a scalar field with a cosine self-interaction. In the free scalar limit, both theories reproduce known analytical results, providing a nontrivial numerical validation of bosonization in curved spacetime for the Schwinger model. Our central finding is that self-interactions lead to a suppression of gravitational particle production compared to the free-field case, as evidenced by two-point functions and the spectra of produced particles. We further examine the behavior of entanglement generation and find that interactions suppress entanglement growth in the $\lambda\phi^4$ theory, while in the Schwinger model, the interplay between suppressed particle production and enhanced inter-particle correlations leads to more complex entanglement behavior. Our results pave the way for further explorations of nonperturbative quantum real-time dynamics of interacting scalar and gauge theories in arbitrary gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nontrivial peculiarity of general relativity is that when the horizon region of black holes is rendered harmless, the exterior doubles, resulting in a causally disconnected parallel universe. This intricacy plays a central role in 't Hooft's unitarity arguments, emphasising an exact identification between the physical universe and its duplicate on the other side of the horizon. However, it leads to another tension in the form of a factor of two correction in Hawking's temperature. This discrepancy is concerning because the Rindler temperature is universal and complies with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We demonstrate that the mismatch in the Boltzmann factor gets fixed if the state that forms the corresponding density matrix adopts a generalised thermofield double structure. That leaves room for some interesting discussion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Features of the black hole interior can be extracted from the analytic structure of boundary correlation functions. Working in the geodesic approximation, we find analytic continuations that probe the interior of rotating and charged black holes. These generate contributions from timelike geodesics that thread the interior and emerge in a future universe. We implement these continuations on the momentum space two-point function and exemplify this in several black hole backgrounds. We also identify position space analytic continuations achieving the same task that incorporate different continued momentum space correlators. These correspond to non-perturbative corrections to the WKB approximation. We demonstrate this explicitly in the rotating BTZ black hole by showing that the interior geodesics contribute to the continued position space correlator and motivate a picture for how these contributions arise in higher dimensions. For AdS Schwarzschild, we identify the analytically continued solution that captures the bouncing geodesic. We discuss the possibility of using these continuations to probe the instability of inner horizons from the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13946v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity is conventionally formulated in terms of the Einstein-Hilbert-York-Gibbons-Hawking action, which requires suitable subtractions to produce the correct black hole partition function. However, there is a unique, canonical teleparallel reformulation which reproduces the same results without subtractions or other ambiguities. This is verified in the case of a black hole with or without an electric or a magnetic charge and in a background with or without a cosmological constant. Moreover, a new quasilocal prescription is proposed and tested, where the black hole partition function is determined solely by the horizon boundary term, yielding the correct Helmholtz free energy without the need for counterterms.</description>

      <title>Self-regularized entropy: How much do quantum black holes violate the no-hair theorem?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the canonical (brick wall) entropy of Hawking radiation in a quantum black hole whose exterior is described, to first order in a small quadrupole parameter, by the static $q$-metric, which is an exact vacuum solution of the Einstein equations. Counting near horizon quasinormal modes shows that a modest quadrupolar deformation self-regularizes the ultraviolet divergence: the entropy of Hawking radiation is finite for any non-vanishing quadrupole, without an ad hoc cutoff. Matching this canonical entropy to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy leads to no-hair violating multipoles, at percent-to-tens-of-percent level, and provides concrete observational targets for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).</description>

Abstract: In Aganagic's Fukaya category of the Coulomb branch of quiver gauge theory, the $T_\theta$-brane algebra gives a symplectic realization of the Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier-Webster (KLRW) algebra, where each standard module is known to admit two Lagrangian realizations: the 'U'-shaped $T$-brane and the step $I$-brane. We show that the latter arises as the infinite-time limit of the Hamiltonian evolution of the former, thus serving as a generalized thimble. This provides a geometric realization of the categorical isomorphism previously established through holomorphic disc counting.</description>

      <title>Thick brane in Palatini formalism with a non-minimally coupled bulk scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a thick brane scenario within the Palatini formulation of gravity, where the metric and affine connection are treated as independent variables. By introducing a non-minimal coupling between a bulk scalar field and the Ricci scalar, we obtain analytic solutions under a flat, four-dimensional Poincar\'e-invariant metric with a kink-like scalar configuration. The warp factor exhibits a bell-shaped profile, while the scalar potential forms a symmetric volcano-like structure, characteristic of a finite-thickness brane. The corresponding energy density is regular and localized, featuring a central peak with symmetrically placed negative minima. Through the analysis of linear tensor perturbations, we derive a Schr\"odinger-like equation with supersymmetric factorization, ensuring the absence of tachyonic modes and thus the stability of the background configuration. The effective potential also takes a volcano-like form that supports a localized graviton zero mode, confirming the recovery of four-dimensional gravity on the brane. A numerical study of the massive Kaluza--Klein spectrum reveals the progressive delocalization of massive modes into the bulk.
  Our results demonstrate a stable and physically consistent thick brane configuration within the Palatini gravity framework, offering new insights into gravity localization and braneworld phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strange metals represent a foundational problem in quantum condensed matter physics, and heavy fermion systems provide a canonical setting to advance a general understanding. The concept of a Kondo destruction quantum critical point is widely invoked to describe the competition of the Kondo effect and the local-moment magnetism. Here, we develop a unified field-theoretic approach, analyzing this competition from a rare approach that is anchored by the magnetically ordered side. Our analysis reveals, for the first time within a renormalization group framework, a quantum critical point across which the Kondo effect goes from being destroyed to dominating. Our findings elucidate not only the Kondo destruction quantum criticality but also an accompanying global phase diagram of heavy fermion metals.</description>

      <title>Tidal perturbations of an extreme mass ratio inspiral around a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the metric of a Kerr black hole subject to external tidal fields using metric reconstruction techniques. Working within the Newman-Penrose formalism, we solve the Teukolsky master equation for static, quadrupolar modes associated with a slowly varying tidal environment, and reconstruct the corresponding metric perturbation in the outgoing radiation gauge. As an application, we derive the secular Hamiltonian governing the motion of a test particle in the tidally deformed Kerr spacetime and investigate long-term tidal effects relevant to extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. In particular, we compute tidal-induced shifts of the innermost stable circular orbit and the light ring. We find that these tidal corrections are strongly spin dependent, with significantly larger effects for retrograde orbits around rapidly rotating black holes. Our results provide a fully analytic framework for studying tidal interactions and secular dynamics in rotating black-hole spacetimes, with direct applications to gravitational-wave modeling and tests of gravity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular magnets, although analogous to familiar macroscopic magnets, offer a platform for next generation magnetic storage technologies with far higher data densities and prospective applications in quantum information science. When exposed to an external magnetic field, single molecule magnets enter a frustrated magnetic configuration that is exceptionally sensitive to low energy excitations. Energy deposited by a dark matter particle can trigger the relaxation of a metastable molecule, releasing Zeeman energy that subsequently propagates through neighboring molecules. This magnetic avalanche encodes the energy deposited in the initial excitation. By combining concepts from chemistry, condensed matter physics, and particle physics, we show that dysprosium and manganese molecules can achieve more than an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity to dark photon and QCD axion models, respectively, compared with existing detection methods.</description>

      <title>On the Properties of the Power-Law Cosmological Solutions in Lovelock Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the properties of Kasner cosmological solutions in Lovelock gravity. Recent progress in the investigation of flat cosmological models in Lovelock gravity unveiled the fact that in quadratic (Gauss--Bonnet) and cubic Lovelock gravities, the higher-order power-law solutions could play the role of both future and past asymptotes, and under some conditions, there could exist a smooth transition between them. So it is natural to question if this feature is unique to Gauss--Bonnet and cubic Lovelock gravities, or if it is a general feature of Lovelock gravity. Our analysis suggests that starting from quartic and in all higher-order Lovelock gravities, the high-order Kasner solution cannot play the role of a past asymptote, not only preventing the abovementioned transition from happening, but also potentially hindering the possibility of reaching viable compactification.</description>

      <title>Repetitive Penrose Process in Accelerating Kerr Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the repetitive Penrose process in accelerating Kerr black holes and explores the influence of the acceleration factor on the repetitive Penrose process. After a brief review of accelerating Kerr black holes, we study the fundamental equations of the Penrose process in this spacetime, examine the stopping conditions required for the repetitive Penrose process, and obtain corresponding numerical results. The conclusions indicate that, apart from the third law of thermodynamics similar to previous cases, accelerating Kerr black holes exhibit stronger energy extraction capabilities compared to Kerr black holes during the repetitive Penrose process. Moreover, in prior studies, the energy utilization efficiency was difficult to exceed $50\%$. However, in accelerating Kerr black holes, when the decay radius is relatively small, the energy utilization efficiency can exceed $50\%$, indicating that the reduced extractable energy primarily transforms into extracted energy rather than irreducible mass. On the other hand, when the initial value of the acceleration factor is large, the extractable energy can decrease to nearly zero, which also differs from the case of Kerr black holes in previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the requirement of perturbative unitarity restricts the parameter space of the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) when higher-dimensional operators up to dimension six are included. We demonstrate that such operators can enhance scalar production cross sections in vector boson fusion relative to 2HDM. Using S-matrix unitarity, we place bounds on several dimension-six bosonic operators. We also find that certain blind directions in the Wilson coefficients of T-parameter violating operators which are poorly constrained by electroweak precision data can be partially excluded when unitarity constraints are taken into account. These results demonstrate how high-energy consistency can complement experimental limits in defining the allowed parameter space of 2HDM effective field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of background electric fields on a hot plasma of charged particles -- a setting relevant for the early stages of heavy-ion collisions as well as laser pulse experiments. Historically, the electric susceptibility -- encoding the behavior of the hot medium for weak fields -- has been defined within two different formalisms, leading to two distinct results at nonzero temperature. With the help of an exact fermion propagator in a homogeneous electric background field at nonzero temperature and finite volume on the one hand, and an improved perturbative result on the other, we identify the origin of this disagreement. The equilibrium conditions for the system are discussed and the role of the thermodynamic ensemble used to describe the system is highlighted. Finally, we construct the electric susceptibility in a simplified hadron resonance gas model, relevant for the strongly interacting medium in the low-temperature regime.</description>

We relate such Reshetikhin type Yangians to Drinfeld type Yangians arising from critical cohomological Hall algebras. Several detailed examples, including the trivial, Jordan, and tripled Jordan quivers are explicitly computed.
  For symmetric quiver varieties with potentials, by using the smallness property of their affinization maps, we derive explicit formulas for quantum multiplication by divisors in terms of Casimir elements of the associated Lie (super)algebras, extending results from Nakajima quiver varieties to the critical setting. A similar formula in the antidominantly framed case is also obtained, which includes Hilbert schemes of points on $\mathbb C^3$ as examples.</description>

      <title>Field-Theoretical Construction of Conserved Currents, Non-Invertible Symmetries, and Mixed Anomalies in Three-Dimensional Non-Abelian Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ..In this work, we investigate generalized symmetries, with particular emphasis on non-invertible ones, in three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders hosting both particle- and loop-like excitations. We adopt a continuum topological field theory description, focusing on twisted $BF$ theories with gauge group $G=\prod_i \mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ and an $a \wedge a \wedge b$ twisted term. This field theory supports Borromean-Rings braiding and realizes non-Abelian topological order, which for $G=(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ admits a microscopic realization via the $\mathbb{D}_4$ Kitaev quantum double lattice model. We systematically identify all generalized symmetry operators by extracting conserved currents from the equations of motion. Two distinct classes of currents emerge: type-I currents, which generate invertible higher-form symmetries, and type-II currents, which give rise to non-invertible higher-form symmetries. The non-invertibility originates from projectors accompanying the symmetry operators, which restrict admissible gauge-field configurations. We further analyze the fusion rules of these symmetries, showing that invertible symmetries admit inverses, while non-invertible symmetries fuse through multiple channels. Finally, we study mixed anomalies among these generalized symmetries by simultaneously coupling multiple currents to proper types of background gauge fields and examining their gaugeability. We identify two types of mixed anomalies: one cancellable by topological field theories in one higher dimension, and another representing an intrinsic gauging obstruction encoded in the $(3+1)$D continuum topological field theory...</description>

      <title>A Geometric Interpretation of Heavy-Quark Transitions and the Emergent SU(2) Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a geometric interpretation of heavy-light mesons in which their infrared dressing is described through adiabatic Berry holonomies on the functional space of gauge configurations. Within this framework the Berry curvature associated with the infrared cloud carries a quantized functional flux, providing a simple and structural origin for the exponential form of the Isgur-Wise function in single-recoil transitions. Sequential processes such as $B \rightarrow D^{**} \rightarrow D$ probe two independent recoil directions and explore a two-dimensional region of the adiabatic manifold. In this setting the quantized flux naturally leads to a minimal non-Abelian structure which can be described effectively by an SU(2) holonomy. Heavy-quark form factors then appear as channel-dependent projections of two universal geometric modes, giving rise to correlated slopes, non-factorizable curvature in the $(w_{1},w_{2})$ plane, and characteristic angular patterns. These features are consistent with the symmetry structure of HQET while providing additional correlations among excited channels. The resulting framework offers a complementary viewpoint on heavy-quark phenomenology and suggests several experimentally testable signatures in multi-step semileptonic transitions.</description>

Abstract: For simple Lie algebras we construct characteristic identities for split (polarized) Casimir operators in representations $T \otimes Y_n$ and $T \otimes Y_n'$, where $T$ -- defining (minimal fundamental for exceptional Lie algebras) representation, $Y_n$ -- n-Cartan powers of the adjoint representations $ad = Y_1$ and Y_n' -- special representations appeared in the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of symmetric part of $ad^{\otimes n}$. By means of these characteristic identities, we derive (for all simple Lie algebras, except $\mathfrak{e}_8$) explicit formulae for invariant projectors onto irreducible subrepresentations arose in the decomposition of $T \otimes Y_n$. These projectors and characteristic identities are written in the universal form for all simple Lie algebras (except $\mathfrak{e}_8$) in terms of Vogel parameters. Universal formulas for the dimensions of the Casimir subrepresentations appeared in the decompositions of $T \otimes Y_n$ where found.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Dark Matter from Low-Scale Spontaneous Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel type of asymmetric dark matter (ADM) model in which the dark matter asymmetry and the baryon asymmetry in our universe (BAU) are produced simultaneously via low-scale spontaneous leptogenesis, where the mass scale of right-handed neutrino is much lower than the Davidson-Ibarra bound $M_1 \ll 10^{9}~\rm{GeV}$. In our scenario, both asymmetries are predominantly sourced by a dynamical $CP$ phase, namely the majoron. Its kinetic misalignment provides a sufficiently large, time-dependent effective $CP$ phase, allowing efficient asymmetry production even for low-scale right-handed neutrinos. In our framework, the sources of $CP$ violation responsible for the BAU and ADM are correlated with each other, leading to a predictive relation for the dark matter mass. In particular, when the dark matter asymmetry reaches its equilibrium value before freeze-out, the dark matter mass is typically predicted to lie in the range $\mathcal{O}(0.1)~\mathrm{GeV} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim \mathcal{O}(100)~\mathrm{GeV}$, which lies within the sensitivity of direct detection experiments. On the other hand, if the dark matter asymmetry does not reach its equilibrium value due to weak coupling, the allowed mass range extends over a broader interval, $\mathcal{O}(0.1)~\mathrm{GeV} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)~\rm{TeV}$.</description>

      <title>The FRW Universe as a van der Waals-like Thermodynamic Heat Engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe is a dynamical spacetime, and it has thermodynamics embodied on the apparent horizon. Notably, it also possesses a van der Waals-like equation of state, enabling us to consider thermodynamic cycles and explore the FRW universe's potential as a heat engine. In this paper, we investigate two types of cycles--the Carnot cycle and the rectangular cycle--based on the phase diagram derived from the equation of state, to study the heat engine characteristics of the FRW universe. Furthermore, we calculate the work done and assess the corresponding efficiencies, illustrating the efficiency diagram for the FRW universe's heat engine. We observe that the efficiency of the rectangular cycle consistently remains below unity and never exceeds the Carnot efficiency--the thermodynamic upper limit. This finding aligns with traditional thermodynamic principles governing heat engines.</description>

      <title>Color-Singlet and Color-Octet Quark Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quarks and antiquarks carry color and electric charges and belong to the color-triplet $3$ group and the color-antitriplet $\bar 3$ group respectively. The product groups of $3$ and $\bar 3$ consist of the color-singlet $1$ and the color-octet $8$ subgroups. Therefore, quarks and antiquarks combine to form color-singlet $[q \bar q]^1$ quark matter and color-octet $[q \bar q]^8$ quark matter. The color-octet quark matter corresponds to the $q\bar q$ quark matter as envisaged in the realm of present knowledge but the color-singlet quark matter is as yet unexplored and now submitted for exploration. The color-singlet quark matter with two flavors can be separated into charged and neutral color-singlet quark matters. In the neutral color-singlet quark matter, the quark and the antiquark interacting only in the QED interaction may form stable and confined colorless QED mesons non-perturbatively at about 17 MeV and 38 MeV (PRC81,064903(2010) and JHEP(2020(8),165). It is proposed that the possible existence of the QED mesons may be a signature of the neutral color-singlet quark matter at $T=0$. The observations of the anomalous soft photons at CERN, and the anomalous bosons with mass about 17 MeV at ATOMKI, DUBNA, and HUS, and mass about 38 MeV at DUBNA hold promising experimental evidence for the existence of such QED mesons, pending further confirmations.</description>

      <title>The Dilaton: A Natural Resolution to the Hubble Tension via Spontaneous Scale Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistical tension between early and late universe measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) suggests that the dark sector is dynamical rather than static. We propose that this dynamics arises from a fundamental symmetry principle: the Spontaneous Breaking of Scale Invariance. We introduce the Dilaton ($\chi$), a Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson (PNGB) associated with dilatation symmetry breaking. We demonstrate that a simple quadratic mass term in the fundamental theory transforms, via conformal coupling to gravity, into a ''thawing'' exponential potential $V(\phi) \propto e^{-\lambda\phi}$ in the Einstein frame. Using recent Bayesian reconstructions of dark energy dynamics from Planck, Pantheon+, and SH0ES data, we constrain the potential slope to be $\lambda \approx 0.056$. We show that this observational value is not arbitrary but corresponds to a fundamental non-minimal coupling strength of $\xi \approx 7.8 \times 10^{-4}$. The Dilaton mechanism naturally generates the late-time equation of state evolution ($w_0 \approx -0.85$) required to alleviate the Hubble tension while protecting the field mass $m \sim H_0$ through approximate shift symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a position-space cosmological perturbation theory around spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker geometries that allows to model localized primordial sources of gravitational waves. The equations of motion are decoupled using a generalized harmonic gauge, which avoids the use of a scalar-vector-tensor decomposition. We point out that sources cannot generically be defined in a compact domain due to fluctuations of the cosmic perfect fluid. For power law cosmologies, we obtain the exact Green's function necessary to solve for all metric perturbations in terms of a hypergeometric function, which matches with a Green's function derived earlier by Chu. This allows us to derive the closed form expression of the linearized metric perturbation generated by sources up to quadrupolar order in the multipolar expansion.</description>

      <title>Anti-collinear resummation in JIMWLK evolution in the linear regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently-proposed resummation procedure for anti-collinear logarithms in the JIMWLK kernel~\cite{Kovner:2023vsy} is studied in the linear (BFKL) regime in the fixed-coupling approximation. Simple closed form expressions for the resummed momentum space kernel and characteristic function $\chi(n,\gamma)$ are found. We find that the anti-collinear pole in the leading order characteristic function at $\gamma=1$ disappears, and instead $\chi(\gamma=1)=\frac{12}{11}\frac{\pi}{\alpha_sN_c}$ for $n_F=0$. Comparison with the known NLO BFKL eigenvalue, with the target-Bjorken limit ($Q_T\gg Q_P$) of the $\gamma^*(Q_P)+\gamma^*(Q_T)$-scattering amplitude and with the ``all-poles'' resummation prescription are presented.</description>

Abstract: Where does what happens happen in a quantum system? The standard textbook formulation of quantum mechanics provides a strange, imprecise and yet successful-in-practice answer to this question. In the struggle to unify our understanding of gravity with quantum theory, though, the textbook answer no longer suffices, and an alternative approach is needed. The Feynman Sum Over Histories approach provides an alternative that is particularly suited to quantum gravity because the Sum Over Histories and General Relativity are built on the same fundamental concepts of `event' and `history'.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Hilbert polynomial of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface $Z$ in a smooth toric variety $M$ associated to a convex polytope $\Delta$ is given by a lattice point count in the polytope boundary $\partial \Delta,$ just as the Hilbert polynomial of $M$ is known to be given by a lattice point count in the convex polytope $\Delta.$ Our main tool is a computation of the Euler class in $K$-theory of the normal line bundle to the hypersurface $Z,$ in terms of the Euler classes of the divisors corresponding to the facets of the moment polytope. We observe a remarkable parallel between our expression for the Euler class and the inclusion-exclusion principle in combinatorics. To obtain our result we combine these facts with the known relation between lattice point counts in the facets of $\Delta$ and the Hilbert polynomials of the smooth toric varieties corresponding to these facets.</description>

Abstract: The no-short hair theorem for static spherically symmetric black holes in general theory of relativity asserts that if a black hole has hair, that hair must extend beyond the lowest photon sphere radius of the black hole. This report generalizes the theorem to various extra-dimensional cases of black holes and wormholes in post-Einstein gravity and shows how the observational satisfaction of the no-short hair theorem may lead to a probe for the existence of extra-dimensions. We also show how we may lead to argue that this no-short hair theorem is satisfied for black holes in theories of quantum gravity that naturally precludes extra-dimensional cases, like string theory.</description>

Abstract: We develop a general formalism of duality rotations for bosonic conformal spin-$s$ gauge fields, with $s\geq 2$, in a conformally flat four-dimensional spacetime. In the $s=1$ case this formalism is equivalent to the theory of $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant nonlinear electrodynamics developed by Gaillard and Zumino, Gibbons and Rasheed, and generalised by Ivanov and Zupnik. For each integer spin $s\geq 2$ we demonstrate the existence of families of conformal $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant models, including a generalisation of the so called ModMax Electrodynamics ($s=1$). Our bosonic results are then extended to the $\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric cases. We also sketch a formalism of duality rotations for conformal gauge fields of Lorentz type $(m/2, n/2)$, for positive integers $m $ and $n$.</description>

Abstract: The complete, nonperturbative content of random matrix models is described by resurgent-transseries -- general solutions to their corresponding string-equations. These transseries include exponentially-suppressed multi-instanton amplitudes obtained by eigenvalue tunneling, but they also contain exponentially-enhanced and mixed instanton-like sectors with no known matrix model interpretation. This work shows how these sectors can be also described by eigenvalue tunneling in matrix models -- but on the non-physical sheet of the spectral curve describing their large-N limit. This picture further explains the full resurgence of random matrices via analysis of all possible eigenvalue integration-contours. How to calculate these "anti" eigenvalue-tunneling amplitudes is explained in detail and in various examples, such as the cubic and quartic matrix models, and their double-scaling limit to Painleve I. This further provides direct matrix-model derivations of their resurgent Stokes data, which were recently obtained by different techniques.</description>

Abstract: It was recently shown how to account for all instantons of hermitian matrix models via (anti-) eigenvalue-tunneling -- including both exponentially-suppressed and exponentially-enhanced transseries-transmonomials which are predicted by resurgence. Matrix-model eigenvalue-tunneling corresponds to ZZ-branes. The present work shows how matrix-model anti-eigenvalues correspond to negative-tension ZZ-branes; and how to compute generic nonperturbative sectors -- with both ZZ and negative-tension-ZZ branes -- in the minimal-string free-energy. Negative-tension D-branes are herein a requirement of resurgence. This results in the construction of minimal-string free-energy transseries and the analytic computation of their resurgent Stokes data. Calculations are presented via Liouville boundary conformal field theory and via (matching) matrix model analysis. Minimal-string results are extended to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Building on the matrix model analysis, one extension towards topological string theory is obtained via the remodeling-conjecture -- which allows for addressing one-cut, toric Calabi-Yau geometries. Building on the Liouville theory calculation, one other extension towards critical string theory is obtained via the H3+ - Liouville correspondence -- which allows for addressing negative-tension D-instantons in AdS spacetime. Throughout, checks of the construction and formulae are made in several examples, against both Borel resurgent analysis and string-equation transseries data.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional Stationary Algebraically Special Solutions, Weyl Invariants, and Soft Hairs Beyond Large Gauge Transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14586v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the Ricci-flat metrics in four dimensions that are stationary and algebraically special, together with the locally asymptotically flat conditions in the generalized Bondi-Sachs framework. We show that the Einstein equation is reduced to Laplacian equation on the celestial sphere. The solutions consist of two pairs of arbitrary holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions analogous to the Virasoro modes. We prove that the higher modes of one pair of the (anti-)holomorphic function contain an infinite tower of soft hairs from the perspectives of the asymptotic supertranslation charges. We verify that different modes of the soft hairs are distinct solutions which cannot be connected by diffeomorphism, using the Weyl invariants associated to the solutions. Extending the construction to Einstein-Maxwell theory introduces a third pair of (anti-)holomorphic functions, arising from the Maxwell tensor which generates soft electric hair. We further present an exact soft-hairy solution of Einstein-Maxwell theory with a cosmological constant, offering a potential understanding of soft hair from the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Background fields in the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of a general local gauge theory can be encoded in the structure of a so-called presymplectic gauge PDE -- an almost-$Q$ bundle over the spacetime exterior algebra, equipped with a compatible presymplectic structure. In the case of a trivial bundle and an invertible presymplectic structure, this reduces to the well-known AKSZ sigma model construction. We develop an extension of the presympletic BV-AKSZ approach to describe local gauge theories with background fields. It turns out that such theories correspond to presymplectic gauge PDEs whose base spaces are again gauge PDEs describing background fields. As such, the geometric structure is that of a bundle over a bundle over a given spacetime. Gauge PDEs over backgrounds arise naturally when studying linearisation, coupling (gauge) fields to background geometry, gauging global symmetries, etc. Less obvious examples involve parametrised systems, Fedosov equations, and the so-called homogeneous (presymplectic) gauge PDEs. The latter are the gauge-invariant generalisations of the familiar homogeneous PDEs and they provide a very concise description of gauge fields on homogeneous spaces such as higher spin gauge fields on Minkowski, (A)dS, and conformal spaces. Finally, we briefly discuss how the higher-form symmetries and their gauging fit into the framework using the simplest example of the Maxwell field.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries in Shallow Water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments have extended the concept of global symmetries in several directions, offering new perspectives across a wide range of physical systems. This work shows that generalized global symmetries naturally emerge in shallow water systems. In particular, we demonstrate that two subsystem symmetries-previously studied primarily in exotic field theories-arise intrinsically in the dynamics of shallow water flows. A central result is that the local conservation of potential vorticity follows directly from the first subsystem symmetry, revealing that the classic Kelvin circulation theorem is rooted in these symmetries. Notably, the associated charge algebra forms a Kac-Moody current algebra, with the level determined by the spatial variation of the Coriolis parameter. Beyond the first subsystem symmetry, we also identify a second one, construct the corresponding Noether charges, and explore their potential applications.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the deformed Schur index in four dimensional N=4 super Yang-Mills theories with $SO$ and $Sp$ gauge groups, generalizing Hatsuda's recent calculations. We express the deformed Schur index as integrals of Koornwinder polynomials and Macdonald polynomials, then perform the integrals in terms of the normalization constants of Macdonald polynomials. We provide explicit results for some low rank gauge groups and for expansion in a $u$ parameter. We discuss various special limits and the tests of S-duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the special extremal slice inside an AdS black hole is dual to an absolutely maximally entangled (AME) state. We demonstrate this by confirming the $n$-independence of holographic $n$-th Renyi entropies for any bi-partite subsystems. Our result gives an AME state in an infinite-volume system, where the local bond dimension is set by the black hole entropy. In particular, our construction provides concrete support from the gravity side for the emergence of random structures and an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space in recent non-isometric holographic codes.</description>

      <title>Positive Geometry for Stringy Scalar Amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new positive geometry, the associahedral grid, which provides a geometric realization of the inverse string theory KLT kernel. It captures the full $\alpha'$-dependence of stringified amplitudes for bi-adjoint scalar $\phi^3$ theory, pions in the NLSM, and their mixed $\phi$/$\pi$ amplitudes, reducing to the corresponding field theory amplitudes in the $\alpha'\to 0$ limit. Our results demonstrate how positive geometries can be utilized beyond rational functions to capture stringy features of amplitudes, such as an infinite resonance structure. The kinematic $\delta$-shift, recently proposed to relate field theory $\mathrm{Tr}(\phi^3)$ and NLSM pion amplitudes, naturally emerges as the leading contribution to the stringy geometry. We show how the connection between $\mathrm{Tr}(\phi^3)$ and NLSM can be geometrized using the associahedral grid.</description>

Abstract: We propose a signal $\Delta^{(3)}_p$ for genuine tripartite entanglement in finite-dimensional quantum systems and $\Delta^{(3)}_w$ for holographic systems. We prove that $\Delta^{(3)}_p$ is non-negative for any tripartite entangled mixed states. Based on the conjecture, the equality between an entanglement wedge cross section $E_w$ and entanglement of purification $E_p$, i.e., $E_w = E_P$ in the semiclassical limit, we apply the tripartite entanglement measure to study the structures of tripartite entanglement in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, especially for pure AdS$_3$. We comment on a generalization to $n$-partite entanglement signals $\Delta^{(n)}_p(A_1:\cdots:A_n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to construct Hamiltonian lattice theories with one exact supersymmetry on arbitrary triangulations of curved space in any number of dimensions. Both bosons and fermions satisfy discrete K\"{a}hler-Dirac equations. The quantization of the fermions proceeds by imposing conventional anti-commutation relations while the bosons require a modification of the usual canonical commutator. On regular lattices we construct parity, time reversal and translation-by-one (shift) symmetries. We argue that the latter are generically non-invertible symmetries. We also show how to couple these degrees of freedom to background gauge fields which leads to a theory with enhanced supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Wrapped D4-branes from maximal 6D gauged supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a large class of domain wall solutions with $Mkw_3\times \Sigma^2$ and $Mkw_2\times \Sigma^3$ slices from maximal gauged supergravity in six dimensions. $\Sigma^2$ and $\Sigma^3$ are given by a Riemann surface and a $3$-manifold with constant curvature while $Mkw_{3,2}$ denotes three/two-dimensional Minkowski space. We consider the maximal gauged supergravity with $CSO(p,q,5-p-q)$ and $CSO(p,q,4-p-q)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^4$ gauge groups arising from an $S^1$ reduction of seven-dimensional maximal gauged supergravity with $CSO(p,q,5-p-q)$ and $CSO(p,q,4-p-q)$ gauge groups. The two types of gauge group can be embedded in type IIA theory via consistent truncations on $H^{p,q}\times \mathbb{R}^{5-p-q}$ and $H^{p,q}\times\mathbb{R}^{4-p-q}\times S^1$, respectively. By performing topological twists on $\Sigma^2$ and $\Sigma^3$, we find a number of solutions interpolating between locally flat domain walls in the UV and curved domain walls with $Mkw_3\times \Sigma^2$ and $Mkw_2\times \Sigma^3$ slices in the IR. Many solutions admit physical IR singularities and can be interpreted as holographic RG flows across dimensions from five-dimensional field theories to three- and two-dimensional non-conformal field theories in the IR. Upon uplifted to type IIA theory, we expect the solutions to describe brane configurations involving D4-branes wrapped on $\Sigma^2$ and $\Sigma^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multifield models, arising from multiple scalars interacting with gravity, provide a rich theoretical framework for addressing fundamental problems in modern cosmology. A key role in this regard is played by the so called rapid turn regime, which is characterized by background solutions with strongly non-geodesic field-space trajectories. We review the implications of this regime for a number of problems relevant for cosmological inflation, dark matter and dark energy. We focus, in more detail, on a class of exact rapid-turn solutions that give a model of dynamical dark energy. In this model, the sound speed of the dark energy perturbations is reduced compared to the speed of light, which leads to observational differences from a cosmological constant even for an equation-of-state parameter very close to -1. Furthermore, this model holds promise for the simultaneous alleviation of two prominent cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>The SymTFT for $N$-ality defects: Part I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to obtain the SymTFT for a theory with an $N$-ality extension of a discrete, Abelian group $G$, one begins by considering a bulk $G$-gauge theory, and then gauges an appropriate $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry. This procedure involves three choices: the choice of a suitable bulk $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry, of a fractionalization class, and of a discrete torsion. The first choice is, somewhat surprisingly, the most involved, and in this paper we discuss it in detail. In particular, we show that the choice of bulk $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry determines all boundary $F$-symbols with a single incoming $N$-ality defect, and that any theory with an $N$-ality symmetry is invariant under a certain twisted gauging given in terms of these $F$-symbols. These $F$-symbols can furthermore be input into the pentagon identities to obtain the other $F$-symbols, up to freedoms related to the choices appearing in the second and third steps of bulk gauging. Although many of our results hold for general $N$, we restrict ourselves in some places to the case of $N=p$ prime. In particular, for generic triality defects, we acquire explicit $F$-symbols which are reminiscent of those in Tambara-Yamagami fusion categories.</description>

Abstract: We provide a detailed derivation of the Schwarzian modes in the full geometry of the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole at finite temperature, establishing the precise conditions under which they emerge from the general solution, thereby clarifying the absence of rotational modes in the full geometry. In addition, we demonstrate that the same modes can be recovered through a purely geometric Kerr-Schild construction. This equivalent approach offers a new geometric understanding of the Schwarzian sector and highlights the correspondence between perturbative and pure geometric approaches, additionally it provides a connection with double copy.</description>

      <title>Residue sums for superconformal indices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study superconformal indices of four-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theories with $\mathcal{N}=1,2,4$ supersymmetry. The usual representation of a gauge theory index involves multiple contour integrals and reflects the BPS spectrum at zero Yang-Mills coupling. To find an alternative, closed form expression, it is natural to attempt an evaluation of the integrals through residues. However, the presence of non-isolated essential singularities prevents a straightforward evaluation. We show how this difficulty can be resolved by fixing the residual Weyl symmetry of the integral. This allows us to evaluate the residue sums for superconformal indices of $SU(2)$ gauge theories in terms of basic and elliptic hypergeometric series. For the Macdonald index of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(2)$ super Yang--Mills theory, we show how known transformation formulas for basic hypergeometric series can be used to simplify the residue sum. We observe that the simplified form encodes features of the BPS spectrum at non-zero coupling and suggests the absence of fortuitous or non-graviton operators in the Macdonald sector. Furthermore, we evaluate the residue sums for the Macdonald and full superconformal indices of a general class of $SU(2)$ gauge theories. In the process, we find various applications to the theory of basic and elliptic hypergeometric integrals, including a convergent residue sum for Spiridonov's elliptic beta integral. Finally, we discuss the generalization of our method to higher rank gauge groups and evaluate the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(3)$ Macdonald index in closed form.</description>

      <title>EFT meets CFT: Multiloop renormalization of higher-dimensional operators in general $\phi^4$ theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The renormalization of composite operators is a fundamental aspect of quantum field theory, relevant for the description of phase transitions and high energy phenomenology. We calculate the anomalous dimensions of a large set of operators in any scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions, up to five loops in most cases. The results have applications in both effective field theory (EFT) and conformal field theory (CFT). As an EFT application, we extract the five-loop renormalization group (RG) equations of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model EFT at dimension six, and up to two loops at dimension eight, aligning our operator basis with custodial symmetry violation. Additionally, for CFT, by resumming the $\varepsilon$-expanded results at the fixed-point, we determine the entire low-lying spectrum (i.e. up to dimension six and Lorentz rank two) of the Ising, $O(n)$ and hypercubic scalar CFTs. Our work enables future conformal bootstrap studies for numerous theories of interest. We include introductions to EFT and CFT, and we illustrate our method and the structure in RG mixing matrices in several illuminating examples, which may also be of general interest. All results in the general theory are publicly available and we describe a systematic path towards applying them to more complicated CFTs.</description>

Abstract: As a generalisation of the recent construction by Russo and Townsend, we propose a new approach to generate $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant models for nonlinear electrodynamics. It is based on the use of two building blocks: (i) a fixed (but otherwise arbitrary) model for self-dual nonlinear electrodynamics with Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ depending on a duality-invariant parameter $g$; and (ii) an arbitrary potential $W(\psi)$, with $\psi$ an auxiliary scalar field. It turns out that the model $\mathfrak{L}(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) = L(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) + W(\psi)$ leads to a self-dual theory for nonlinear electrodynamics upon elimination of $\psi$. As an illustration, we work out two examples in which the seed Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ corresponds to the Born-Infeld model and two particular potentials $W(\psi)$ are chosen such that integrating out $\psi$ gives: (i) the ModMaxBorn theory; and (ii) the ModMax theory. We also briefly discuss supersymmetric generalisations of the proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>Imprints of flat space analyticity in de Sitter S-matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analytic structure of the flat-space S-matrix provides non-perturbative constraints on low-energy effective field theories based on the properties of high-energy theory. While the analytic structure of the flat-space S-matrix is well understood, extending this framework to de Sitter space is challenging, as the expanding background complicates the definition of asymptotic states and breaks time-translation symmetry. This paper investigates how flat-space analyticity is imprinted on the de Sitter S-matrix. We derive a relation between flat-space amplitude and de Sitter S-matrix on a specific limit called the Hubble flat-space limit. Specifically, we show that the relation holds for tree-level amplitude exchanging a massive scalar field with any local derivative interactions. Finally, we argue that the Hubble flat-space limit is more compatible with the description of effective field theory, as the total energy dependence of de Sitter S-matrix becomes trivial, allowing the Mandelstam variable to be identified as the unique energy scale, just as in flat space.</description>

      <title>Two roads to fortuity in ABJM theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently proposed addition to the holographic dictionary connects extremal black holes to fortuitous operators -- those which are only supersymmetric for sufficiently small values of the central charge. The most efficient techniques for finding them come from studying the cohomology of a nilpotent supercharge. We explore two aspects of this problem in weakly-coupled ABJM theory, where the gauge group is $\mathrm{U}(N) \times \mathrm{U}(N)$ and the Chern-Simons level is taken to be large. Adapting an algorithm which has been used to great effect in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills, we enumerate 244 low-lying fortuitous operators and sort them into multiplets of the centralizer algebra. This leads to the construction of two leading fortuitous representatives for $N = 3$ which are subleading for $N = 2$. In the second part of this work, we identify a truncation of ABJM theory where the action of the one-loop supercharge matches the one in the BMN subsector of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills. This allows a known infinite tower of representatives to be lifted from one theory to the other.</description>

      <title>Spin-operator form factors of the critical Ising chain and their finite volume scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a self-contained derivation of the spin-operator matrix elements in the fermionic basis, for the critical Ising chain at a generic system length $N\in 2Z_{\ge 2}$. The approach relies on the near-Cauchy property of certain matrices formed by the Toeplitz symbol in the critical model, and leads to simpler product formulas for the dressing functions in terms of square root functions. These square root products allow fully dis-singularized integral representations. In the finite volume scaling limit, they further reduce to the Binet's second integral for the gamma function logarithm and its Hermite's generalization. As such, all the matrix elements in the scaling limit allow simple product formulas in terms of the gamma function at integer and half-integer arguments, and are rational numbers up to $\sqrt{2}$. They are exactly the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, whose explicit forms are much less well known in comparison to the finite-volume form factors in the massive theory. We also fully determine the normalization factor of the spin-operator and show explicitly how the coefficient $G(\frac{1}{2})G(\frac{3}{2})$ appear through a ground state overlap.</description>

      <title>A scaling limit of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice Yang-Mills-Higgs theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The construction of non-Abelian Euclidean Yang-Mills theories in dimension four, as scaling limits of lattice Yang-Mills theories or otherwise, is a central open question of mathematical physics. This paper takes the following small step towards this goal. In any dimension $d\ge 2$, we construct a scaling limit of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice Yang-Mills theory coupled to a Higgs field (under the degenerate potential) transforming in the fundamental representation of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. After unitary gauge fixing and taking the lattice spacing $\varepsilon\to 0$, and simultaneously taking the gauge coupling constant $g\to 0$ and the Higgs length $\alpha\to \infty$ in such a manner that $\alpha g$ is always equal to $c\varepsilon$ for some fixed $c$ and $g= O(\varepsilon^{50d})$, a stereographic projection of the gauge field is shown to converge to a scale-invariant massive Gaussian field. This gives the first construction of a scaling limit of a non-Abelian lattice Yang-Mills theory in a dimension higher than two, as well as the first rigorous proof of mass generation by the Higgs mechanism in such a theory. Analogous results are proved for $\mathrm{U}(1)$ theory as well. The question of constructing a non-Gaussian scaling limit remains open.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto \omega^s$ via dissipation strengths $\alpha_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\alpha_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $\alpha_z = \alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s&lt;1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method for retarded interactions to explore how this nontrivial fixed-point structure affects the phase diagram and phase transitions of the anisotropic model. In particular, we show how fixed-point annihilation within a symmetry-enhanced critical manifold leads to (i) a continuous order-to-order transition beyond the Landau paradigm, (ii) a symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, and (iii) pseudocriticality, which can be tuned into each other via the bath exponent $s$. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. Moreover, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent. We also study the crossover away from the SU(2)-symmetric case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical phase.</description>

      <title>Cosmological bouncing solutions and their stability in higher-order torsion gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmological dynamics in the early universe are investigated to explore the possibility of the sign reversal of the Hubble parameter as a key feature of non-singular bouncing cosmological solutions in higher-order torsion gravity. The self-consistent multiple cosmological regimes are studied, such as the accelerated expansion, ultra-relativistic, radiation-dominated, sub-relativistic, dust, and stiff matter phases, for three distinct parametrizations of the scale factor: power-law, exponential, and hybrid forms. In particular, five characteristic bouncing scenarios are analyzed: symmetric bounce, super-bounce, oscillatory bounce, matter bounce, and Type IV singularity-free bounce, so that the gravitational Lagrangian can be reconstructed to satisfy bounce conditions at the bounce time. It is found that each scenario requires a violation of the null energy condition, implying the presence of exotic matter with an effective equation of state to drive both the bounce and late-time cosmic acceleration. As a result, it is explicitly demonstrated that higher-order torsion gravity naturally incorporates the bouncing solutions without introducing ad hoc matter fields, providing a possible geometric framework for non-singular early universe evolution. Furthermore, the consistency of the bouncing solutions with the observational constraints of the cosmic microwave background and gravitational wave spectrum is shown, while offering testable predictions for primordial perturbations.</description>

Abstract: In order to numerically compute scattering cross sections in QCD, one needs to deal with various kinematic divergences that appear at intermediate stages of the calculation. One way of doing this is by setting up an IR subtraction scheme. In this talk we give an update on the status of extending the CoLoRFul subtraction scheme, which has been successfully used in the past for processes with only final-state hadrons, to hadron-hadron collisions. In particular we discuss the analytic computation of the integrated counterterms.</description>

Abstract: For the first time, we present the model-independent two-loop effective action up to dimension six after integrating out heavy scalar(s) employing the Heat-Kernel method. We compute the effective operators that emerge at two-loop for two example models: heavy electroweak complex Triplet and Doublet scalars. We present our results on the SILH basis. We also capture the effect in the fermion sector. For these two scenarios, we compute all the fermionic effective operators up to dimension six.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14359v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of quantum information and computational resources using a tractable model of coupled harmonic oscillators. We precisely characterize the interplay between mutual information, synchronization, and circuit complexity, demonstrating that they serve as complementary yet distinct measures of quantum correlations. Our analysis reveals how coupling strength, detuning, and external magnetic fields modulate these quantities, with synchronization and mutual information exhibiting marked divergence in nonlinear regimes. By employing exact Gaussian methods, we compute the circuit depth required to prepare target states and connect increased fidelity to more regular dynamical behavior. Furthermore, we analyze single-ion transport in a harmonic trap, comparing sudden and adiabatic protocols. We introduce a nonadiabaticity metric to quantify the fidelity-complexity trade-off, showing that smooth control sequences significantly minimize operational errors by suppressing excitations. These results provide a refined understanding of quantum correlations and offer concrete principles for optimizing control strategies in quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral form factor of random matrix theory plays a key role in the description of disordered and chaotic quantum systems. While its moments are known to be approximately Gaussian, corrections subleading in the matrix dimension, $D$, have recently come to attention, with conflicting results in the literature. In this work, we investigate these departures from Gaussianity for both circular and Gaussian ensembles. Using two independent approaches -- sine-kernel techniques and supersymmetric field theory -- we identify the form factor statistics to next leading order in a $D^{-1}$ expansion. Our sine-kernel analysis highlights inconsistencies with previous studies, while the supersymmetric approach backs these findings and suggests an understanding of the statistics from a complementary perspective. Our findings fully agree with numerics. They are presented in a pedagogical way, highlighting new pathways (and pitfalls) in the study of statistical signatures at next leading order, which are increasingly becoming important in applications.</description>

Abstract: We give an overview of recent developments in the computation of the anomalous dimension matrix of composite operators in non-forward kinematics. The elements of this matrix set the evolution of non-perturbative parton distributions such as the generalized parton distribution functions. The latter provide important information about hadronic structure and are accessible experimentally in hard exclusive scattering processes. We focus our discussion on a recent method that exploits consistency relations for the anomalous dimensions which follow from the renormalization structure of quark and gluon operators.</description>

Abstract: We present a search for boosted dark matter from Primordial Black Holes (PBH) evaporation using the DarkSide-50 ionization-signal-only dataset corresponding to the experiment's ($12202\pm180$) ${\rm kg\: d}$ exposure. We focus on evaporation of PBHs with masses in the range [$10^{14},\,10^{16}$] g producing Dirac fermionic dark matter particles with sub-GeV kinetic energy. These relativistic particles, with energies up to hundreds of MeV, can generate detectable signals for masses below $\mathcal{O}(100)$ MeV. The absence of a signal enables setting complementary limits to those derived from cosmological observations and direct detection searches for cosmic ray-boosted dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Taking as a model the fact that Heisenberg's matrix mechanics was derived from Hamiltonian mechanics using the correspondence principle, we explore a class of dynamical systems involving discrete variables, with Nambu mechanics as the starting point. Specifically, we reconstruct an extended version of matrix mechanics that describes dynamical systems possessing physical quantities expressed through generalized matrices. Furthermore, we reconfirm that a multiple commutator involving generalized matrices can serve as a discrete (quantized) version of the Nambu bracket or the Jacobian.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave standard sirens: A brief review of cosmological parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations are expected to serve as a powerful and independent probe of the expansion history of the universe. By providing direct and calibration-free measurements of luminosity distances through waveform analysis, GWs provide a fundamentally different and potentially more robust approach to measuring cosmic-scale distances compared to traditional electromagnetic (EM) observations, which is known as the standard siren method. In this review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren cosmology, including up-to-date $H_0$ constraints, and prospects for constraining cosmological parameters using future GW detections. A central focus of this review is the unique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies inherent in the EM observations. We also briefly highlight the impact of systematic uncertainties, such as detector calibration, weak lensing, peculiar velocities, and host-galaxy catalog completeness, and corresponding potential mitigation strategies, which currently limit the constraint precision of cosmological parameters. Looking forward, we highlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging late-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity mapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe for exploring the late universe.</description>

      <title>Can Static Black Holes in Massive Gravity Serve as Candidates for Aschenbach-Like Phenomena?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Aschenbach effect is widely regarded as a manifestation of two quintessential relativistic features: frame dragging and extreme spacetime curvature. Traditionally associated with rotating geometries, this non-monotonic behavior in orbital angular velocity challenges Newtonian intuition. In our previous work, however, we demonstrated that this velocity irregularity is not exclusive to spinning spacetimes. Specifically, we showed that the presence of a stable minimum in the gravitational potential, corresponding to a stable photon sphere, can reproduce Aschenbach-like behavior in static black holes as well. This observation suggests that, even in the absence of rotational frame dragging, curvature alone (if encoded through appropriate geometric extrema) may be sufficient to induce non-monotonic velocity profiles.
  In this study, we build upon that foundation to investigate whether black hole architectures in theories of Massive Gravity can inherently support the emergence of Aschenbach-like phenomena. Furthermore, can this Aschenbach-like phenomenon in static configurations be considered as an observable signature in the dynamics of general relativity, similar to the original Aschenbach effect in rotating spacetimes?</description>

      <title>Gauge fields in the presence of the electroweak bubble wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20134v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gauge field theory of the standard electroweak model in the presence of the electroweak bubble wall is investigated with a view to its applications to microscopic phenomena, which are believed to have occurred during the phase transition in the early universe. The asymptotic fields are defined anew so that the effects of the position-dependent Higgs condensate are taken into account through the position-dependent $W$ and $Z$ boson masses. A novel method of massive gauge field quantization in the $R_{\xi}$-gauge with $\xi =1$ is proposed for the case of the position-dependent masses. Our procedure is based on the eigenfunction expansion method associated with second-order differential operators, i.e., a sort of generalized Fourier expansion. The commutation relations of creation and annihilation operators of various wave propagation modes are given in terms of what is known as the spectral function. The decoupling of unphysical states from the physical S-matrix is also investigated along the line of Kugo-Ojima's quartet mechanism on the basis of the BRST symmetry. It is pointed out that one of the quartet fields is not merely the unphysical scalar field but should be a linear combination of the unphysical scalar and the gauge fields. The physical and unphysical polarizations of the gauge field waves are unambiguously distinguished and this will help us evaluate the friction caused by the physical polarization states of $W$ and $Z$ boson waves on the bubble wall during the phase transition in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Complex Dynamics in Far-from-equilibrium Systems: Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic systems dominated by strong nonlinearity are reformulated within a dynamical framework based on the Nambu bracket formalism. It is demonstrated that general complex nonlinear non-equilibrium systems can be locally reduced to a simple form of Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics (NNET). Furthermore, mathematical and dynamical obstacles encountered in extending this reduction globally are discussed, and a generalized formulation that incorporates nonlinear effects through mixed higher-order tensors is proposed.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Structure of an Extended Standard Model with $U(1)_D$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this research, we investigate the vacuum structure of an extended standard model with a $U(1)_D$ global symmetry. The scalar sector consists of two $SU(2)$ doublets as well as one complex singlet and one real singlet, resulting in a more complicated vacuum structure compared to that of the Standard Model. We analyze various theoretical constraints, including the conditions for being bounded from below, the existence of a global minimum, and perturbativity up to the Planck scale. Additionally, we consider experimental constraints from the Higgs invisible decay. Through a detailed statistical analysis using numerical methods, we show that the extended scalar potential can accommodate a stable vacuum while satisfying both theoretical and experimental constraints for a small region of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Applications of Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics to Specific Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply Nambu non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NNET)-a dynamics with multiple Hamiltonians coupled to entropy-induced dissipation-to paradigmatic far-from-equilibrium systems. Concretely, we construct NNET realizations for the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction (oscillatory), the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model (spiking), and the Lorenz and Chen systems (chaotic), and analyze their dynamical and thermodynamic signatures. Across all cases the velocity field cleanly decomposes into a reversible Nambu part and an irreversible entropygradient part, anchored by a model-independent quasi-conserved quantity. This construction reproduces cycles, spikes, and strange-attractor behavior and clarifies transitions among steady, periodic, and chaotic regimes via cross-model diagnostics. These results demonstrate that NNET provides a unified, quantitatively consistent framework for oscillatory, spiking, and chaotic non-equilibrium systems, offering a systematic description beyond the scope of linear-response theories such as Onsager's relations or GENERIC.</description>

      <title>Wormhole-Induced correlation: A Link Between Two Universes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>The large-$N$ limit of the topological susceptibility of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theories via Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a large-$N$ determination of the topological susceptibility $\chi$ of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang--Mills theories using non-perturbative numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice-discretized theory for $3\le N \le 6$, and adopting the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions (PTBC) algorithm to bypass topological freezing for $N&gt;3$. Thanks to this algorithm I am able to explore a uniform range of lattice spacings across all values of $N$, and to precisely determine $\chi$ for finer lattice spacings compared to previous studies with periodic or open boundary conditions. By taking the continuum limit at fixed smoothing radius in physical units, I am also able to show the independence of the continuum limit of $\chi$ from this choice. I conclude providing a comprehensive comparison of my new PTBC results with previous determinations of the topological susceptibility in the literature, both at finite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave standard sirens from GWTC-3 combined with DESI DR2 and DESY5: A late-universe probe of the Hubble constant and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data and the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements has shown a $\sim$3$\sigma$ preference for a dynamical dark energy model with a phantom-crossing behavior. However, such a phantom-crossing dark energy evolution further exacerbates the already severe Hubble tension in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Moreover, there exists a $\sim2\sigma$ tension between the DESI DR2 BAO and CMB datasets. Therefore, it is essential to measure the Hubble constant and dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameters using only late-universe observations. In this work, we investigate a novel late-universe data combination: gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, BAO, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This combination provides a fully distance-ladder- and CMB-independent determination of the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS. Using 47 GW standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, the DESI DR2 BAO data, and DESY5 SNe Ia data, in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we obtain $H_0=74.8^{+6.3}_{-8.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.320^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, $w_0=-0.775^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$, and $w_a=-0.80\pm0.47$, indicating a mild phantom-crossing behavior within the $1\sigma$ credible interval with an $H_0$ value consistent with the distance ladder measurements. Our analysis demonstrates the power of GW standard sirens in breaking parameter degeneracies, and this novel data combination provides joint constraints on the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS parameters.</description>

      <title>Genesis of Axion Dark Matter via Black Hole and Cosmic String Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global $U_{PQ}(1)$ Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry, proposed to resolve the strong CP problem, predicts the existence of the axion, a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson and a leading dark matter candidate. The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry generates global strings that decay predominantly via the emission of massive axions and gravitational waves. In this work, we investigate the decay of cosmic axion strings in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole and estimate the corresponding energy losses and decay timescales of the resulting string loops. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses as small as $10^{-16} M_\odot$, the total energy radiated by the contracting strings is found to be on the order of $10^{27} \, \mathrm{GeV}$, accounting for both axion and gravitational radiation. Our analysis shows that the presence of a central black hole considerably accelerates string loop decay, leading to significantly reduced lifetimes. These results constitute an initial exploration of whether axion radiation from PBH-cosmic string systems could provide a non-negligible contribution to the dark matter content of galactic halos. The study also identifies the decay time as a potentially valuable observational signature. Further detailed modeling will be necessary to assess the cosmological implications of this mechanism more precisely.</description>

Abstract: Symmetries play a crucial role in shaping the structure and predictions of multi-Higgs-doublet models. In three-Higgs-doublet models considerable effort has been put into classifying possible symmetry groups and the conditions for their realisation, yet the completeness of existing classifications remains an open question. In this work, we revisit the problem of identifying realisable symmetries by re-examining conventional Higgs family and general CP transformations from an alternative perspective. Our analysis identifies certain limitations in previous approaches and introduces a clearer, more systematic framework for model builders. We expand our classification by investigating more generalised symmetry structures -- the recently identified GOOFy transformations, which act non-trivially on the Higgs doublets and their conjugates. Our analysis consolidates known results, uncovers previously overlooked structures, and expands the set of symmetries in three-Higgs-doublet models, offering both a clearer theoretical foundation and a practical reference for symmetry-based model building.</description>

Abstract: We implement a probe counterpart of Newman-Janis algorithm, which Wick rotates the all-orders geodesic deviation equation into a part of exact spinning-particle equations of motion. Consequently, the gravitational dynamics of the Kerr black hole in its point-particle effective theory is completely constrained in the self-dual sector for a hidden symmetry, implying the spin exponentiation of same-helicity gravitational Compton amplitudes to all multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Pauli stabilizer formalism for topological quantum field theories and generalized statistics</title>

Abstract: Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) provides a unifying framework for describing topological phases of matter and for constructing quantum error-correcting codes, playing a central role across high-energy physics, condensed matter, and quantum information. A central challenge is to formulate topological order on lattices and to extract the properties of topological excitations from microscopic Hamiltonians. In this work, we construct new classes of lattice gauge theories as Pauli stabilizer models, realizing a wide range of TQFTs in general dimensions. We develop a lattice description of extended excitations and systematically determine their generalized statistics. Our main example is the (4+1)D fermionic-loop toric code, obtained by condensing the $e^2m^2$-loop in the (4+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code. We show that the loop excitation exhibits fermionic loop statistics: the 24-step loop-flipping process yields a phase of $-1$. Our Pauli stabilizer models realize all twisted 2-form gauge theories in (4+1)D, the higher-form Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT classified by $H^5(B^2G,U(1))$. Beyond (4+1)D, the fermionic-loop toric codes form a family of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in arbitrary dimensions, realized as explicit Pauli stabilizer codes using $\mathbb{Z}_4$ qudits. Finally, we develop a Pauli-based framework that defines generalized statistics for extended excitations in any dimension, yielding computable lattice unitary processes to detect nontrivial statistics. For example, we propose anyonic membrane statistics in (6+1)D, as well as fermionic membrane and volume statistics in arbitrary dimensions. We construct new families of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders: the fermionic-membrane toric code and the fermionic-volume toric code. In addition, we demonstrate that $p$-dimensional excitations in $2p+2$ spatial dimensions can support anyonic $p$-brane statistics for only even $p$.</description>
