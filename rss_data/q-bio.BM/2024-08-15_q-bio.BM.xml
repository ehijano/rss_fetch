      <title>Integration of Genetic Algorithms and Deep Learning for the Generation and Bioactivity Prediction of Novel Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intersection of artificial intelligence and bioinformatics has enabled significant advancements in drug discovery, particularly through the application of machine learning models. In this study, we present a combined approach using genetic algorithms and deep learning models to address two critical aspects of drug discovery: the generation of novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the prediction of their bioactivity. The generative model leverages genetic algorithms to create new small molecules with optimized ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) and drug-likeness properties. Concurrently, a deep learning model is employed to predict the bioactivity of these generated molecules against tyrosine kinases, a key enzyme family involved in various cellular processes and cancer progression. By integrating these advanced computational methods, we demonstrate a powerful framework for accelerating the generation and identification of potential tyrosine kinase inhibitors, contributing to more efficient and effective early-stage drug discovery processes.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Structural Ensemble Generation of Macrocyclic Peptides using Internal Coordinate Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macrocyclic peptides are an emerging therapeutic modality, yet computational approaches for accurately sampling their diverse 3D ensembles remain challenging due to their conformational diversity and geometric constraints. Here, we introduce RINGER, a diffusion-based transformer model using a redundant internal coordinate representation that generates three-dimensional conformational ensembles of macrocyclic peptides from their 2D representations. RINGER provides fast backbone and side-chain sampling while respecting key structural invariances of cyclic peptides. Through extensive benchmarking and analysis against gold-standard conformer ensembles of cyclic peptides generated with metadynamics, we demonstrate how RINGER generates both high-quality and diverse geometries at a fraction of the computational cost. Our work lays the foundation for improved sampling of cyclic geometries and the development of geometric learning methods for peptides.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Programmable Lipid Nanoparticles: A Comprehensive Review of the Four-Domain Model for Precision Drug Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Programmable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent a critical advancement in drug delivery. It offers precise spatiotemporal control over drug distribution and release, which is essential for treating complex diseases such as cancer and genetic disorders. However, the design and understanding of these sophisticated systems necessitate a structured framework. This review introduces a novel Four-Domain Model - the Architecture, Interface, Payload, and Dispersal - providing a modular perspective that emphasizes the programmability of LNPs. We delve into the dynamics between LNPs components and their environment throughout their lifecycle, focusing on thermodynamic stability during synthesis, storage, delivery, and drug release. Through these four distinct but interconnected domains, we introduce the concept of input stimuli, functional components, and output responses. This modular approach offers new perspectives for the rational design of programmable nanocarriers for exquisite control over payload release while minimizing off-target effects. Advances in bioinspired design principles could lead to LNPs that mimic natural biological systems, enhancing their biocompatibility and functionality. This review summarizes recent advancements, identifies challenges, and offers outlooks for programmable LNPs, emphasizing their potential to evolve into more intelligent, naturally integrated systems that enhance scalability and reduce side effects. Additionally, exploring innovative anatomical routes such as intranasal and intraocular delivery holds significant promise for enhancing drug delivery efficacy and patient compliance, further expanding the clinical potential of programmable LNPs.</description>
