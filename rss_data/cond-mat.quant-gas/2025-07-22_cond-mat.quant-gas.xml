      <title>Multiply quantized vortex spectroscopy in a quantum fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of quantized vortices is a unifying feature of quantum mechanical systems, making it a premier means for fundamental and comparative studies of different quantum fluids. Being excited states of motion, vortices are normally unstable towards relaxation into lower energy states. However, here we exploit the driven-dissipative nature of polaritonic fluids of light to create stationary, multiply charged vortices. We measure the spectrum of collective excitations and observe negative energy modes at the core and positive energy modes at large radii. Their coexistence at the same frequency normally causes the dynamical instability, but here intrinsic losses stabilize the system, allowing for phase pinning by the pump on macroscopic scales. We observe common features of quantized vortices in quantum fluids and other rotating geometries like astrophysical compact objects, opening the way to the study of universal amplification phenomena.</description>

      <title>Interference and short-range correlation in fermionic Hubbard gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interference patterns of ultracold atoms, observed after ballistic expansion from optical lattices, encode essential information about strongly correlated lattice systems, including phase coherence and non-local correlations. While the interference of lattice bosons has been extensively investigated, quantitative studies of the lattice fermion interference remain challenging. Here, we report the observation and quantitative characterization of interference patterns in low-temperature, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases. We develop a novel method to extract first-order correlations from interference patterns, which directly reflect the short-range phase coherence of lattice fermions. Mapping the nearest-neighbor correlations as a function of lattice filling and interaction strength, we observe a crossover from a metal to a Mott insulator. Moreover, at half filling, the measured correlations agree well with quantum Monte Carlo calculations and remain finite in the regime of strong repulsion, revealing virtual tunneling processes driven by quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Observation of Self-Bound Droplets of Ultracold Dipolar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Spin Faraday pattern formation in a circular spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate with stripe phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin Faraday pattern formation in a periodically driven, pancake-shaped spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) prepared with stripe phase. By modulating atomic interactions using $in$-$phase$ and $out$-$of$-$phase$ protocols, we observe collective excitation modes with distinct rotational symmetries (L-fold). Crucially, at the critical modulation frequency, $out$-$of$-$phase$ modulation destabilizes the L = 6 pattern, whereas $in$-$phase$ modulation not only preserves high symmetry but also excites higher-order modes (L $\ge $ 6). Unlike conventional binary BECs, Faraday patterns emerge here without initial noise due to SOC-induced symmetry breaking, with all patterns exhibiting supersolid characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate control over pattern symmetry, radial nodes, and pattern radius by tuning the modulation frequency, providing a new approach for manipulating quantum fluid dynamics. This work establishes a platform for exploring supersolidity and nonlinear excitations in SOC systems with stripe phase.</description>

      <title>Supersolidity in Optically Trapped Polariton Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superfluids under specific conditions can exhibit spontaneous breaking of continuous translation symmetries and form exotic spatially ordered states of matter known as supersolids. Despite its early theoretical prediction, it took over half-a-centrury to experimentally demonstrate the supersolid phase in ultracold atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, forming due to long-range interatomic interactions. Here we propose as a promising new platform for supersolidity exciton-polariton superfluids, confined in annular optically induced traps. The supersolid phase emerges due to effective attractive interactions, mediated by the normal excitonic component of the system. Experimental demonstration of spontaneously formed spatially ordered phase is in agreement with detailed mean-field theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. The spontaneous character of the observed supersolid transition is further evidenced by the formation of specific zero-energy Nambu-Goldstone modes in the collective excitation spectrum.</description>

      <title>Granovskii-Zhedanov Scar of XYZ Spin-chain: Modern Algebraic Perspectives and Realization in Higher Dimensional Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a work by Granovskii and Zhedanov, a surprising scar state exhibiting zero entanglement and long periodicity was discovered in the XYZ spin chains; remarkably, nearly three decades before the concept of many-body scars became a subject of active research. In this study, we uncover the origin of the Granovskii-Zhedanov (GZ) scar within the framework of the modern understanding of quantum many-body scars. We demonstrate that the scar subspace can be effectively described using the standard spectrum-generating algebra (SGA) framework and through a group-theoretical formulation of the Hamiltonian. This description, however, is applicable only in the XXZ limit, where a quasi-$U(1)$ symmetry exists within the scar subspace. In contrast, the absence of such quasi-$U(1)$ symmetry for the GZ scar subspace restricts the applicability of these standard formulations. We propose two alternative techniques: approximated SGA and generalized SGA, which construct and describe the scar subspace in the XYZ case. Using these approaches, we can characterize the scar subspaces. We further explore the possibility of constructing lattice-independent GZ scars in higher-dimensional uniform spin-exchange systems with centrosymmetry, using graphical rules developed for GZ scar construction. Our results indicate that lattice-independent GZ scars cannot be supported on uniform lattices with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with an odd number of edges, while uniform lattices featuring even coordination numbers and even-edged plaquettes can host such lattice-independent scars in specific scenarios. Remarkably, if certain bonds retain the full $SU(2)$ symmetry of the spin-exchange interaction, thereby breaking the spatial uniformity of the lattice, lattice-independent GZ scars can still emerge in systems with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with an odd number of edges.</description>

      <title>Regge poles of analogous rotating black holes in binary Bose-Einstein condensates: The gapped excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectrum of the Regge poles (RPs), which are the counterparts of quasinormal modes, in a draining bathtub vortex within a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) system. We study the gapped excitations of the condensate with the spatially dependent energy gap term using a spatially tunable Rabi coupling, which will be treated as a perturbation. This model serves as an analogue of a rotating black hole surrounded by an environmental mass shell. We first compute the semiclassical scattering amplitude with the spatially independent mass effect due to the orbital interference. In the case of the mass-shell, bifurcation of the spectrum is observed, resulting in the destabilization of the RPs. We also study the migration of RPs by shifting the bump position. Our results show that the RPs of the co-rotating modes exhibit greater stability than those of the counter-rotating modes. Large migration and overtaking jumps of the overtone (fundamental RP) leave an imprint on the scattering amplitude at small (large) scattering angles. This can be observed in the scattering interference pattern in experiments.</description>

      <title>Discrete time crystal and perfect many-body tunneling in a periodically driven Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain driven by a periodic magnetic field. Based on its instantaneous integrability and inherent symmetry, we analytically study the magnetization and many-body tunneling (MBT). Both of them exhibit periodicity distinct from the driving period. The magnetization is shown to be independent of the initial state and robust against perturbations, signaling the formation of discrete time crystal (DTC) order. The DTC phase is found to be continuously tunable through magnetic field. The system exhibits perfect MBT, manifested as exactly vanishing Loschmidt echo (LE) thus divergent LE rate function at half period of the DTC. Remarkably, the perfect MBT is independent of the system size, and can be traced to an effective gap closure induced by quantum geometric effects. Furthermore, the Loschmidt echo spectra entropy shows logarithmic-dependence on system size, consistent with non-thermal nature of the DTC phase. We propose a protocol using ultracold atoms for experimental realization of the DTC and MBT.</description>

      <title>Rotation quenches in trapped bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ground state properties of strongly rotating bosons confined in an asymmetric anharmonic potential exhibit a split density distribution. However, the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of this split structure remain largely unexplored. Given that rotation is responsible for the breakup of the bosonic cloud, we investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics by abruptly changing the rotation frequency. Our study offers insights into the dynamics of trapped Bose-Einstein condensates in both symmetric and asymmetric anharmonic potentials under different rotation quench scenarios. In the rotationally symmetric trap, angular momentum is a good quantum number. This makes it challenging to exchange angular momentum within the system; hence, a rotation quench does practically not impact the density distribution. In contrast, the absence of angular momentum conservation in asymmetric traps results in more complex dynamics. This allows rotation quenches to either inject into or extract angular momentum from the system. We observe and analyze these intricate dynamics both for the mean-field condensed and the many-body fragmented systems. The dynamical evolution of the condensed system and the fragmented system exhibits similarities in several observables during small rotation quenches. However, these similarities diverge notably for larger quenches. Additionally, we investigate the formation and the impact of the vortices on the angular momentum dynamics of the evolving split density. All in all, our findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of trapped interacting bosons under different rotation quenches.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic preparation of a number-conserving atomic Majorana phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a protocol to adiabatically prepare the ground state of a widely discussed number-conserving model Hamiltonian for ultracold atoms in optical lattices that supports Majorana edge states. In particular, we introduce a symmetry breaking mass term that amounts to threading a commensurate (artificial) magnetic flux through the plaquettes of the considered two-leg ladder which opens a constant bulk gap. This enables the preparation of the topological Majorana phase from a trivial Mott insulator state with optimal asymptotic scaling of the ramp time in system size, which is linear owing to the critical nature of the target state. Using constructive bosonization techniques that account for both finite size effects and global fermion number conservation, we are able to fully explain with theory the somewhat counterintuitive necessity of the aforementioned commensurate flux for a controlled bulk gap. Our analytical predictions are corroborated and quantified by unbiased numerical matrix product states (MPS) simulations. Directly building up on previous experimental work, the crucial flux-term of the proposed protocol is feasible with state-of-the-art experimental techniques in atomic quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the preparation of topological insulator states with fermionic ultracold atoms in optical lattices by means of measurement-based Markovian feedback control. The designed measurement and feedback operators induce an effective dissipative channel that stabilizes the desired insulator state, either in an exact way or approximately in the case where additional experimental constraints are assumed. Successful state preparation is demonstrated in one-dimensional insulators as well as for Haldane's Chern insulator, by calculating the fidelity between the target ground state and the steady state of the feedback-modified master equation. The fidelity is obtained numerically through exact diagonalization or via time evolution of the system with moderate sizes. For larger 2D systems, we compare the mean occupation of the single-particle eigenstates for the ground and steady state computed through mean-field kinetic equations.</description>

Abstract: We study the frequency-resolved density response of a photon Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to a bath of dye molecules by time-periodic driving. By monitoring the photon number dynamics for different drive frequencies, we obtain the spectral response of the condensate in a phase-sensitive way. We find that as the photon number increases, the response of the coupled condensate-bath system transitions from overdamped to resonant behavior, indicating a transition from closed to open system dynamics. Our spectroscopy method paves the way for studies of collective excitations in complex driven-dissipative systems.</description>

Abstract: A topological quantum number, the Witten index, characterizes supersymmetric models by probing for zero energy modes and the possibility of supersymmetry breaking. We propose an averaging method to infer the Witten index in quantum analog simulators. Motivated by recent work on Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays, we consider a related supersymmetric XXZ spin model. We show how to infer the Witten index from open system averaging and numerically demonstrate its topological robustness in this model. Our Letter defines a route for quantum analog simulators to directly identify many-body topological physics.</description>

      <title>Semi-group influence matrices for non-equilibrium quantum impurity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for describing the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity models out of equilibrium which is based on the influence matrix approach. By replacing the dynamical map of a large fermionic quantum environment with an effective semi-group influence matrix (SGIM) which acts on a reduced auxiliary space, we overcome the limitations of previous proposals, achieving high accuracy at long evolution times. This SGIM corresponds to a uniform matrix-product state representation of the influence matrix and can be obtained by an efficient algorithm presented in this paper. We benchmark this approach by computing the spectral function of the single impurity Anderson model with high resolution. Further, the spectrum of the effective dynamical map allows us to obtain relaxation rates of the impurity towards equilibrium following a quantum quench. Finally, for a quantum impurity model with on-site two-fermion loss, we compute the spectral function and confirm the emergence of Kondo physics at large loss rates.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. Here, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</description>

      <title>Anyon-trions in atomically thin semiconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state, forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a direct optical observation of anyon-trions.</description>
