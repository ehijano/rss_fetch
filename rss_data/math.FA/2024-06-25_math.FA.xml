      <title>Maximal regularity for fractional difference equations with finite delay on UMD space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $\ell^p$-maximal regularity for the fractional difference equation with finite delay: \begin{equation*} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
  \Delta^{\alpha}u(n)=Au(n)+\gamma u(n-\lambda)+f(n), \ n\in \mathbb N_0, \lambda \in \mathbb N, \gamma \in \mathbb R;
  u(i)=0,\ \ i=-\lambda, -\lambda+1,\cdots, 1, 2,
  \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $A$ is a bounded linear operator defined on a Banach space $X$, $f:\mathbb N_0\rightarrow X$ is an $X$-valued sequence and $2&lt;\alpha&lt;3$. We introduce an operator theoretical method based on the notion of $\alpha$-resolvent sequence of bounded linear operators, which gives an explicit representation of solution. Further, using Blunck's operator-valued Fourier multipliers theorems on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z}; X)$, we completely characterize the $\ell^p$-maximal regularity of solution when $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ and $X$ is a UMD space.</description>

      <title>Representation in $C(K)$ by Lipschitz functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isometric universality of the spaces $C(K)$ for $K$ a non scattered Hausdorff compact does not take into account the ``quality'' of the representation. Indeed, the existence of an isometric copy of a separable Banach space $X$ into $C(K)$ made of regular enough functions, say Lipschitz with respect to a lower semicontinuous metric defined on $K$, imposes severe restrictions to both $X$ and $K$. In this paper, we present a systematic treatment of the representation of Banach spaces into $C(K)$ by Lipschitz functions improving previous results of the author.</description>

      <title>Measure theoretic aspects of the finite Hilbert transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite Hilbert transform $T$, when acting in the classical Zygmund space $\logl$ (over $(-1,1)$), was intensively studied in \cite{curbera-okada-ricker-log}. In this note an integral representation of $T$ is established via the $L^1(-1,1)$-valued measure $\mlog\colon A\mapsto T(\chi_A)$ for each Borel set $A\subseteq(-1,1)$. This integral representation, together with various non-trivial properties of $\mlog$, allow the use of measure theoretic methods (not available in \cite{curbera-okada-ricker-log}) to establish new properties of $T$. For instance, as an operator between Banach function spaces $T$ is not order bounded, it is not completely continuous and neither is it weakly compact. An appropriate Parseval formula for $T$ plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Almost Auerbach, Markushevich and Schauder bases in Hilbert and Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any sequence of positive numbers $(\varepsilon_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ such that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \varepsilon_n = \infty$ we provide an explicit simple construction of $(1+\varepsilon_n)$-bounded Markushevich basis in a separable Hilbert space which is not strong, or, in other terminology, is not hereditary complete; this condition on the sequence $(\varepsilon_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is sharp. Using a finite-dimensional version of this construction, Dvoretzky's theorem and a construction of Vershynin, we conclude that in any Banach space for any sequence of positive numbers $(\varepsilon_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ such that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \varepsilon_n^2 = \infty$ there exists a $(1+\varepsilon_n)$-bounded Markushevich basis which is not a Schauder basis after any permutation of its elements.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet type spaces in the unit bidisc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that an analytic $2$-isometric left-inverse commuting pair on a Hilbert space always possess wandering subspace property. Along with this, we define Dirichlet-type space $\mathcal{D}^{2}(\boldsymbol{\mu})$ over the bidisc $\mathbb D^2$ for any measure $\boldsymbol{\mu}\in\mathcal{P}\mathcal{M}_{+}(\mathbb T^2).$ We prove that the pair $(M_{z_1},M_{z_2})$ of multiplication by the coordinate functions on $\mathcal{D}^{2}(\boldsymbol{\mu})$ is an analytic $2$-isometric left-inverse commuting pair and satisfies $\langle z_1^m z_2^n, z_1^p z_2^q \rangle_{\boldsymbol{\mu}} = \langle z_1^m, z_1^p \rangle_{\mathcal{D}(\mu_1)} \langle z_2^n, z_2^q \rangle_{\mathcal{D}(\mu_2)},$ for any $m,n,p,q\in\mathbb Z_{\geqslant 0}.$ Furthermore, the unitary equivalent class of the commuting analytic $2$-isometric pair $(M_{z_1},M_{z_2})$ on $\mathcal{D}^{2}(\boldsymbol{\mu})$ is identified using left-inverse commutativity and the above property of inner product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we use Littlewood-Paley-Stein theory to prove two versions of Dunkl multiplier theorem when the multiplier $ m $ satisfies a modified H\"ormander condition. When $ m $ is radial we give a simple proof of a known result. For general $ m $ we prove that the Dunkl multiplier operator takes radial functions in $ L^p $ boundedly into $ L^p $ for all $ p \geq 2.$</description>

      <title>The Surface Signature and Rough Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel transport, or path development, provides a rich characterization of paths which preserves the underlying algebraic structure of concatenation. The path signature is universal among such maps: any (translation-invariant) parallel transport factors uniquely through the path signature. Furthermore, the path signature is a central object in the theory of rough paths, which provides an integration theory for highly irregular paths. A fundamental result is Lyons' extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough paths, and in turn provides a way to compute parallel transport of arbitrarily irregular paths. In this article, we consider the notion of surface holonomy, a generalization of parallel transport to the higher dimensional setting of surfaces parametrized by rectangular domains, which preserves the higher algebraic structures of horizontal and vertical concatenation. Building on work of Kapranov, we introduce the surface signature, which is universal among surface holonomy maps with respect to continuous 2-connections. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a rough surface and prove a surface extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough surfaces. By exploiting the universal property of the surface signature, this provides a method to compute the surface holonomy of arbitrarily irregular surfaces.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff Convergence of Smocked Measure Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smocked spaces are a special class of metric spaces which were introduced as a generalisation of pulled thread spaces. We investigate convergence of these spaces, showing that the smocked space obtained from the Hausdorff limit of a sequence of smocking sets is equivalent to the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the corresponding smocked spaces and also obtaining an analogue of Gromov's compactness theorem for smocked spaces. We then introduce smocked metric measure spaces and smocked Wasserstein spaces of measures, finding that there is a result for Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of certain smocked Wasserstein spaces which may be useful for studying a large class of PDEs which appear in mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>On well-posedness for parabolic Cauchy problems of Lions type with rough initial data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a complete picture for well-posedness of parabolic Cauchy problems with time-independent, uniformly elliptic, bounded measurable complex coefficients. We exhibit a range of $p$ for which tempered distributions in homogeneous Hardy--Sobolev spaces $\dot{H}^{s,p}$ with regularity index $s \in (-1,1)$ are initial data. Source terms of Lions' type lie in weighted tent spaces, and weak solutions are built with their gradients in weighted tent spaces as well. A similar result can be achieved for initial data in homogeneous Besov spaces $\dot{B}^{s}_{p,p}$.</description>

      <title>On the null space of the backprojection operator and Rubin's conjecture for the spherical mean transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spherical mean transform associates to a function $f$ its integral averages over all spheres. We consider the spherical mean transform for functions supported in the unit ball $\mathbb{B}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for odd $n$, with the centers of integration spheres restricted to the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. In this setup, Rubin employed properties of Erd\'elyi-Kober fractional integrals and analytic continuation to re-derive the explicit inversion formulas proved earlier by Finch, Patch, and Rakesh using wave equation techniques. As part of his work, Rubin stated a conjecture relating spherical mean transform, its associated backprojection operator and the Riesz potential. Furthermore, he pointed to the necessity of a detailed analysis of injectivity of the backprojection operator as a crucial step toward the resolution of his conjecture. This article addresses both questions posed by Rubin by providing a characterization of the null space of the backprojection operator, and disproving the conjecture through the construction of an explicit counterexample. Crucial to the proofs is the range characterization for the spherical mean transform in odd dimensions derived recently by the authors.</description>

      <title>On open book analogs of quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum graphs have become in this century a favorite playground for mathematicians, mathematical physicists, and chemists, due to their manifold applications as models of thin structures, as well as presenting sometimes simpler playground for hard higher dimensional problems.
  It was clear from some applications that thin surface structures (looking as stratified varieties) also arise, for instance in photonic crystals theory and dynamical systems. However, both justification and studying of these models is much harder and very little progress has been made by now. The goal of this note is to set down some basic notions and results for such structures.
  The name ``open book'' has been used for such geometric structures in topology and comes from an image of several smooth $n$-dimensional ``pages'' bound to an $(n-1)$- dimensional ``binding.''</description>

We do not know which is the first paper that used that false assertion, but the first one that we identified is from 2005 and the last one is from 2024.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of operator systems: tight extensions and noncommutative measurable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a unital $C^*$-algebra generated by some separable operator system $S$. More than a decade ago, Arveson conjectured that $S$ is hyperrigid in $A$ if all irreducible representations of $A$ are boundary representations for $S$. Recently, a counterexample to the conjecture was found by Bilich and Dor-On. To circumvent the difficulties hidden in this counterexample, we exploit some of Pedersen's seminal ideas on noncommutative measurable structures and establish an amended version of Arveson's conjecture. More precisely, we show that all irreducible representations of $A$ are boundary representations for $S$ precisely when all representations of $A$ admit a unique "tight" completely positive extension from $S$. In addition, we prove an equivalence between uniqueness of such tight extensions and rigidity of completely positive approximations for representations of nuclear $C^*$-algebras, thereby extending the classical principle of Korovkin--Saskin for commutative algebras.</description>

      <title>Approximation Theory of Tree Tensor Networks: Tensorized Multivariate Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.11932v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the approximation of multivariate functions with tensor networks (TNs). The main conclusion of this work is an answer to the following two questions: ``What are the approximation capabilities of TNs?" and "What is an appropriate model class of functions that can be approximated with TNs?"
  To answer the former, we show that TNs can (near to) optimally replicate $h$-uniform and $h$-adaptive approximation, for any smoothness order of the target function. Tensor networks thus exhibit universal expressivity w.r.t. isotropic, anisotropic and mixed smoothness spaces that is comparable with more general neural networks families such as deep rectified linear unit (ReLU) networks. Put differently, TNs have the capacity to (near to) optimally approximate many function classes -- without being adapted to the particular class in question.
  To answer the latter, as a candidate model class we consider approximation classes of TNs and show that these are (quasi-)Banach spaces, that many types of classical smoothness spaces are continuously embedded into said approximation classes and that TN approximation classes are themselves not embedded in any classical smoothness space.</description>

      <title>The Daugavet and Delta-constants of points in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two new notions called the Daugavet constant and $\Delta$-constant of a point, which measure quantitatively how far the point is from being Daugavet point and $\Delta$-point and allow us to study Daugavet and $\Delta$-points in Banach spaces from a quantitative viewpoint. We show that these notions can be viewed as a localized version of certain global estimations of Daugavet and diametral local diameter two properties such as Daugavet indices of thickness. As an intriguing example, we present the existence of a Banach space $X$ in which all points on the unit sphere have positive Daugavet constants despite the Daugavet indices of thickness of $X$ being zero. Moreover, using the Daugavet and $\Delta$-constants of points in the unit sphere, we describe the existence of almost Daugavet and $\Delta$-points as well as the set of denting points of the unit ball. We also present exact values of the Daugavet and $\Delta$-constant on several classical Banach spaces, as well as Lipschitz-free spaces. In particular, it is shown that there is a Lipschitz-free space with a $\Delta$-point which is the furthest away from being a Daugavet point. Finally, we provide some related stability results concerning the Daugavet and $\Delta$-constant.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the sequences of complex numbers $(z_{n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and the locally complete $(DF)$-spaces $E$ such that for each $(e_{n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in E^\mathbb{N}$ there exists an $E$-valued function $\mathbf{f}$ on $(0,\infty)$ (satisfying a mild regularity condition) such that $$\int_{0}^{\infty} t^{z_{n}} \mathbf{f}(t) dt = e_{n}, \qquad \forall n \in \mathbb{N},$$ where the integral should be understood as a Pettis integral. Moreover, in this case, we show that there always exists a solution $\mathbf{f}$ that is smooth on $(0,\infty)$ and satisfies certain optimal growth bounds near $0$ and $\infty$. The scalar-valued case $(E = \mathbb{C})$ was treated by Dur\'an [Math. Nachr. 158 (1992), 175-194]. Our work is based upon his result.</description>

      <title>Partial Isometries Between Hilbert Modules and Their Compositions</title>

Abstract: Motivated by questions raised in the preprint [AL20] by Accardi and Lu (private communication), we examine criteria for when the product of two partial isometries between Hilbert spaces is again a partial isometry and we use this to define a new composition operation that always yields again a partial isometry. Then, we aim at promoting these results to (not necessarily adjointable) partial isometries between Hilbert modules as proposed by Shalit and Skeide [SS23].
  The case of Hilbert spaces is elementary and rather simple, though not trivial, but -- we expect -- folkloric. The case of Hilbert modules suffers substantially from the fact that bounded right linear maps need not possess necessarily an adjoint. In fact, we show that the new composition law for partial isometries between Hilbert spaces can in no way be promoted directly to partial isometries between Hilbert modules, but that we have to pass to the more flexible class of partially defined isometries.</description>

      <title>Limit point and limit circle trichotomy for Sturm-Liouville problems with complex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limit point and limit circle classification of real Sturm-Liouville problems by H. Weyl more than 100 years ago was extended by A.R. Sims around 60 years ago to the case when the coefficients are complex. Here, the main result is a collection of various criteria which allow us to decide to which class of Sims' scheme a given Sturm-Liouville problem with complex coefficients belongs. This is subsequently applied to a second order differential equation defined on a ray in $\mathbb C$ which is motivated by the recent intensive research connected with $\mathcal P \mathcal T$-symmetric Hamiltonians.</description>
