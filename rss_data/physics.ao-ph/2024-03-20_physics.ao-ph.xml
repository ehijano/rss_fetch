      <title>U-Net Kalman Filter (UNetKF): An Example of Machine Learning-assisted Ensemble Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have seen a tremendous rise in popularity in weather and climate sciences. Data assimilation (DA), which combines observations and numerical models, has great potential to incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. In this paper, we use U-Net, a type of convolutional neutral network (CNN), to predict the localized ensemble covariances for the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithm. Using a 2-layer quasi-geostrophic model, U-Nets are trained using data from EnKF DA experiments. The trained U-Nets are then used to predict the flow-dependent localized error covariance matrices in U-Net Kalman Filter (UNetKF) experiments, which are compared to traditional 3-dimensional variational (3DVar), ensemble 3DVar (En3DVar) and EnKF methods. The performance of UNetKF can match or exceed that of 3DVar, En3DVar or EnKF. We also demonstrate that trained U-Nets can be transferred to a higher-resolution model for UNetKF implementation, which again performs competitively to 3DVar and EnKF, particularly for small ensemble sizes.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis of IUVB values in Mexico City from 2000 to 2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar radiation are electromagnetic waves, composed of infrared, visible spectrum and ultraviolet. The infrared component is the cause of thermal energy, the visible spectrum allows to see and the ultraviolet component is the most energetic part and dangerous for the human body (skin and eyes). The ultraviolet rays are divided in a wavelength range, in three parts; called UVA (100-280 nm), UVB (280-315 nm) and UVC (315-400 nm). The UVC are the most energetic (followed by the UVB rays ), however are stopped in the ozone layer. In this work it shown a statistical analysis of the UVB index measured by five station in Mexico City, from the years 2000 to 2022. Through a Gaussian fit distribution, it was found that the range when the IUVB value exceeds the value of seven, which is from 11:00 to 16:00, having an average mean value of 13:09 hrs. $\pm$ 4 min. i.e. the time at which the UVB index reaches its maximum value. This occurs in the months from February to October. More than 80% of radiation is for UVB values less than 7 and less than the remaining 20% is for IUVB values greater than 7. Finally, it was possible to observe that the mean value per year, reaches its maximum when the solar cycles occurs, which was in the years 2003 and 2013.</description>

      <title>Connecting finite-time Lyapunov exponents with supersaturation and droplet dynamics in the bulk of a turbulent cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact of turbulent mixing on the droplet size distribution is studied deep inside a warm ice-free cloud. A simplified cloud mixing model was implemented therefore which summarizes the balance equations of water vapor mixing ratio and temperature to an effective advection-diffusion equation for the supersaturation field $s(\textbf{x},t)$. Our three-dimensional direct numerical simulations connect the scalar supersaturation field to the cloud droplet dynamics, in particular to the droplet size distribution for different box sizes. In addition, finite-time Lyapunov exponents are monitored such that we can relate regions of higher compressive strain to those of high local supersaturation amplitudes. We find that the mixing process in terms of the droplet evaporation is always homogeneous in the bulk of the cloud, while being inhomogeneous in view to the relaxation of the supersaturation field. The probability density function of $\lambda_3$ is related to the one of $s$ by a simple one-dimensional aggregation model. The distributions of the compressive finite-time Lyapunov exponents $\lambda_3$, the supersaturation field, and the droplet size are found to be Gaussian.</description>

      <title>The High-Frequency and Rare Events Barriers to Neural Closures of Atmospheric Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest for leveraging neural networks to parameterize small-scale or fast processes in climate and turbulence models. In this short paper, we point out two fundamental issues in this endeavor. The first concerns the difficulties neural networks may experience in capturing rare events due to limitations in how data is sampled. The second arises from the inherent multiscale nature of these systems. They combine high-frequency components (like inertia-gravity waves) with slower, evolving processes (geostrophic motion). This multiscale nature creates a significant hurdle for neural network closures. To illustrate these challenges, we focus on the atmospheric 1980 Lorenz model, a simplified version of the Primitive Equations that drive climate models. This model serves as a compelling example because it captures the essence of these difficulties.</description>

      <title>Implicit Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Dispersive Tsunami Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to solve the dispersive depth-averaged Serre-Green-Naghdi (SGN) equations using patch-based adaptive mesh refinement. These equations require adding additional higher derivative terms to the nonlinear shallow water equations. This has been implemented as a new component of the open source GeoClaw software that is widely used for modeling tsunamis, storm surge, and related hazards, improving its accuracy on shorter wavelength phenomena. We use a formulation that requires solving an elliptic system of equations at each time step, making the method implicit. The adaptive algorithm allows different time steps on different refinement levels, and solves the implicit equations level by level. Computational examples are presented to illustrate the stability and accuracy on a radially symmetric test case and two realistic tsunami modeling problems, including a hypothetical asteroid impact creating a short wavelength tsunami for which dispersive terms are necessary.</description>

      <title>Time correlations in atmospheric quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient transfer of quantum information between remote parties is a crucial challenge for quantum communication over atmospheric channels. Random fluctuations of the channel transmittance are a major disturbing factor for its practical implementation. We study correlations between channel transmittances at different moments of time and focus on two transmission protocols. The first is related to the robustness of both discrete- and continuous-variable entanglement between time-separated light pulses, showing a possibility to enlarge the effective dimension of the Hilbert space. The second addresses a selection of high-transmittance events by testing them with bright classical pulses followed by quantum light. Our results show a high capacity of the time-coherence resource for encoding and transferring quantum states of light in atmospheric channels.</description>
