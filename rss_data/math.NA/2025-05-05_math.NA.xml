      <title>Numerical Integration of Navier-Stokes Equations by Time Series Expansion and Stabilized FEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript introduces an advanced numerical approach for the integration of incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations using a Time Series Expansion (TSE) method within a Finite Element Method (FEM) framework. The technique is enhanced by a novel stabilization strategy, incorporating a Divergent Series Resummation (DSR) technique, which significantly augments the computational efficiency of the algorithm. The stabilization mechanism is meticulously designed to improve the stability and validity of computed series terms, enabling the application of the Factorial Series (FS) algorithm for series resummation. This approach is pivotal in addressing the challenges associated with the accurate and stable numerical solution of NS equations, which are critical in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications. The manuscript elaborates on the variational formulation of Stokes problem and present convergence analysis of the method using the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) condition. It is followed by the NS equations and the implementation details of the stabilization technique, underscored by numerical tests on laminar flow past a cylinder, showcasing the method's efficacy and potential for broad applicability in fluid dynamics simulations. The results of the stabilization indicate a substantial enhancement in computational stability and accuracy, offering a promising avenue for future research in the field.</description>

      <title>A high-order combined interpolation/finite element technique for evolutionary coupled groundwater-surface water problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-order combined interpolation/finite element technique is developed for solving the coupled groundwater-surface water system that governs flows in karst aquifers. In the proposed high-order scheme we approximate the time derivative with piecewise polynomial interpolation of second-order and use the finite element discretization of piecewise polynomials of degree $d$ and $d+1$, where $d \geq 2$ is an integer, to approximate the space derivatives. The stability together with the error estimates of the constructed technique are established in $L^{\infty}(0,T;\text{\,}L^{2})$-norm. The analysis suggests that the developed computational technique is unconditionally stable, temporal second-order accurate and convergence in space of order $d+1$. Furthermore, the new approach is faster and more efficient than a broad range of numerical methods discussed in the literature for the given initial-boundary value problem. Some examples are carried out to confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approaches for non-local Transport-Dominated PDE Models with Applications to Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport-dominated partial differential equation models have been used extensively over the past two decades to describe various collective migration phenomena in cell biology and ecology. To understand the behaviour of these models (and the biological systems they describe) different analytical and numerical approaches have been used. While the analytical approaches have been discussed by different recent review studies, the numerical approaches are still facing different open problems, and thus are being employed on a rather ad-hoc basis for each developed non-local model. The goal of this review is to summarise the basic ideas behind these transport-dominated non-local models, to discuss the current numerical approaches used to simulate these models, and finally to discuss some open problems related to the applications of these numerical methods, in particular the finite element method. This allows us to emphasize the opportunities offered by this numerical method to advance the research in this field. In addition, we present in detail some numerical schemes that we used to discretize these non-local equations; in particular a new semi-implicit scheme we introduced to stabilize the oscillations obtained with classical schemes.</description>

      <title>MOR-T L : A Novel Model Order Reduction Method for Parametrized Problems with Application to Seismic Wave Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient strategy for constructing Reduced-Order Model (ROM) bases using Taylor polynomial expansions and Fr{\'e}chet derivatives with respect to model parameters. The proposed approach enables the construction of ROM bases with minimal additional computational cost. By exploiting Fr{\'e}chet derivatives -solution to the same problem with distinct right-hand sides -the method introduces a streamlined multiple-right-hand-side (RHS) strategy for ROM bases construction. This approach not only reduces overall computational expenses but also improves accuracy during model parameter updates. Numerical experiments on a two-dimensional wave problem demonstrate significant efficiency gains and enhanced performance, highlighting the potential of the proposed method to advance computational cost-effectiveness, particularly in seismic inversion applications.</description>

      <title>A Goal-Oriented Adaptive Sampling Procedure for Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models with Hyperreduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projection-based reduced-order models (PROMs) have demonstrated accuracy, reliability, and robustness in approximating high-dimensional, differential equation-based computational models across many applications. For this reason, it has been proposed as a tool for high-querying parametric design problems like those arising in modern aircraft design. Since aerodynamic simulations can be computationally expensive, PROMs offer the potential for more rapid estimations of high-fidelity solutions. However, the efficiency can still be tied to the dimension of the full-order model (FOM), particularly when projected quantities must be frequently recomputed due to non-linearities or parameter dependence. In the case of Petrov-Galerkin models, the projected residual and Jacobian are re-evaluated at every Newton iteration, thereby limiting the anticipated cost improvements. Hyperreduction is one of the tools available to approximate these quantities and address this issue. This work tests the energy-conserving sampling and weighting (ECSW) method as a potential approach for hyperreduction. It will be incorporated into the work in a previous article {10.1016/j.compfluid.2025.106568} which had developed an adaptive sampling procedure for building a reduced-order model (ROM) with a controlled functional error. The impacts of hyperreduction on computational cost and accuracy will be studied using the NACA0012 airfoil.</description>

      <title>Partial integration based regularization in BEM for 3D elastostatic problems: The role of line integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boundary Element Method (BEM) is a powerful numerical approach for solving 3D elastostatic problems, particularly advantageous for crack propagation in fracture mechanics and half-space problems. Despite its benefits, BEM faces significant challenges related to dense system matrices and singular integral kernels. The computational expense can be mitigated using various fast methods; this study employs the Chebyshev interpolation-based Fast Multipole Method (FMM). To handle singular kernels, several analytical and numerical integration or regularization techniques exist. One such technique combines partial integration with Stokes' theorem to transform hyper-singular and strong singular kernels into weakly singular ones. However, applying Stokes' theorem introduces line integrals in half-space problems and with FMM, where the geometry is partitioned into near-field and far-field regions and must be treated as an open surface. In this paper, the necessary line integrals for strongly singular and hyper-singular kernels are presented and their significance in the aforementioned problems is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Comparison of FMM and $\mathcal{H}$-matrix based 3D-ACA for a time domain boundary element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time domain Boundary Element Method (BEM) for the homogeneous wave equation with vanishing initial conditions is considered. The generalized convolution quadrature method (gCQ) developed by Lopez-Fernandez and Sauter is used for the temporal discretisation. The spatial discretisation is done classically using low order shape functions.
  Essentially, the gCQ requires to establish boundary element matrices of the corresponding elliptic problem in Laplace domain at several complex frequencies. Consequently, an array of system matrices is obtained. This array of system matrices can be interpreted as a three-dimensional array of data which should be approximated by a data-sparse representation. The generalised Adaptive Cross Approximation (3D-ACA) can be applied to get a data sparse representation of these three-dimensional data arrays. Adaptively, the rank of the three-dimensional data array is increased until a prescribed accuracy is obtained. On a pure algebraic level it is decided whether a low-rank approximation of the three-dimensional data array is close enough to the original matrix. Within the data slices corresponding to the BEM calculations at each frequency either the standard $\mathcal{H}$-matrices approach with ACA or a fast multipole (FMM) approach can be used. The third dimension of the data array represents the complex frequencies. Hence, the algorithm makes not only a data sparse approximation in the two spatial dimensions but detects adaptively how much frequencies are necessary for which matrix block.
  The two versions, either using ACA or FMM within the slices are briefly discussed and the main contribution is a comparison of both with respect to savings in storage and computing time. The sound scattering of an electric machine show that both techniques allow to utilise a time domain BEM in real world problems.</description>

      <title>A New Semi-Discrete Finite-Volume Active Flux Method for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new active flux (AF) method for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Following an AF approach recently proposed in [{\sc R. Abgrall}, Commun. Appl. Math. Comput., 5 (2023), pp. 370--402], we consider two different formulations of the studied system (the original conservative formulation and a primitive one containing nonconservative products), and discretize them on overlapping staggered meshes using two different numerical schemes. The novelty of our method is twofold. First, we introduce an original paradigm making use of overlapping finite-volume (FV) meshes over which cell averages of conservative and primitive variables are evolved using semi-discrete FV methods: The nonconservative system is discretized by a path-conservative central-upwind scheme and its solution is used to evaluate very simple numerical fluxes for the discretization of the original conservative system. Second, to ensure the nonlinear stability of the resulting AF method, we design a post-processing, which also guarantees a conservative coupling between the two sets of variables. We test the proposed semi-discrete FV AF method on a number of benchmarks for the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations of gas dynamics.</description>

      <title>New Smoothness Indicator Within an Active Flux Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new smoothness indicator (SI), which is capable of detecting ``rough'' parts of the solutions computed by active flux (AF) methods for hyperbolic (systems of) conservation laws. The new SI is based on measuring the difference between the two sets of solutions (either cell averages and point values or cell averages on overlapping grids) evolved at each time step of AF methods. The key idea in the derivation of the new SI is that in the ``rough'' parts of the evolved solutions, the difference is ${\cal O}(1)$, while in the smooth areas, it is proportional to the order of the underlying AF method. The performance of the new SI, that is, its ability to automatically and robustly detect ``rough'' parts of the computed solutions, is illustrated on several numerical examples, in which the one-dimensional Euler equations of gas dynamics are numerically solved by a recently introduced semi-discrete finite-volume AF method on overlapping grids.</description>

      <title>A stabilized march approach to adjoint-based sensitivity analysis of chaotic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adjoint-based sensitivity analysis is of interest in computational science due to its ability to compute sensitivities at a lower cost with respect to several design parameters. However, conventional sensitivity analysis methods fail in the presence of chaotic flows. Popular approaches to chaotic sensitivity analysis of flows involve the use of the shadowing trajectory. The state-of-the-art approach computes the shadowing trajectory by solving a least squares minimization problem, resulting in a space-time linear system of equations. The current paper computes the adjoint shadowing trajectory using the stabilized march, by specifying the adjoint boundary conditions instead of solving a minimization problem. This approach results in a space-time linear system that can be solved through a single backward substitution of order $\mathcal{O}(n_u^2)$ with $n_u$ being the dimension of the unstable subspace. It is proven to compute sensitivities that converge to the true sensitivity for large integration times and that the error in the sensitivity due to the discretization is of the order of the local truncation error of the scheme. The approach is numerically verified on the Lorentz 63 and Kuramoto-Sivasinsky equations.</description>

      <title>On calculation of canonical decomposition of Tensor via the grid of local discrepancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method for calculation of the canonical decomposition that approximates a tensor of high order is considered, which requires moderate computational resources. It is based on the replacement of the approximation error norm (global discrepancy functional) by the grid of local functionals (discrepancies computed on hyperplanes). The point of the global functional minimum in the space of the canonical decomposition cores is determined by the set of the stationary points of local functionals. In result, the estimation of the cores of the canonical decomposition is possible using Newton method applied point-wisely along coordinates and nodes. The discrepancies on the hyperplanes are calculated using Monte-Carlo method. Numerical tests on the approximation of sixth order tensors confirms the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Parameter-Driven Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework for Solving Two-Parameter Singular Perturbation Problems Involving Boundary Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, our goal is to solve two-parameter singular perturbation problems (SPPs) in one- and two-dimensions using an adapted Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) approach. Such problems are of major importance in engineering and sciences as it appears in control theory, fluid and gas dynamics, financial modelling and so on. Solutions of such problems exhibit boundary and/or interior layers, which make them difficult to handle. It has been validated in the literature that standard PINNs have low accuracy and can't handle such problems efficiently. Recently Cao et. al \cite{cao2023physics} proposed a new parameter asymptotic PINNs (PA-PINNs) to solve one-parameter singularly perturbed convection-dominated problems. It was observed that PA-PINNs works better than standard PINNs and gPINNs in terms of accuracy, convergence and stability. In this article, for the first time robustness of PA-PINNs will be validated for solving two-parameter SPPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sets of $d\times d$ matrices sharing a common invariant cone enjoy special properties, which are widely used in applications. However, finding this cone or even proving its existence/non-existence is hard. This problem is known to be algorithmically undecidable for general sets of matrices. We show that it can nevertheless be efficiently solved in practice. An algorithm that for a given finite set of matrices, either finds a common invariant cone or proves its non-existence is presented. Numerical results demonstrate that it works for a vast majority of matrix sets. The structure and properties of the minimal and maximal invariant cones are analyzed. Applications to dynamical systems and combinatorics are considered.</description>

      <title>Monotone Peridynamic Neural Operator for Nonlinear Material Modeling with Conditionally Unique Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven methods have emerged as powerful tools for modeling the responses of complex nonlinear materials directly from experimental measurements. Among these methods, the data-driven constitutive models present advantages in physical interpretability and generalizability across different boundary conditions/domain settings. However, the well-posedness of these learned models is generally not guaranteed a priori, which makes the models prone to non-physical solutions in downstream simulation tasks. In this study, we introduce monotone peridynamic neural operator (MPNO), a novel data-driven nonlocal constitutive model learning approach based on neural operators. Our approach learns a nonlocal kernel together with a nonlinear constitutive relation, while ensuring solution uniqueness through a monotone gradient network. This architectural constraint on gradient induces convexity of the learnt energy density function, thereby guaranteeing solution uniqueness of MPNO in small deformation regimes. To validate our approach, we evaluate MPNO's performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. On synthetic datasets with manufactured kernel and constitutive relation, we show that the learnt model converges to the ground-truth as the measurement grid size decreases both theoretically and numerically. Additionally, our MPNO exhibits superior generalization capabilities than the conventional neural networks: it yields smaller displacement solution errors in down-stream tasks with new and unseen loadings. Finally, we showcase the practical utility of our approach through applications in learning a homogenized model from molecular dynamics data, highlighting its expressivity and robustness in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Linear Convergence of ADMM for Isotropic TV Norm Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an explicit local linear rate for ADMM solving the isotropic Total Variation (TV) norm compressed sensing problem in multiple dimensions, by analyzing the auxiliary variable in the equivalent Douglas-Rachford splitting on a dual problem. Numerical verification on large 3D problems and real MRI data will be shown. Though the proven rate is not sharp, it is close to the observed ones in numerical tests.</description>

      <title>A CFL-type Condition and Theoretical Insights for Discrete-Time Sparse Full-Order Model Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the data-driven inference of a discrete-time dynamical system via a sparse Full-Order Model (sFOM). We first formulate the involved Least Squares (LS) problem and discuss the need for regularization, indicating a connection between the typically employed $l_2$ regularization and the stability of the inferred discrete-time sFOM. We then provide theoretical insights considering the consistency and stability properties of the inferred numerical schemes that form the sFOM and exemplify them via illustrative, 1D test cases of linear diffusion and linear advection. For linear advection, we analytically derive a "sampling CFL" condition, which dictates a bound for the ratio of spatial and temporal discretization steps in the training data that ensures stability of the inferred sFOM. Finally, we investigate the sFOM inference for two nonlinear problems, namely a 2D Burgers' test case and the incompressible flow in an oscillating lid driven cavity, and draw connections between the theoretical findings and the properties of the inferred, nonlinear sFOMs.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of continuous and discrete variational ODEs with convergence guarantee and uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article introduces a method to learn dynamical systems that are governed by Euler--Lagrange equations from data. The method is based on Gaussian process regression and identifies continuous or discrete Lagrangians and is, therefore, structure preserving by design. A rigorous proof of convergence as the distance between observation data points converges to zero and lower bounds for convergence rates are provided. Next to convergence guarantees, the method allows for quantification of model uncertainty, which can provide a basis of adaptive sampling techniques. We provide efficient uncertainty quantification of any observable that is linear in the Lagrangian, including of Hamiltonian functions (energy) and symplectic structures, which is of interest in the context of system identification. The article overcomes major practical and theoretical difficulties related to the ill-posedness of the identification task of (discrete) Lagrangians through a careful design of geometric regularisation strategies and through an exploit of a relation to convex minimisation problems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>On the specific solutions of reduced biquaternion equality constrained least squares problem and their relative forward error bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on addressing the challenge of solving the reduced biquaternion equality constrained least squares (RBLSE) problem. We develop algebraic techniques to derive real and complex solutions for the RBLSE problem by utilizing the real and complex forms of reduced biquaternion matrices. Furthermore, we propose algorithms and provide a detailed analysis of their computational complexity for finding special solutions to the RBLSE problem. A perturbation analysis is conducted, establishing an upper bound for the relative forward error of these solutions. This analysis ensures the accuracy and stability of the solutions in the presence of data perturbations, which is crucial for practical applications where errors arising from input inaccuracies can cause deviations between computed and true solutions. Numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed algorithms, demonstrate their effectiveness, and verify the accuracy of the established upper bound for the relative forward errors. These findings lay the groundwork for exploring applications in 3D and 4D algebra such as robotics, signal, and image processing, expanding their impact on practical and emerging domains.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear manifold approximation using compositional polynomial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating a subset $M$ of a Hilbert space $X$ by a low-dimensional manifold $M_n$, using samples from $M$. We propose a nonlinear approximation method where $M_n $ is defined as the range of a smooth nonlinear decoder $D$ defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with values in a possibly high-dimensional linear space $X_N$, and a linear encoder $E$ which associates to an element from $ M$ its coefficients $E(u)$ on a basis of a $n$-dimensional subspace $X_n \subset X_N$, where $X_n$ and $X_N$ are optimal or near to optimal linear spaces, depending on the selected error measure. The linearity of the encoder allows to easily obtain the parameters $E(u)$ associated with a given element $u$ in $M$. The proposed decoder is a polynomial map from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $X_N$ which is obtained by a tree-structured composition of polynomial maps, estimated sequentially from samples in $M$. Rigorous error and stability analyses are provided, as well as an adaptive strategy for constructing a decoder that guarantees an approximation of the set $M$ with controlled mean-squared or wort-case errors, and a controlled stability (Lipschitz continuity) of the encoder and decoder pair. We demonstrate the performance of our method through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Mixed Precision Orthogonalization-Free Projection Methods for Eigenvalue and Singular Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed-precision arithmetic offers significant computational advantages for large-scale matrix computation tasks, yet preserving accuracy and stability in eigenvalue problems and the singular value decomposition (SVD) remains challenging. This paper introduces an approach that eliminates orthogonalization requirements in traditional Rayleigh-Ritz projection methods. The proposed method employs non-orthogonal bases computed at reduced precision, resulting in bases computed without inner-products. A primary focus is on maintaining the linear independence of the basis vectors. Through extensive evaluation with both synthetic test cases and real-world applications, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the desired accuracy while fully taking advantage of mixed-precision arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Learning the hub graphical Lasso model with the structured sparsity via an efficient algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical models have exhibited their performance in numerous tasks ranging from biological analysis to recommender systems. However, graphical models with hub nodes are computationally difficult to fit, particularly when the dimension of the data is large. To efficiently estimate the hub graphical models, we introduce a two-phase algorithm. The proposed algorithm first generates a good initial point via a dual alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and then warm starts a semismooth Newton (SSN) based augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to compute a solution that is accurate enough for practical tasks. We fully excavate the sparsity structure of the generalized Jacobian arising from the hubs in the graphical models, which ensures that the algorithm can obtain a nice solution very efficiently. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic data and real data show that it obviously outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, in some high dimensional tasks, it can save more than 70\% of the execution time, meanwhile still achieves a high-quality estimation.</description>

      <title>Generating synthetic data for neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the literature show promising potential of deep learning methods, particularly neural operators, in obtaining numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) beyond the reach of current numerical solvers. However, existing data-driven approaches often rely on training data produced by numerical PDE solvers (e.g., finite difference or finite element methods). We introduce a "backward" data generation method that avoids solving the PDE numerically: by randomly sampling candidate solutions $u_j$ from the appropriate solution space (e.g., $H_0^1(\Omega)$), we compute the corresponding right-hand side $f_j$ directly from the equation by differentiation. This produces training pairs ${(f_j, u_j)}$ by computing derivatives rather than solving a PDE numerically for each data point, enabling fast, large-scale data generation consisting of exact solutions. Experiments indicate that models trained on this synthetic data generalize well when tested on data produced by standard solvers. While the idea is simple, we hope this method will expand the potential of neural PDE solvers that do not rely on classical numerical solvers to generate their data.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Density Estimation via Variance-Reduced Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate density estimation is of great interest in various scientific and engineering disciplines. In this work, we introduce a new framework called Variance-Reduced Sketching (VRS), specifically designed to estimate multivariate density functions with a reduced curse of dimensionality. Our VRS framework conceptualizes multivariate functions as infinite-size matrices/tensors, and facilitates a new sketching technique motivated by the numerical linear algebra literature to reduce the variance in density estimation problems. We demonstrate the robust numerical performance of VRS through a series of simulated experiments and real-world data applications. Notably, VRS shows remarkable improvement over existing neural network density estimators and classical kernel methods in numerous distribution models. Additionally, we offer theoretical justifications for VRS to support its ability to deliver density estimation with a reduced curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a mesh-independent, data-driven library, chebgreen, to mathematically model one-dimensional systems, possessing an associated control parameter, and whose governing partial differential equation is unknown. The proposed method learns an Empirical Green's Function for the associated, but hidden, boundary value problem, in the form of a Rational Neural Network from which we subsequently construct a bivariate representation in a Chebyshev basis. We uncover the Green's function, at an unseen control parameter value, by interpolating the left and right singular functions within a suitable library, expressed as points on a manifold of Quasimatrices, while the associated singular values are interpolated with Lagrange polynomials.</description>
