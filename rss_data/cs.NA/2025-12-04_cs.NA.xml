      <title>A Discrete Neural Operator with Adaptive Sampling for Surrogate Modeling of Parametric Transient Darcy Flows in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a new discrete neural operator for surrogate modeling of transient Darcy flow fields in heterogeneous porous media with random parameters. The new method integrates temporal encoding, operator learning and UNet to approximate the mapping between vector spaces of random parameter and spatiotemporal flow fields. The new discrete neural operator can achieve higher prediction accuracy than the SOTA attention-residual-UNet structure. Derived from the finite volume method, the transmissibility matrices rather than permeability is adopted as the inputs of surrogates to enhance the prediction accuracy further. To increase sampling efficiency, a generative latent space adaptive sampling method is developed employing the Gaussian mixture model for density estimation of generalization error. Validation is conducted on test cases of 2D/3D single- and two-phase Darcy flow field prediction. Results reveal consistent enhancement in prediction accuracy given limited training set.</description>

      <title>Simpson variational integrator for nonlinear systems: a tutorial on the Lagrange top</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution presents an integration method based on the Simpson quadrature. The integrator is designed for finite-dimensional nonlinear mechanical systems that derive from variational principles. The action is discretized using quadratic finite elements interpolation of the state and Simpson's quadrature, leading to discrete motion equations. The scheme is implicit, symplectic, and fourth-order accurate. The proposed integrator is compared with the implicit midpoint variational integrator on two examples of systems with inseparable Hamiltonians. First, the example of the nonlinear double pendulum illustrates how the method can be applied to multibody systems. The analytical solution of the Lagrange top is then used as a reference to analyze accuracy, convergence, and precision of the numerical method. A reduced Lagrange top system is also proposed and solved with a classical fourth-order method. Its solution is compared with the Simpson solution of the complete system, and the convergence order of the difference between both is consistent with the order of the classical method.</description>

      <title>A fast stochastic interacting particle-field method for 3D parabolic parabolic Chemotaxis systems: numerical algorithms and error analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel numerical framework, the stochastic interacting particle-field method with particle-in-cell acceleration (SIPF-PIC), for the efficient simulation of the three-dimensional (3D) parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel (KS) systems. The SIPF-PIC method integrates Lagrangian particle dynamics with spectral field solvers, by leveraging localized particle-grid interpolations and fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques. For $P$ particles and $H$ Fourier modes per spatial dimension, the SIPF-PIC method achieves a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(P + H^3 \log H)$ per time step, a significant improvement over the original SIPF method (proposed in \cite{SIPF1}), which has a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(PH^3)$, while preserving numerical accuracy. Moreover, we establish a rigorous error analysis, proving that the discretization errors are of order $\mathcal{O}(H^{-16/13}+P^{-1/2}H^{4/13})$. Finally, we present numerical experiments to validate the theoretical convergence rates and demonstrate the computational efficiency of our new method. Notably, these experiments also show that the method captures complex blowup dynamics beyond single-point collapse, including ring-type singularities, where mass dynamically concentrates into evolving annular structures.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of the 2D Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations: Convergence under Transport Noise and No-slip Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the numerical approximation of the two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with transport noise and no-slip boundary conditions on a convex polygonal domain. The analysis is challenged by the solution's low spatial regularity and the non-Lipschitz nonlinearity. We derive a convergence rate in the mean-square sense for a spatial semidiscretization. Furthermore, for the full discretization, we prove convergence in probability and establish an explicit rate with respect to the time step.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Preserving High-Order Compact OEDG Method for Spherically Symmetric Einstein-Euler System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of the spherically symmetric Einstein--Euler (EE) system faces severe challenges due to the stringent physical admissibility constraints of relativistic fluids and the geometric singularities inherent in metric evolution. This paper proposes a high-order Constraint-Preserving (CP) compact Oscillation-Eliminating Discontinuous Galerkin (cOEDG) method specifically tailored to address these difficulties. The method integrates a scale-invariant oscillation-eliminating mechanism [M. Peng, Z. Sun, K. Wu, Math. Comp., 94: 1147--1198, 2025] into a compact Runge--Kutta DG framework. By characterizing the convex invariant region of the hydrodynamic subsystem with general barotropic equations of state, we prove that the proposed scheme preserves physical realizability (specifically, positive density and subluminal velocity) directly in terms of conservative variables, thereby eliminating the need for complex primitive-variable checks. To ensure the geometric validity of the spacetime, we introduce a bijective transformation of the metric potentials. Rather than evolving the constrained metric components directly, the scheme advances unconstrained auxiliary variables whose inverse mapping automatically enforces strict positivity and asymptotic bounds without any limiters. Combined with a compatible high-order boundary treatment, the resulting CPcOEDG method exhibits robust stability and design-order accuracy in capturing strong gravity-fluid interactions, as demonstrated by simulations of black hole accretion and relativistic shock waves.</description>

      <title>A Coupled IMEX Domain Decomposition Method for High-Order Time Integration of the ES-BGK Model of the Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a high-order domain decomposition method for the ES-BGK model of the Boltzmann equation, which dynamically detects regions of equilibrium and non-equilibrium. Our implementation automatically switches between Euler equations in regions where the fluid is at equilibrium, and the ES-BGK model elsewhere. The main challenge addressed in this work is the development of a coupled strategy between the macroscopic and the kinetic solvers, which preserves the overall temporal order of accuracy of the scheme. A coupled IMEX method is introduced across decomposed subdomains and solvers. This approach is based on a coupled IMEX method and allows high accuracy and computational efficiency. Several numerical simulations in two space dimensions are performed, in order to validate the robustness of our approach and the expected temporal high-order convergence.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional modelling of drag anchor penetration using the material point method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drag embedment anchors are a key threat to buried subsea linear infrastructure, such as power/data cables and pipelines. For cables, selecting a burial depth is a compromise between protecting the cable from anchor strike and the increased cost of deeper installation. This presents an efficient large deformation, elasto-plastic Material Point Method-based soil-structure interaction predictive tool for the estimation of anchor penetration based on Cone Penetration Test (CPT) site investigation data. The tool builds on earlier work by the authors supplemented by three developments: modelling assemblies of rigid bodies (necessary for articulated anchors), a partitioned domain approach to enable accurate and efficient modelling of long anchor pulls and an improved means of modelling rotational inertia. The tool is validated against scaled physical tests conducted in a geotechnical centrifuge on sands with a range of relative densities with good agreement across the tested conditions. Numerical simulations identify key issues with the UK Cable Burial Risk Assessment (CBRA) approach for estimating anchor penetration and reveal the potentially non-conservatism of the CBRA framework for sandy seabeds. The numerical model enables site-specific anchor-penetration assessment along cable routes and can be used to evaluate the performance of different anchor designs and sizes in varied soil conditions.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of a Crank-Nicolson scheme for strongly magnetized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to the convergence analysis of an asymptotic preserving particle scheme designed to serve as a particle pusher in a Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method for the Vlasov equation with a strong inhomogeneous magnetic field. The asymptotic preserving scheme that we study removes classical strong restrictive stability constraints on discretization steps while capturing the large-scale dynamics, even when the discretization is too coarse to capture fastest scales. Our error bounds are explicit regarding the discretization and stiffness parameters and match sharply numerical tests. The present analysis is expected to be representative of the general analysis of a class of schemes, developed by the authors, conceived as implicit-explicit schemes on augmented formulations.</description>

      <title>From Memory Model to CPU Time: Exponential Integrators for Advection-Dominated Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of exponential integrators to advection-dominated problems. We focus on Krylov subspace and Leja interpolation methods to compute the action of exponential and related matrix functions. Complementing our earlier paper, arXiv:2410.12765 (to appear in Advances in Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, 2025) based on a performance model, we extend the numerical investigation to higher-order Krylov approximations and new numerical regime, and assess their CPU-time efficiency relative to explicit Runge--Kutta schemes. We show that, depending on the problem setting, exponential integrators can either outperform or match explicit Runge--Kutta schemes. We also observe that Leja-based methods outperform Krylov iterations for large time steps, whereas for small time steps, Krylov-based methods provide better results than Leja-based methods.</description>

      <title>A Superfast Direct Solver for Type-III Inverse Nonuniform Discrete Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonuniform discrete Fourier transform (NUDFT) and its inverse are widely used in various fields of scientific computing. In this article, we propose a novel superfast direct inversion method for type-III NUDFT. The proposed method approximates the type-III NUDFT matrix as a product of a type-II NUDFT matrix and an HSS matrix, where the type-II NUDFT matrix is further decomposed into the product of an HSS matrix and an uniform discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix as in [Wilber, Epperly, and Barnett, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 47(3):A1702-A1732, 2025]. This decomposition enables both the forward application and the backward inversion to be accomplished with quasi-linear complexity. The fast inversion can serve as a high-accuracy direct solver or as an efficient preconditioner. Additionally, we provide an error bound for the approximation under specific sample distributions. Numerical results are presented to verify the relevant theoretical properties and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>An arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian semi-implicit hybrid method for continuum mechanics with GLM cleaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a semi-implicit arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method for the solution of the unified Godunov-Peshkov-Romenski (GPR) model of continuum mechanics. To handle the curl free involutions arising in the solid limit of the model, the original system is augmented by adopting a thermodynamically compatible generalized Lagrangian multiplier (GLM) approach. Next, an operator splitting strategy decouples the computation of fast pressure waves from the bulk velocity of the medium yielding a transport subsystem, containing convective terms and non-conservative products, and a Poisson-type subsystem, for the pressure. A second splitting yields an ODE subsystem comprising only the potentially stiff source terms, responsible for the relaxation of the model between its fluid and solid limits.
  The mesh motion can be driven by two sources: the local fluid velocity and a prescribed boundary displacement. For the spatial discretization, we employ unstructured staggered grids, with the pressure defined on the primal mesh and all remaining variables on the dual grid. The transport subsystem is advanced via an explicit finite volume method, in which integration over closed space-time control volumes ensures verification of the geometric conservation law (GCL). On the other hand, implicit continuous finite elements are used for the discretization of the pressure subsystem and an implicit DIRK scheme is employed to solve the ODE subsystem. Consequently, the proposed approach is well suited to address all Mach number flows. A comprehensive set of benchmarks is employed to assess the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methodology in tackling both fluid and solid mechanics problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic error distributions of symplectic methods for stochastic Hamiltonian systems and further provide Hamiltonian-specific analysis that clarifies the superiority of symplectic methods. Our contribution is threefold. First, we derive the asymptotic error distributions of symplectic methods for stochastic Hamiltonian systems with multiplicative noise and additive noise, respectively, and show that the obtained limiting stochastic processes satisfy equations retaining the Hamiltonian formulations. Second, we propose a new approach for calculating the asymptotic error distribution, revealing the connection between the stochastic modified equation and the asymptotic error distribution. Third, we characterize the limiting distribution of the normalized Hamiltonian deviation, thereby illustrating through test equations the superiority of symplectic methods for long-time simulations of the Hamiltonians, even in the limit as the step size tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Mixed finite element approximation for non-divergence form elliptic equations with random input data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an elliptic partial differential equation in non-divergence form with a random diffusion matrix and random forcing term. To address this, we propose a mixed-type continuous finite element discretization in the physical domain, combined with a collocation discretization in the stochastic domain. For the mixed formulation, we first introduce a stochastic cost functional at the continuous level. This formulation is then enhanced to incorporate the vanishing tangential trace constraint directly into a mesh-dependent cost functional, rather than enforcing it in the solution's function space. In this context, we define a mesh-dependent norm and provide an error analysis based on this norm. We employ the collocation method by collocating the stochastic equation at the zeros of suitable tensor product orthogonal polynomials. This approach leads to a system of uncoupled deterministic problems, simplifying computation. Furthermore, we establish an a poriori error bound for the fully discrete approximation, detailing the convergence rates with respect to the discretization parameters. Finally, numerical results are presented to confirm and validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse imaging problems rely on limited and indirect measurements, making reconstruction highly dependent on both regularization and sample locations. We introduce a novel greedy framework for the optimal selection of indirect measurements in the operator codomain, specifically tailored to inverse problems. Our approach employs a two-step scheme combining kernel-based interpolation and extrapolation. Within this framework, greedy schemes can be residual-based, where points are selected according to the current approximation error for a specific target function, or error-based, where points are chosen using a priori error indicators independent of the residual. For the latter, we derive explicit error bounds that quantify the propagation of approximation errors through both interpolation and extrapolation. Numerical applications to solar hard X-ray imaging demonstrate that the proposed greedy sampling strategy achieves high-quality reconstructions using only a few available measurements.</description>

      <title>In Situ Quantum Analog Pulse Characterization via Structured Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog quantum simulators can directly emulate time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics, enabling the exploration of diverse physical phenomena such as phase transitions, quench dynamics, and non-equilibrium processes. Realizing accurate analog simulations requires high-fidelity time-dependent pulse control, yet existing calibration schemes are tailored to digital gate characterization and cannot be readily extended to learn continuous pulse trajectories. We present a characterization algorithm for in situ learning of pulse trajectories by extending the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) framework to analyze time-dependent pulses. By combining QSP with a logical-level analog-digital mapping paradigm, our method reconstructs a smooth pulse directly from queries of the time-ordered propagator, without requiring mid-circuit measurements or additional evolution. Unlike conventional Trotterization-based methods, our approach avoids unscalable performance degradation arising from accumulated local truncation errors as the logical-level segmentation increases. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy with strong efficiency and robustness against SPAM as well as depolarizing errors, providing a lightweight and optimal validation protocol for analog quantum simulators capable of detecting major hardware faults.</description>

      <title>Modeling and simulation of electrodiffusion in dense reconstructions of cerebral tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitable tissue is fundamental to brain function, yet its study is complicated by extreme morphological complexity and the physiological processes governing its dynamics. Consequently, detailed computational modeling of this tissue represents a formidable task, requiring both efficient numerical methods and robust implementations. Meanwhile, efficient and robust methods for image segmentation and meshing are needed to provide realistic geometries for which numerical solutions are tractable. Here, we present a computational framework that models electrodiffusion in excitable cerebral tissue, together with realistic geometries generated from electron microscopy data. To demonstrate a possible application of the framework, we simulate electrodiffusive dynamics in cerebral tissue during neuronal activity. Our results and findings highlight the numerical and computational challenges associated with modeling and simulation of electrodiffusion and other multiphysics in dense reconstructions of cerebral tissue.</description>

      <title>Computing Equilibrium Points of Electrostatic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computation of equilibrium points of electrostatic potentials: locations in space where the electrostatic force arising from a collection of charged particles vanishes. This is a novel scenario of optimization in which solutions are guaranteed to exist due to a nonconstructive argument, but gradient descent is unreliable due to the presence of singularities.
  We present an algorithm based on piecewise approximation of the potential function by Taylor series. The main insight is to divide the domain into a grid with variable coarseness, where grid cells are exponentially smaller in regions where the function changes rapidly compared to regions where it changes slowly. Our algorithm finds approximate equilibrium points in time poly-logarithmic in the approximation parameter, but these points are not guaranteed to be close to exact solutions. Nevertheless, we show that such points can be computed efficiently under a mild assumption that we call "strong non-degeneracy". We complement these algorithmic results by studying a generalization of this problem and showing that it is CLS-hard and in PPAD, leaving its precise classification as an intriguing open problem.</description>

      <title>Sketch Tomography: Hybridizing Classical Shadow and Matrix Product State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Sketch Tomography, an efficient procedure for quantum state tomography based on the classical shadow protocol used for quantum observable estimations. The procedure applies to the case where the ground truth quantum state is a matrix product state (MPS). The density matrix of the ground truth state admits a tensor train ansatz as a result of the MPS assumption, and we estimate the tensor components of the ansatz through a series of observable estimations, thus outputting an approximation of the density matrix. The procedure is provably convergent with a sample complexity that scales quadratically in the system size. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that the procedure outputs an accurate approximation to the quantum state. For observable estimation tasks involving moderately large subsystems, we show that our procedure gives rise to a more accurate estimation than the classical shadow protocol. We also show that sketch tomography is more accurate in observable estimation than quantum states trained from the maximum likelihood estimation formulation.</description>

      <title>ATHENA: Agentic Team for Hierarchical Evolutionary Numerical Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bridging the gap between theoretical conceptualization and computational implementation is a major bottleneck in Scientific Computing (SciC) and Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). We introduce ATHENA (Agentic Team for Hierarchical Evolutionary Numerical Algorithms), an agentic framework designed as an Autonomous Lab to manage the end-to-end computational research lifecycle. Its core is the HENA loop, a knowledge-driven diagnostic process framed as a Contextual Bandit problem. Acting as an online learner, the system analyzes prior trials to select structural `actions' ($A_n$) from combinatorial spaces guided by expert blueprints (e.g., Universal Approximation, Physics-Informed constraints). These actions are translated into executable code ($S_n$) to generate scientific rewards ($R_n$). ATHENA transcends standard automation: in SciC, it autonomously identifies mathematical symmetries for exact analytical solutions or derives stable numerical solvers where foundation models fail. In SciML, it performs deep diagnosis to tackle ill-posed formulations and combines hybrid symbolic-numeric workflows (e.g., coupling PINNs with FEM) to resolve multiphysics problems. The framework achieves super-human performance, reaching validation errors of $10^{-14}$. Furthermore, collaborative ``human-in-the-loop" intervention allows the system to bridge stability gaps, improving results by an order of magnitude. This paradigm shift focuses from implementation mechanics to methodological innovation, accelerating scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Reservoir Seepage Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) for reservoir seepage is critical for optimizing oil and gas field development and predicting production performance. Traditional numerical methods suffer from mesh-dependent errors and high computational costs, while classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) face bottlenecks in parameter efficiency, high-dimensional expression, and strong nonlinear fitting. To address these limitations, we propose a Discrete Variable (DV)-Circuit Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Network (QCPINN) and apply it to three typical reservoir seepage models for the first time: the pressure diffusion equation for heterogeneous single-phase flow, the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation for two-phase waterflooding, and the convection-diffusion equation for compositional flow considering adsorption. The QCPINN integrates classical preprocessing/postprocessing networks with a DV quantum core, leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance high-dimensional feature mapping while embedding physical constraints to ensure solution consistency. We test three quantum circuit topologies (Cascade, Cross-mesh, Alternate) and demonstrate through numerical experiments that QCPINNs achieve high prediction accuracy with fewer parameters than classical PINNs. Specifically, the Alternate topology outperforms others in heterogeneous single-phase flow and two-phase BL equation simulations, while the Cascade topology excels in compositional flow with convection-dispersion-adsorption coupling. Our work verifies the feasibility of QCPINN for reservoir engineering applications, bridging the gap between quantum computing research and industrial practice in oil and gas engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a finite volume scheme for the scalar conservation law $\partial_t u + \partial_x (H(x, u)) = 0$ with bounded initial condition for a wide class of flux function $H$, convex with respect to the second variable. The main idea for the construction of the scheme is to use the theory of discontinuous flux. We prove that the resulting approximating sequence converges boundedly almost everywhere on $\mathopen]0, +\infty\mathclose[$ to the entropy solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of computing the operator norm of a linear map between finite dimensional Hilbert spaces when only evaluations of the linear map are available and under restrictive storage assumptions. We propose a stochastic method of random search type to maximize the Rayleigh quotient and employ an exact line search in the random search directions. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm converges to the global maximum (the operator norm) almost surely and a sublinear convergence behavior for the corresponding eigenvector and eigenvalue equation. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the method with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A modified Crank-Nicolson scheme for the Vlasov-Poisson system with a strong external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and study a Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method based on the Crank-Nicolson time discretization for the Vlasov-Poisson system with a strong and inhomogeneous external magnetic field with fixed direction, where we focus on the motion of particles in the plane orthogonal to the magnetic field. In this regime, the time step can be subject to stability constraints related to the smallness of Larmor radius and plasma frequency [21]. To avoid this limitation, our approach is based on numerical schemes [9, 10, 12], providing a consistent PIC discretization of the guiding-center system taking into account variations of the magnetic field. We carry out some theoretical proofs and perform several numerical experiments to validate the method and its underlying concepts.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo with Inexact Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05025v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an unbiased method for Bayesian posterior means based on kinetic Langevin dynamics that combines advanced splitting methods with enhanced gradient approximations. Our approach avoids Metropolis correction by coupling Markov chains at different discretization levels in a multilevel Monte Carlo approach. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our proposed estimator is unbiased, attains finite variance, and satisfies a central limit theorem. It can achieve accuracy $\epsilon&gt;0$ for estimating expectations of Lipschitz functions in $d$ dimensions with $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/4}\epsilon^{-2})$ expected gradient evaluations, without assuming warm start. We exhibit similar bounds using both approximate and stochastic gradients, and our method's computational cost is shown to scale independently of the size of the dataset. The proposed method is tested using a multinomial regression problem on the MNIST dataset and a Poisson regression model for soccer scores. Experiments indicate that the number of gradient evaluations per effective sample is independent of dimension, even when using inexact gradients. For product distributions, we give dimension-independent variance bounds. Our results demonstrate that in large-scale applications, the unbiased algorithm we present can be 2-3 orders of magnitude more efficient than the ``gold-standard" randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Bayesian optimisation in an input-output reduced space for engineering design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimisation is an adaptive sampling strategy for constructing a Gaussian process surrogate to efficiently search for the global minimum of a black-box computational model. Gaussian processes have limited applicability in engineering design problems, which usually have many design variables but typically a low intrinsic dimensionality. Their scalability can be significantly improved by identifying a low-dimensional space of latent variables that serve as inputs to the Gaussian process. In this paper, we introduce a multi-view learning strategy that considers both the input design variables and output data representing the objective or constraint functions, to identify a low-dimensional latent subspace. Adopting a fully probabilistic viewpoint, we use probabilistic partial least squares (PPLS) to learn an orthogonal mapping from the design variables to the latent variables using training data consisting of inputs and outputs of the black-box computational model. The latent variables and posterior probability densities of the PPLS and Gaussian process models are determined sequentially and iteratively, with retraining occurring at each adaptive sampling iteration. We compare the proposed probabilistic partial least squares Bayesian optimisation (PPLS-BO) strategy with its deterministic counterpart, partial least squares Bayesian optimisation (PLS-BO), and classical Bayesian optimisation, demonstrating significant improvements in convergence to the global minimum.</description>

      <title>Energy-Conserving Neural Network Closure Model for Long-Time Accurate and Stable LES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based closure models for LES have shown promise in capturing complex turbulence dynamics but often suffer from instabilities and physical inconsistencies. In this work, we develop a novel skew-symmetric neural architecture as closure model that enforces stability while preserving key physical conservation laws. Our approach leverages a discretization that ensures mass, momentum, and energy conservation, along with a face-averaging filter to maintain mass conservation in coarse-grained velocity fields. We compare our model against several conventional data-driven closures (including unconstrained convolutional neural networks), and the physics-based Smagorinsky model. Performance is evaluated on decaying turbulence and Kolmogorov flow for multiple coarse-graining factors. In these test cases we observe that unconstrained machine learning models suffer from numerical instabilities. In contrast, our skew-symmetric model remains stable across all tests, though at the cost of increased dissipation. Despite this trade-off, we demonstrate that our model still outperforms the Smagorinsky model in unseen scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of structure-preserving machine learning closures for reliable long-time LES.</description>

Abstract: This short note modifies a reconstruction method by the author (Comm. PDE, 45(9):1118-1133, 2020), for reconstructing piecewise constant conductivities in the Calder\'on problem (electrical impedance tomography). In the former paper, a layering assumption and the local Neumann-to-Dirichlet map were needed since the piecewise constant partition also was assumed unknown. Here I show how to modify the method in case the partition is known, for general piecewise constant conductivities and only a finite number of partial boundary measurements. Moreover, no lower/upper bounds on the unknown conductivity are needed.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo-Type Neural Operator for Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).</description>

      <title>Computing Optimal Trajectories for Optimal Transport in Nonuniform Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we solve a discrete optimal transport problem in a nonuniform environment. To solve the optimal transport problem, we build the cost matrix and then use classical solvers for discrete optimal transport. The challenge is to form the cost matrix, which requires finding the optimal path between two points, and for this task we formulate and solve the associated Euler-Lagrange equations. A main contribution of ours is to provide verifiable sufficient conditions of optimality of the solution of the Euler-Lagrange equation and to propose new algorithms to to check optimality a-posteriori, thus validating the (exact) computation of the cost matrix. We illustrate our results and performance of the algorithms on several numerical examples in 2 and 3 dimensions.</description>
