      <title>A visual representation of the properties of pre- and post- selected entangled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a visual representation for generating entangled-based quantum effects under pre- and post- selected states that allows us to reveal equivalence between seemingly different quantum effects. We show how to realize entangled quantum systems of an arbitrary number of qubits from a single or pre-specified number of physical particles. We then show that a variation of the quantum Cheshire cat experiment and Hardy's paradox are equivalent and propose a class of experiments that generalizes both experiments. We show that the weak values of the products of projection operators allow us to get the weak value of each projection operator, implying that the weak value of the product of projection operators includes the entire information about the weak values in the system. In nature, interactions can only be acted between a pair of particles. We show how to realize quantum systems of multiwise interacted qubits, i.e., interactions that come in groups of n&gt;2 qubits. In this way, we are able to propose unique quantum systems that consist of interacted groups of entangled states. The proposed framework opens the door toward a new way to explore quantum systems of entangled particles and quantum phenomena that emerge from such a general setting.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Genetic Algorithms for Pulse-Level Quantum Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise remains a fundamental challenge in quantum computing, significantly affecting pulse fidelity and overall circuit performance. This paper introduces an adaptive algorithm for pulse-level quantum error mitigation, designed to enhance fidelity by dynamically responding to noise conditions without modifying circuit gates. By targeting pulse parameters directly, this method reduces the impact of various noise sources, improving algorithm resilience in quantum circuits. We show the latter by applying our protocol to Grover's and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms. Experimental results show that this pulse-level strategy provides a flexible and efficient solution for increasing fidelity during the noisy execution of quantum circuits. Our work contributes to advancements in error mitigation techniques, essential for robust quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general method for the implementation of quantum algorithms that optimizes both gate count and circuit depth. Our approach introduces connectivity-adapted CNOT-based building blocks called Parity Twine chains. It outperforms all known state-of-the art methods for implementing prominent quantum algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform or the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm across a wide range of quantum hardware, including linear, square-grid, hexagonal, ladder and all-to-all devices. For specific cases, we rigorously prove the optimality of our approach.</description>

      <title>Bell nonlocality in quantum networks with unreliable sources: Loophole-free postelection via self-testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss Bell nonlocality in quantum networks with unreliable sources. Our main result is a condition on the observed data which ensures that inconclusive events can be safely discarded, without introducing any loophole. More formally, we characterize the fair-sampling property for measurements in a network. When all measurements are fair-sampling, we show that the post-selection of conclusive outcomes does not compromise the assumption of source independence, hence avoiding the detection loophole. Furthermore, we show that in some cases, the fair-sampling property can in fact be guaranteed based only on observed data. To show this, we prove that saturation of the Finner inequality provides a self-test of the underlying quantum model. We illustrate the relevance of our results by demonstrating an improvement in device-independent randomness generation for a photonic Bell test with a probabilistic source and for the triangle network.</description>

      <title>Distributed quantum error correction based on hyperbolic Floquet codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers significant speedups, but the large number of physical qubits required for quantum error correction introduces engineering challenges for a monolithic architecture. One solution is to distribute the logical quantum computation across multiple small quantum computers, with non-local operations enabled via distributed Bell states. Previous investigations of distributed quantum error correction have largely focused on the surface code, which offers good error suppression but poor encoding rates, with each surface code instance only able to encode a single logical qubit. In this work, we argue that hyperbolic Floquet codes are particularly well-suited to distributed quantum error correction for two reasons. Firstly, their hyperbolic structure enables a high number of logical qubits to be stored efficiently. Secondly, the fact that all measurements are between pairs of qubits means that each measurement only requires a single Bell state. Through simulations, we show that distributed hyperbolic Floquet codes offer good performance under local and non-local phenomenological noise. This shows that distributed quantum error correction is not only possible but efficiently realisable.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Verification of Non-Gaussian Coherence in Bosonic Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity, a distinctive characteristic of bosonic quantum states, is pivotal in advancing quantum networks, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and high-precision metrology. Verifying the quantum nature of a state, particularly its non-Gaussian features, is essential for ensuring the reliability and performance of these technologies. However, the specific properties required for each application demand tailored validation thresholds. Here, we introduce a hierarchical framework comprising absolute, relative, and qubit-specific thresholds to assess the non-Gaussianity of local coherences. We illustrate this framework using heralded optical non-Gaussian states with the highest purities available in optical platforms. This comprehensive framework presents the first detailed evaluation of number state coherences and can be extended to a wide range of bosonic states.</description>

      <title>Hierarchies of quantum non-Gaussian coherences for bosonic systems: a theoretical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence in bosonic systems is a fundamental resource for quantum technology applications. In this work, we introduce a framework for analyzing coherence in the Fock-state basis, utilizing context-dependent certification to reveal the quantum non-Gaussian nature of the tested coherence. Rather than relying on global coherence measures, our approach targets specific aspects of coherence, enabling a tailored hierarchical classification. We derive and compare two distinct hierarchies, each representing a different context for coherence in bosonic systems. Motivated by current advancements in optical quantum state engineering, we assess the feasibility and depth of these hierarchies under conditions of loss and thermal noise. The methodology introduced here is versatile and can be extended to multi-state and multi-mode coherences, making it adaptable to a wide range of experimental scenarios and platforms.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal entanglement in molecular optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proposed a theoretical scheme to investigate how to generate the nonreciprocal bipartite entanglement between cavity mode and vibrational modes in a molecular cavity optomechanical system. Our system consists of $\mathcal{N}$ molecules within a spinning whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonator whose vibrations can be strongly entangled with an auxiliary cavity and plasmonic cavity. We find that nonreciprocal photon-vibration entanglement and nonreciprocal vibration-vibration entanglement can exist in our system at high temperatures. These nonreciprocal entanglements are induced by the Sagnac-Fizeau effect. The two types of nonreciprocal entanglements can be enhanced by spinning the WGM resonator in the CCW direction. This ensures that the optical photon is driven by blue-detuned driving field. Moreover, we find that the vibration-vibration entanglement can be greatly enhanced as the number of the molecules increases. Our work finds applications in quantum information transmission</description>

      <title>A Unified Blockwise Measurement Design for Learning Quantum Channels and Lindbladians via Low-Rank Matrix Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum superoperator learning is a pivotal task in quantum information science, enabling accurate reconstruction of unknown quantum operations from measurement data. We propose a robust approach based on the matrix sensing techniques for quantum superoperator learning that extends beyond the positive semidefinite case, encompassing both quantum channels and Lindbladians. We first introduce a randomized measurement design using a near-optimal number of measurements. By leveraging the restricted isometry property (RIP), we provide theoretical guarantees for the identifiability and recovery of low-rank superoperators in the presence of noise. Additionally, we propose a blockwise measurement design that restricts the tomography to the sub-blocks, significantly enhancing performance while maintaining a comparable scale of measurements. We also provide a performance guarantee for this setup. Our approach employs alternating least squares (ALS) with acceleration for optimization in matrix sensing. Numerical experiments validate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced beam tracking surpassing the Heisenberg uncertainty limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining a beam's full trajectory requires tracking both its position and momentum (angular) information. However, the product of position and momentum uncertainty in a simultaneous measurement of the two parameters is bound by the Heisenberg uncertainty limit (HUL). In this work, we present a proof-of-principle demonstration of a quantum-enhanced beam tracking technique, leveraging the inherent position and momentum entanglement between photons produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). We show that quantum entanglement can be exploited to achieve a beam tracking accuracy beyond the HUL in a simultaneous measurement. Moreover, with existing detection technologies, it is already possible to achieve near real-time beam tracking capabilities at the single-photon level. The technique also exhibits high resilience to background influences, with negligible reduction in tracking accuracy even when subjected to a disruptive beam that is significantly brighter than SPDC.</description>

      <title>On the Transfer of Knowledge in Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of quantum computing is generating significant anticipation within the scientific and industrial communities due to its potential to revolutionize computing paradigms. Recognizing this potential, this paper explores the integration of transfer of knowledge techniques, traditionally used in classical artificial intelligence, into quantum computing. We present a comprehensive classification of the transfer models, focusing on Transfer Learning and Transfer Optimization. Additionally, we analyze relevant schemes in quantum computing that can benefit from knowledge sharing, and we delve into the potential synergies, supported by theoretical insights and initial experimental results. Our findings suggest that leveraging the transfer of knowledge can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of quantum algorithms, particularly in the context of hybrid solvers. This approach not only accelerates the optimization process but also reduces the computational burden on quantum processors, making it a valuable tool for advancing quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Phase Transitions in Multiscale Media: Universality and Critical Exponents in the Fractional Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Until now multiscale quantum problems have appeared to be out of reach at the many-body level relevant to strongly correlated materials and current quantum information devices. In fact, they can be modeled with $q$-th order fractional derivatives, as we demonstrate in this work, treating classical and quantum phase transitions in a fractional Ising model for $0 &lt; q \leq 2$ ($q = 2$ is the usual Ising model). We show that fractional derivatives not only enable continuous tuning of critical exponents such as $\nu$, $\delta$, and $\eta$, but also define the Hausdorff dimension $H_D$ of the system tied geometrically to the anomalous dimension $\eta$. We discover that for classical systems, $H_D$ is precisely equal to the fractional order $q$. In contrast, for quantum systems, $H_D$ deviates from this direct equivalence, scaling more gradually, driven by additional degrees of freedom introduced by quantum fluctuations. These results reveal how fractional derivatives fundamentally modify the fractal geometry of many-body interactions, directly influencing the universal symmetries of the system and overcoming traditional dimensional restrictions on phase transitions. Specifically, we find that for $q &lt; 1$ in the classical regime and $q &lt; 2$ in the quantum regime, fractional interactions allow phase transitions in one dimension. This work establishes fractional derivatives as a powerful tool for engineering critical behavior, offering new insights into the geometry of multiscale systems and opening avenues for exploring tunable quantum materials on NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Emergence of classical realism under successive noncommuting measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of emergence of classicality from quantum mechanics has been addressed over time through numerous frameworks, from Bohr's correspondence principle to quantum Darwinism. Traditional approaches associate the emergence of classicality with the decoherence process induced by large reservoirs on the system's state. In this work, we present an effective mechanism by which classicality emerges through the establishment of elements of reality. This involves the process of successive monitoring of noncommuting observables. To assess physical reality, we employ the realism criterion introduced by Bilobran and Angelo [EPL, 112 (2015) 40005], as well as their quantifier for the violations of this criterion. With these tools, we formally demonstrate, for generic systems, that a quasi-classical regime can always be reached with a sufficiently large number of incompatible measurements. Thus, instead of diagnosing the emergence of the classical regime in terms of the resulting algebraic characteristics for the density operator under the action of large reservoirs, our results reveal that classicality can emerge, at the level of physical elements of reality, from the coupling of the system with environments of a few degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Single-shot detection limits of quantum illumination with multipartite qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum illumination is a protocol for detecting a low-reflectivity target by using two-mode entangled states composed of signal and idler modes. In this study, we extend the two-mode qubit states to three-mode qubit states, exploring the following configurations: (i) three signals, (ii) two signals and one idler, and (iii) one signal and two idlers. Each configuration considers various three-qubit states, such as GHZ state, W state, bipartite entangled states, and product states. We derive single-shot detection limits of the three-qubit states under white noise environment, evaluating the detection error probabilities for each configuration. We obtain that the performance is enhanced by the entanglement between signal and idler qubits, whereas it is degraded by the entanglement between signal qubits. In particular, the optimal probe state is not a maximally entangled state but a bipartite entangled state. Moreover, we show that the order of detection error probabilities is consistently certified by the quantum mutual information for the three-qubit probe states. Furthermore, we devote attention to whether this tendency maintains even in multipartite qudit states.</description>

      <title>Tight Sample Complexity Bounds for Parameter Estimation Under Quantum Differential Privacy for Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note provides tight upper and lower bounds for minimal number of samples (copies of quantum states) required to attain a prescribed accuracy (measured by error variance) for scalar parameters using unbiased estimators under quantum local differential privacy for qubits. In the small privacy budget $\epsilon$ regime, i.e., $\epsilon\ll 1$, the sample complexity scales as $\Theta(\epsilon^{-2})$. This bound matches that of classical parameter estimation under differential privacy. The lower bound loosens (converges to zero) in the large privacy budget regime, i.e., $\epsilon\gg 1$, but that case is not particularly interesting as tight bounds for parameter estimation in the noiseless case are widely known. That being said, extensions to systems with higher dimensions and tightening the bounds for the large privacy budget regime are interesting avenues for future research.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing has been a prominent research area for decades, inspiring transformative fields such as quantum simulation, quantum teleportation, and quantum machine learning (QML), which are undergoing rapid development. Within QML, hybrid classical-quantum algorithms like Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) and Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQCs) have shown promise in leveraging quantum circuits and classical optimizers to classify classical data efficiently.Simultaneously, classical machine learning has made significant strides in graph classification, employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze systems ranging from large-scale structures like the Large Hadron Collider to molecular and biological systems like proteins and DNA. Combining the advancements in quantum computing and graph classification presents a unique opportunity to develop quantum algorithms capable of extracting features from graphs and performing their classification effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum encoding framework for graph classification using VQCs. Unlike existing approaches such as PCA-VQC, which rely on dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and may lead to information loss, our method preserves the integrity of graph data. Furthermore, our encoding approach is optimized for Noise-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, requiring a limited number of qubits while achieving comparable or superior classification performance to PCA-VQC. By constructing slightly more complex circuits tailored for graph encoding, we demonstrate that VQCs can effectively classify graphs within the constraints of current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Optimized Spectral Purity of Heralded Single Photons at the Telecom O-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on optimizing the spectral purity of heralded single photons in the telecom O-band, where single photons can be propagated with low loss and low dispersion in a standard telecom optical fiber. We numerically searched for various group-velocity-matching conditions and corresponding optimal poling structures of a potassium titanyl phosphate crystal for spontaneous parametric downconversion. Our poling optimization results using phase-matching coherence-length and sub-coherence-length modulation schemes show &gt; 99.4% spectral purity with pump wavelengths ranging from 603.8 nm to 887.3 nm. Some optimized configurations are feasible with off-the-shelf lasers and single-photon detectors. Moreover, by investigating noise photon spectra for different poling optimization methods, we show that, in practice, appropriate, gentle spectral filtering helps achieve high purity. This study will pave the way for developing practical quantum sources for quantum information applications at the telecom O-band.</description>

      <title>Analysis of heralded higher-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates with self-correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the quantum error correction (QEC) and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms to function with high efficiency, the raw fidelity of quantum logic gates on physical qubits needs to satisfy strict requirement. The neutral atom quantum computing equipped with Rydberg blockade gates has made impressive progress recently, which makes it worthwhile to explore its potential in the two-qubit entangling gates, including Controlled-PHASE gate and in particular the CZ gate. Provided the quantum coherence is well preserved, improving the fidelity of Rydberg blockade gates calls for special mechanisms to deal with adverse effects caused by realistic experimental conditions. Here the heralded very-high-fidelity Rydberg blockade Controlled-PHASE gate is designed to address these issues, which contains self-correction and projection as the key steps. This trailblazing method can be built on the basis of the previously established buffer-atom-mediated gate, and a special form of symmetry under PT transformation plays a crucial role in the process. We further analyze the performance with respect to a few typical sources of imperfections. This procedure can also be regarded as quantum hardware error correction or mitigation. While this paper by itself does not cover every single subtle issue and still contains many over-simplifications, we find it reasonable to anticipate very-high-fidelity two-qubit quantum logic gate operated in the sense of heralded but probabilistic, whose gate error can reduce to the level of $10^{-4}$--$10^{-6}$ or even lower with reasonably high possibilities.</description>

      <title>Cylindrically confined $H$ atom in magnetic field: variational cut-off factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we consider the hydrogen atom confined within an impenetrable infinite cylindrical cavity of radius $\rho_{0}$ in the presence of a constant magnetic field ${\bf B} = B\,{\hat{\bf z}}$ oriented along the main cylinder's axis. In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, anchoring the nucleus to the geometric center of the cylinder, a physically meaningful 3-parametric trial function is used to determine the ground state energy $E$ of the system. This trial function incorporates the exact symmetries and key limiting behaviors of the problem explicitly. In particular, it does not treat the Coulomb potential nor the magnetic interaction as a perturbation. The novel inclusion of a variational cut-off factor, $(1 - (\frac{\rho}{\rho_0})^\nu )$, appears to represent an improvement compared to the non-variational cut-off factors commonly employed in the literature. A phenomenon of a sharp change of $\nu-$behavior for small magnetic fields $B \lesssim 0.45\,a.u.$ with fixed radius $\rho_0 \approx 2\,a.u.$ is indicated. The energy dependence $E=E(\rho_0,\,B)$ on the cavity radius $\rho_0 \in [0.8,\,5] \,a.u.$ and the magnetic field strength $B \in [0,\,1]\, a.u.$ is presented in detail. The expectation value $\langle \rho \rangle$ and the Shannon entropy in position space are computed to provide additional insights into the system's localization. A brief discussion is provided comparing the 2D and 3D cases as well.</description>

      <title>Whether a quantum computation employs nonlocal resources is operationally undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational complexity characterizes the usage of spatial and temporal resources by computational processes. In the classical theory of computation, e.g. in the Turing Machine model, computational processes employ only local space and time resources, and their resource usage can be accurately measured by us as users. General relativity and quantum theory, however, introduce the possibility of computational processes that employ nonlocal spatial or temporal resources. While the space and time complexity of classical computing can be given a clear operational meaning, this is no longer the case in any setting involving nonlocal resources. In such settings, theoretical analyses of resource usage cease to be reliable indicators of practical computational capability. We prove that the verifier (C) in a multiple interactive provers with shared entanglement (MIP*) protocol cannot operationally demonstrate that the "multiple" provers are independent, i.e. cannot operationally distinguish a MIP* machine from a monolithic quantum computer. Thus C cannot operationally distinguish a MIP* machine from a quantum TM, and hence cannot operationally demonstrate the solution to arbitrary problems in RE. Any claim that a MIP* machine has solved a TM-undecidable problem is, therefore, circular, as the problem of deciding whether a physical system is a MIP* machine is itself TM-undecidable. Consequently, despite the space and time complexity of classical computing having a clear operational meaning, this is no longer the case in any setting involving nonlocal resources. In such settings, theoretical analyses of resource usage cease to be reliable indicators of practical computational capability. This has practical consequences when assessing newly proposed computational frameworks based on quantum theories.</description>

      <title>From Classical to Quantum: Explicit Classical Distributions Achieving Maximal Quantum $f$-Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit classical states achieving maximal $f$-divergence are given, allowing for a simple proof of Matsumoto's Theorem, and the systematic extension of any inequality between classical $f$-divergences to quantum $f$-divergences. Our methodology is particularly simple as it does not require any elaborate matrix analysis machinery but only basic linear algebra. It is also effective, as illustrated by two examples improving existing bounds: (i)~an improved quantum Pinsker inequality is derived between $\chi^2$ and trace norm, and leveraged to improve a bound in decoherence theory; (ii)~a new reverse quantum Pinsker inequality is derived for any quantum $f$-divergence, and compared to previous (Audenaert-Eisert and Hirche-Tomamichel) bounds.</description>

      <title>Error-mitigated Geometric Quantum Control over an Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information is very fragile to environmental- and operational-induced imperfections. Therefore, the construction of practical quantum computers needs the quantum error correction technique to protect quantum information. Particularly, encode a logical qubit into the large Hilbert space of an oscillator is a hardware-efficient way of correcting quantum errors. In this strategy, selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gates are vital for universal quantum control. However, the quality of SNAP gates is considerably limited by the small coupling-induced non-linearity of the oscillator. Here, to resolve this limitation, we propose a robust scheme based on quantum optimal control via the functional theory, by designing an appropriate trajectory for a target operation. Besides, we combine the geometric phase approach with our trajectory design scheme to minimize the decoherence effect, by shortening the gate-time. Numerical simulation shows that both errors can be significantly mitigated and the robustness of the geometric gate against both $X$ and $Z$ errors can be maintained. Therefore, our scheme provides a promising alternative for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>On Measures in Ion Trap Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate quantum information measures in ion traps by utilizing the harmonic oscillator model to characterize trapped potentials and ion dynamics. Our findings confirm that, in the steady-state case, mutual information and synchronization measures exhibit similar behaviors. Additionally, we explore how these measures change in the quench model and how they are influenced by coupling and external noise, such as an external magnetic field. Moreover, for a proposed target ground state, we determine the circuit depth and analyze the effects of the external magnetic field and coupling constant, highlighting their dynamic evolution over time. We also discuss the coherent state of a single ion in a trap, noting an inverse relationship between complexity and fidelity-where increased fidelity corresponds to decreased system complexity, indicating a more ordered state with improved control and optimization. However, at higher system frequencies, complexity increases due to intricate interactions and rapid state changes, necessitating advanced control mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the macroscopic dynamics of Josephson charge pumps in the light of Alicki et al.'s theoretical description of the Josephson junction as an open quantum system described by a Markovian master equation. If the Coulomb interaction between the terminals is taken into account, we find that the resulting description of pumping is physically reasonable and in good qualitative agreement with experimental observations. We comment on how this approach relates to other theoretical treatments of quantum pumps based on time-dependent potentials or scattering amplitudes. We also highlight the significance of our results in the broader context of the dynamics of charge pumping by active systems.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Control under Physical Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control is concerned with the realisation of desired dynamics in quantum systems, serving as a linchpin for advancing quantum technologies and fundamental research. Analytic approaches and standard optimisation algorithms do not yield satisfactory solutions for large quantum systems, and especially not for real world quantum systems which are open and noisy. We devise a physics-informed Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that restricts the space of possible solutions. We incorporate priors about the desired time scales of the quantum state dynamics - as well as realistic control signal limitations - as constraints to the RL algorithm. These physics-informed constraints additionally improve computational scalability by facilitating parallel optimisation. We evaluate our method on three broadly relevant quantum systems (multi-level $\Lambda$ system, Rydberg atom and superconducting transmon) and incorporate real-world complications, arising from dissipation and control signal perturbations. We achieve both higher fidelities - which exceed 0.999 across all systems - and better robustness to time-dependent perturbations and experimental imperfections than previous methods. Lastly, we demonstrate that incorporating multi-step feedback can yield solutions robust even to strong perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have advanced rapidly in qubit number and gate fidelity. However, they would still lack practicalness without utilizing fault-tolerant quantum error correction code (QECC) implementations to suppress noise. Manually or experimentally verifying the fault-tolerance of complex QECCs is impractical due to the vast error combinations. This paper formalizes fault-tolerance within the language of quantum programs. By incorporating the techniques of quantum symbolic execution, we provide an automatic verification tool for quantum fault-tolerance. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool on a universal set of logical operations across different QECCs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Networks: A Comparative Analysis and Noise Robustness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs) offer a promising solution, combining the strengths of classical machine learning with quantum computing capabilities. However, the performance of these networks can be significantly affected by the quantum noise inherent in NISQ devices. In this paper, we conduct an extensive comparative analysis of various HQNN algorithms, namely Quantum Convolution Neural Network (QCNN), Quanvolutional Neural Network (QuanNN), and Quantum Transfer Learning (QTL), for image classification tasks. We evaluate the performance of each algorithm across quantum circuits with different entangling structures, variations in layer count, and optimal placement in the architecture. Subsequently, we select the highest-performing architectures and assess their robustness against noise influence by introducing quantum gate noise through Phase Flip, Bit Flip, Phase Damping, Amplitude Damping, and the Depolarizing Channel. Our results reveal that the top-performing models exhibit varying resilience to different noise gates. However, in most scenarios, the QuanNN demonstrates greater robustness across various quantum noise channels, consistently outperforming other models. This highlights the importance of tailoring model selection to specific noise environments in NISQ devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, the probability distribution function (PDF) and full counting statistics (FCS) play a fundamental role in characterizing the fluctuations of quantum observables, as they encode the complete information about these fluctuations. In this letter, we measure these two quantities in a trapped-ion quantum simulator for the transverse and longitudinal magnetization within a subsystem. We utilize the toolbox of classical shadows to postprocess the measurements performed in random bases. The measurement scheme efficiently allows access to the FCS and PDF of all possible operators on desired choices of subsystems of an extended quantum system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a generic hybrid network, classical, quantum, and no-signaling sources emit local hidden variables, stabilizer states, and no-signaling systems, respectively. We investigate the maximal correlation strength as the non-classical feature in this network. Given the associated fully-quantum network of a hybrid network, we exploit the stabilizing operators of the distributed quantum state to construct segmented Bell operators and the Bell inequalities tailored to the state. We derive the upper bounds of the maximal correlation strengths in the associated full-classical, full-quantum, and fully-no-signaling networks as the benchmarks. Our study shows that the achievable correlation strength depends on the number of type-A measurements and that of nonlocal sources. We also introduce the t-nonlocality criteria, indicating that the achievable maximal correlation strength cannot modeled by the network with at least t observers with local hidden variables performing type-A measurements.</description>

      <title>Two-photon scattering in a waveguide by a giant atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-photon scattering by a two-level giant atom in a waveguide. We first study the case that the giant atom is coupled to the waveguide via two coupling points, and obtain Bethe ansatz eigenstates and eigenvalues in the Hilbert space of two-excitation. Then we derive bound states by subtracting the states corresponding to Bethe ansatz solutions from the entire two-excitation Hilbert space, and construct the two-photon scattering matrix (S-matrix) by using Bethe ansatz eigenstates and bound states. We further study the properties of output states, which include both the scattering and bound states, for arbitrarily incident two-photon states by using a concrete example. We find that the oscillation period of the scattering states and decay rates of the bound states strongly depend on the distance between two coupling points. Moreover, we find that the two-photon correlation in the bound states can be enhanced by changing such distance when the total energy of two incident photons equals to two times of single photon resonance energy. We also generalize our study to the case that the giant atom is coupled to the waveguide via $N$ coupling points. We obtain all the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the scattering matrix and construct the S-matrix. Comparing with the case of the two coupling points, we find the photon correlation can be further enhanced by increasing the number of the coupling points for the same incident states when the distance of any two nearest neighbor coupling points is half of the wavelength.</description>

      <title>Ballistic diffusion vs. damped oscillation of energy in a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum kicked harmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the quantum dynamics of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric kicked harmonic oscillator. We observe that directed current of momentum and ballistic diffusion of energy coexist under the non-resonant conditions, whereas both the momentum and energy oscillate as damped cosine functions with identical frequencies under the resonant conditions. The research shows that the directed current of momentum and ballistic diffusion of energy arise from nearest-neighbor hopping between momentum eigenstates with the non-Hermitian driving, while the damped oscillations of momentum and energy originate from resonant coupling between the non-Hermitian driving and the harmonic oscillator. Our findings indicate that the non-Hermiticity and the frequency characteristic of this system collectively result in these distinctive dynamical behaviors. </description>

      <title>Towards a Cryogenic CMOS-Memristor Neural Decoder for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach utilizing a scalable neural decoder application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) based on metal oxide memristors in a 180nm CMOS technology. The ASIC architecture employs in-memory computing with memristor crossbars for efficient vector-matrix multiplications (VMM). The ASIC decoder architecture includes an input layer implemented with a VMM and an analog sigmoid activation function, a recurrent layer with analog memory, and an output layer with a VMM and a threshold activation function. Cryogenic characterization of the ASIC is conducted, demonstrating its performance at both room temperature and cryogenic temperatures down to 1.2K. Results indicate stable activation function shapes and pulse responses at cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, power consumption measurements reveal consistent behavior at room and cryogenic temperatures. Overall, this study lays the foundation for developing efficient and scalable neural decoders for quantum error correction in cryogenic environments.</description>

      <title>Quantifying entanglement dimensionality from the quantum Fisher information matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is known to be an essential resource for a number of tasks, including quantum-enhanced metrology, and can thus be quantified by figures of merit related to those tasks. In quantum metrology this is emphasized by the connections between the quantum Fisher information (QFI), providing the ultimate bounds of precision, and multipartite entanglement quantifiers such as the depth of entanglement. In systems composed by many qudits, it is also important to characterize the dimensionality of entanglement across bipartitions, i.e., loosely speaking, the minimal number of levels that must be entangled with each other in a given bipartition. However, the impact of high-dimensional entanglement on the QFI remains unexplored. In this work, we fill this gap by deriving a quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) criterion for witnessing the entanglement dimensionality across bipartitions, along with scalar corollaries, which we also extend to the multipartite scenario. To further emphasize the significance of our results, we draw connections with the precision of multiparameter estimation, which also provides a practical way of implementing our methods in experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Spectral Response of linear-quadratic optomechanical interaction: Effects of pure dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, the decoherence dynamics and spectral response of an optomechanical system, with linear and quadratic couplings, is addressed. The decoherence considered arises from pure dephasing, described by the Milburn stochastic evolution of the Schr\"odinger equation. In the first part of the manuscript, it is shown how the decoherence rate influences the evolution of the number of phonons, and the quadrature of the mechanical resonator. In the second part of the manuscript, an attempt to look at the spectral response of the mechanical part of the system is given using non-stationary spectroscopy. It is emphasized the response of the resonator in its equilibrium position when a single photon excitation in the cavity field is prepared. Coherent states are also considered in the cavity field and the mechanical resonator. Results and discussion comparing the inclusions of the linear, quadratic, and linear-quadratic couplings are given.</description>

      <title>End-to-end workflow for machine learning-based qubit readout with QICK and hls4ml</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end workflow for superconducting qubit readout that embeds co-designed Neural Networks (NNs) into the Quantum Instrumentation Control Kit (QICK). Capitalizing on the custom firmware and software of the QICK platform, which is built on Xilinx RFSoC FPGAs, we aim to leverage machine learning (ML) to address critical challenges in qubit readout accuracy and scalability. The workflow utilizes the hls4ml package and employs quantization-aware training to translate ML models into hardware-efficient FPGA implementations via user-friendly Python APIs. We experimentally demonstrate the design, optimization, and integration of an ML algorithm for single transmon qubit readout, achieving 96% single-shot fidelity with a latency of 32ns and less than 16% FPGA look-up table resource utilization. Our results offer the community an accessible workflow to advance ML-driven readout and adaptive control in quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <title>Weak convexity of Fisher information matrix and superresolved localization of blinking sources of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group of techniques known by the general name of single-molecule localization microscopy reaches a nanometer-scale spatial resolution of point light emitters, well below the diffraction limit of the traditional microscopy. The key feature of these techniques is blinking, alternation of bright and dark states, of each emitter so that no more than one emitter is bright within the width of the point-spread function of microscope during a time sufficient for its localization. We give a formulation of the optical part of these techniques in terms of quantum metrology, where the limit of precision is determined by the Fisher information on the emitters positions contained in the measurement data. We show that the advantage in resolution provided by making the emitters to blink is a consequence of the fundamental property of Fisher information, its convexity. In particular, we prove the weak matrix convexity and the trace convexity of the Fisher information matrix -- two fundamental results in the multiparameter estimation theory. We show also that the advantage in information is inherent to the quantum state of light itself before the measurement and is related to the convexity of the quantum Fisher information matrix.</description>

      <title>Exact generalized Bethe eigenstates of the non-integrable alternating Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact solutions of quantum lattice models serve as useful guides for interpreting physical phenomena in condensed matter systems. Prominent examples of integrability appear in one dimension, including the Heisenberg chain, where the Bethe ansatz method has been widely successful. Recent work has noted that certain non-integrable models harbor quantum many-body scar states, which form a superspin of regular states hidden in an otherwise chaotic spectrum. Here we consider one of the simplest examples of a non-integrable model, the alternating ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic (bond-staggered) Heisenberg chain, a close cousin of the spin-1 Haldane chain and a spin analog of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and show the presence of exponentially many zero-energy states. We highlight features of the alternating chain that allow treatment with the Bethe ansatz (with important modifications) and surprisingly for a non-integrable system, we find simple compact expressions for zero-energy eigenfunctions for a few magnons including solutions with fractionalized particle momentum. We discuss a general numerical recipe to diagnose the existence of such generalized Bethe ansatz (GBA) states and also provide exact analytic expressions for the entanglement of such states. We conclude by conjecturing a picture of magnon pairing which may generalize to multiple magnons. Our work opens the avenue to describe certain eigenstates of partially integrable systems using the GBA.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum many-body scars tunable from volume to area law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teleportation of quantum information over long distances requires robust entanglement on the macroscopic scale. The construction of a manifold of highly energetic eigenstates with tunable long-range entanglement can provide a new medium for information transmission. We construct polynomially many exact zero-energy eigenstates in an exponentially degenerate manifold for a class of non-integrable spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with two-body interactions. A symmetric superposition of the triplet basis of antipodal spin pairs provides a rich manifold for the construction of states with extensive, logarithmic, and short-range entanglement by tuning the distribution of triplet states. We show the volume-law entangled states despite being in the middle of the spectrum host non-thermal expectation values of local observables. Certain quasiparticle excitations in this manifold converge to be exact quantum many-body scars in the thermodynamic limit. This framework has a natural extension to higher dimensions, where entangled states controlled by lattice geometry and internal symmetries can result in new classes of correlated out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. Our results provide a new avenue for entanglement control and a novel method of quantum state construction.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order correlator computation based on discrete truncated Wigner approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method based on the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) for computing out-of-time-order correlators. This method is applied to long-range interacting quantum spin systems where the interactions decay as a power law with distance. As a demonstration, we use a squared commutator of local operators and its higher-order extensions that describe quantum information scrambling under Hamilton dynamics. Our results reveal that the DTWA method accurately reproduces the exact dynamics of the average spreading of quantum information (i.e., the squared commutator) across all time regimes in strongly long-range interacting systems. We also identify limitations in the DTWA method when capturing dynamics in weakly long-range interacting systems and the fastest spreading of quantum information. This work provides a new technique to study scrambling dynamics in long-range interacting quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>A Classifying Space for Phases of Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a topological space $\mathcal{B}$ consisting of translation invariant injective matrix product states (MPS) of all physical and bond dimensions and show that it has the weak homotopy type $K(\mathbb{Z}, 2) \times K(\mathbb{Z}, 3)$. The implication is that the phase of a family of such states parametrized by a space $X$ is completely determined by two invariants: a class in $H^2(X; \mathbb{Z})$ corresponding to the Chern number per unit cell and a class in $H^3(X; \mathbb{Z})$, the so-called Kapustin-Spodyneiko (KS) number. The space $\mathcal{B}$ is defined as the quotient of a contractible space $\mathcal{E}$ of MPS tensors by an equivalence relation describing gauge transformations of the tensors. We prove that the projection map $p:\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ is a quasifibration, and this allows us to determine the weak homotopy type of $\mathcal{B}$. As an example, we review the Chern number pump-a family of MPS parametrized by $S^3$-and prove that it generates $\pi_3(\mathcal{B})$.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Current Fluctuations in Quantum Wires through Charge Fractionalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information measures of many-body systems often imply a measure with multi- or two regions such as bipartite charge fluctuations within the ground state revealing the logarithmic profile of the entanglement entropy in a quantum wire. Here, we introduce a new method from the bipartite current fluctuations and the divergence theorem. They reveal the fractional charges related to ground-state energetics and the proximity to Mott physics in the same ballistic quantum wires. This also encodes the behavior of the electron Green's function in space. With metallic gates on both sides of an interface to implement the protocol introducing the two macroscopic domains, bipartite current fluctuations can reveal an additional localized bound state associated to the topological Jackiw-Rebbi model, coexisting with the fractional charges. Through the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm we introduce a quantum spin chain analogue.</description>

      <title>Investigating topological in-gap states in non-Hermitian quasicrystal with unconventional $p$-wave pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of onsite quasiperiodic potential, superconductivity, and non-Hermiticity is explored in a non-Hermitian unconventional superconducting quasicrystal described by Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (NHAAH) model with $p$-wave pairing. In previous studies, the non-Hermiticity was only considered at the onsite quasiperiodic potential of the NHAAH model, and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) were observed under open boundary conditions (OBC) in this model. In this work, we study an NHAAH model with $p$-wave pairing, where non-Hermiticity is considered onsite by introducing complex quasiperiodic potential and asymmetry at the hopping part. Our analysis uncovers triple-phase transitions, where topological, metal-insulator, and unconventional real-to-complex transitions coincide at weak $p$-wave pairing strength. Additionally, instead of the MZMs observed in the symmetric hopping case, we observe the emergence of in-gap states under OBC in this model. These in-gap states are robust against disorder, underscoring their topological protection. Therefore, unlike the MZMs, which are very challenging to experimentally realize, these in-gap states can be used in topological quantum computational protocols.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Meissner Effect and Flux Trapping of Superconductors under High Pressure using N-V Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pressure is a key parameter for tuning or revealing superconductivity in materials and compounds. Many measurements of superconducting phase transition temperatures have been conducted using diamond anvil cells (DACs), which provide a wide pressure range and enable concomitant microscopic structural characterization of the sample. However, the inherently small sample volumes in DACs complicate the unambiguous detection of the Meissner effect, the hallmark of superconductivity. Recently, the Meissner effect in superconductors within a DAC was successfully demonstrated using diamond nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) widefield magnetometry, a non-invasive optical technique. In this work, we show that N-V magnetometry can also map superconductivity with micrometer resolution. We apply this technique to a microcrystal of HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg-1223) mercury-based cuprate superconductor under 4 GPa of pressure. The method is capable to detect the magnetic field expulsion and heterogeneities in the sample, visible in a set of characteristic parameters as the local critical temperature $T_{c}$. Flux pinning zones are identified through flux trapping maps. This approach could enable detailed investigations of superconductivity of a broad range of materials under high-pressure conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting with the Dirac equation for an electron in a constant electromagnetic background on a noncommutative (NC) plane, we obtain a gauge invariant description of the system. Surprisingly, the dynamics of the system is dictated by the standard form of Lorentz force law, once the effective magnetic and electric fields $\left( B^{NC}, \, E^{NC} \right)$ correct up to leading order in the NC parameter are identified. The Hall effect is studied using the NC corrected fields in the non-relativistic (NR) limit. This shows that noncommutativity affects the cyclotron frequency, but leaves the Hall conductivity unaffected at least to first order in the NC parameter. Owing to the NC corrected magnetic field, the hyperfine splitting of Hydrogen atom spectrum also shows a first order correction which helps establish an upper bound on the spatial NC parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) focuses on determining conflict-free paths for multiple agents navigating through a shared space to reach specified goal locations. This problem becomes computationally challenging, particularly when handling large numbers of agents, as frequently encountered in practical applications like coordinating autonomous vehicles. Quantum computing (QC) is a promising candidate in overcoming such limits. However, current quantum hardware is still in its infancy and thus limited in terms of computing power and error robustness. In this work, we present the first optimal hybrid quantum-classical MAPF algorithm which is based on branch-and-cut-and-prize. QC is integrated by iteratively solving QUBO problems, based on conflict graphs. Experiments on actual quantum hardware and results on benchmark data suggest that our approach dominates previous QUBO formulations and baseline MAPF solvers.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Lorentz symmetry violation on relativistic neutral scalar bosons: Scattering and bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on a relativistic neutral scalar boson within the framework of the Klein-Gordon formalism. We consider a tensor $(K_F)_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}$ out of the Standard Model Extension, which describes the field configuration consisting of a constant magnetic field $\vec{B}=B\hat{z}$ and a cylindrical electric field $\vec{E}=\frac{\lambda}{r}\hat{r}$. We analyze and discuss the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on the equation of motion and show that the presence of a specific Lorentz symmetry violation parameter is essential to obtain analytical solutions for scattering and bound states. Employing the partial wave approach in cylindrical coordinates, we calculate the relativistic phase shift, scattering amplitude and $S$-matrix, and discuss the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on the phase shift. Furthermore, we obtain bound-state solutions by examining the poles of the $S$-matrix and compare our findings with those reported in the literature. Our results reveal that bound-state solutions are only feasible for a restrict range of Lorentz symmetry violation parameters, which contradict previous studies.</description>

      <title>A dressed singlet-triplet qubit in germanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In semiconductor hole spin qubits, low magnetic field ($B$) operation extends the coherence time ($T_\mathrm{2}^*$) but proportionally reduces the gate speed. In contrast, singlet-triplet (ST) qubits are primarily controlled by the exchange interaction ($J$) and can thus maintain high gate speeds even at low $B$. However, a large $J$ introduces a significant charge component to the qubit, rendering ST qubits more vulnerable to charge noise when driven. Here, we demonstrate a highly coherent ST hole spin qubit in germanium, operating at both low $B$ and low $J$. By modulating $J$, we achieve resonant driving of the ST qubit, obtaining an average gate fidelity of $99.68\%$ and a coherence time of $T_\mathrm{2}^*=1.9\,\mu$s. Moreover, by applying the resonant drive continuously, we realize a dressed ST qubit with a tenfold increase in coherence time ($T_\mathrm{2\rho}^*=20.3\,\mu$s). Frequency modulation of the driving signal enables universal control, with an average gate fidelity of $99.64\%$. Our results demonstrate the potential for extending coherence times while preserving high-fidelity control of germanium-based ST qubits, paving the way for more efficient operations in semiconductor-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Dualities between 2+1d fusion surface models from braided fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fusion surface models generalize the concept of anyon chains to 2+1 dimensions, utilizing fusion 2-categories as their input. We investigate bond-algebraic dualities in these systems and show that distinct module tensor categories $\mathcal{M}$ over the same braided fusion category $\mathcal{B}$ give rise to dual lattice models. This extends the 1+1d result that dualities in anyon chains are classified by module categories over fusion categories. We analyze two concrete examples: (i) a $\text{Rep}(S_3)$ model with a constrained Hilbert space, dual to the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ XXZ model on the honeycomb lattice, and (ii) a bilayer Kitaev honeycomb model, dual to a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ model with XXZ and Ising interactions. Unlike regular $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{B}$ fusion surface models, which conserve only 1-form symmetries, models constructed from $\mathcal{M} \neq \mathcal{B}$ can exhibit both 1-form and 0-form symmetries, including non-invertible ones.</description>

      <title>A Non-perturbative General Approximation Scheme (NGAS) for Interacting Quantum Systems with Perturbation Theory for Arbitrary Strength of Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.12508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A non-perturbative general approximation scheme (NGAS) is presented which is potentially applicable for arbitrary strength of interaction in quantum theory. The scheme utilizes an input Hamiltonian, which is exactly solvable. The effects of interaction are incorporated into this input Hamiltonian through a non-linear feedback mechanism by imposing self-consistency conditions. The method is nonperturbative, yet improvable in a new formulation of perturbation theory, designated as: mean field perturbation theory (MFPT). We apply the scheme to anharmonic interactions in one dimension employing the harmonic-approximation and obtain uniformly accurate results by Borel summation, for the quartic-, sextic-, octic-anharmonic oscillators and to the quartic double-well oscillator (QDWO) for {\emph{arbitrary strength of coupling}}. The {\it{flexibility}} of the scheme to the choice of the input is demonstrated by producing results of comparable accuracy by employing the infinite-square Hamiltonian as input. Application to the {\lambda}{\phi}^4-quantum field theory leads to the equivalence of the present method to the Gaussian-effective potential approach in the harmonic approximation. Additionally,however the underlying condensate structure of the effective vacuum is shown to emerge and the instability of the perturbative ground state is established. The results for the QDWO may be contrasted with those from the standard formulation of perturbation theory , where Borel-summation {\it{fails}} for any value of the coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Improved Quantum Query Upper Bounds Based on Classical Decision Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.02968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a classical query algorithm as a decision tree, when does there exist a quantum query algorithm with a speed-up over the classical one? We provide a general construction based on the structure of the underlying decision tree, and prove that this can give us an up-to-quadratic quantum speed-up. In particular, we obtain a bounded-error quantum query algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{s})$ to compute a Boolean function (more generally, a relation) that can be computed by a classical (even randomized) decision tree of size $s$.
  Lin and Lin [ToC'16] and Beigi and Taghavi [Quantum'20] showed results of a similar flavor, and gave upper bounds in terms of a quantity which we call the "guessing complexity" of a decision tree. We identify that the guessing complexity of a decision tree equals its rank, a notion introduced by Ehrenfeucht and Haussler [Inf. Comp.'89] in the context of learning theory. This answers a question posed by Lin and Lin, who asked whether the guessing complexity of a decision tree is related to any complexity-theoretic measure. We also show a polynomial separation between rank and randomized rank for the complete binary AND-OR tree.
  Beigi and Taghavi constructed span programs and dual adversary solutions for Boolean functions given classical decision trees computing them and an assignment of non-negative weights to its edges. We explore the effect of changing these weights on the resulting span program complexity and objective value of the dual adversary bound, and capture the best possible weighting scheme by an optimization program. We exhibit a solution to this program and argue its optimality from first principles. We also exhibit decision trees for which our bounds are asymptotically stronger than those of Lin and Lin, and Beigi and Taghavi. This answers a question of Beigi and Taghavi, who asked whether different weighting schemes could yield better upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Maximum tolerable excess noise in continuous-variable quantum key distribution and improved lower bound on two-way capacities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12867v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-way capacities of quantum channels determine the ultimate entanglement and secret-key distribution rates achievable by two distant parties that are connected by a noisy transmission line, in absence of quantum repeaters. Since repeaters will likely be expensive to build and maintain, a central open problem of quantum communication is to understand what performances are achievable without them. In this paper, we find a new lower bound on the energy-constrained and unconstrained two-way quantum and secret-key capacities of all phase-insensitive bosonic Gaussian channels, namely thermal attenuator, thermal amplifier, and additive Gaussian noise, which are realistic models for the noise affecting optical fibres or free-space links. Ours is the first nonzero lower bound on the two-way quantum capacity in the parameter range where the (reverse) coherent information becomes negative, and it shows explicitly that entanglement distribution is always possible when the channel is not entanglement breaking. This completely solves a crucial open problem of the field, namely, establishing the maximum excess noise which is tolerable in continuous-variable quantum key distribution. In addition, our construction is fully explicit, i.e. we devise and optimise a concrete entanglement distribution and distillation protocol that works by combining recurrence and hashing protocols</description>

      <title>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</description>

      <title>New Approaches to Complexity via Quantum Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Problems based on the structure of graphs -- for example finding cliques, independent sets, or colourings -- are of fundamental importance in classical complexity. Defining well-formulated decision problems for quantum graphs, which are an operator system generalisation of graphs, presents several technical challenges. Consequently, the connections between quantum graphs and complexity have been underexplored.
  In this work, we introduce and study the clique problem for quantum graphs. Our approach utilizes a well-known connection between quantum graphs and quantum channels. The inputs for our problems are presented as circuits inducing quantum channel, which implicitly determine a corresponding quantum graph. We show that, quantified over all channels, this problem is complete for QMA(2); in fact, it remains QMA(2)-complete when restricted to channels that are probabilistic mixtures of entanglement-breaking and partial trace channels. Quantified over a subset of entanglement-breaking channels, this problem becomes QMA-complete, and restricting further to deterministic or classical noisy channels gives rise to complete problems for NP and MA, respectively. In this way, we exhibit a classical complexity problem whose natural quantisation is QMA(2), rather than QMA, and provide the first problem that allows for a direct comparison of the classes QMA(2), QMA, MA, and NP by quantifying over increasingly larger families of instances.
  We use methods that are inspired by self-testing to provide a direct proof of QMA(2)-completeness, rather than reducing to a previously-studied complete problem. We also give a new proof of the celebrated reduction of QMA(k) to QMA(2). In parallel, we study a version of the closely-related independent set problem for quantum graphs, and provide preliminary evidence that it may be in general weaker in complexity, contrasting to the classical case.</description>

      <title>The standard no-signalling constraints in Bell scenarios are neither sufficient nor necessary for preventing superluminal signalling with general interventions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-classical correlations resulting from entangled quantum systems have sparked debates about the compatibility of quantum theory and relativity, and about the right way to think about causation. Key to a causal theory is that superluminal signalling is forbidden, which holds in quantum theory. In Bell scenarios, relativistic causality principles like no superluminal signalling are often assumed to follow from the standard no-signalling constraints on correlations. We explore the connections between a range of relativistic principles, including no superluminal signalling and no causal loops, and constraints on correlations that can arise with arbitrary interventions, within multi-party Bell scenarios. This includes standard no-signalling conditions and proposed relaxations allowing phenomena like jamming, where it was suggested that superluminal signalling and causal loops remain impossible. Using our recent framework combining relativistic principles with causal modelling, we show that any theory (classical or non-classical) allowing jamming must rely on causal fine-tuning and superluminal causal influences. Additionally, we show that jamming theories can lead to superluminal signalling in certain situations, highlighting limitations for their physicality. However, we identify cases where jamming correlations avoid superluminal signalling under general interventions, demonstrating that standard no-signalling constraints are not necessary for this purpose. We also show that these constraints are insufficient to rule out superluminal signalling and are neither necessary nor sufficient for ensuring no causal loops under general interventions. Finally, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for ruling out superluminal signalling and operationally detectable causal loops, solidifying our understanding of relativistic causality principles in information processing tasks in space-time.</description>

      <title>Can increasing the size and flexibility of a molecule reduce decoherence and prolong charge migration?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent superposition of electronic states, created by ionizing a molecule, can initiate ultrafast dynamics of the electron density. Correlation between nuclear and electron motions, however, typically dissipates the electronic coherence in only a few femtoseconds, especially in larger and more flexible molecules. We, therefore, use ab initio semiclassical dynamics to study decoherence in a sequence of analogous organic molecules of increasing size and find, surprisingly, that extending the carbon skeleton in propynal analogs slows down decoherence and prolongs charge migration. To elucidate this observation, we decompose the overall decoherence into contributions from individual vibrational modes and show that: (1) The initial decay of electronic coherence is caused by high- and intermediate-frequency vibrations via momentum separation of nuclear wavepackets evolving on different electronic surfaces. (2) At later times, the coherence disappears completely due to the increasing position separation in the low-frequency modes. (3) In agreement with another study, we observe that only normal modes that preserve the symmetry of the molecule induce decoherence. All together, we justify the enhanced charge migration by a combination of increased hole-mixing and the disappearance of decoherence contributions from specific vibrational modes: CO stretching in butynal and various H rockings in pentynal.</description>

      <title>On the locality of qubit encodings of local fermionic modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Known mappings that encode fermionic modes into a bosonic qubit system are non-local transformations. In this paper we establish that this must necessarily be the case, if the locality graph is complex enough (for example for regular 2$d$ lattices). In particular we show that, in case of exact encodings, a fully local mapping is possible if and only if the locality graph is a tree. If instead we allow ourselves to also consider operators that only act fermionically on a subspace of the qubit Hilbert space, then we show that this subspace must be composed of long range entangled states, if the locality graph contains at least two overlapping cycles. This implies, for instance, that on 2$d$ lattices there exist states that are of low depth from the fermionic point of view, while in any encoding require a circuit of depth at least proportional to the system size to be prepared.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Quantum Secure Function Evaluation Reductions</title>

Abstract: One-sided output secure function evaluation is a cryptographic primitive where the two mutually distrustful players, Alice and Bob, both have a private input to a bivariate function. Bob obtains the value of the function for the given inputs, while Alice receives no output. It is known that this primitive cannot be securely implemented if the two players only have access to noiseless classical and quantum communication. In this work, we first show that Bob can extract the function values for all his possible inputs from any implementation of a non-trivial function that is correct and preserves the privacy of Bob's input. Our result holds in the non-asymptotic setting where the players have finite resources and the error is a constant. Then we consider protocols for secure function evaluation in a setup where the two players have access to trusted distributed randomness as a resource. Building upon the first result, we prove a bound on the efficiency of such cryptographic reductions for any non-trivial function in terms of the conditional entropies of the trusted randomness. From this result, we can derive lower bounds on the number of instances of different variants of OT needed to securely implement a given function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Levitated nanoparticles are a promising platform for sensing applications and for macroscopic quantum experiments. While the nanoparticles' motional temperatures can be reduced to near absolute zero, their uncontrolled internal degrees of freedom remain much hotter, inevitably leading to the emission of heat radiation. The decoherence and motional heating caused by this thermal emission process is still poorly understood beyond the case of the center-of-mass motion of point particles. Here, we present the master equation describing the impact of heat radiation on the motional quantum state of arbitrarily sized and shaped dielectric rigid rotors. It predicts the localization of spatio-orientational superpositions only based on the bulk material properties and the particle geometry. A counter-intuitive and experimentally relevant implication of the presented theory is that orientational superpositions of optically isotropic bodies are not protected by their symmetry, even in the small-particle limit.</description>

      <title>Unifying Floquet theory of longitudinal and dispersive readout</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise a Floquet theory of longitudinal and dispersive readout in circuit QED. By studying qubits coupled to cavity photons and driven at the resonance frequency of the cavity $\omega_{\rm r}$, we establish a universal connection between the qubit AC Stark shift and the longitudinal and dispersive coupling to photons. We find that the longitudinal coupling $g_\parallel$ is controlled by the slope of the AC Stark shift as function of the driving strength $A_{\rm q}$, while the dispersive shift $\chi$ depends on its curvature. The two quantities become proportional to each other in the weak drive limit ($A_{\rm q}\rightarrow 0$). Our approach unifies the adiabatic limit ($\omega_{\rm r}\rightarrow 0$) -- where $g_\parallel$ is generated by the static spectrum curvature (or quantum capacitance) -- with the diabatic one, where the static spectrum plays no role. We derive analytical results supported by exact numerical simulations. We apply them to superconducting and spin-hybrid cQED systems, showcasing the flexibility of faster-than-dispersive longitudinal readout.</description>

      <title>Floquet Schrieffer-Wolff transform based on Sylvester equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08405v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Floquet Schrieffer Wolff transform (FSWT) to obtain effective Floquet Hamiltonians and micro-motion operators of periodically driven many-body systems for any non-resonant driving frequency. The FSWT perturbatively eliminates the oscillatory components in the driven Hamiltonian by solving operator-valued Sylvester equations with systematic approximations. It goes beyond various high-frequency expansion methods commonly used in Floquet theory, as we demonstrate with the example of the driven Fermi-Hubbard model. In the limit of high driving frequencies, the FSWT Hamiltonian reduces to the widely used Floquet-Magnus result. We anticipate this method will be useful for designing Rydberg multi-qubit gates, controlling correlated hopping in quantum simulations in optical lattices, and describing multi-orbital and long-range interacting systems driven in-gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in optical fibers poses a major challenge for maintaining the fidelity of quantum states for quantum communications. In this work, a comprehensive model linking the probability of quantum measurement errors (infidelity) to PMD is developed and validated by experimental measurements of differential group delay and quantum bit error rate (QBER). Our research proposes effective methods to mitigate PMD effects for broadband entangled photons and evaluates the impact of higher-order PMD effects. The model provides an experimentally verified framework for the optimization of commercial quantum key distribution systems in deployed fiber optic lines.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the workflow for converting qubit circuits represented by Open Quantum ASseMbly format (OpenQASM, also known as QASM) into the qudit form for execution on qudit hardware and provide a method for translating qudit experiment results back into qubit results. We present the comparison of several qudit transpilation regimes, which differ in decomposition of multicontrolled gates: "qubit" as ordinary qubit transpilation and execution, "qutrit" with $d{=}3$ levels and single qubit in qudit and "ququart" with $d{=}4$ levels and 2 qubits per ququart. We provide several examples of transpiling circuits, which demonstrate potential advantages of qudits.</description>

      <title>Quasi-quantum states and the quasi-quantum PCP theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce $k$-local quasi-quantum states: a superset of the regular quantum states, defined by relaxing the positivity constraint. We show that a $k$-local quasi-quantum state on $n$ qubits can be 1-1 mapped to a distribution of assignments over $n$ variables with an alphabet of size $4$, which is subject to non-linear constraints over its $k$-local marginals. Therefore, solving the $k$-local Hamiltonian over the quasi-quantum states is equivalent to optimizing a distribution of assignment over a classical $k$-local CSP. We show that this optimization problem is essentially classical by proving it is NP-complete. Crucially, just as ordinary quantum states, these distributions lack a simple tensor-product structure and are therefore not determined straightforwardly by their local marginals. Consequently, our classical optimization problem shares some unique aspects of Hamiltonian complexity: it lacks an easy search-to-decision reduction, and it is not clear that its 1D version can be solved with dynamical programming (i.e., it could remain NP-hard).
  Our main result is a PCP theorem for the $k$-local Hamiltonian over the quasi-quantum states in the form of a hardness-of-approximation result. The proof suggests the existence of a subtle promise-gap amplification procedure in a model that shares many similarities with the quantum local Hamiltonian problem, thereby providing insights on the quantum PCP conjecture.</description>

      <title>Does the oscillatory behavior of the Momentum Spectrum depend on the basis in the Post-Transient Stage?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pair creation by a spatially homogeneous, time-dependent electric field is studied within the framework of scalar quantum electrodynamics. We employ the standard Bogoliubov transformation approach to compute the single-particle distribution function in an adiabatic basis. We analyzed the distribution function of created particles in two different adiabatic bases (related by a unitary transformation). A novel dynamical scaling is observed while analyzing the oscillatory momentum spectrum of the pairs created by the Sauter pulsed field at intermediate times, calculated using the two adiabatic bases. In these bases, the same oscillatory momentum spectra are observed but at different times. However, when we scale the time by the point marking the end of the transient stage of dynamical evolution for each case of central momentum, the respective momentum spectra overlap. Furthermore, we study the time evolution of the momentum spectrum in the multi-photon regime and find that the spectra show a multi-modal profile structure at finite times for both choices of basis.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimates of trace distance between bosonic Gaussian states and applications to learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian states of bosonic quantum systems enjoy numerous technological applications and are ubiquitous in nature. Their significance lies in their simplicity, which in turn rests on the fact that they are uniquely determined by two experimentally accessible quantities, their first and second moments. But what if these moments are only known approximately, as is inevitable in any realistic experiment? What is the resulting error on the Gaussian state itself, as measured by the most operationally meaningful metric for distinguishing quantum states, namely, the trace distance? In this work, we fully resolve this question by demonstrating that if the first and second moments are known up to an error $\varepsilon$, the trace distance error on the state also scales as $\varepsilon$, and this functional dependence is optimal. To prove this, we establish tight bounds on the trace distance between two Gaussian states in terms of the norm distance of their first and second moments. As an application, we improve existing bounds on the sample complexity of tomography of Gaussian states.</description>

Abstract: Time-dependent terms in Hamiltonians and equations of motion are rather important for a quantum-mechanical description of particles with arbitrary spins in nonstationary fields. We use the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation which allows one to obtain the Schr\"{o}dinger picture of relativistic quantum mechanics. We determine exact nonexponential and exponential operators of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation for arbitrary-spin particles in the nonstationary case.</description>

      <title>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

Abstract: In this letter we propose a new interpretation of the Casimir effect. Concretely, we show that the Casimir energy can be written as the quantum ``Von Neumann'' entropy associated to a 2-qubit, mixed pseudo-density matrix of the relevant quantum fluctuations. The quantum entropy we introduce draws parallels to the concept of quantum inseparability found in quantum information theory. Our results suggest that the Casimir energy is a measure of the quantum entropy of the vacuum fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Influence of coordinate noncommutativity on 2D quantum oscillatory motion, which undergoes parameter variations, is investigated. We first derive quantum solutions of the system described with time-independent parameters considering the noncommutativity of coordinates as a preliminary step. And then, we extend our study, framed with noncommutative phase-space formalism, to obtain relevant solutions of the system with time-dependent parameters. This system, which we focus on, is nonstationary due to variation of parameters in time. While the left and right circular annihilation and creation operators are utilized in the quantal management of the basic stationary system, the Schr\"odinger equation of the nonstationary system is solved using the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory and the invariant-related unitary transformation procedure. The outcome of our analysis is useful in understanding the effects of noncommutativity from quantum perspectives, especially in conjunction with the impact of parameter variations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximating the ground state of many-body systems is a key computational bottleneck underlying important applications in physics and chemistry. It has long been viewed as a promising application for quantum computers. The most widely known quantum algorithm for ground state approximation, quantum phase estimation, is out of reach of current quantum processors due to its high circuit-depths. Quantum diagonalization algorithms based on subspaces represent alternatives to phase estimation, which are feasible for pre-fault-tolerant and early-fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we introduce a quantum diagonalization algorithm which combines two key ideas on quantum subspaces: a classical diagonalization based on quantum samples, and subspaces constructed with quantum Krylov states. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time under the working assumptions of Krylov quantum diagonalization and sparseness of the ground state. We then show numerical investigations of lattice Hamiltonians, which indicate that our method can outperform existing Krylov quantum diagonalization in the presence of shot noise, making our approach well-suited for near-term quantum devices. Finally, we carry out the largest ground-state quantum simulation of the single-impurity Anderson model on a system with $41$ bath sites, using $85$ qubits and up to $6 \cdot 10^3$ two-qubit gates on a Heron quantum processor, showing excellent agreement with density matrix renormalization group calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sunny is a Julia package designed to serve the needs of the quantum magnetism community. It supports the specification of a very broad class of spin models and a diverse suite of numerical solvers. These include powerful methods for simulating spin dynamics both in and out of equilibrium. Uniquely, it features a broad generalization of classical and semiclassical approaches to SU(N) coherent states, which is useful for studying systems exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling or local entanglement effects. Sunny also offers a well-developed framework for calculating the dynamical spin structure factor, enabling direct comparison with scattering experiments. Ease of use is a priority, with tools for symmetry-guided modeling and interactive visualization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimal control of switching on a coupling term between two quantum many-body systems. Specifically, we (i) quantify the energetic cost of establishing a weak junction between two quantum spin-$1/2$ chains in finite time $\tau$ and (ii) identify the energetically optimal protocol to realize it. For linear driving protocols, we find that for long times the excess (irreversible) work scales as $\tau^{-\eta}$, where $\eta=1, 2$ or a nonuniversal number depending on the phase of the chains. Interestingly, increasing a $J_z$ anisotropy in the chains suppresses the excess work thus promoting quasi-adiabaticity. The general optimal control problem is solved, employing a Chebyshev ansatz. We find that the optimal control protocol is intimately sensitive to the chain phases.</description>

      <title>An NV- center in magnesium oxide as a spin qubit for hybrid quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent predictions suggest that oxides, such as MgO and CaO, could serve as hosts of spin defects with long coherence times and thus be promising materials for quantum applications. However, in most cases specific defects have not yet been identified. Here, by using a high-throughput first-principles framework and advanced electronic structure methods, we identify a negatively-charged complex between a nitrogen interstitial and a magnesium vacancy in MgO with favorable electronic and optical properties for hybrid quantum technologies. We show that this NV- center has stable triplet ground and excited states, with singlet shelving states enabling optical initialization and spin-dependent readout. We predict several properties, including absorption, emission, and zero-phonon line energies, as well as zero-field splitting tensor, and hyperfine interaction parameters, which can aid in the experimental identification of this defect. Our calculations show that due to a strong pseudo-Jahn Teller effect and low frequency phonon modes, the NV- center in MgO is subject to a substantial vibronic coupling. We discuss design strategies to reduce such coupling and increase the Debye-Waller factor, including the effect of strain and the localization of the defect states. We propose that the favorable properties of the NV- defect, along with the technological maturity of MgO, could enable hybrid classical-quantum applications, such as spintronic quantum sensors and single qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only 2. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.</description>

      <title>A note on the deformation of 1D ferromagnetic domain walls due to double exchange interaction with a free electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the thermodynamic potential and conductance of a Bloch or N\'eel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron gas via a double exchange interaction. The minimization of the elastic magnetic energy plus electronic thermodynamic potential indicates that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is generally deformed to a thin wall, while for magnetic interaction larger than the chemical potential tends towards wide walls. In contrast, for a double wall configuration the deformation is always towards wide walls. For the single as well as the double magnetic wall configurations the conductance monotonically decreases with decreasing wall width. The thermodynamic potential and conductance of Bloch and N\'eel magnetic domain walls are identical within this prototype model.</description>

      <title>Divergence Inequalities with Applications in Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The data processing inequality is central to information theory and motivates the study of monotonic divergences. However, it is not clear operationally we need to consider all such divergences. We establish a simple method for Pinsker inequalities as well as general bounds in terms of $\chi^{2}$-divergences for twice-differentiable $f$-divergences. These tools imply new relations for input-dependent contraction coefficients. We use these relations to show for many $f$-divergences the rate of contraction of a time homogeneous Markov chain is characterized by the input-dependent contraction coefficient of the $\chi^{2}$-divergence. This is efficient to compute and the fastest it could converge for a class of divergences. We show similar ideas hold for mixing times. Moreover, we extend these results to the Petz $f$-divergences in quantum information theory, albeit without any guarantee of efficient computation. These tools may have applications in other settings where iterative data processing is relevant.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein distances and divergences of order $p$ by quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non-quadratic generalization of the quantum mechanical optimal transport problem introduced in [De Palma and Trevisan, Ann. Henri Poincar\'e, {\bf 22} (2021), 3199-3234] where quantum channels realize the transport. Relying on this general machinery, we introduce $p$-Wasserstein distances and divergences and study their fundamental geometric properties. Finally, we prove triangle inequality for quadratic Wasserstein divergences under the sole assumption that an arbitrary one of the states involved is pure, which is a generalization of our previous result in this direction.</description>

      <title>A quantum algorithm for Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Khovanov homology is a topological knot invariant that categorifies the Jones polynomial, recognizes the unknot, and is conjectured to appear as an observable in $4D$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory. Despite its rich mathematical and physical significance, the computational complexity of Khovanov homology remains largely unknown. To address this challenge, this work initiates the study of efficient quantum algorithms for Khovanov homology.
  We provide simple proofs that increasingly accurate additive approximations to the ranks of Khovanov homology are DQC1-hard, BQP-hard, and #P-hard, respectively. For the first two approximation regimes, we propose a novel quantum algorithm. Our algorithm is efficient provided the corresponding Hodge Laplacian thermalizes in polynomial time and has a sufficiently large spectral gap, for which we give numerical and analytical evidence.
  Our approach introduces a pre-thermalization procedure that allows our quantum algorithm to succeed even if the Betti numbers of Khovanov homology are much smaller than the dimensions of the corresponding chain spaces, overcoming a limitation of prior quantum homology algorithms. We introduce novel connections between Khovanov homology and graph theory to derive analytic lower bounds on the spectral gap.</description>
