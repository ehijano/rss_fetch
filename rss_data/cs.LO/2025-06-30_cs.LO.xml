      <title>On the role of connectivity in Linear Logic proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a property that extends the Danos-Regnier correctness criterion for linear logic proof-structures. The property applies to the correctness graphs of a proof-structure: it states that any such graph is acyclic and that the number of its connected components is exactly one more than the number of nodes bottom or weakening. This is known to be necessary but not sufficient in multiplicative exponential linear logic (MELL) to recover a sequent calculus proof from a proof-structure. We present a geometric condition on untyped proof-structures allowing us to turn this necessary property into a sufficient one: we can thus isolate several fragments of MELL for which this property is indeed a correctness criterion. We also recover as by-product some known results.</description>

      <title>Negated String Containment is Decidable (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a positive answer to a long-standing open question of the decidability of the not-contains string predicate. Not-contains is practically relevant, for instance in symbolic execution of string manipulating programs. Particularly, we show that the predicate notContains(x1 ... xn, y1 ... ym), where x1 ... xn and y1 ... ym are sequences of string variables constrained by regular languages, is decidable. Decidability of a not-contains predicate combined with chain-free word equations and regular membership constraints follows.</description>

      <title>Wait-Only Broadcast Protocols are Easier to Verify</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study networks of processes that all execute the same finite-state protocol and communicate via broadcasts. We are interested in two problems with a parameterized number of processes: the synchronization problem which asks whether there is an execution which puts all processes on a given state; and the repeated coverability problem which asks if there is an infinite execution where a given transition is taken infinitely often. Since both problems are undecidable in the general case, we investigate those problems when the protocol is Wait-Only, i.e., it has no state from which a process can both broadcast and receive messages. We establish that the synchronization problem becomes Ackermann-complete, and the repeated coverability problem is in EXPSPACE, and PSPACE-hard.</description>

      <title>Scott's Representation Theorem and the Univalent Karoubi Envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lambek and Scott constructed a correspondence between simply-typed lambda calculi and Cartesian closed categories. Scott's Representation Theorem is a cousin to this result for untyped lambda calculi. It states that every untyped lambda calculus arises from a reflexive object in some category. We present a formalization of Scott's Representation Theorem in univalent foundations, in the (Rocq-)UniMath library. Specifically, we implement two proofs of that theorem, one by Scott and one by Hyland. We also explain the role of the Karoubi envelope -- a categorical construction -- in the proofs and the impact the chosen foundation has on this construction. Finally, we report on some automation we have implemented for the reduction of $\lambda$-terms.</description>

      <title>Computation by infinite descent made explicit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a non-wellfounded proof system for intuitionistic logic extended with ordinary inductive and co-inductive definitions, based on a syntax in which fixpoint formulas are annotated with explicit variables for ordinals. We explore the computational content of this system, in particular we introduce a notion of computability and show that every valid proof is computable. As a consequence, we obtain a normalization result for proofs of what we call finitary formulas. A special case of this result is that every proof of a sequent of the appropriate form represents a unique function on natural numbers. Finally, we derive a categorical model from the proof system and show that least and greatest fixpoint formulas correspond to initial algebras and final coalgebras respectively.</description>

      <title>Nets-within-Nets through the Lens of Data Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elementary Object Systems (EOSs) are a model in the nets-within-nets (NWNs) paradigm, where tokens in turn can host standard Petri nets. We study the complexity of the reachability problem of EOSs when subjected to non-deterministic token losses. It is known that this problem is equivalent to the coverability problem with no lossiness of conservative EOSs (cEOSs). We precisely characterize cEOS coverability into the framework of data nets, whose tokens carry data from an infinite domain. Specifically, we show that cEOS coverability is equivalent to the coverability of an interesting fragment of data nets that extends beyond $\nu$PNs (featuring globally fresh name creation), yet remains less expressive than Unordered Data Nets (featuring lossy name creation as well as powerful forms of whole-place operations and broadcasts). This insight bridges two apparently orthogonal approaches to PN extensions, namely data nets and NWNs. At the same time, it enables us to analyze cEOS coverability taking advantage of known results on data nets. As a byproduct, we immediately get that the complexity of cEOS coverability lies between $\mathbf{F}_{\omega 2}$ and $\mathbf{F}_{\omega^\omega}$, two classes beyond Primitive Recursive.</description>

      <title>Quantitative and Approximate Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.08353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In runtime verification, a monitor watches a trace of a system and, if possible, decides after observing each finite prefix whether or not the unknown infinite trace satisfies a given specification. We generalize the theory of runtime verification to monitors that attempt to estimate numerical values of quantitative trace properties (instead of attempting to conclude boolean values of trace specifications), such as maximal or average response time along a trace. Quantitative monitors are approximate: with every finite prefix, they can improve their estimate of the infinite trace's unknown property value. Consequently, quantitative monitors can be compared with regard to a precision-cost trade-off: better approximations of the property value require more monitor resources, such as states (in the case of finite-state monitors) or registers, and additional resources yield better approximations. We introduce a formal framework for quantitative and approximate monitoring, show how it conservatively generalizes the classical boolean setting for monitoring, and give several precision-cost trade-offs for monitors. For example, we prove that there are quantitative properties for which every additional register improves monitoring precision.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Monoidal Algebra: Axiomatising Distance with String Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String diagrammatic calculi have become increasingly popular in fields such as quantum theory, circuit theory, probabilistic programming, and machine learning, where they enable resource-sensitive and compositional algebraic analysis. Traditionally, the equations of diagrammatic calculi only axiomatise exact semantic equality. However, reasoning in these domains often involves approximations rather than strict equivalences. In this work, we develop a quantitative framework for diagrammatic calculi, where one may axiomatise notions of distance between string diagrams. Unlike similar approaches, such as the quantitative theories introduced by Mardare et al., this requires us to work in a monoidal rather than a cartesian setting. We define a suitable notion of monoidal theory, the syntactic category it freely generates, and its models, where the concept of distance is established via enrichment over a quantale. To illustrate the framework, we provide examples from probabilistic and linear systems analysis.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism Theorems between Models of Mixed Choice (Revised)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We relate the so-called powercone models of mixed non-deterministic and probabilistic choice proposed by Tix, Keimel, Plotkin, Mislove, Ouaknine, Worrell, Morgan, and McIver, to our own models of previsions. Under suitable topological assumptions, we show that they are isomorphic. We rely on Keimel's cone-theoretic variants of the classical Hahn-Banach separation theorems, using functional analytic methods, and on the Schr\"oder-Simpson Theorem. Lemma 3.4 in the original 2017 version, published at MSCS, had a wrong proof, and we prove a repaired, albeit slightly less general version here.</description>

      <title>Localized RETE for Incremental Graph Queries with Nested Graph Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing size of graph-based modeling artifacts in model-driven engineering calls for techniques that enable efficient execution of graph queries. Incremental approaches based on the RETE algorithm provide an adequate solution in many scenarios, but are generally designed to search for query results over the entire graph. However, in certain situations, a user may only be interested in query results for a subgraph, for instance when a developer is working on a large model of which only a part is loaded into their workspace. In this case, the global execution semantics can result in significant computational overhead.
  To mitigate the outlined shortcoming, in this article we propose an extension of the RETE approach that enables local, yet fully incremental execution of graph queries, while still guaranteeing completeness of results with respect to the relevant subgraph.
  We empirically evaluate the presented approach via experiments inspired by a scenario from software development and with queries and data from an independent social network benchmark. The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique can significantly improve performance regarding memory consumption and execution time in favorable cases, but may incur a noticeable overhead in unfavorable cases.</description>

Abstract: The Pathwidth Theorem states that if a class of graphs has unbounded pathwidth, then it contains all trees as graph minors. We prove a similar result for dense graphs: if a class of graphs has unbounded linear cliquewidth, then it can produce all trees via some fixed CMSO transduction.</description>

      <title>RLSF: Fine-tuning LLMs via Symbolic Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed AI but often struggle with tasks that require domain-specific reasoning and logical alignment. Traditional fine-tuning methods do not leverage the vast amount of symbolic domain-knowledge available to us via symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., provers), and are further limited by sparse rewards and unreliable reward models.
  We introduce Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF), a novel fine-tuning paradigm where symbolic reasoning tools (e.g., solvers, provers, and algebra systems) provide fine-grained feedback to LLMs. RLSF uses poly-sized certificates (e.g., proofs) generated by symbolic tools to identify and correct errors in model outputs, offering token-level guidance without requiring differentiable reasoning systems. This paradigm bridges the gap between symbolic reasoning and LLM fine-tuning, enabling precise alignment with domain-specific constraints while addressing key limitations of traditional reward signals.
  Via extensive evaluations, we show that our RLSF-based fine-tuning of LLMs outperforms traditional approaches on five different applications (that have some associated logical or domain constraints), namely, program synthesis from natural language pseudo-code to programming language, three chemistry tasks, and solving the Game of 24. A key takeaway is that fine-tuning via RLSF enables relatively smaller LLMs to significantly outperform closed-source models that are orders of magnitude larger.</description>
