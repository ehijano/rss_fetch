      <title>SKA-ESO Synergies for the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping out the first billion years using the 21-cm line with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will revolutionize our understanding of the cosmic dawn, reionization and the galaxies that drove these milestones. However, synergies with other telescopes in the form of cross correlations will be fundamental in making and confirming initial, low signal-to-noise claims of a detection. Participants of the 2023 European Southern Observatory (ESO) - SKA Observatory workshop discussed such synergies for Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD) science. Here we highlight some of the most promising candidates for cross-correlating SKA EoR/CD observations with ESO instruments such as the Multi-Object Optical and Near-infrared Spectrograph (MOONS), the MOSAIC multi-object spectrograph, and the ArmazoNes high Dispersion Echelle Spectrograph (ANDES).</description>

      <title>Cosmology with second and third-order shear statistics for the Dark Energy Survey: Methods and simulated analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new pipeline designed for the robust inference of cosmological parameters using both second- and third-order shear statistics. We build a theoretical model for rapid evaluation of three-point correlations using our fastnc code and integrate it into the CosmoSIS framework. We measure the two-point functions $\xi_{\pm}$ and the full configuration-dependent three-point shear correlation functions across all auto- and cross-redshift bins. We compress the three-point functions into the mass aperture statistic $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ for a set of 796 simulated shear maps designed to model the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data. We estimate from it the full covariance matrix and model the effects of intrinsic alignments, shear calibration biases and photometric redshift uncertainties. We apply scale cuts to minimize the contamination from the baryonic signal as modeled through hydrodynamical simulations. We find a significant improvement of $83\%$ on the Figure of Merit in the $\Omega_{\rm m}$-$S_8$ plane when we add the $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ data to the $\xi_{\pm}$ information. We present our findings for all relevant cosmological and systematic uncertainty parameters and discuss the complementarity of third-order and second-order statistics.</description>

      <title>Kernel dependence of the Gaussian Process reconstruction of late Universe expansion history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss model-independent reconstruction of the expansion history of the late Universe. We use Gaussian Process Regression to reconstruct the evolution of various cosmological parameters such as H(z) and slow-roll parameter using observational data to train the GP model. We look at the GP reconstruction of these parameters using stationary and non-stationary kernel functions. We examine the effect of the choice of kernel functions on the reconstructions. We find that non-stationary kernels such as polynomial kernels might be a better choice for the reconstruction if the training data set is noisy (such as H(z) data) as it helps to avoid fitting the error in the data. We also look at the kernel dependence of other cosmological parameters such as the redshift of transition to the accelerated expansion. This has been achieved by reconstructing the derivatives of the expansion history (H(z)) such as the deceleration parameter/slow-roll parameter.</description>

      <title>Preference for evolving dark energy in light of the galaxy bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse pre-DESI clustering data using a dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ parametrised by $(w_0, w_a)$, finding a $2.8-3.9\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy over the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ when combined with cosmic microwave background data from Planck and supernova data from Pantheon+, Union3, or DESY5. Our constraints, consistent with DESI Y1 results, are derived from the power spectrum and bispectrum of SDSS/BOSS galaxies using the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) at one loop. The evidence remains robust across analysis variations but disappears without the one-loop bispectrum. When combining DESI baryon acoustic oscillations with BOSS full-shape data, while marginalising over the sound horizon in the latter to prevent unaccounted correlations, the significance increases to $3.7-4.4\sigma$, depending on the supernova dataset. Using a data-driven reconstruction of $w(z)$, we show that the evidence arises from deviations from $\Lambda$ at multiple redshifts. In addition, our findings are interpreted within the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFTofDE), from which we explicitly track the non-standard time evolution in EFTofLSS predictions. For perturbatively stable theories in the $w &lt; -1$ regime, the evidence persists in the clustering limit $(c_s^2 \rightarrow 0)$ when higher-derivative corrections are present, as well as in the quasi-static limit $(c_s^2 \rightarrow 1)$ when additional EFTofDE parameters are considered.</description>

      <title>Abundance and properties of dark radiation from the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmological signatures of new light relics that are collisionless like standard neutrinos or are strongly interacting. We provide a simple and succinct rephrasing of their physical effects in the cosmic microwave background, as well as the resulting parameter degeneracies with other cosmological parameters, in terms of the total radiation abundance and the fraction thereof that freely streams. In these more general terms, interacting and noninteracting light relics are differentiated by their respective decrease and increase of the free-streaming fraction, and, moreover, the scale-dependent interplay thereof with a common, correlated reduction of the fraction of matter in baryons. We then derive updated constraints on various dark-radiation scenarios with the latest cosmological observations, employing this language to identify the physical origin of the impact of each dataset. The "PR4" reanalyses of Planck CMB data prefer a larger primordial helium yield and therefore also slightly more radiation than the 2018 analysis, whose origin we identify in a number of poorly fit polarization measurements. Smaller free-streaming fractions are disfavored by the excess lensing of the CMB measured in lensing reconstruction data from Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. On the other hand, baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument drive marginal detections of new, strongly interacting light relics due to that data's preference for lower matter fractions. Finally, we forecast measurements from the CMB-S4 experiment.</description>

      <title>One Extension to Explain Them All, One Parameter to Minimize $\chi^2$, One Framework to Bring Them All, and in One Model Bind Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing precision of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations has unveiled significant tensions between different datasets, notably between Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), as well as with the late-Universe measurements of the Hubble constant. In this work, we explore a variety of $\Lambda$CDM extensions to assess their ability to reconcile these discrepancies. The statistical preference for these extensions remains moderate, and imposing $n_s=1$ often worsens model performance. Our findings highlight the limitations of incremental modifications to $\Lambda$CDM and suggest that either more complex new physics or, more likely, improved systematic understanding in the CMB sector may be required to fully address the observed tensions. While CMB experiments are often considered the gold standard of precision cosmology, our results reinforce that these measurements are not immune to systematic uncertainties, which may be underestimated in current analyses.</description>

      <title>Improving Cosmic Birefringence Constraints via Delensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study on using delensing to enhance cosmic birefringence measurements based on full-sky, map-based simulations. In our analysis, we neglect foreground contamination and instrumental systematics to isolate the intrinsic impact of delensing on both isotropic and anisotropic birefringence. For the isotropic case, assuming a constant rotation angle of $\beta = 0.35^\circ$, delensing reduces the lensing-induced variance in the EB power spectrum, yielding an improvement in sensitivity of approximately 10% at 6 $\mu$K-arcmin noise and 25-40% at lower noise levels. For the anisotropic case, using simulations at 1 $\mu$K-arcmin noise, we reconstruct the birefringence angle for a scale-invariant spectrum and mitigate lensing bias by delensing, achieving a 50% reduction in the leading $N_{(0)}$ bias and a 30% improvement in the constraints on the amplitude $A_{CB}$. Our results demonstrate that delensing is an effective tool for enhancing the detectability of subtle parity-violating signals in the cosmic microwave background with forthcoming experiments such as the Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and LiteBIRD.</description>

      <title>Evolution of a kink-antikink ensemble in a quantum vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $1+1$ flat spacetime dynamics of a classical field configuration corresponding to an ensemble of sine-Gordon kinks and antikinks, semi-classically coupled to a quantum field. This coupling breaks the integrability of the sine-Gordon model resulting in the background's decay into quantum radiation as kink-antikink pairs annihilate. We find evidence that, on average, the energy of the ensemble scales as $t^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha&lt;1$ and independent of the coupling strength or the mass of the quantum field. The generalization of this result to domain wall networks in higher spacetime dimensions could be relevant to particle production in the early universe.</description>

      <title>EDGE: The emergence of dwarf galaxy scaling relations from cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new suite of EDGE (`Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy formation's Edge') cosmological zoom simulations. The suite includes 15 radiation-hydrodynamical dwarf galaxies covering the ultra-faint to the dwarf irregular regime ($10^4 \leq M_{\star}(z=0) \leq 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$) to enable comparisons with observed scaling relations. Each object in the suite is evolved at high resolution ($\approx 3 \, \text{pc}$) and includes stellar radiation, winds and supernova feedback channels. We compare with previous EDGE simulations without radiation, finding that radiative feedback results in significantly weaker galactic outflows. This generalises our previous findings to a wide mass range, and reveals that the effect is most significant at low $M_{\star}$. Despite this difference, stellar masses stay within a factor of two of each other, and key scaling relations of dwarf galaxies (size-mass, neutral gas-stellar mass, gas-phase mass-metallicity) emerge correctly in both simulation suites. Only the stellar mass -- stellar metallicity relation is strongly sensitive to the change in feedback. This highlights how obtaining statistical samples of dwarf galaxy stellar abundances with next-generation spectrographs will be key to probing and constraining the baryon cycle of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>WIMPs and new physics interpretations of the PTA signal are incompatible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to explain the large amplitude of the nano-Hertz stochastic gravitational wave background observed in pulsar timing arrays (PTA), primordial sources must be particularly energetic. This is correlated to the generation of large density fluctuations, later collapsing into ultra-compact mini-halo (UCMHs). We demonstrate that if dark matter is made of WIMPs, then photon and neutrino fluxes from UCMHs produced by curvature peaks, first-order phase transition and domain wall interpretations of the PTA signal, exceed current bounds.</description>

      <title>A Detection of Circumgalactic Dust at Megaparsec Scales with Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the more surprising astrophysical discoveries of the last decade has been the presence of enormous quantities of dust at megaparsec distances from galaxies, which has important implications for galaxy evolution, the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium, and observational cosmology. In this work, we present a novel method for studying these vast halos of circumgalactic dust: a maximum-likelihood estimator for dust-induced extinction of background galaxies. This estimator can accommodate a broad range of archival photometric data and can incorporate different dust reddening prescriptions, making it applicable to diverse galaxy types and redshifts. We apply the estimator to the redMaGiC catalog of luminous red galaxies, selected for their tight dispersion in color and well-constrained photometric redshifts, and measure the resulting extinction as a function of projected distance from WISExSuperCOSMOS and redMaGiC foreground galaxies. We detect significant dust-induced extinction profiles extending to at least 1 megaparsec from galactic disks, with noticeable differences between star-forming and quiescent galaxies: star-forming galaxies exhibit a pronounced rise in extinction within the inner 50 kiloparsecs and a steep decline beyond 1 megaparsec, while the quiescent galaxies host little dust in the inner halo but have detectable extinction out to 30 megaparsecs. We test the robustness of our results using star catalogs and inverted foreground and background samples and find no evidence for significant systematic error. Our approach provides a powerful tool for studying the interplay between circumgalactic dust, galaxy evolution, and large-scale structure, with potential applications in a number of astrophysical subfields.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Photon Tridents Through Primordial Black Hole Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gamma-ray signals from primordial black holes (PBHs) could provide compelling evidence for their role as a dark matter candidate, particularly through the observation of their Hawking radiation. Future gamma-ray observatories, such as e-ASTROGAM, and the next-generation telescopes, are poised to explore this possibility by measuring both Standard Model (SM) and beyond-the-SM particle emissions. A particularly promising avenue involves production of dark photons by PBHs, which is a hypothetical particle that decays into photons. In this work, we investigate the trident decay of dark photons focusing on their primary emission from PBHs. We assume that the dark photons produced via Hawking radiation decay into photons well before reaching Earth, thereby enhancing the detectable gamma-ray flux. The energy spectrum of the photons decaying from the dark photons is distinct from that of direct Hawking-radiated photons due to higher degree of freedom, leading to observable modifications in the gamma-ray signal. Using the asteroid-mass PBHs as a case study, we demonstrate that future gamma-ray missions could detect dark-photon signatures and distinguish them from conventional Hawking radiation. This approach enables the exploration of previously inaccessible parameter spaces in dark photon mass $m_{A^{\prime}}$ and their coupling to photons, offering a novel pathway to uncover the properties of dark sectors and the nature of PBHs.</description>

Abstract: The recent observation of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A by the KM3NeT experiment offers a compelling avenue to explore physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we explore a simplest possibility that this event originates from the decay of a super-heavy dark matter (SHDM). We consider a minimal extension of the type-I seesaw by including a singlet scalar and a singlet fermion DM, both being odd under a $Z_2$ symmetry. At high scale, the $Z_2$ symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vev of the $Z_2$ odd scalar, leading to i) mixing between DM and heavy right-handed neutrinos and ii) formation of domain walls (DW). In the former case, the decay of the DM to $\nu,h$ can give rise to the PeV neutrino event KM3-230213A. While, in the latter case, the disappearance of the DW can give rise to stochastic gravitational waves. We derive constraints on the DM lifetime as a function of DM mass ensuring consistency with IceCube, Auger upper limits and the observed KM3-230213A event. We found that KM3-230213A gives stringent constraint on DM mass ranging from $1.7\times10^8$ GeV to $5.5\times10^9$ GeV with lifetime $6.3\times10^{29}$ s to $3.6\times10^{29}$ s.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the sensitivity to ultralight bosonic dark matter using signal correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, numerous experiments have been proposed and conducted to search for ultralight bosonic dark matter (ULBDM). Signals from ULBDM in such experiments are characterized by extremely narrow spectral widths. A near-optimal detection strategy is to divide the data based on the signal coherence time and sum the power across these segments. However, the signal coherence time can extend beyond a day, making it challenging to construct contiguous segments of such a duration due to detector instabilities. In this work, we present a novel detection statistic that can coherently extract ULBDM signals from segments of arbitrary durations. Our detection statistic, which we refer to as coherent SNR, is a weighed sum of data correlations, whose weights are determined by the expected signal correlations. We demonstrate that coherent SNR achieves sensitivity independent of segment duration and surpasses the performance of the conventional incoherent-sum approach, through analytical arguments and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter-Electron Interactions in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider Dark Matter (DM) interactions, and study the same in the light of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) data. In particular, we focus on the DM-electron interactions. Assuming that such interactions are mediated by rather heavy mediators, we consider effective operators describing the relevant interaction terms in the lagrangian. The presence of such interaction terms lead to both DM annihilation and DM-electron scattering (drag). We focus on operators which lead to velocity-independent DM annihilation and DM-electron scattering cross-sections. Using the CMBR data, we study the the implications of both of these effects imposing constraints on the respective effective operators. This analysis underscores the importance of taking both scattering and annihilation processes into consideration in the study of DM interactions. We observe that the constraints on the DM annihilation and scattering cross-sections can change, up to about 14% and 13% respectively, for the benchmark scenarios we considered, depending on the mass of DM, as compared to the scenario where only DM annihilation is accounted for.</description>

      <title>Double Narrow-Line Signatures of Dark Matter Decay and New Constraints from XRISM Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the indirect detection search of the two-body decay of dark matter particles into final states containing a photon, a process predicted in various promising dark matter models such as axion-like particles and sterile neutrinos. Recent and near-future photon detectors with a resolution $
R \equiv \lambda/\Delta\lambda = O(1000) $ are primarily optimized for the velocity dispersion of dark matter in the Milky Way. When performing indirect detection of dark matter in objects other than the Milky Way, one should take into account the contribution from Milky Way dark matter. As a result, the dark matter signal observed by a detector is predicted to exhibit a two-peak structure in many targets, owing to the Doppler shift, differences in radial velocities and the good energy resolution. An analysis incorporating this two-peak effect was performed using the latest XRISM observation data of the Centaurus galaxy cluster~\cite{XRISM:2025axf}. Although, due to the relatively short observation time, our derived limit is weaker than some existing limits, among dark matter searches in galaxy clusters our limit is one of the most stringent (at least in certain mass ranges). We also perform the usual single-peak analysis, for considering the various scenarios, that prefer narrow-line photon from the faraway galaxy cluster. Future data releases from XRISM as well as other observatories will further strengthen our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Prospects for constraining interacting dark energy cosmology with gravitational-wave bright sirens detected by future SKA-era pulsar timing arrays</title>

Abstract: We explore the constraints on cosmological parameters in interacting dark energy (IDE) models described by energy transfer rates $Q = \beta H \rho_{\rm de}$ and $Q = \beta H \rho_{\rm c}$, using simulated gravitational-wave (GW) bright siren data from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. In particular, we simulate a future PTA observation in the FAST/SKA era with 20 millisecond pulsars (MSPs), each having 20\,ns white noise over a 10-year observation span, and demonstrate that this mock dataset significantly improves the constraint precision of key cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant $H_0$, matter density $\Omega_m$, and the coupling parameter $\beta$. For the IDE model $Q = \beta H \rho_{\rm de}$, PTA data alone provides tighter constraints on these parameters than the CMB data alone, primarily due to the high sensitivity of GW standard sirens in probing the late universe. Combining PTA and CMB data further enhances the constraints by 43.6\% for $H_0$, 43.2\% for $\Omega_m$, and 44.7\% for $\beta$, relative to using CMB data alone. In contrast, for $Q = \beta H \rho_{\rm c}$, the CMB data alone constrains $\beta$ more tightly than the PTA data, due to the stronger impact of this interaction in the early universe. Nevertheless, the PTA+\,CMB combination still yields improvements of 13.3\% for $H_0$, 22.7\% for $\Omega_m$, and 18.2\% for $\beta$. Increasing the number of MSPs in the PTA further tightens all parameter constraints in both IDE models. Our results highlight the great potential of future PTA observations for significantly improving cosmological parameter estimation in IDE models, offering critical insights into the nature of dark energy and its interaction with dark matter.</description>

      <title>Measuring the speed of gravity and the cosmic expansion with time delays between gravity and light from binary neutron stars</title>

Abstract: The first observation of a gravitational wave (GW) and a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) emitted by the same binary neutron star (BNS) merger officially opened the field of GW multimessenger astronomy. In this paper, we define and address $\textit{lagging sirens}$, a new class of multimessenger BNSs for which associated GWs and sGRBs are observed without the identification of their host galaxy. We propose a new methodology to use the observed time delay of these sources to constrain the speed of gravity that is, the propagation speed of gravitational waves, the Hubble constant and the prompt time delay distribution between GWs and sGRBs, even though a direct redshift estimation from the host galaxy is unavailable. Our method exploits the intrinsic relation between GWs and sGRBs observed and prompt time delays to obtain a statistical redshift measure for the cosmological sources. We show that this technique can be used to infer the Hubble constant at the $10\%$~level of precision with future-generation GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and only 100 observations of this kind. The novel procedure that we propose has systematics that differ completely from the ones of previous GW methods for cosmology. Additionally, we demonstrate for the first time that the speed of gravity and the distribution of the prompt time delays between GWs and sGRBs can be inferred conjointly with less than 10 sources even with current GW detector sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Optical galaxy cluster mock catalogs with realistic projection effects: Validations with the SDSS clusters</title>

Abstract: Galaxy clusters identified in optical imaging surveys suffer from projection effects: Physically unassociated galaxies along a cluster's line of sight can be counted as its members and boost the observed richness (the number of cluster members). To model the impact of projection on cluster cosmology analyses, we apply a halo occupation distribution model to N-body simulations to simulate the red galaxies contributing to cluster members, and we use the number of galaxies in a cylinder along the line of sight (counts in cylinders) to model the impact of projection on cluster richness. We compare three projection models: uniform, quadratic, and Gaussian, and we convert between them by matching their effective cylinder volumes. We validate our mock catalogs using SDSS redMaPPer clusters' data vectors, including counts vs. richness, stacked lensing signal, spectroscopic redshift distribution of member galaxies, and richness remeasured on a redshift grid. We find the former two are insensitive to the projection model, while the latter two favor a quadratic projection model with a width of approximately 180 Mpc/h (equivalent to the volume of a uniform model with a width of 100 Mpc/h and a Gaussian model with a width of 110 Mpc/h, or a Gaussian redshift error of 0.04). Our framework provides an efficient and flexible way to model optical cluster data vectors, paving the way for a simulation-based joint analysis for clusters, galaxies, and shear.</description>

      <title>A robust cosmic standard ruler from the cross-correlations of galaxies and dark sirens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of gravitational waves (GWs) from dark sirens allow us to infer their locations and distances. Galaxies, on the other hand, have precise angular positions but no direct measurement of their distances -- only redshifts. The cross-correlation of GWs, which we limit here to binary black hole mergers (BBH), in spherical shells of luminosity distance $D_L$, with galaxies in shells of redshift $z$, leads to a direct measurement of the Hubble diagram $D_L(z)$. Since this standard ruler relies only on the statistical proximity of the dark sirens and galaxies (a general property of large-scale structures), it is essentially model-independent: the correlation is maximal when both redshift and $D_L$ shells coincide. We forecast the constraining power of this technique, which we call {\it{Peak Sirens}}, for run 5 (O5) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK), as well as for the third-generation observatories Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We employ thousands of full-sky light cone simulations with realistic numbers for the tracers, and include masking by the Milky Way, lensing and inhomogeneous GW sky coverage. We find that the method is not expected to suffer from some of the issues present in other dark siren methods, such as biased constraints due to incompleteness of galaxy catalogs or dependence on priors for the merger rates of BBH. We show that with Peak Sirens, given the projected O5 sensitivity, LVK can measure $H_0$ with $7\%$ precision by itself, assuming $\Lambda$CDM, and $4\%$ precision using external datasets to constrain $\Omega_m$. We also show that future third-generation GW detectors can achieve, without external data, sub-percent uncertainties in $H_0$ assuming $\Lambda$CDM, and 3\% in a more flexible $w_0w_a$CDM model. The method also shows remarkable robustness against systematic effects such as the modeling of non-linear structure formation.</description>

      <title>Constraining the phase shift of relativistic species in DESI BAOs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the early Universe, neutrinos decouple quickly from the primordial plasma and propagate without further interactions. The impact of free-streaming neutrinos is to create a temporal shift in the gravitational potential that impacts the acoustic waves known as baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), resulting in a non-linear spatial shift in the Fourier-space BAO signal. In this work, we make use of and extend upon an existing methodology to measure the phase shift amplitude $\beta_{\phi}$ and apply it to the DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) BAOs with an anisotropic BAO fitting pipeline. We validate the fitting methodology by testing the pipeline with two publicly available fitting codes applied to highly precise cubic box simulations and realistic simulations representative of the DESI DR1 data. We find further study towards the methods used in fitting the BAO signal will be necessary to ensure accurate constraints on $\beta_{\phi}$ in future DESI data releases. Using DESI DR1, we present individual measurements of the anisotropic BAO distortion parameters and the $\beta_{\phi}$ for the different tracers, and additionally a combined fit to $\beta_{\phi}$ resulting in $\beta_{\phi} = 2.7 \pm 1.7$. After including a prior on the distortion parameters from constraints using \textit{Planck} we find $\beta_{\phi} = 2.7^{+0.60}_{-0.67} $ suggesting $\beta_{\phi} &gt; 0$ at 4.3$\sigma$ significance. This result may hint at a phase shift that is not purely sourced from the standard model expectation for $N_{\rm{eff}}$ or could be a upwards statistical fluctuation in the measured $\beta_{\phi}$; this result relaxes in models with additional freedom beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Revisiting holographic dark energy from the perspective of multi-messenger gravitational wave astronomy: future joint observations with short gamma-ray bursts</title>

Abstract: The advent of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors opens new opportunities for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star merger events, holding significant potential for probing the history of cosmic expansion. In this paper, we investigate the holographic dark energy (HDE) model by using the future GW standard siren data observed from the 3G GW detectors and the short $\gamma$-ray burst THESEUS-like detector joint observations. We find that GW data alone can achieve a relatively precise estimation of the Hubble constant, with precision of $0.2\%$-$0.6\%$, but its ability to constrain other cosmological parameters remains limited. Nonetheless, since the GW data can break parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB + BAO + SN (CBS), GW standard sirens play a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of parameter estimation. With the addition of GW data to CBS, the constraints on cosmological parameters $H_0$, $c$ and $\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ can be improved by $63\%$-$88\%$, $27\%$-$44\%$ and $55\%$-$70\%$. In summary, observations of GW standard sirens from 3G GW detectors could be pivotal in helping solve the Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the Cepheid-based distance ladder: implications for the Hubble constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$) is a key parameter in cosmology, yet its precise value remains contentious due to discrepancies between early- and late-universe measurement methods, a problem known as the "Hubble tension." In this study, we revisit the Cepheid-based distance ladder calibration, focusing on two potential sources of bias in the period-luminosity relation (PLR): (1) the assumed prior for the residual parallax offset of the Milky Way (MW) Cepheids and (2) systematic differences between Cepheid periods in anchor galaxies versus supernova host galaxies. To address the latter, we adopt two different strategies alongside a renewed MW Cepheid calibration. The first strategy involves resampling anchor and host Cepheids from a common distribution of periods. This approach provides a conservative estimate of $H_0 = (72.18 \pm 1.76) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, including the renewed MW analysis. The increased uncertainty reflects the reduced sample size -- about 700 Cepheids per resampling compared to 3200 in the original dataset. This method reduces the Hubble tension from $5.4 \, \sigma$ (as reported by the SH0ES collaboration with $H_0 = (73.17 \pm 0.86) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$) to $2.4 \, \sigma$. The second strategy allows the PLR slope to vary with the period, yielding $H_0 = (72.35 \pm 0.91) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, including the renewed MW analysis, and the tension reduced to $4.4 \, \sigma$. A statistical comparison of the model with the single-linear PLR shows a significant preference for the broken PLR (p-value $&lt; 0.001$). Both strategies consistently indicate a downward shift of approximately $-1 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ in $H_0$. Our findings underscore the importance of careful consideration of Cepheid population characteristics for precise $H_0$ calibrations.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological simulations of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) are computationally expensive, and the resulting halos lack flexibility in parameter adjustments, such as virial mass, density profile, and global velocity. Previous studies have introduced a method for constructing FDM halos with predefined density profiles. In this study, we investigate the initial global velocity of these constructed halos and find that it is nonzero. We provide the theoretical formula for this velocity and illustrate that it arises from the interference between states of odd and even parity. Our calculated results closely match simulation outcomes. Additionally, we showcase how to counteract this velocity and create a halo with a customizable initial global velocity. Our study presents a practical method for adjusting the initial global velocity of halos in controlled FDM simulations, facilitating investigations into tidal effects, galaxy collisions, and other scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The current generation of large galaxy surveys will test the cosmological model by combining multiple types of observational probes. Realising the statistical promise of these new datasets requires rigorous attention to all aspects of analysis including cosmological measurements, modelling, covariance and parameter likelihood. In this paper we present the results of an end-to-end simulation study designed to test the analysis pipeline for the combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1 galaxy redshift dataset and separate weak gravitational lensing information from the Kilo-Degree Survey, Dark Energy Survey and Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey. Our analysis employs the 3x2-pt correlation functions including cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing, together with the projected correlation function of the spectroscopic DESI lenses. We build realistic simulations of these datasets including galaxy halo occupation distributions, photometric redshift errors, weights, multiplicative shear calibration biases and magnification. We calculate the analytical covariance of these correlation functions including the Gaussian, noise and super-sample contributions, and show that our covariance determination agrees with estimates based on the ensemble of simulations. We use a Bayesian inference platform to demonstrate that we can recover the fiducial cosmological parameters of the simulation within the statistical error margin of the experiment, investigating the sensitivity to scale cuts. This study is the first in a sequence of papers in which we present and validate the large-scale 3x2-pt cosmological analysis of DESI-Y1.</description>

      <title>Lost in the FoG: Pitfalls of Models for Large-Scale Hydrogen Distributions</title>

Abstract: Large-scale HI surveys and their cross-correlations with galaxy distributions have immense potential as cosmological probes. Interpreting these measurements requires theoretical models that must incorporate redshift-space distortions (RSDs), such as the Kaiser and fingers-of-God (FoG) effect, and differences in the tracer and matter distributions via the tracer bias. These effects are commonly approximated with assumptions that should be tested on simulated distributions. In this work, we use the hydrodynamical simulation suite IllustrisTNG to assess the performance of models of $z \leq 1$ HI auto and HI-galaxy cross-power spectra, finding that the models employed by recent observations introduce errors comparable to or exceeding their measurement uncertainties. In particular, neglecting FoG causes $\gtrsim 10\%$ deviations between the modeled and simulated power spectra at $k \gtrsim 0.1$ $h$ / Mpc, larger than assuming a constant bias which reaches the same error threshold at slightly smaller scales. However, even without these assumptions, models can still err by $\sim 10\%$ on relevant scales. These remaining errors arise from multiple RSD damping sources on HI clustering, which are not sufficiently described with a single FoG term. Overall, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of RSDs to harness the capabilities of future measurements of HI distributions.</description>

      <title>The eventful life of a luminous galaxy at z = 14: metal enrichment, feedback, and low gas fraction?</title>

Abstract: JADES-GS-z14-0 is the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy yet, at $z&gt;14$. With a UV magnitude of -20.81, it is one of the most luminous galaxies at cosmic dawn and its half-light radius of 260 pc means that stars dominate the observed UV emission. We report ALMA detection of [OIII]88$\mu$m line emission with a significance of 6.67$\sigma$ and at a frequency of 223.524~GHz, corresponding to a redshift of $14.1796\pm0.0007$, which is consistent with the candidate CIII] line detected in the NIRSpec spectrum. At this spectroscopic redshift, the Lyman-$\alpha$ break identified with NIRSpec requires a damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber with a column density of $\log(N_{\rm HI}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2})=21.96$. The total [O\,{\sc iii}]88$\mu$m luminosity (log$(L_{\rm [OIII]}/L_\odot) = 8.3\pm 0.1$) is fully consistent with the local $L_{\rm [OIII]}-SFR$ relation and indicating a gas-phase metallicity $&gt;0.1~{\rm Z_{\rm \odot}}$. Using \texttt{prospector} SED modeling and combining the ALMA data with JWST observations, we find $Z=0.17~{\rm Z_{\rm \odot}}$ and a non-zero escape fraction of ionizing photons ($\sim11\%$), which is necessary by the code to reproduce the UV spectrum. We measure an ${\rm [O III]}5007$\r{A}/[O III]88$\mu$m line flux ratio between 1 and 20, resulting in an upper limit to the electron density of roughly 700 cm$^{-3}$ assuming a single-cloud photoionization model. The [OIIII]88$\mu$m emission line is spectrally resolved, with a FWHM of 100 km/s, resulting in a dynamical mass of log($M_{\rm dyn}/M_\odot$) = 9.0$\pm0.2$. When compared to the stellar mass, this value represents a conservative upper limit on the gas mass fraction, which ranges from 50\% to 80\%, depending on the assumed star formation history. Past radiation-driven outflows may have cleared the galaxy from the gas, reducing the gas fraction and thus increasing the escape fraction of ionizing photons.</description>

      <title>Simulating image coaddition with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope: III. Software improvements and new linear algebra strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will implement a devoted weak gravitational lensing program with its High Latitude Wide Area Survey. For cosmological purposes, a critical step in Roman image processing is to combine dithered undersampled images into unified oversampled images and thus enable high-precision shape measurements. IMCOM is an image coaddition algorithm which offers control over point spread functions in output images. This paper presents the refactored IMCOM software, featuring full object-oriented programming, improved data structures, and alternative linear algebra strategies for determining coaddition weights. Combining these improvements and other acceleration measures, to produce almost equivalent coadded images, the consumption of core-hours has been reduced by about an order of magnitude. We then re-coadd a $16 \times 16 \,{\rm arcmin}^2$ region of our previous image simulations with three linear algebra kernels in four bands, and compare the results in terms of IMCOM optimization goals, properties of coadded noise frames, and measurements of simulated stars. The Cholesky kernel is efficient and relatively accurate, yet its irregular windows for input pixels slightly bias coaddition results. The iterative kernel avoids this issue by tailoring input pixel selection for each output pixel; it yields better noise control, but can be limited by random errors due to finite tolerance. The empirical kernel coadds images using an empirical relation based on geometry; it is inaccurate, but being much faster, it provides a valid option for "quick look" purposes. We fine-tune IMCOM hyperparameters in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>The Maximal Gravitational Wave Signal from Asteroid-Mass Primordial Black Hole Mergers At Resonant Microwave Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes can be the entirety of the dark matter in a broad, approximately five-orders-of-magnitude-wide mass range, the ``asteroid mass range'', between $10^{-16}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- where constraints originate from evaporation -- and $10^{-11}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- from microlensing. A direct detection in this mass range is very challenging with any known observational or experimental methods. Here we update the calculation of the sight distance for narrow-band detectors such as resonant microwave cavities, and the resulting maximal event rate. We find that the largest detection rates are associated with binaries from non-monochromatic mass functions in early-formed three-body systems. Even in the most optimistic setup, these events are anticipated to be extremely rare.</description>

      <title>Boxed in from all sides: a global fit to loopy dark matter and neutrino masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a dark matter model that couples to the standard model through a one-loop interaction with neutrinos, where the mediator particles also generate neutrino masses. We perform a global fit that incorporates dark matter relic abundance, primordial nucleosynthesis, neutrino mass, collider and indirect detection constraints. Thanks to the loop suppression, large couplings are allowed, and we find that the model parameters are constrained on all sides. Dark matter masses from 10 MeV to a few TeV are allowed, but sub-GeV masses are preferred for the model to also account for the heaviest neutrino mass. Though our results are valid for a single neutrino mass eigenstate at a time, the model and methods are generalizable to the full 3-flavor case.</description>

      <title>Starobinsky Inflation with T-Model Kaehler Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present novel implementations of Starobisky-like inflation within Supergravity adopting Kaehler potentials for the inflaton which parameterize hyperbolic geometries known from the T-model inflation. The associated superpotentials are consistent with an R and a global or gauge U(1)_X symmetries. The inflaton is represented by a gauge-singlet or non-singlet superfield and is accompanied by a gauge-singlet superfield successfully stabilized thanks to its compact contribution into the total Kaehler potential. Keeping the Kaehler manifold intact, a conveniently violated shift symmetry is introduced which allows for a slight variation of the predictions of Starobinsky inflation: The (scalar) spectral index exhibits an upper bound which lies close to its central observational value whereas the constant scalar curvature of the inflaton-sector Kaehler manifold increases with the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in an expanding medium -- hot remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of a first order confinement/deconfinement phase transition in an expanding medium using an effective boundary description fitted to the holographic Witten model. We observe and analyze hot plasma remnants, which do not cool down or nucleate bubbles despite the expansion of the system. The appearance of the hot remnants, the dynamics of their shrinking and subsequent dissolution and further heating up is very robust and persists in such diverse scenarios as boost-invariant expansion with a flat Minkowski metric and cosmological expansion in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime.</description>

      <title>The size of the continuum emission region and its scaling relations with active galactic nucleus luminosity and the broad-line region size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a continuum lag analysis for a sample of 37 relatively high-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project (SAMP), utilizing the light curve data in $B$ and $V$ bands from SAMP and in $g,r,i$ bands from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We find that the inter-band lags ($\tau$) increase with wavelength (i.e., $\tau \propto \lambda^{\sim 4/3}$) as prescribed by the standard disk model (SSD), suggesting consistency with the "lamp-post" reprocessing model. We report that the size of the continuum emitting region (CER) normalized at 2500 {\AA} ($R_{2500}$) is a factor of $\sim$5 (i.e, $0.69\pm0.04$ dex) larger than predicted by SSD. By combining our new measurements with the re-measurements of the literature sample, we report a correlation between $R_{2500}$ and AGN continuum luminosity as $R_{2500} \, \propto \, L_{5100}^{0.58\pm0.03}$, which suggests that the observed continuum could be composed of both the disk emission and the diffuse emission from the broad line region (BLR). The size of CER shows a tight relation with the size of H$\beta$ BLR with a sublinear slope (i.e., $R_{\text{BLR}} \, \propto \, R_{\text{2500}}^{0.87\pm0.07}$) and a scatter of 0.29 dex. This empirical relation offers a promising method for estimating single-epoch black hole masses, once established over a large dynamic range of AGN luminosity.</description>
