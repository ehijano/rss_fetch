      <title>Quantitative Aspects, Engineering and Optimization of Bacterial Sensor Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial sensor systems can be used for the detection and measurement of molecular signal concentrations. The dynamics of the sensor directly depend on the biological properties of the bacterial sensor cells; manipulation of these features in the wet lab enables the engineering and optimization of the bacterial sensor kinetics. This necessitates the development of biologically meaningful computational models for bacterial sensors comprising a variety of different molecular mechanisms, which further facilitates a systematic and quantitative evaluation of optimization strategies. In this work, we dissect the detection chain of bacterial sensors from a mathematical perspective from which we derive, supported by wet-lab data, a complete computational model for a Streptococcus mutans-based bacterial sensor as a case example. We address the engineering of bacterial sensors by investigating the impact of altered bacterial cell properties on the sensor response characteristics, specifically sensor sensitivity and response signal intensity. This is achieved through a sensitivity analysis targeting both the steady-state and transient sensor response characteristics. Alongside the demonstration of suitability of our methodological approach, our analysis shows that an increase of sensor sensitivity, through a targeted manipulation of bacterial physiology, often comes at the cost of generally diminished sensor response intensity.</description>

      <title>Moment-based parameter inference with error guarantees for stochastic reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring parameters of models of biochemical kinetics from single-cell data remains challenging because of the uncertainty arising from the intractability of the likelihood function of stochastic reaction networks. Such uncertainty falls beyond current error quantification measures, which focus on the effects of finite sample size and identifiability but lack theoretical guarantees when likelihood approximations are needed. Here, we propose an inference method for stochastic reaction networks with nonlinear and rational propensities at steady state that provides bounds on the parameters via convex optimisation over sets constrained by moment equations and moment matrices. Our approach takes observations from the stochastic reaction network and forms moment intervals, which are then used to constrain parameters through convex sets. The bounds on the parameters contain the true parameters under the condition that the moment intervals contain the true stationary moments, thus providing uncertainty quantification and error guarantees. Our approach does not need to predict moments and distributions for given parameters (i.e., it avoids solving or simulating the forward problem), and hence circumvents intractable likelihood computations or computationally expensive simulations. We demonstrate its use for uncertainty quantification, data integration and prediction of latent species statistics through synthetic data from common nonlinear biochemical models including the Schl\"ogl model, the toggle switch and post-transcriptional regulation.</description>
