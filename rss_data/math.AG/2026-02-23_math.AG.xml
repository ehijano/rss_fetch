      <description>arXiv:2602.17927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the coherent Springer sheaf and its parabolic analogues are concentrated in cohomological degree $0$, as predicted by Ben-Zvi-Chen-Helm-Nadler, Zhu, Emerton-Gee-Hellmann, Hansen, and others. More generally, we show that the universal trace functor for a mixed partial affine Hecke category is right t-exact with respect to the exotic t-structure given by Bezrukavnikov-Mirkovi\'c's noncommutative Springer resolution, and left t-exact with respect to the monoidally dual t-structure. To this end, we construct an explicit complex computing the universal trace functor for certain monoidal categories over quotient stacks.</description>

      <title>Degenerations of CoHAs of 2-Calabi-Yau categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By work of Davison and Meinhardt, the cohomological Hall algebra of a symmetric quiver with potential admits a geometrically defined filtration (the perverse filtration) whose associated graded is a supercommutative algebra. In the case of the triple quiver of a quiver with the canonical cubic potential, which corresponds to the preprojective algebra of the quiver via dimensional reduction, there is an additional filtration (the less perverse filtration), which is defined more generally for cohomological Hall algebras of suitably geometric 2-Calabi-Yau categories in work of Davison. In this paper, we show that the degenerations of the cohomological Hall algebras of preprojective algebras and more generally 2-Calabi-Yau categories with respect to the less perverse filtration is isomorphic to the enveloping algebra of the current Lie algebra of the BPS Lie algebra. This result applies in particular to CoHAs of local systems on Riemann surfaces and Higgs bundles on smooth projective curves. We extend this description to deformations of the cohomological Hall algebra obtained via torus actions on the arrows of the quiver and deformed canonical cubic potentials via the deformed dimensional reduction of Davison-P\u{a}durariu. Last, we use our results to compare the less perverse filtration on CoHAs of preprojective algebras with the order filtration on the Maulik-Okounkov Yangian, via the comparison isomorphism of Botta-Davison and Schiffmann-Vasserot.</description>

      <title>Dynamical GCD Problems and a Variant of the Dynamical Mordell-Lang Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{NZ25}, the authors resolved the rational function analogue of the finiteness results for greatest common divisors of iterates of polynomials established in \cite{HT17}. These results may be viewed as dynamical generalizations of a classical problem concerning upper bounds for the greatest common divisors (GCDs) of two integer sequences studied by Bugeaud, Corvaja, and Zannier. The most delicate case arises when the maps involved are automorphisms, where the methods of \cite{NZ25} and \cite{HT17} rely heavily on Diophantine approximation and asymptotic analysis.
  In the present paper, we develop an alternative approach to the automorphism case. This method is more powerful, allowing us to give complete answers to the further questions posed in \cite{HT17}. In particular, we strengthen the main theorem of \cite{HT17} and provide an alternative proof of the main theorem of \cite{NZ25} in the automorphism setting.
  Moreover, we relate this dynamical GCD problem to a special case of a higher-dimensional generalization of the Dynamical Mordell--Lang Conjecture proposed by Junyi Xie. We establish this generalized conjecture when the dynamics arise from algebraic group actions. In addition, we resolve the corresponding special case associated with dynamical GCD questions when the maps involved are polynomials.</description>

      <title>An algebraic theory of Lojasiewicz exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified algebraic and valuative theory of Lojasiewicz exponents for pairs of graded families and filtrations of ideals. Within this framework, local Lojasiewicz exponents, gradient exponents, and exponents at infinity are all realized as asymptotic containment thresholds between filtrations, governed by integral closure. This reformulation shows that Lojasiewicz exponents are fundamentally valuative optimization problems.
  The central structural contribution of the paper is a finite-max principle. Under verifiable algebraic hypotheses, the a priori infinite valuative supremum bounding the Lojasiewicz exponent reduces to a finite maximum, and computes the Lojasiewicz exponent precisely. We identify two complementary mechanisms leading to this phenomenon: finite testing arising from normalized blowups and Noetherian Rees algebras, and attainment via compactness of normalized valuation spaces under linear boundedness assumptions.
  This finite-max framework yields strong structural consequences. We prove rigidity results showing that common extremal valuations force equality of Lojasiewicz ratios, and we establish stratification and stability phenomena for Lojasiewicz exponents in families, including fractional linearity and wall-chamber behavior along natural one-parameter deformations.
  The theory recovers and explains classical results in toric and Newton-polyhedral settings, particularly, for Newton nondegenete case, where the Lojasiewicz exponent is computed by finitely many toric divisorial valuations corresponding to facet data.
  Finally, we illustrate why the hypotheses underlying the finite-max principle are essential, delineating the precise scope of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the classification of del Pezzo surfaces $X$ of degree $5$ over any perfect field $\mathbf{k}$ in explicit geometric terms. More precisely, in each case we use the Petersen graph to illustrate the $\operatorname{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf{k}}/\mathbf{k})$-action on the $(-1)$-curves of $X$ and we describe explicitly its group of automorphisms, $\operatorname{Aut}_{\mathbf{k}}(X)$. For the cases when $X$ is not minimal, we describe how to realize it as the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^{2}$, or of a (minimal) quadric in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$, and classify them up to $\mathbf{k}$-isomorphism. In all cases, the elements of the group $\operatorname{Aut}_{\mathbf{k}}(X)$ are described geometrically.</description>

      <title>Differential Galois groups of $G$-connections with Coxeter singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental theorem of Katz \cite{Katz87} determines the differential Galois groups of rank $n$ connections on algebraic curves with slope $r/n$ at a singularity, where $\gcd(r,n)=1$. We extend this result to $G$-connections, where $G$ is a simple algebraic group and the slope is $r/h$, with $h$ the Coxeter number of $G$ and $\gcd(r,h)=1$. This allows us to compute the differential Galois groups of a broad class of $G$-connections that have been central to recent advances in the geometric Langlands program and the Deligne--Simpson problem -- namely, Coxeter connections, generalised Frenkel--Gross connections, and Airy connections. We apply our results to inverse differential Galois theory by giving uniform and explicit constructions of $G$-connections whose differential Galois groups realise all reductive subgroups of maximal degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study points and 0-cycles on del Pezzo surfaces defined over a field K of characteristic 0, with emphasis on cubic surfaces. We prove that a cubic surface that admits a point defined over a field extension of K of degree coprime to 3 either has a K-point or has a point defined over a field extension of degree 4. This improves a result of Coray (who allowed also field extensions of degree 10). We also prove that 0-cycles of degree at least 18 on a cubic surface are effective and get similar results for degree 2 and degree 1 del Pezzo surfaces, improving results of Colliot-Th\'{e}l\`{e}ne. In a different direction, we prove that the third symmetric product of a cubic hypersurface of dimension at least 2 is unirational over any field, and that in dimension 2 or 3, it is not stably rational in general.</description>

      <title>On finiteness properties of separating semigroup of real curve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A real morphism $f$ from a real algebraic curve $X$ to $\mathbb{P}^1$ is called separating if $f^{-1}(\mathbb{R} \mathbb{P}^1) = \mathbb{R} X$. A separating morphism defines a covering $\mathbb{R} X \to \mathbb{R} \mathbb{P}^1$. Let $X_1, \ldots, X_r$ denote the components of $\mathbb{R} X$. M. Kummer and K. Shaw defined the separating semigroup of a curve $X$ as the set of all vectors $d(f) = (d_1(f), \ldots, d_r(f)) \in \mathbb{N}^{r}$ where $f$ is a separating morphism $X \to \mathbb{P}^1$ and $d_i(f)$ is the degree of the restriction of $f$ to $X_i$.
  In the present paper we prove that for a non-negative integer number $g$ the set of all separating semigroups of genus $g$ curves is finite.</description>

      <title>Pluricanonical Geometry of Varieties Isogenous to a Product and Pluricanonical Decompositions of Abelian Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study canonical and pluricanonical maps of varieties isogenous to a product of curves, i.e., quotients of the form $X = (C_1 \times \dots \times C_n)/G$ with $g(C_i)\ge 2$ and $G$ acting freely. For this purpose, we provide a technical result which is of general interest: a decomposition theorem for pluricanonical systems of abelian covers. This theorem provides an effective tool for the explicit study of geometric properties, such as base loci and the birationality of pluricanonical maps. For threefolds isogenous to a product, we prove that the 4-canonical map is birational for $p_g \ge 5$ and construct an example attaining the maximal canonical degree for this class of threefolds. In this example, the canonical map is the normalization of its image, which admits isolated non-normal singularities. Computational classifications also reveal threefolds where the bicanonical map fails to be birational, even in the absence of genus-2 fibrations. This illustrates an interesting phenomenon similar to the non-standard case for surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (FTA) asserts that every complex polynomial has as many complex roots, counted with multiplicities, as its degree. A probabilistic analogue of this theorem for real roots of real polynomials, sometimes referred to as the Kac theorem, was found between 1938 and 1943 by J. Littlewood, A. Offord, and M. Kac. In this paper, we present several more versions of FTA: Kac type FTA for Laurent polynomials in one and many variables, Kac type FTA for polynomials on complex reductive groups arising in the context of compact group representations (similar to Laurent polynomials arising in torus representation theory), and FTA for exponential sums in one and many variables. In the case of Laurent polynomials, the result, even in the one-dimensional case, is unexpected: most of the zeros of a real Laurent polynomial are real. This text is a supplemented and more detailed version of \cite{arx}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topological obstructions of dynamical convexity on contact manifolds focusing on fillability by cotangent bundles and subcritical surgeries. Using links to algebraic geometry, we motivate and define a stronger version of dynamical convexity, and investigate the topology of these manifolds. More precisely, we show that strongly dynamically convex contact manifolds cannot arise as a unit cotangent bundle $(ST^*M,\lambda_{std})$ of a closed manifold $M$ and in particular that simply connected dynamically convex contact manifolds cannot be filled by cotangent bundles. We demonstrate that dynamical convexity can be used to recover homotopy groups of topologically simple fillings with vanishing symplectic homology. We also show obstructions to dynamical convexity that come from studying different kinds of subcritical surgeries.</description>
