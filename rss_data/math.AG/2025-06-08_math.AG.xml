      <title>Positive Geometry of Polytopes and Polypols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These are lecture notes supporting a minicourse taught at the Summer School in Total Positivity and Quantum Field Theory at CMSA Harvard in June 2025. We give an introduction to positive geometries and their canonical forms. We present the original definition by Arkani-Hamed, Bai and Lam, and a more recent definition suggested by work of Brown and Dupont. We compute canonical forms of convex polytopes and of quasi-regular polypols, which are nonlinear generalizations of polygons in the plane. The text is a collection of known results. It contains many examples and a list of exercises.</description>

      <title>Motivic Steenrod operations at the characteristic via infinite ramification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct motivic power operations on the mod-$p$ motivic cohomology of $\Fb_p$-schemes using a motivic refinement of Nizio{\l}'s theorem. The key input is a purity theorem for motivic cohomology established by Levine. Our operations satisfy the expected properties (naturality, Adem relations, and the Cartan formula) for all bidegrees, generalizing previous results of Primozic which were only know along the ``Chow diagonal.'' We offer geometric applications of our construction: 1) an example of non-(quasi-)smoothable algebraic cycle at the characteristic, 2) an answer to the motivic Steenrod problem at the characteristic, 3) a counterexample to the integral version of a crystalline Tate conjecture.</description>

      <title>Spencer-Riemann-Roch Theory: Mirror Symmetry of Hodge Decompositions and Characteristic Classes in Constrained Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of mirror symmetry in compatible pair Spencer complex theory brings new theoretical tools to the study of constrained geometry. Inspired by classical Spencer theory and modern Hodge theory, this paper establishes Spencer-Riemann-Roch theory in the context of constrained geometry, systematically studying the mirror symmetry of Spencer-Hodge decompositions and their manifestations in algebraic geometry. We utilize Serre's GAGA principle to algebraic geometrize Spencer complexes, establish coherent sheaf formulations, and reveal the topological essence of mirror symmetry through characteristic class theory. Main results include: Riemann-Roch type Euler characteristic computation formulas for Spencer complexes, equivalence theorems for mirror symmetry of Hodge decompositions at the characteristic class level, and verification of these theories in concrete geometric constructions. Research shows that algebraic geometric methods can not only reproduce deep results from differential geometry, but also reveal the intrinsic structure of mirror symmetry in constrained geometry through characteristic class analysis, opening new directions for applications of Spencer theory in constrained geometry.</description>

      <title>On Hodge--Witt cohomology of Drinfeld's upper half space over a finite field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this dissertation we study the Hodge-Witt cohomology of the $d$-dimensional Drinfeld's upper half space $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{P}_k^d$ over a finite field $k$. We consider the natural action of the $k$-rational points $G$ of the linear group $\mathrm{GL}_{d+1}$ on $H^0(\mathcal{X},\mathrm{W}_n\Omega_{\mathbb{P}_k^d}^i)$, making them natural $\mathrm{W}_n(k)[G]$-modules. To study these representations, we introduce a theory of differential operators over the Witt vectors for smooth $k$-schemes $X$, through a quasi-coherent sheaf of $\mathrm{W}_n(k)$-algebras $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{W}_n(X)}$. We apply this theory to equip suitable local cohomology groups arising from $H^0(\mathcal{X},\mathrm{W}_n\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}_k^d})$ with a $\Gamma(\mathbb{P}_k^d,\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{W}_n(\mathbb{P}_k^d)})$-module structure. Those local cohomology groups are naturally modules over some parabolic subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_{d+1}(k)$, and we prove that they are finitely generated $\Gamma(\mathbb{P}_k^d,\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{W}_n(\mathbb{P}_k^d)})$-modules.</description>

      <title>Elliptic constant cycle curves on Kummer surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The order of a constant cycle curve $C \subset X$ on a K3 surface, defined by Huybrechts, is a positive integer that measures the obstruction to decomposing the diagonal class $\Delta_C$ in the Chow group $\mathrm{CH}^2(X \times C)$. In this paper, we compute the order of elliptic constant cycle curves that naturally arise on Kummer surfaces, by passing to the transcendental intermediate Jacobian $J_{\mathrm{tr}}^3(X \times C)$. As a consequence, every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ can be realized as the order of a constant cycle curve on a K3 surface.</description>

      <title>The SagbiHomotopy.jl package for solving polynomial systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Julia package SagbiHomotopy.jl for solving systems of polynomial equations using numerical homotopy continuation. The package introduces an optimal choice of a start system based on SAGBI homotopies. For square horizontally parameterized systems, where each equation is a linear combination of a given set of polynomials, SAGBI homotopies significantly reduce the number of solution paths to track compared to polyhedral homotopies currently used by default in most software for numerical homotopy continuation. We illustrate our framework with a variety of examples, including problems arising in chemistry and physics.</description>

Abstract: We show that the inverse Serre functor for the constructible derived category $\mathbf{D}^\mathrm{b}_\mathrm{c}(\mathbb{P}^n)$ is given by the $\mathbb{P}$-twist at the simple perverse sheaf corresponding to the open stratum. Moreover, we show that all indecomposable perverse sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^n$ are $\mathbb{P}$-like objects, and explicitly construct morphisms spanning their total endomorphism spaces.</description>

      <title>On real roots of polynomial systems of equations in the context of group theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14711v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The probability that a zero of a random real polynomial of increasing degree is real tends to zero. However, passing from polynomials to Laurent polynomials yields a surprising result: the probability that a root is real tends not to zero, but to $1/\sqrt{3}$. A similar phenomenon has also been observed for systems of Laurent polynomials in several variables. By considering Laurent polynomials as functions associated with torus representations, we describe an analogous phenomenon for representations of any reductive linear group. In the case of a simple group, we provide a formula for the aforementioned limiting probability.</description>

      <title>Seiberg Duality conjecture for star-shaped quivers and finiteness of Gromov-Witten thoery for D-type quivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the second work on Seiberg Duality. This work proves that the Seiberg duality conjecture holds for star-shaped quivers: the Gromov-Witten theories for two mutation-related varieties are equivalent.
  In particular, it is known that a $D$-type quiver goes back to itself after finite times quiver mutations, and we further prove that Gromov-Witten theory together with k\"ahler variables of a $D_3$-type quiver variety return to the original ones after finite times quiver mutations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an explicit graph formula, in terms of decorated boundary strata classes, for the wall-crossing of universal Brill-Noether classes. More precisely, fix n&gt;0 and d&lt;g , and two stability conditions \phi^-, \phi^+ for degree d compactified universal (over the moduli space of stable n-pointed curves of genus g) Jacobians that lie on opposite sides of a stability hyperplane. Our main result is a formula for the difference between the Brill-Noether classes, compared via the pullback along the (rational) identity map. The calculation involves constructing a resolution of the identity map by means of subsequent blow-ups.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of skew lines in $\mathbb P^3$ with an application to algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a previously unrecognized combinatorial structure underlying configurations of skew lines in $\mathbb{P}^3$, and reveals its deep and surprising connection to the algebro-geometric concept of geproci sets.
  Given any field $\mathbb{K}$ and a finite set $\mathcal L$ of 3 or more skew lines in $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{K}$, we associate to it a group $G_{\mathcal L}$ and a groupoid $C_{\mathcal L}$ whose action on the union $\cup_{L\in\mathcal L}L$ provides orbits which have a rich combinatorial structure. We characterize when $G_{\mathcal L}$ is abelian and give partial results on its finiteness. The notion of \emph{collinearly complete} subsets is introduced and shown to correspond exactly to unions of groupoid orbits. In the case where $\mathbb{K}$ is a finite field and $\mathcal L$ is a full spread in $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{K}$ (i.e., every point of $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{K}$ lies on a line in $\mathcal{L}$), we prove that $G_{\mathcal L}$ being abelian characterizes the classical spread given by the fibers of the Hopf fibration. Over any algebraically closed field, we establish that finite unions of $C_{\mathcal L}$-orbits are geproci sets - that is, finite sets whose general projections to a plane are complete intersections. Furthermore, we prove a converse: if $\mathbb{K}$ is algebraically closed and $Z \subset \mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{K}$ is a geproci set consisting of $m$ points on each of $s \geq 3$ skew lines $\mathcal L$ where the general projection of $Z$ is a complete intersection of type $(m, s)$, then $Z$ is a finite union of orbits of $C_{\mathcal L}$.
  This work thus uncovers a profound combinatorial framework governing geproci sets, providing a new bridge between incidence combinatorics and algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Covering Number of Real Algebraic Varieties and Beyond: Improved Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05116v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Covering numbers are a powerful tool used in the development of approximation algorithms, randomized dimension reduction methods, smoothed complexity analysis, and others. In this paper we prove upper bounds on the covering number of numerous sets in Euclidean space, namely real algebraic varieties, images of polynomial maps and semialgebraic sets in terms of the number of variables and degrees of the polynomials involved. The bounds remarkably improve the best known general bound by Yomdin-Comte, and our proof is much more straightforward. In particular, our result gives new bounds on the volume of the tubular neighborhood of the image of a polynomial map and a semialgebraic set, where results for varieties by Lotz and Basu-Lerario are not directly applicable. We illustrate the power of the result on three computational applications. Firstly, we derive a near-optimal bound on the covering number of tensors with low canonical polyadic (CP) rank, quantifying their approximation properties and filling in an important missing piece of theory for tensor dimension reduction and reconstruction. Secondly, we prove a bound on dimensionality reduction of images of polynomial maps via randomized sketching, which has direct applications to large scale polynomial optimization. Finally, we deduce generalization error bounds for deep neural networks with rational or ReLU activation functions, improving or matching the best known results in the machine learning literature while helping to quantify the impact of architecture choice on generalization error.</description>

      <title>Minimal model program for algebraically integrable foliations on klt varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For lc algebraically integrable foliations on klt varieties, we prove the base-point-freeness theorem, the contraction theorem, and the existence of flips. The first result resolves a conjecture of Cascini and Spicer, while the latter two results strengthen a result of Cascini and Spicer by removing their assumption on the termination of flips.
  Moreover, we prove the existence of the minimal model program for lc algebraically integrable foliations on klt varieties and the existence of good minimal models or Mori fiber spaces for lc algebraically integrable foliations polarized by ample divisors on klt varieties. As a consequence, we show that $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial klt varieties with lc algebraically integrable Fano foliation structures are Mori dream spaces. We also show the existence of a Shokurov-type polytope for lc algebraically integrable foliations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit moduli spaces of slope stable vector bundles on general polarized HK varieties $(X,h)$ of type $K3^{[2]}$ which have an irreducible component of dimension $2a^2+2$, with $a$ an arbitrary integer greater than $1$. This is done by studying the case $X=S^{[2]}$ where $S$ is an elliptic $K3$ surface. We show that in this case there is an irreducible component of the moduli space of stable vector bundles on $S^{[2]}$ which is birational to a moduli space of sheaves on $S$. We expect that if the moduli space of sheaves on $S$ is a smooth HK variety (necessarily of type $K3^{[a^2+1]}$) then the following more precise version holds: the closure of the moduli space of slope stable vector bundles on $(X,h)$ in the moduli space of Gieseker-Maruyama semistable sheaves with its GIT polarization is a general polarized HK variety of type $K3^{[a^2+1]}$.</description>

Abstract: A recurring task in particle physics and statistics is to compute the complex critical points of a product of powers of affine-linear functions. The logarithmic discriminant characterizes exponents for which such a function has a degenerate critical point in the corresponding hyperplane arrangement complement. We study properties of this discriminant, exploiting its connection with the Hurwitz form of a reciprocal linear space.</description>

      <title>Homological mirror symmetry for log Calabi-Yau surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.05010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a log Calabi-Yau surface $Y$ with maximal boundary $D$ and distinguished complex structure, we explain how to construct a mirror Lefschetz fibration $w: M \to \mathbb{C}$, where $M$ is a Weinstein four-manifold, such that the directed Fukaya category of $w$ is isomorphic to $D^b \text{Coh}(Y)$, and the wrapped Fukaya category $D^b\mathcal{W} (M)$ is isomorphic to $D^b \text{Coh}(Y \backslash D)$. We construct an explicit isomorphism between $M$ and the total space of the almost-toric fibration arising in the work of Gross-Hacking-Keel; when $D$ is negative definite this is expected to be the Milnor fibre of a smoothing of the dual cusp of $D$. We also match our mirror potential $w$ with existing constructions for a range of special cases of $(Y,D)$, notably in work of Auroux-Katzarkov-Orlov and Abouzaid.</description>

      <title>Symplectomorphisms of some Weinstein 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.06797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let M be a Weinstein four-manifold mirror to Y\D for (Y,D) a log Calabi--Yau surface; intuitively, this is typically the Milnor fibre of a smoothing of a cusp singularity. We introduce two families of symplectomorphisms of M: Lagrangian translations, which we prove are mirror to tensors with line bundles; and nodal slide recombinations, which we prove are mirror to automorphisms of (Y,D). The proof uses a detailed compatibility between the homological and SYZ view-points on mirror symmetry. Together with spherical twists, these symplectomorphisms are expected to generate all autoequivalences of the wrapped Fukaya category of M which are compactly supported in a categorical sense. A range of applications is given.</description>
