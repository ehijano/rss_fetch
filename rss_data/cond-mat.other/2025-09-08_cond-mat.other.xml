      <title>Ultrafast Dynamics of Spin-Orbit Entangled Excitons Coupled to Magnetic Ordering in van der Waals Antiferromagnet NiPS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit entangled excitons (SOEE) in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnets provide a direct access to explore unconventional many body interactions in correlated electron systems. In this work, we carry out a detailed investigation using non-degenerate isotropic and anisotropic pump-probe reflection spectroscopy to probe the ultrafast dynamics of SOEE and their coupling to spin fluctuations in NiPS3. Transient reflectivity data reveals acoustic phonon oscillations at ~ 27 GHz, along with two distinct relaxation timescales: fast (1-9 ps) and slower components (1-4 ns) associated with SOEE coherence and spin reordering, respectively. Both timescales exhibit pronouns temperature dependence near the exciton dissociation (TED = 120 K) and Neel TN = 155 K) temperatures. The SOEE coherence shortens from ~ 8-9 ps at T &lt; TED to ~ 3 ps at T &gt; TED with a finite tail persisting beyond TN. The spin reordering time grows near 120 K, and shows critical slowing down around TN. Pump fluence studies further corroborate their spin origin. Our findings uncover the direct interplay between the excitonic and spin degrees of freedom across ultrafast and longer timescales, offering new opportunities to probe and engineer emergent many-body interactions in 2D antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Exchange spin-wave propagation in Ga:YIG nanowaveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-wave-based computing has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the fundamental limitations of CMOS technologies. However, the increasing demand for device miniaturization down to a 100 nm scale presents significant challenges for long-distance spin-wave transport. Gallium-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Ga:YIG) offers a potential solution to these challenges due to its unique magnetic properties. The reduced saturation magnetization in Ga:YIG enables efficient excitation of exchange-dominated spin waves, which exhibit enhanced transport characteristics compared to dipolar-dominated modes in conventional materials. Here, we present the first comprehensive study combining experimental, analytical, and numerical investigations of spin-wave propagation in Ga:YIG waveguides down to 145 nm width and 73 nm thickness. Using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, TetraX simulations, and analytical dispersion calculations, we demonstrate that Ga:YIG waveguides support spin waves with significantly higher group velocities up to 600 m/s. This value remains constant for structures with different widths, leading to longer spin-wave propagation lengths in nanowaveguides compared to non-substituted YIG. These results reveal that gallium substitution provides access to faster and longer-lived spin waves, opening new possibilities for implementing this material in nanoscale magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport in graphene under strain fields modeled by Dirac oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene has emerged as a paradigmatic material in condensed matter physics due to its exceptional electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties. A deep understanding of its thermoelectric transport behavior is crucial for the development of novel nanoelectronic and energy-harvesting devices. In this work, we investigate the thermoelectric transport properties of monolayer graphene subjected to randomly distributed localized strain fields, which locally induce impurity-like perturbations. These strain-induced impurities are modeled via 2D Dirac oscillators, capturing the coupling between pseudorelativistic charge carriers and localized distortions in the lattice. Employing the semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism, we compute the relaxation time using a scattering approach tailored to the Dirac oscillator potential. From this framework, we derive analytical expressions for the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity. The temperature dependence of the scattering centers density is also investigated. Our results reveal how strain modulates transport coefficients, highlighting the interplay between mechanical deformations and thermoelectric performance in graphene. This study provides a theoretical foundation for strain engineering in thermoelectric graphene-based devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of Arbitrarily Configurable Nonlinear Topological Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear topology is an emerging field that combines the intrinsic reconfigurability of nonlinear systems with the robustness of topological protection, offering fertile ground for unconventional phenomena and novel applications. Recently, arbitrarily configurable nonlinear topological modes (ANTMs) were proposed, enabling wavefunctions to be configured into arbitrary profiles , and offering greatly enhanced capacity for topological modes and high-throughput topological transport. Here we present the first direct experimental demonstration of ANTMs . These nonlinear topological modes are robust against disorder while also being continuously reshaped and reconfigured in real time through external control. These counterintuitive properties highlight the versatility of arbitrarily morphing nonlinear topological modes and pave the way for highly adaptable topological devices capable of operating reliably across diverse application scenarios, including those involving imperfections, signal variability, and dynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>Entropy from scattering in weakly interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbation theory is used to investigate the evolution of the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of a bipartite quantum system under the action of a unitary matrix, in the limit where that matrix is close to the unit matrix. The physical context for such process would be scattering with weak short-ranged interactions where the unitary matrix is the S matrix. We find surprisingly simple criteria for the initial state and the S matrix that guarantee that the subsystem entropy increases. The class of initial states that meet these criteria are more correlated than simple product states of the subsystems. They form a subclass of the set of all separable states, and they can therefore be assembled by classical processes alone.</description>
