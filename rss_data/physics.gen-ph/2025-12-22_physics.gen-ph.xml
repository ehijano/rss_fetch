      <title>Gravitational collapse of a degenerate wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a degenerate spherically symmetric wormhole in a vacuum is considered. An extension of the equivalence principle to matter free objects that are the source of a gravitational field is proposed. Using the Klinkhamer metric as an example, it is shown that a degenerate wormhole is precisely such an object. Application of the extended equivalence principle reduces the radial dynamics of the Klinkhamer wormhole to the dynamics of the radial fall of a test particle in a Schwarzschild gravitational field. It is proven that any bound state of the traversable Klinkhamer wormhole eventually collapses into a nontraversable Einstein-Rosen wormhole. An estimate is presented showing that the traversable Klinkhamer wormhole, although nonstationary, is a longlived state.</description>

      <title>A Re-Examination Of Foundational Elements Of Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper undertakes a conceptual re-examination of several foundational elements of cosmology through the lens of spacetime symmetries. A new derivation of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric is obtained by a careful conceptual examination of rotations and translations on generic manifolds, followed by solving the rotational and translational Killing equations, yielding both the metric \emph{and} its translational generators for $k\in\{-1,0,1\}$ without any further assumptions. We then analyze how continuous symmetries are inherited by the Einstein tensor and the Hilbert energy-momentum tensor, proving two general propositions. Furthermore, we use the Maxwell and Kalb-Ramond fields to show that a homogeneous and isotropic energy-momentum tensor, in general, does \emph{not} give rise to field configurations which share these symmetries. In particular, the Kalb-Ramond field we derive is significantly more general than what is usually encountered in the cosmological context. Finally, we provide a rigorous but accessible, elementary, and transparent derivation of the scalar-vector-tensor decomposition from the linearized Einstein equations. Together, these results highlight the value of multiple complementary formulations of the same cosmological physics.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of the two-dimensional (2D) Ising model at an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact solution of the two-dimensional (2D) Ising model at an external magnetic field is derived by a modified Clifford algebraic approach. At first, the transfer matrices are analyzed in three representations, i.e., Clifford algebraic representation, transfer tensor representation and schematic representation, to inspect nonlocal effects in this many-body interacting system. It is ensured that nontrivial topological structures exist in this system, which is analogous to (but different with) those in the three-dimensional (3D) Ising model at zero magnetic field. Therefore, the approaches developed for the 3D Ising models are modified to be appropriable for solving analytically the solution of the 2D Ising model at a magnetic field. An additional rotation, serving as a topological Lorentz transformation, is applied for dealing with the topological problems in the present system. The rotation angle for the transformation is determined by Yang-Baxter relations and a subsequent average of rotation angles treating the linear change of the topological actions. Application of a magnetic field increases the magnetization, shifting the critical point to higher temperatures. At the temperature above the critical point, the magnetization keeps zero until a critical field at which it jumps rapidly as a first-order magnetization process. The partition function and the magnetization obtained are helpful for understanding the physical properties, in particular, the magnetization processes of the 2D magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Cosmic/Comoving Duality: The Cognitive Stability and Typicality Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological scenarios wherein the cumulative number of spontaneously formed, cognitively impaired, disembodied transient observers is vastly larger than the corresponding number of atypical `ordinary observers' (OOs) formed in the conventional way -- essentially via cosmic evolution and gravitational instability -- are disqualified in modern cosmology on the grounds of Cognitive Instability -- the untrustworsiness of one own's reasoning -- let alone the atypicality of OOs like us. According to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model -- when described in the (expanding) `cosmic frame' -- the cosmological expansion is future-eternal. In this frame we are atypical OOs, which are vastly outnumbered by typical Boltzmann Brains (BBs) that spontaneously form via sheer thermal fluctuations in the future-eternal asymptotic de Sitter spacetime. In the case that dark energy (DE) ultimately decays, the cumulative number of transient `Freak Observers' (FOs) formed and destroyed spontaneously by virtue of the quantum uncertainty principle ultimately overwhelms that of OOs. Either possibility is unacceptable. We argue that these unsettling conclusions are artifacts of employing the (default) cosmic frame description in which space expands. When analyzed in the comoving frame, OOs overwhelmingly outnumber both BBs and FOs. This suggests that the dual comoving description is the cognitively stable preferred framework for describing our evolving Universe. In this frame, space is globally static, masses monotonically increase, and the space describing gravitationally bounded objects monotonically contracts.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monogamy with Predetermined Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of correlation appears straightforward: measurement outcomes coincide, and patterns emerge. For any record of events, the coefficients are uniquely determined. Thus, if correlations change spontaneously, as seen in quantum monogamy, then individual behavior must have changed first. Surprisingly, this is not always true. When two observables are mutually exclusive, they cannot coincide objectively and need to be grouped across time. Yet, sectioning the flow of events into "iterations" is not trivial in this case. Even with blind windows of coincidence, the same order of outcomes can produce different coefficients of correlation, depending on the number of joint measurements. Therefore, quantum monogamy can happen with fixed pre-determined events. A new concept ("subjective correlation") is required to explain this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>How to present and interpret the Feynman diagrams in this theory describing fermion and boson fields in a unique way, in comparison with the Feynman diagrams so far presented and interpreted?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the internal spaces describing spins and charges of fermions' and bosons' second-quantised fields have such different properties, yet we can all describe them equivalently with the ``basis vectors'' which are a superposition of odd (for fermions) and even (for bosons) products of $\gamma^{a}$'s. In an even-dimensional internal space, as it is $d=(13+1)$, odd ``basis vectors'' appear in $2^{\frac{d}{2}-1}$ families with $2^{\frac{d}{2}-1}$ members each, and have their Hermitian conjugate partners in a separate group, while even ``basis vectors'' appear in two orthogonal groups. Algebraic multiplication of boson and fermion ``basis vectors'' determines the interactions between fermions and bosons, and among bosons themselves, and correspondingly also their action. Tensor products of the ``basis vectors'' and basis in ordinary space-time determine states for fermions and bosons, if bosons obtain in addition the space index $\alpha$. We study properties of massless fermions and bosons with the internal spaces determined by the ``basis vectors'' while assuming that fermions and bosons are active only in $d=(3+1)$ of the ordinary space-time. We discuss the Feynman diagrams in this theory, describing internal spaces of fermion and boson fields with odd and even ``basis vectors'', respectively, in comparison with the Feynman diagrams of the theories so far presented and interpreted.</description>

      <title>Constructing de Sitter space and Dark Matter with Dynamical Tension Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The string tensions can be dynamical in the modified measure formalism and appear as an additional dynamical degrees of freedom . These tensions may not be universal, instead, each string generates its own tension. We then consider a new bulk field that can couple to the strings, the tension scalar which changes locally the tension along the world sheet. In the case with two string tensions there is a braneworld solution which gives rise to an induced de Sitter space in the brane, avoiding swampland constraints of the standard string theory. Strings with different tension to ours can appear also as Dark Matter and since they share the same space and compactifications as visible matter, they should lead to Dark copies of the standard model,</description>

      <title>From the thermodynamics of irreversible processes to dissipative structures and active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A historical perspective is presented on thermodynamics from the pioneering contributions by Carnot and Clausius to recent advances on active matter. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics develops from the identification of the irreversible processes contributing to entropy production in various types of materials and systems. These processes include friction, viscosity, heat and electric conductions, diffusion, reactions, and more. In 1954, Glansdorff and Prigogine formulated a general evolution criterion, which led to the theory of dissipative structures like chemical clocks, reaction-diffusion patterns, and convection patterns. Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics provides the microscopic foundations for the thermodynamics of irreversible processes.</description>
