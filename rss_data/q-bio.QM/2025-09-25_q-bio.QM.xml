      <title>Deep Clustering for Blood Cell Classification and Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate classification of blood cells plays a key role in improving automated blood analysis for both medical and veterinary applications. This work presents a two-stage deep clustering method for classifying blood cells from high-dimensional signal data. In the first stage, red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets (PLTs) are separated using a combination of an improved autoencoder and the IDEC algorithm. The second stage further classifies RBC subtypes, pure RBCs, reticulocytes, and clumped RBCs, through a variational deep embedding (VaDE) approach. Due to the lack of detailed cell-level labels, soft classification probabilities are generated from sample-level data to approximate the true distributions. The aim is to contribute to the development of low-cost, automated blood analysis systems suitable for veterinary and biomedical use. Initial results indicate this method shows promise in effectively distinguishing different blood cell populations, even with limited supervision.</description>

      <title>Integrating Mechanistic Modeling and Machine Learning to Study CD4+/CD8+ CAR-T Cell Dynamics with Tumor Antigen Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown remarkable success in hematological malignancies, yet patient responses remain highly variable and the roles of CD4 and CD8 subsets are not fully understood. We present an extended mathematical framework of CAR-T cell dynamics that explicitly models CD4 helper and CD8 cytotoxic lineages and their interactions with tumor antigen burden. Building on the Kirouac et al. (2023) model of antigen-regulated memory, effector, and exhaustion transitions, our system of differential equations incorporates cytokine-mediated modulation of CD8 proliferation, cytotoxicity, and memory regeneration by CD4 T cells. Sensitivity analyses identify effector proliferation burst size, antigen turnover, and CD8 expansion rates as dominant determinants of treatment outcome. Virtual patient simulations reproduce clinical findings that a 1:1 CD4:CD8 ratio enhances CAR-T expansion and tumor clearance relative to CD8-only products. Finally, we integrate a feed-forward neural network trained on noisy virtual patient data to improve predictive robustness, and apply SHAP analysis to interpret the network predictions and compare them with mechanistic sensitivity analyses. This work highlights the synergistic roles of CD4 and CD8 CAR-T cells and provides a quantitative foundation for optimizing treatments and patient stratification.</description>

      <title>Dynamicasome: a molecular dynamics-guided and AI-driven pathogenicity prediction catalogue for all genetic mutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in genomic medicine accelerate the identi cation of mutations in disease-associated genes, but the pathogenicity of many mutations remains unknown, hindering their use in diagnostics and clinical decision-making. Predictive AI models are generated to combat this issue, but current tools display low accuracy when tested against functionally validated datasets. We show that integrating detailed conformational data extracted from molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) into advanced AI-based models increases their predictive power. We carry out an exhaustive mutational analysis of the disease gene PMM2 and subject structural models of each variant to MDS. AI models trained on this dataset outperform existing tools when predicting the known pathogenicity of mutations. Our best performing model, a neuronal networks model, also predicts the pathogenicity of several PMM2 mutations currently considered of unknown signi cance. We believe this model helps alleviate the burden of unknown variants in genomic medicine.</description>

      <title>Meta-analysis and Topological Perturbation in Interactomic Network for Anti-opioid Addiction Drug Repurposing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ongoing opioid crisis highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly deployed. This study presents a novel approach to identify potential repurposable drugs for the treatment of opioid addiction, aiming to bridge the gap between transcriptomic data analysis and drug discovery. Speciffcally, we perform a meta-analysis of seven transcriptomic datasets related to opioid addiction by differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, and propose a novel multiscale topological differentiation to identify key genes from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network derived from DEGs. This method uses persistent Laplacians to accurately single out important nodes within the PPI network through a multiscale manner to ensure high reliability. Subsequent functional validation by pathway enrichment and rigorous data curation yield 1,865 high-conffdence targets implicated in opioid addiction, which are cross-referenced with DrugBank to compile a repurposing candidate list. To evaluate drug-target interactions, we construct predictive models utilizing two natural language processing-derived molecular embeddings and a conventional molecular ffngerprint. Based on these models, we prioritize compounds with favorable binding afffnity proffles, and select candidates that are further assessed through molecular docking simulations to elucidate their receptor-level interactions. Additionally, pharmacokinetic and toxicological evaluations are performed via ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) proffling, providing a multidimensional assessment of druggability and safety. This study offers a generalizable approach for drug repurposing in other complex diseases beyond opioid addiction.

      <title>BioBO: Biology-informed Bayesian Optimization for Perturbation Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient design of genomic perturbation experiments is crucial for accelerating drug discovery and therapeutic target identification, yet exhaustive perturbation of the human genome remains infeasible due to the vast search space of potential genetic interactions and experimental constraints. Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as a powerful framework for selecting informative interventions, but existing approaches often fail to exploit domain-specific biological prior knowledge. We propose Biology-Informed Bayesian Optimization (BioBO), a method that integrates Bayesian optimization with multimodal gene embeddings and enrichment analysis, a widely used tool for gene prioritization in biology, to enhance surrogate modeling and acquisition strategies. BioBO combines biologically grounded priors with acquisition functions in a principled framework, which biases the search toward promising genes while maintaining the ability to explore uncertain regions. Through experiments on established public benchmarks and datasets, we demonstrate that BioBO improves labeling efficiency by 25-40%, and consistently outperforms conventional BO by identifying top-performing perturbations more effectively. Moreover, by incorporating enrichment analysis, BioBO yields pathway-level explanations for selected perturbations, offering mechanistic interpretability that links designs to biologically coherent regulatory circuits.</description>

      <title>A decision-theoretic framework for uncertainty quantification in epidemiological modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating, understanding, and communicating uncertainty is fundamental to statistical epidemiology, where model-based estimates regularly inform real-world decisions. However, sources of uncertainty are rarely formalised, and existing classifications are often defined inconsistently. This lack of structure hampers interpretation, model comparison, and targeted data collection. Connecting ideas from machine learning, information theory, experimental design, and health economics, we present a first-principles decision-theoretic framework that defines uncertainty as the expected loss incurred by making an estimate based on incomplete information, arguing that this is a highly useful and practically relevant definition for epidemiology. We show how reasoning about future data leads to a notion of expected uncertainty reduction, which induces formal definitions of reducible and irreducible uncertainty. We demonstrate our approach using a case study of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance in Aotearoa New Zealand, estimating the uncertainty reduction if wastewater surveillance were expanded to the full population. We then connect our framework to relevant literature from adjacent fields, showing how it unifies and extends many of these ideas and how it allows these ideas to be applied to a wider range of models. Altogether, our framework provides a foundation for more reliable, consistent, and policy-relevant uncertainty quantification in infectious disease epidemiology.</description>

      <title>A co-evolving agentic AI system for medical imaging analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI is rapidly advancing in healthcare and biomedical research. However, in medical image analysis, their performance and adoption remain limited due to the lack of a robust ecosystem, insufficient toolsets, and the absence of real-time interactive expert feedback. Here we present "TissueLab", a co-evolving agentic AI system that allows researchers to ask direct questions, automatically plan and generate explainable workflows, and conduct real-time analyses where experts can visualize intermediate results and refine them. TissueLab integrates tool factories across pathology, radiology, and spatial omics domains. By standardizing inputs, outputs, and capabilities of diverse tools, the system determines when and how to invoke them to address research and clinical questions. Across diverse tasks with clinically meaningful quantifications that inform staging, prognosis, and treatment planning, TissueLab achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with end-to-end vision-language models (VLMs) and other agentic AI systems such as GPT-5. Moreover, TissueLab continuously learns from clinicians, evolving toward improved classifiers and more effective decision strategies. With active learning, it delivers accurate results in unseen disease contexts within minutes, without requiring massive datasets or prolonged retraining. Released as a sustainable open-source ecosystem, TissueLab aims to accelerate computational research and translational adoption in medical imaging while establishing a foundation for the next generation of medical AI.</description>

      <title>PGCLODA: Prompt-Guided Graph Contrastive Learning for Oligopeptide-Infectious Disease Association Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health, underscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen novel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential, computational models specifically designed to predict associations between oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides, microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at https://github.com/jjnlcode/PGCLODA.</description>

      <title>Discrete vs. continuous dynamics in biology: When do they align and when do they diverge?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many biological systems are governed by difference equations and exhibit discrete-time dynamics. Examples include the size of a population when generations are non-overlapping, and the incidence of a disease when infections are recorded at fixed intervals. For discrete-time systems lacking exact solutions, continuous-time approximations are frequently employed when small changes occur between discrete time steps.
  Here, we present an approach motivated by exactly soluble discrete time problems. We show that such systems have continuous-time descriptions (governed by differential equations) whose solutions precisely agree, at the discrete times, with the discrete time solutions, irrespective of the size of changes that occur.
  For discrete-time systems lacking exact solutions, we develop approximate continuous-time models that can, to high accuracy, capture rapid growth and decay. Our approach employs mappings between difference and differential equations, generating functional solutions that exactly or closely preserve the original discrete time behaviour. It uncovers fundamental structural parallels and also distinctions between the difference equation and the `equivalent' differential equation. The findings we present cover both time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous systems.
  For completeness, we also consider discrete-time systems with the most rapid oscillatory behaviour possible, namely a sign change each time step. We show, for exactly soluble cases, that such systems also have a continuous-time description, but that this comes at the expense of generally complex-valued solutions.
  This work has applications in, for example, population genetics, ecology and epidemic modelling. By bridging discrete and continuous representations of a system, it enhances insights/analysis of different types of dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chase-and-Run and Chirality in Nonlocal Models of Pattern Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chase-and-run dynamics, in which one population pursues another that flees from it, are found throughout nature, from predator-prey interactions in ecosystems to the collective motion of cells during development. Intriguingly, in many of these systems, the movement is not straight; instead, 'runners' veer off at an angle from their pursuers. This angled movement often exhibits a consistent left-right asymmetry, known as lateralisation or chirality. Inspired by such phenomena in zebrafish skin patterns and evasive animal motion, we explore how chirality shapes the emergence of patterns in nonlocal (integro-differential) advection-diffusion models. We extend such models to allow movement at arbitrary angles, uncovering a rich landscape of behaviours. We find that chirality can enhance pattern formation, suppress oscillations, and give rise to entirely new dynamical structures, such as rotating pulses of chasers and runners. We also uncover how chase-and-run dynamics can cause populations to mix or separate. Through linear stability analysis, we identify physical mechanisms that drive some of these effects, whilst also exposing striking limitations of this theory in capturing more complex dynamics. Our findings suggest that chirality could have roles in ecological and cellular patterning beyond simply breaking left-right symmetry.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Artificial Intelligence of Embryo Grading and Pregnancy Prediction in Assisted Reproductive Technology: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infertility, a pressing global health concern, affects a substantial proportion of individuals worldwide. While advancements in assisted reproductive technology (ART) have offered effective interventions, conventional in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) procedures still encounter significant hurdles in enhancing pregnancy success rates. Key challenges include the inherent subjectivity in embryo grading and the inefficiency of multi-modal data integration. Against this backdrop, the adoption of AI-driven technologies has emerged as a pivotal strategy to address these issues. This article presents a comprehensive review of the progress in AI applications for embryo grading and pregnancy prediction from a novel perspective, with a specific focus on the utilization of different modal data, such as static images, time-lapse videos, and structured tabular data. The reason for this perspective is that reorganizing tasks based on data sources can not only more accurately depict the essence of the problem but also help clarify the rationality and limitations of model design. Furthermore, this review critically examines the core challenges in contemporary research, encompassing the intricacies of multi-modal feature fusion, constraints imposed by data scarcity, limitations in model generalization capabilities, and the dynamically evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. On this basis, it explicitly identifies potential avenues for future research, aiming to provide actionable guidance for advancing the application of multi-modal AI in the field of ART.</description>

      <title>Assay2Mol: large language model-based drug design using BioAssay context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate candidate molecules' functional responses against disease targets. Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of assays offer rich information for drug discovery campaigns but has been untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.</description>

      <title>Causality-Induced Positional Encoding for Transformer-Based Representation Learning of Non-Sequential Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positional encoding is essential for supplementing transformer with positional information of tokens. Existing positional encoding methods demand predefined token/feature order, rendering them unsuitable for real-world data with non-sequential yet causally-related features. To address this limitation, we propose CAPE, a novel method that identifies underlying causal structure over non-sequential features as a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) using generalized structural equation modeling. The DAG is then embedded in hyperbolic space where its geometric structure is well-preserved using a hyperboloid model-based approach that effectively captures two important causal graph properties (causal strength &amp; causal specificity). This step yields causality-aware positional encodings for the features, which are converted into their rotary form for integrating with transformer's self-attention mechanism. Theoretical analysis reveals that CAPE-generated rotary positional encodings possess three valuable properties for enhanced self-attention, including causal distance-induced attenuation, causal generality-induced attenuation, and robustness to positional disturbances. We evaluate CAPE over both synthetic and real-word datasets, empirically demonstrating its theoretical properties and effectiveness in enhancing transformer for data with non-sequential features. Our code is available at https://github.com/Catchxu/CAPE.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel information-preserving Chaos Game Representation (CGR) method, also called Reverse-CGR (R-CGR), for biological sequence analysis that addresses the fundamental limitation of traditional CGR approaches - the loss of sequence information during geometric mapping. Our method introduces complete sequence recovery through explicit path encoding combined with rational arithmetic precision control, enabling perfect sequence reconstruction from stored geometric traces. Unlike purely geometric approaches, our reversibility is achieved through comprehensive path storage that maintains both positional and character information at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-CGR on biological sequence classification tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to traditional sequence-based methods while providing interpretable geometric visualizations. The approach generates feature-rich images suitable for deep learning while maintaining complete sequence information through explicit encoding, opening new avenues for interpretable bioinformatics analysis where both accuracy and sequence recovery are essential.</description>
