      <title>Robust Communication Design in RIS-Assisted THz Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication offers the necessary bandwidth to meet the high data rate demands of next-generation wireless systems. However, it faces significant challenges, including severe path loss, dynamic blockages, and beam misalignment, which jeopardize communication reliability. Given that many 6G use cases require both high data rates and strong reliability, robust transmission schemes that achieve high throughput under these challenging conditions are essential for the effective use of high-frequency bands. In this context, we propose a novel mixed-criticality superposition coding scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted THz systems. This scheme leverages both the strong but intermittent direct line-of-sight link and the more reliable, yet weaker, RIS path to ensure robust delivery of high-criticality data while maintaining high overall throughput. We model a mixed-criticality queuing system and optimize transmit power to meet reliability and queue stability constraints. Simulation results show that our approach significantly reduces queuing delays for critical data while sustaining high overall throughput, outperforming conventional time-sharing methods. Additionally, we examine the impact of blockage, beam misalignment, and beamwidth adaptation on system performance. These results demonstrate that our scheme effectively balances reliability and throughput under challenging conditions, while also underscoring the need for robust beamforming techniques to mitigate the impact of misalignment in RIS-assisted channels.</description>

      <title>Wireless Resource Allocation with Collaborative Distributed and Centralized DRL under Control Channel Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a wireless resource allocation problem in a cyber-physical system (CPS) where the control channel, carrying resource allocation commands, is subjected to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. We propose a novel concept of collaborative distributed and centralized (CDC) resource allocation to effectively mitigate the impact of these attacks. To optimize the CDC resource allocation policy, we develop a new CDC-deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, whereas existing DRL frameworks only formulate either centralized or distributed decision-making problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the CDC-DRL algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks, showcasing its ability to address resource allocation problems in large-scale CPSs under control channel attacks.</description>

      <title>A Resilience Perspective on C-V2X Communication Networks under Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) networks provide a promising solution to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. One key challenge in such systems lies in meeting different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of coexisting vehicular communication links, particularly under imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions caused by the highly dynamic environment. In this paper, a novel analytical framework for examining the resilience of C-V2X networks in face of imperfect CSI is proposed. In this framework, the adaptation phase of the C-V2X network is studied, in which an adaptation power scheme is employed and the probability distribution function (PDF) of the imperfect CSI is estimated. Then, the resilience of C-V2X networks is studied through two principal dimensions: remediation capability and adaptation performance, both of which are defined, quantified, and analyzed for the first time. Particularly, an upper bound on the estimation's mean square error (MSE) is explicitly derived to capture the C-V2X's remediation capability, and a novel metric named hazard rate (HR) is exploited to evaluate the C-V2X's adaptation performance. Afterwards, the impact of the adaptation power scheme on the C-V2X's resilience is examined, revealing a tradeoff between the C-V2X's remediation capability and adaptation performance. Simulation results validate the framework's superiority in capturing the interplay between adaptation and remediation, as well as the effectiveness of the two proposed metrics in guiding the design of the adaptation power scheme to enhance the system's resilience.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design and Multi-User Scheduling in Transmissive RIS Enabled Distributed Cooperative ISAC Networks with RSMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (TRIS) transceiver-empowered distributed cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network to enhance coverage as well as to enhance wireless environment understanding. Based on the network requirements, the users are categorized into cooperative users (CUEs) and destination users (DUEs), and the CUEs utilize their own resources to serve the DUEs. To realize cooperation, we implement rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) at the base station (BS), where the common stream is decoded and reencoded at the CUEs and forwarded to the DUEs, while the private stream satisfies the CUEs' own communication requirements. We construct an optimization problem with maximum minimum radar mutual information (RMI) as the objective function to optimize the BS beamforming matrix, the CUE beamforming matrices, the common stream rate vectors, and the user scheduling vectors. Due to the coupling of the optimization variables and non-convex operation, the proposed problem is a non-convex optimization problem that cannot be solved directly. To address the above challenges, we adopt a consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework to decouple the optimization variables and solve it. Specifically, the problem is decoupled into multiple subproblems and solved by iterative optimization independently until overall convergence is achieved. Finally, numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of improving communication sum-rate and RMI, and greatly reduce the algorithm complexity.</description>

      <title>Joint Precoding and AP Selection for Energy Efficient RIS-aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Using Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) are two advanced transceiver technologies for realizing future sixth-generation (6G) networks. In this paper, we investigate the joint precoding and access point (AP) selection for energy efficient RIS-aided CF mMIMO system. To address the associated computational complexity and communication power consumption, we advocate for user-centric dynamic networks in which each user is served by a subset of APs rather than by all of them. Based on the user-centric network, we formulate a joint precoding and AP selection problem to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the considered system. To solve this complex nonconvex problem, we propose an innovative double-layer multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based scheme. Moreover, we propose an adaptive power threshold-based AP selection scheme to further enhance the EE of the considered system. To reduce the computational complexity of the RIS-aided CF mMIMO system, we introduce a fuzzy logic (FL) strategy into the MARL scheme to accelerate convergence. The simulation results show that the proposed FL-based MARL cooperative architecture effectively improves EE performance, offering a 85\% enhancement over the zero-forcing (ZF) method, and achieves faster convergence speed compared with MARL. It is important to note that increasing the transmission power of the APs or the number of RIS elements can effectively enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) performance, which also leads to an increase in power consumption, resulting in a non-trivial trade-off between the quality of service and EE performance.</description>

      <title>Information Rates of Channels with Additive White Cauchy Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information transmission over discrete-time channels with memoryless additive noise obeying a Cauchy, rather than Gaussian, distribution, are studied. The channel input satisfies an average power constraint. Upper and lower bounds to such additive white Cauchy noise (AWCN) channel capacity are established. In the high input power regime, the gap between upper and lower bounds is within 0.5 nats per channel use, and the lower bound can be achieved with Gaussian input. In the lower input power regime, the capacity can be asymptotically approached by employing antipodal input. It is shown that the AWCN decoder can be applied to additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels with negligible rate loss, while the AWGN decoder when applied to AWCN channels cannot ensure reliable decoding. For the vector receiver case, it is shown that a linear combining receiver front end loses the channel combining gain, a phenomenon drastically different from AWGN vector channels.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-Aided Rate-Splitting Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter considers a fluid antenna system (FAS)-aided rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) approach for downlink transmission. In particular, a base station (BS) equipped with a single traditional antenna system (TAS) uses RSMA signaling to send information to several mobile users (MUs) each equipped with FAS. To understand the achievable performance, we first present the distribution of the equivalent channel gain based on the joint multivariate t-distribution and then derive a compact analytical expression for the outage probability (OP). Moreover, we obtain the asymptotic OP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Numerical results show that combining FAS with RSMA significantly outperforms TAS and conventional multiple access schemes, such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), in terms of OP. The results also indicate that FAS can be the tool that greatly improves the practicality of RSMA.</description>

      <title>Channel Capacity-Aware Distributed Encoding for Multi-View Sensing and Edge Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) unifies wireless communication and sensing by sharing spectrum and hardware, which often incurs trade-offs between two functions due to limited resources. However, this paper shifts focus to exploring the synergy between communication and sensing, using WiFi sensing as an exemplary scenario where communication signals are repurposed to probe the environment without dedicated sensing waveforms, followed by data uploading to the edge server for inference. While increased device participation enhances multi-view sensing data, it also imposes significant communication overhead between devices and the edge server. To address this challenge, we aim to maximize the sensing task performance, measured by mutual information, under the channel capacity constraint. The information-theoretic optimization problem is solved by the proposed ADE-MI, a novel framework that employs a two-stage optimization two-stage optimization approach: (1) adaptive distributed encoding (ADE) at the device, which ensures transmitted bits are most relevant to sensing tasks, and (2) multi-view Inference (MI) at the edge server, which orchestrates multi-view data from distributed devices. Our experimental results highlight the synergy between communication and sensing, showing that more frequent communication from WiFi access points to edge devices improves sensing inference accuracy. The proposed ADE-MI achieves 92\% recognition accuracy with over $10^4$-fold reduction in latency compared to schemes with raw data communication, achieving both high sensing inference accuracy and low communication latency simultaneously.</description>

      <title>A New Finite-Horizon Dynamic Programming Analysis of Nonanticipative Rate-Distortion Function for Markov Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the computation of a non-asymptotic lower bound by means of the nonanticipative rate-distortion function (NRDF) on the discrete-time zero-delay variable-rate lossy compression problem for discrete Markov sources with per-stage, single-letter distortion. First, we derive a new information structure of the NRDF for Markov sources and single-letter distortions. Second, we derive new convexity results on the NRDF, which facilitate the use of Lagrange duality theorem to cast the problem as an unconstrained partially observable finite-time horizon stochastic dynamic programming (DP) algorithm subject to a probabilistic state (belief state) that summarizes the past information about the reproduction symbols and takes values in a continuous state space. Instead of approximating the DP algorithm directly, we use Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to find an implicit closed-form expression of the optimal control policy of the stochastic DP (i.e., the minimizing distribution of the NRDF) and approximate the control policy and the cost-to-go function (a function of the rate) stage-wise, via a novel dynamic alternating minimization (AM) approach, that is realized by an offline algorithm operating using backward recursions, with provable convergence guarantees. We obtain the clean values of the aforementioned quantities using an online (forward) algorithm operating for any finite-time horizon. Our methodology provides an approximate solution to the exact NRDF solution, which becomes near-optimal as the search space of the belief state becomes sufficiently large at each time stage. We corroborate our theoretical findings with simulation studies where we apply our algorithms assuming time-varying and time-invariant binary Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Wideband Ultrasonic Acoustic Underwater Channels: Measurements and Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present the results of a measurement campaign carried out in the Mediterranean sea aimed at characterizing the underwater acoustic channel in a wideband at ultrasonic frequencies centered at 80 kHz with a width of 96 kHz, covering two octaves from 32 to 128 kHz. So far, these type of wideband measurements are not found in the literature. Periodic orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFMD) sounding signals using Zadoff-Chu sequences have been specially designed for this purpose. The collected data has been post-processed to estimate the time-variant impulse and frequency responses and relevant parameters for system design like the time coherence, bandwidth coherence, delay spread and Doppler bandwidth. The statistical behavior of the channel gain random fluctuation has also been analyzed. This information has been extracted for both the global channel and each path separately. The wide bandwidth of the measurements have allowed the characterization of the channel in a scarcely explored ultrasonic band with an accuracy that is far beyond what is reported in previous works.</description>

      <title>COST CA20120 INTERACT Framework of Artificial Intelligence Based Channel Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel models are the prerequisite for communication-theoretic investigations as well as system design. Channel modeling generally relies on statistical and deterministic approaches. However, there are still significant limits for the traditional modeling methods in terms of accuracy, generalization ability, and computational complexity. The fundamental reason is that establishing a quantified and accurate mapping between physical environment and channel characteristics becomes increasing challenging for modern communication systems. Here, in the context of COST CA20120 Action, we evaluate and discuss the feasibility and implementation of using artificial intelligence (AI) for channel modeling, and explore where the future of this field lies. Firstly, we present a framework of AI-based channel modeling to characterize complex wireless channels. Then, we highlight in detail some major challenges and present the possible solutions: i) estimating the uncertainty of AI-based channel predictions, ii) integrating prior knowledge of propagation to improve generalization capabilities, and iii) interpretable AI for channel modeling. We present and discuss illustrative numerical results to showcase the capabilities of AI-based channel modeling.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Perspective on the Injective Norm of Sums of Random Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix concentration inequalities, intimately connected to the Non-Commutative Khintchine inequality, have been an important tool in both applied and pure mathematics. We study tensor versions of these inequalities, and establish non-asymptotic inequalities for the $\ell_p$ injective norm of random tensors with correlated entries. In certain regimes of $p$ and the tensor order, our tensor concentration inequalities are nearly optimal in their dimension dependencies. We illustrate our result with applications to problems including structured models of random tensors and matrices, tensor PCA, and connections to lower bounds in coding theory.
  Our techniques are based on covering number estimates as opposed to operator theoretic tools, which also provide a geometric proof of a weaker version of the Non-Commutative Khintchine inequality, motivated by a question of Talagrand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore an approach to actively plan and excite contact modes in differentiable simulators as a means to tighten the sim-to-real gap. We propose an optimal experimental design approach derived from information-theoretic methods to identify and search for information-rich contact modes through the use of contact-implicit optimization. We demonstrate our approach on a robot parameter estimation problem with unknown inertial and kinematic parameters which actively seeks contacts with a nearby surface. We show that our approach improves the identification of unknown parameter estimates over experimental runs by an estimate error reduction of at least $\sim 84\%$ when compared to a random sampling baseline, with significantly higher information gains.</description>

The original RPN model was designed under the assumption of input data independence, presuming the independence among both individual instances within data batches and attributes in each data instance. However, this assumption often proves invalid for function learning tasks involving complex, interdependent data such as language, images, time series, and graphs. Ignoring such data interdependence may inevitably lead to significant performance degradation.
  To overcome these limitations, we introduce the new Reconciled Polynomial Network (version 2), namely RPN 2, in this paper. By incorporating data and structural interdependence functions, RPN 2 explicitly models data interdependence via new component functions in its architecture.
  This enhancement not only significantly improves RPN 2's learning performance but also substantially expands its unifying potential, enabling it to encompass a broader range of contemporary dominant backbone models within its canonical representation. These backbones include, but are not limited to, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and Transformers. Our analysis reveals that the fundamental distinctions among these backbone models primarily stem from their diverse approaches to defining the interdependence functions. Furthermore, this unified representation opens up new opportunities for designing innovative architectures with the potential to surpass the performance of these dominant backbones.</description>

      <title>Improved PIR Schemes using Matching Vectors and Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct new t-server Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes with communication complexity subpolynomial in the previously best known, for all but finitely many t. Our results are based on combining derivatives (in the spirit of Woodruff-Yekhanin) with the Matching Vector based PIRs of Yekhanin and Efremenko. Previously such a combination was achieved in an ingenious way by Dvir and Gopi, using polynomials and derivatives over certain exotic rings, en route to their fundamental result giving the first 2-server PIR with subpolynomial communication.
  Our improved PIRs are based on two ingredients:
  - We develop a new and direct approach to combine derivatives with Matching Vector based PIRs. This approach is much simpler than that of Dvir-Gopi: it works over the same field as the original PIRs, and only uses elementary properties of polynomials and derivatives.
  - A key subproblem that arises in the above approach is a higher-order polynomial interpolation problem. We show how "sparse S-decoding polynomials", a powerful tool from the original constructions of Matching Vector PIRs, can be used to solve this higher-order polynomial interpolation problem using surprisingly few higer-order evaluations.
  Using the known sparse S-decoding polynomials, in combination with our ideas leads to our improved PIRs. Notably, we get a 3-server PIR scheme with communication $2^{O^{\sim}( (\log n)^{1/3}) }$, improving upon the previously best known communication of $2^{O^{\sim}( \sqrt{\log n})}$ due to Efremenko.</description>

      <title>Rank Resilience of Pattern Matrices against Structured Perturbations with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.11490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In structured system theory, a pattern matrix is a matrix with entries either fixed to zero or free to take arbitrary numbers. The (generic) rank of a pattern matrix is the rank of almost all its realizations. The resilience of various system properties is closely tied to the rank resilience of the corresponding pattern matrices. Yet, existing literature predominantly explores the latter aspect by focusing on perturbations that change the zero-nonzero structure of pattern matrices, corresponding to link additions/deletions. In this paper, we consider the rank resilience of pattern matrices against structured perturbations that can arbitrarily alter the values of a prescribed set of entries, corresponding to link weight variations. We say a pattern matrix is structurally rank $r$ resilient against a perturbation pattern if almost all realizations of this pattern matrix have a rank not less than $r$ under arbitrary complex-valued realizations of the perturbation pattern. We establish a generic property in this concept. We then present combinatorial necessary and sufficient conditions for a rectangular pattern matrix to lose full rank under given perturbation patterns. We also generalize them to obtain a sufficient condition and a necessary one for losing an arbitrarily prescribed rank. We finally show our results can be applied to the resilience analysis of various properties of structured (descriptor) systems, including controllability and input-state observability, as well as characterizing zero structurally fixed modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of reliable and efficient codes for channels with feedback remains a longstanding challenge in communication theory. While significant improvements have been achieved by leveraging deep learning techniques, neural codes often suffer from high computational costs, a lack of interpretability, and limited practicality in resource-constrained settings. We focus on designing low-complexity coding schemes that are interpretable and more suitable for communication systems. We advance both analytical and neural codes. First, we demonstrate that PowerBlast, an analytical coding scheme inspired by Schalkwijk-Kailath (SK) and Gallager-Nakibo\u{g}lu (GN) schemes, achieves notable reliability improvements over both SK and GN schemes, outperforming neural codes in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. Next, to enhance reliability in low-SNR regions, we propose LightCode, a lightweight neural code that achieves state-of-the-art reliability while using a fraction of memory and compute compared to existing deeplearning-based codes. Finally, we systematically analyze the learned codes, establishing connections between LightCode and PowerBlast, identifying components crucial for performance, and providing interpretation aided by linear regression analysis.</description>

      <title>Splitting Messages in the Dark- Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for FDD Massive MIMO Without CSI Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A critical hindrance in realizing frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems is the overhead associated with the downlink (DL) channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) acquisition. To address this, we propose a novel framework that eliminates the need for CSI feedback, while achieving robust sum spectral efficiency (SE). Specifically, by leveraging partial frequency invariance of channel parameters, we reconstruct the DL CSIT using uplink (UL) pilots with the 2D-Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-NOMP) algorithm. Due to discrepancies between the two disjoint bands, however, perfect DL CSIT acquisition is infeasible; resulting in multi-user interference (MUI). To account for this, we reformulate the sum SE maximization problem using the reconstructed channel and its error covariance matrix (ECM). Then, we propose an ECM estimation method based on the observed Fisher information matrix and introduce a precoder optimization technique with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). Our simulation results verify the validity of the proposed framework in the practical FDD massive MIMO scenarios, highlighting the essential role of ECM estimation in mitigating MUI to attain RSMA gains.</description>

      <title>Leveraging partial stragglers within gradient coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within distributed learning, workers typically compute gradients on their assigned dataset chunks and send them to the parameter server (PS), which aggregates them to compute either an exact or approximate version of $\nabla L$ (gradient of the loss function $L$). However, in large-scale clusters, many workers are slower than their promised speed or even failure-prone. A gradient coding solution introduces redundancy within the assignment of chunks to the workers and uses coding theoretic ideas to allow the PS to recover $\nabla L$ (exactly or approximately), even in the presence of stragglers. Unfortunately, most existing gradient coding protocols are inefficient from a computation perspective as they coarsely classify workers as operational or failed; the potentially valuable work performed by slow workers (partial stragglers) is ignored. In this work, we present novel gradient coding protocols that judiciously leverage the work performed by partial stragglers. Our protocols are efficient from a computation and communication perspective and numerically stable. For an important class of chunk assignments, we present efficient algorithms for optimizing the relative ordering of chunks within the workers; this ordering affects the overall execution time. For exact gradient reconstruction, our protocol is around $2\times$ faster than the original class of protocols and for approximate gradient reconstruction, the mean-squared-error of our reconstructed gradient is several orders of magnitude better.</description>

      <title>Risk Bounds on MDL Estimators for Linear Regression Models with Application to Simple ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To investigate the theoretical foundations of deep learning from the viewpoint of the minimum description length (MDL) principle, we analyse risk bounds of MDL estimators based on two-stage codes for simple two-layers neural networks (NNs) with ReLU activation. For that purpose, we propose a method to design two-stage codes for linear regression models and establish an upper bound on the risk of the corresponding MDL estimators based on the theory of MDL estimators originated by Barron and Cover (1991). Then, we apply this result to the simple two-layers NNs with ReLU activation which consist of $d$ nodes in the input layer, $m$ nodes in the hidden layer and one output node. Since the object of estimation is only the $m$ weights from the hidden layer to the output node in our setting, this is an example of linear regression models. As a result, we show that the redundancy of the obtained two-stage codes is small owing to the fact that the eigenvalue distribution of the Fisher information matrix of the NNs is strongly biased, which was shown by Takeishi et al. (2023) and has been refined in this paper. That is, we establish a tight upper bound on the risk of our MDL estimators. Note that our risk bound for the simple ReLU networks, of which the leading term is $O(d^2 \log n /n)$, is independent of the number of parameters $m$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Denial-of-Service Attacks Against Partially-Observable Real-Time Monitoring Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of denial-of-service attacks on the status updating of a cyber-physical system with one or more sensors connected to a remote monitor via unreliable channels. We approach the problem from the perspective of an adversary that can strategically jam a subset of the channels. The sources are modeled as Markov chains, and the performance of status updating is measured based on the age of incorrect information at the monitor. Our objective is to derive jamming policies that strike a balance between the degradation of the system's performance and the conservation of the adversary's energy. For a single-source scenario, we formulate the problem as a partially-observable Markov decision process, and rigorously prove that the optimal jamming policy is of a threshold form. We then extend the problem to a multi-source scenario. We formulate this problem as a restless multi-armed bandit, and provide a jamming policy based on the Whittle's index. Our numerical results highlight the performance of our policies compared to baseline policies.</description>

      <title>Pre-Chirp-Domain Index Modulation for Full-Diversity Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing towards 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), tailored as a superior multicarrier technique utilizing chirp signals for high-mobility communications, is envisioned as a promising candidate for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless network. AFDM is based on the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) with two adjustable parameters of the chirp signals, termed as the pre-chirp and post-chirp parameters, respectively. We show that the pre-chirp counterpart can be flexibly manipulated for additional degree-of-freedom (DoF). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel AFDM scheme with the pre-chirp index modulation (PIM) philosophy (AFDM-PIM), which can implicitly convey extra information bits through dynamic pre-chirp parameter assignment, thus enhancing both spectral and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first demonstrate that the subcarrier orthogonality is still maintained by applying distinct pre-chirp parameters to various subcarriers in the AFDM modulation process. Inspired by this property, each AFDM subcarrier is constituted with a unique pre-chirp signal according to the incoming bits. By such arrangement, extra binary bits can be embedded into the index patterns of pre-chirp parameter assignment without additional energy consumption. For performance analysis, we derive the asymptotically tight upper bounds on the average bit error rates (BERs) of the proposed schemes with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection, and validate that the proposed AFDM-PIM can achieve the optimal diversity order under doubly dispersive channels. Based on the derivations, we further propose an optimal pre-chirp alphabet design to enhance the BER performance via intelligent optimization algorithms. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed AFDM-PIM outperforms the classical benchmarks under doubly dispersive channel.</description>

      <title>Erasure Decoding for Quantum LDPC Codes via Belief Propagation with Guided Decimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a promising family of quantum error-correcting codes for fault tolerant quantum computing with low overhead. Decoding quantum LDPC codes on quantum erasure channels has received more attention recently due to advances in erasure conversion for various types of qubits including neutral atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits. Belief propagation with guided decimation (BPGD) decoding of quantum LDPC codes has demonstrated good performance in bit-flip and depolarizing noise. In this work, we apply BPGD decoding to quantum erasure channels. Using a natural modification, we show that BPGD offers competitive performance on quantum erasure channels for multiple families of quantum LDPC codes. Furthermore, we show that the performance of BPGD decoding on erasure channels can sometimes be improved significantly by either adding damping or adjusting the initial channel log-likelihood ratio for bits that are not erased. More generally, our results demonstrate BPGD is an effective general-purpose solution for erasure decoding across the quantum LDPC landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.10300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proximal splitting-based convex optimization is a promising approach to linear inverse problems because we can use some prior knowledge of the unknown variables explicitly. An understanding of the behavior of the optimization algorithms would be important for the tuning of the parameters and the development of new algorithms. In this paper, we first analyze the asymptotic property of the proximity operator for the squared loss function, which appears in the update equations of some proximal splitting methods for linear inverse problems. Our analysis shows that the output of the proximity operator can be characterized with a scalar random variable in the large system limit. Moreover, we apply the asymptotic result to the prediction of optimization algorithms for compressed sensing. Simulation results demonstrate that the MSE performance of the Douglas-Rachford algorithm can be well predicted in compressed sensing with the $\ell_{1}$ optimization. We also examine the behavior of the prediction for the case with nonconvex smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) regularization.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Neyman-Pearson Detection to Combat Strategic Evasion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The security in networked systems depends greatly on recognizing and identifying adversarial behaviors. Traditional detection methods focus on specific categories of attacks and have become inadequate for increasingly stealthy and deceptive attacks that are designed to bypass detection strategically. This work aims to develop a holistic theory to countermeasure such evasive attacks. We focus on extending a fundamental class of statistical-based detection methods based on Neyman-Pearson's (NP) hypothesis testing formulation. We propose game-theoretic frameworks to capture the conflicting relationship between a strategic evasive attacker and an evasion-aware NP detector. By analyzing both the equilibrium behaviors of the attacker and the NP detector, we characterize their performance using Equilibrium Receiver-Operational-Characteristic (EROC) curves. We show that the evasion-aware NP detectors outperform the passive ones in the way that the former can act strategically against the attacker's behavior and adaptively modify their decision rules based on the received messages. In addition, we extend our framework to a sequential setting where the user sends out identically distributed messages. We corroborate the analytical results with a case study of anomaly detection.</description>

Abstract: 6G promises a paradigm shift by integrating positioning and sensing, enhancing not only the communication performance but also enabling location- and context-aware services. Historically, positioning and sensing were focused on cost and performance tradeoffs, implying an escalated demand for resources, such as radio, physical, and computational resources, for improved performance. However, 6G expands this perspective, embracing a set of broader values, namely sustainability, inclusiveness, and trustworthiness. From a joint industrial/academic perspective, this paper aims to shed light on these important value indicators and their relationship with the conventional key performance indicators in the context of positioning and sensing.</description>

Abstract: This book delves into the burgeoning field of quantum resource theories, a novel and vibrant area of research within quantum information science that seeks to unify diverse quantum phenomena under a single framework. By recognizing various attributes of physical systems as "resources," this approach offers a fresh perspective on quantum phenomena, transforming our understanding and application of concepts such as quantum entanglement, coherence, and more. With a focus on the pedagogical, the book aims to equip readers with the advanced mathematical tools and physical principles needed to navigate and contribute to this rapidly evolving field. It covers a wide range of topics, from the foundational aspects of quantum mechanics and quantum information to detailed explorations of specific resource theories, including entanglement, asymmetry, and thermodynamics. Through rigorous mathematical exposition and a unique axiomatic approach, the book provides deep insights into the operational and conceptual frameworks that underpin quantum resource theories, making it an invaluable resource for graduate students, early-career researchers, and anyone interested in the cutting-edge developments in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence and Distinguishability: A Resource-Theoretic Perspective on Wave-Particle Duality</title>

Abstract: Wave-particle duality, the cornerstone of quantum mechanics, illustrates essential trade-offs between two complementary aspects of quantum systems. Captured by Bohr's complementarity principle, the wave-particle duality relation indicates that perfect path discrimination in a multipath interferometer obliterates interference patterns and vice versa. In this work, from the perspective of coherence resource manipulation, we uncover a novel duality relation between quantum coherence and distinguishability in ensembles of mutually orthogonal pure states. We demonstrate the sum of `co-bits', coherence preserved after discrimination, and classical bits, distinguishability extracted through perfect discrimination is bounded. One cannot simultaneously extract all classical information and preserve coherence. Such duality relation exposes an inherent trade-off between quantum coherence and classical distinguishability resources. Our findings offer a fresh perspective and advance our understanding of the intrinsic complementary relationship between quantum and classical resources.</description>

      <title>Partial Information Decomposition for Data Interpretability and Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Partial Information Decomposition of Features (PIDF), a new paradigm for simultaneous data interpretability and feature selection. Contrary to traditional methods that assign a single importance value, our approach is based on three metrics per feature: the mutual information shared with the target variable, the feature's contribution to synergistic information, and the amount of this information that is redundant. In particular, we develop a novel procedure based on these three metrics, which reveals not only how features are correlated with the target but also the additional and overlapping information provided by considering them in combination with other features. We extensively evaluate PIDF using both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating its potential applications and effectiveness, by considering case studies from genetics and neuroscience.</description>
