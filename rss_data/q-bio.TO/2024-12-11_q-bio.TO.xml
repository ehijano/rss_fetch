      <title>Efficient Representations of Cardiac Spatial Heterogeneity in Computational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally assumed that all cells in models of the electrical behavior of cardiac tissue have the same properties. However, there are differences in cardiac cells that are not well characterized but cause spatial heterogeneity of the electrical properties in tissue. Optical mapping can be used to obtain experimental data from cardiac surfaces at high spatial resolution. Variations in model parameters can be defined on a coarser grid than considering each single pixel, which would allow a representation of heterogeneous tissue to be obtained more efficiently. Here, we address how coarse the parameterization grid can be while still obtaining accurate results for complicated dynamical states of spatially discordant alternans. We use the Fenton-Karma model with heterogeneity included as a smooth nonlinear gradient over space for more model parameters. To obtain the more efficient representations, we set parameter values everywhere in space based on the assumption that the exact parameter values are known at the points of the coarser grid; we assume the parameter values could be obtained from experimental data. We assign parameter values in space by fitting either a piecewise-constant or piecewise-linear function to the spatially coarse known data. We wish to identify the maximal grid spacing of such points to obtain good agreement with spatial profiles of action potential duration during complex states. We find that coarse grid spacing of about 1.0-1.6 cm generally results in spatial profiles that agree well with the true profiles for a range of different model parameters and different functions of those parameters over space. In addition, the piecewise-constant and piecewise-linear functions perform similarly. Our results to date suggest that matching the output of models of cardiac tissue to heterogeneous experimental data can be done efficiently, even during complex dynamical states.</description>

      <title>Poromechanical modelling of the time-dependent response of in vivo human skin during extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a proof of concept application of a biphasic constitutive model to identify the mechanical properties of in vivo human skin under extension. Although poromechanics theory has been extensively used to model other soft biological tissues, only a few studies have been published for skin, and most have been limited to ex vivo or in silico conditions. However, in vivo procedures are crucial to determine the subject-specific properties at different body sites. This study focuses on cyclic uni-axial extension of the upper arm skin, using unpublished data collected by Chambert et al. Our analysis shows that a two-layer finite element model allows representing all relevant features of the observed mechanical response to the imposed external loading, which was composed, in this contribution, of four loading-sustaining-unloading cycles. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the calibrated model and the measured Force-time response was 8.84e-3 N. Our biphasic model represents a preliminary step toward investigating the mechanical conditions responsible for the onset of injury. It allows for the analysis of changes in Interstitial Fluid (IF) pressure, flow, and osmotic pressure, in addition to the mechanical fields. Future work will focus on the interaction of multiple biochemical factors and the complex network of regulatory signals.</description>

      <title>Mechanical cell interactions on curved interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple mathematical model to describe the mechanical relaxation of cells within a curved epithelial tissue layer represented by an arbitrary curve in two-dimensional space. This model generalises previous one-dimensional models of flat epithelia to investigate the influence of curvature for mechanical relaxation. We represent the mechanics of a cell body either by straight springs, or by curved springs that follow the curve's shape. To understand the collective dynamics of the cells, we devise an appropriate continuum limit in which the number of cells and the length of the substrate are constant but the number of springs tends to infinity. In this limit, cell density is governed by a diffusion equation in arc length coordinates, where diffusion may be linear or nonlinear depending on the choice of the spring restoring force law. Our results have important implications about modelling cells on curved geometries: (i) curved and straight springs can lead to different dynamics when there is a finite number of springs, but they both converge quadratically to the dynamics governed by the diffusion equation; (ii) in the continuum limit, the curvature of the tissue does not affect the mechanical relaxation of cells within the layer nor their tangential stress; (iii) a cell's normal stress depends on curvature due to surface tension induced by the tangential forces. Normal stress enables cells to sense substrate curvature at length scales much larger than their cell body, and could induce curvature dependences in experiments.</description>
