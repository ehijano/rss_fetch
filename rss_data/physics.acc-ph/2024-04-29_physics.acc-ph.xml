      <title>Analytical approach to the design of RF photoinjector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this thesis is to ascertain the dimensions of an RF 2.856GHz photoinjector through a combination of analytical and computational approaches. The phase velocity within a single cavity exceeds 'c', rendering it inadequate for storing the requisite energy for beam acceleration. To surmount this limitation, we aim to devise a multi-celled cavity design. However, the alterations in electromagnetic fields and resonant frequency within the multi-celled cavity are intricate and sensitive, presenting challenges in obtaining precise dimensions solely via computer simulations. Prior to numerical methods, it is essential to analyze the photoinjector using theoretical frameworks. We employ perturbation theory and the construction of an equivalent circuit to elucidate the underlying physics of the photoinjector and the electrical oscillations within the cell structure. Detailed analytical methods for the equivalent circuit are explored. Through theoretical analysis, the dimensions and simulation outcomes can be determined quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Elements of Ion Linear Accelerators + Calm in the Resonances -- and Other Tales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main part of this book, Elements of Linear Accelerators, outlines in Part 1 a framework for non-relativistic linear accelerator focusing and accelerating channel design, simulation, optimization and analysis where space charge is an important factor. Part 1 is the most important part of the book; grasping the framework is essential to fully understand and appreciate the elements within it, and the myriad application details of the following Parts. The treatment concentrates on all linacs, large or small, intended for high-intensity, very low beam loss, factory-type application. The Radio-Frequency-Quadrupole (RFQ) is especially developed as a representative and the most complicated linac form (from dc to bunched and accelerated beam), extending to practical design of long, high energy linacs, including space charge resonances and beam halo formation, and some challenges for future work. Also a practical method is presented for designing Alternating-Phase- Focused (APF) linacs with long sequences and high energy gain. Full open-source software is available. The following part, Calm in the Resonances and Other Tales, contains eyewitness accounts of nearly 60 years of participation in accelerator technology.
  (September 2023) The LINACS codes are released at no cost and, as always, with fully open-source coding. (p.2 &amp; Ch 19.10)</description>

      <title>A New Family of High-Current Cyclotrons for Isotope Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are developing a high-current cyclotron as a driver for the IsoDAR neutrino experiment. It accelerates 5 mA H2+ to 60 MeV/amu, after which the electron is removed to produce a 10 mA, 60 MeV proton beam. The enabling innovations that offset space-charge effects occur at injection and in the first few turns, allowing one to construct cyclotrons with energies ranging from below 5 MeV up to 60 MeV/amu, or possibly higher, with the same performance for accelerated ions with Q/A = 0.5 (H2+, D+, He++, ...). In this paper, we discuss the possible uses of such cyclotrons for isotope production, including production of long-lived generator parents (68Ga, 44Ti, 82Sr,...), as well as intense fast neutron beams from deuteron breakup for (n,2n) production of isotopes like 225Ac.</description>
