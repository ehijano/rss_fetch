      <title>Radiative cooling capacity on Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By passively dissipating thermal emission into the ultracold deep space, radiative cooling (RC) is an environment-friendly means for gaining cooling capacity, paving a bright future for global energy saving and carbon dioxide reduction. However, assessing the global RC capacity at the day-to-annual scale remains challenging as the RC capacity significantly depends on geographic and environmental conditions. To our knowledge, no analysis of global RC capacity has been reported. Herein, we show the distribution of RC capacity on Earth by establishing a precise assessment model for evaluating the performance of a radiative cooler. Our assessment is comprehensively validated against experimental data and extended to elucidate the capacity of representative broadband and selective cooler. We also categorize the global RC capacity into five representative regions based on the year-round cooling power. Our assessment can inform trade-offs between design and practical application for the RC systems, alongside promoting RC-based technologies to tackle worldwide energy and environment challenges.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for physically-realizable kagome metamaterials and its implications on dualities and topological edge modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of topological modes in idealized ball-and-spring kagome lattices, significant efforts have been devoted to realizing mechanical analogues of these ideal lattices via practical fabrication techniques. While numerical and experimental characterizations of these mechanical analogues have been reported, theoretical modeling that accounts for realistic structural effects (e.g., the bending behavior of thin ligaments-a departure from ideal hinges allowing free rotation) has been lacking. Here we propose a theoretical framework to investigate the dynamic properties of physically-realizable kagome metamaterials consisting of solid triangles and ligaments, in which triangles and ligaments are modeled as rigid bodies and elastic springs, respectively. By applying the framework, validated through finite element analysis, to twisted and deformed kagome metamaterials, we theoretically show the required conditions for achieving certain unique dynamic properties, including dispersion dualities and topological edge modes. The presented study unequivocally reveals the effects of structural components on these properties, which could enable new design strategies for wave propagation manipulation in kagome-based metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relationship of phononic generalized beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive method for determining the dispersion relation in one-dimensional waveguides, applicable to a wide range of structures, regardless of their specific characteristics. This general framework employs a unified mathematical model, referred to as *generalized beams*, where varying types of waveguides and scatterers are incorporated by adjusting certain parameters. The generalized beam consists of a host waveguide, which is a homogeneous elastic structure with physical properties represented in matrix form. The model also accounts for an arbitrary set of scatterers within the unit cell, including resonators (discrete and continuous), small material inclusions, or variations in cross-sectional area. Based on general assumptions, we develop a matrix-based algorithm utilizing the plane wave expansion method to derive the solution. Additionally, we propose an iterative procedure that provides analytical expressions for the first- and second-order terms, particularly useful in the context of weak scattering. The convergence conditions of the method are rigorously defined. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through several numerical examples, highlighting its versatility in different waveguide configurations and scattering scenarios.</description>

      <title>Focused helium ion beam nanofabrication by near-surface swelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focused helium ion beam microscope is a versatile imaging and nanofabrication instrument enabling direct-write lithography with sub-10-nm resolution. Subsurface damage and swelling of substrates due to helium ion implantation is generally unwanted. However, these effects can also be leveraged for specific nanofabrication tasks. To explore this, we investigate focused helium ion beam induced swelling of bulk crystalline silicon and free-standing amorphous silicon nitride membranes using various irradiation strategies. We show that the creation of near-surface voids due to helium ion implantation can be used to induce surface nanostructure and create subsurface nanochannels. By tailoring the ion dose and beam energy, the size and depth of the swollen features can be controlled. Swelling heights of several hundred nanometers are demonstrated and for the embedded nanochannels, void internal diameters down to 30nm are shown. Potential applications include the engineering of texturized substrates and the prototyping of on-chip nanofluidic transport devices.</description>

      <title>Thickness dependence of the mechanical properties of piezoelectric high-$Q_m$ nanomechanical resonators made from aluminium nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators with high quality factors ($Q_m$) enable mechanics-based quantum technologies, in particular quantum sensing and quantum transduction. High-$Q_m$ nanomechanical resonators in the kHz to MHz frequency range can be realized in tensile-strained thin films that allow the use of dissipation dilution techniques to drastically increase $Q_m$. In our work, we study the material properties of tensile-strained piezoelectric films made from aluminium nitride (AlN). We characterize crystalline AlN films with a thickness ranging from 45nm to 295nm, which are directly grown on Si(111) by metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy. We report on the crystal quality and surface roughness, the piezoelectric response, and the residual and released stress of the AlN thin films. Importantly, we determine the intrinsic quality factor of the films at room temperature in high vacuum. We fabricate and characterize AlN nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution to enhance the intrinsic quality factor by utilizing the tensile strain in the film. We find that AlN nanomechanical resonators below 200nm thickness exhibit the highest $Q_m\cdot f_m$-product, on the order of $10^{12}$Hz. We discuss possible strategies to optimize the material growth that should lead to devices that reach even higher $Q_m\cdot f_m$-products. This will pave the way for future advancements of optoelectromechanical quantum devices made from tensile-strained piezoelectric AlN.</description>

      <title>High order ADER-DG method with local DG predictor for solutions of differential-algebraic systems of equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical method ADER-DG with a local DG predictor for solving a DAE system has been developed, which was based on the formulation of ADER-DG methods using a local DG predictor for solving ODE and PDE systems. The basis functions were chosen in the form of Lagrange interpolation polynomials with nodal points at the roots of the Radau polynomials, which differs from the classical formulations of the ADER-DG method, where it is customary to use the roots of Legendre polynomials. It was shown that the use of this basis leads to A-stability and L1-stability in the case of using the DAE solver as ODE solver. The numerical method ADER-DG allows one to obtain a highly accurate numerical solution even on very coarse grids, with a step greater than the main characteristic scale of solution variation. The local discrete time solution can be used as a numerical solution of the DAE system between grid nodes, thereby providing subgrid resolution even in the case of very coarse grids. The classical test examples were solved by developed numerical method ADER-DG. With increasing index of the DAE system, a decrease in the empirical convergence orders p is observed. An unexpected result was obtained in the numerical solution of the stiff DAE system -- the empirical convergence orders of the numerical solution obtained using the developed method turned out to be significantly higher than the values expected for this method in the case of stiff problems. It turns out that the use of Lagrange interpolation polynomials with nodal points at the roots of the Radau polynomials is much better suited for solving stiff problems. Estimates showed that the computational costs of the ADER-DG method are approximately comparable to the computational costs of implicit Runge-Kutta methods used to solve DAE systems. Methods were proposed to reduce the computational costs of the ADER-DG method.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependent conductivity of nanometric semiconductor thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of semiconductor thin films that are only a few nanomenters thick. In spite of intense research, the thickness-dependent resistivity or conductivity of semiconductor thin films is not understood at a fundamental physical level. We develop a theory based on quantum confinement which yields the dependence of the concentration of intrinsic carriers on the film thickness. The theory predicts that the resistivity $\rho$, in the 1-10 nm thickness range, increases exponentially as $\rho \sim \exp(const/L^{1/2})$ upon decreasing the film thickness $L$. This law is able to reproduce the remarkable increase in resistivity observed experimentally in Si thin films, whereas the effect of surface scattering (Fuchs-Sondheimer theory) alone cannot explain the data when the film thickness is lower than 10 nm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 500-nm-thick $\mathrm{In}_{x}\mathrm{Ga}_{1-x}\mathrm{N}$ layers with $x=$ 0.05-0.14 are grown using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy, and their properties are assessed by a comprehensive analysis involving x-ray diffraction, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and cathodoluminescence as well as photoluminescence spectroscopy. We demonstrate low degrees of strain relaxation (10% for $x=0.12$), low threading dislocation densities ($\mathrm{1\times10^{9}\,cm^{-2}}$ for $x=0.12$), uniform composition both in the growth and lateral direction, and a narrow emission band. The unique sum of excellent materials properties make these layers an attractive basis for the top-down fabrication of ternary nanowires.</description>

      <title>Anomalous length dependent conductance of quasi-one-dimensional molecular wires assembled from metal superatoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular wires with high electrical conductance are desirable components for future molecular-scale circuitry. However, their conductance typically decays exponentially with increasing length. Here, we report a novel discovery that the conductivity of a nanoscale molecular wire assembled from metal superatoms increases with length. Specifically, high-precision first-principles calculations show that, while the conductance of quasi-one-dimensional superatomic assemblies formed with individual W@Cu12 superatoms as units exhibits a slow decay with increasing length, by extending the quasi-one-dimensional superatomic assemblies into bundle-like structures, their electrical conductivity increases with length, accompanied by a change in the corresponding decay factor from 1.25 nm-1 to -0.95 nm-1. This significant change in the decay factor originates from that the Fermi level of the superatomic assemblies shifts closer to the Fermi level of the electrodes, thereby reducing the tunneling barrier. Our findings highlight that molecular-scale devices exhibiting a negative decay factor are not an inherent characteristic, but rather can be regulated through structural modulation. This work not only provides theoretical references for modulating the performance of molecular-scale circuitry, but also opens up the application prospect of metal superatoms in electrical transport field.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Algebra Made Simple for Thermoelectric Generator Module Performance Prediction under Constant Seebeck-Coefficient Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While thermoelectric material performances can be estimated using the ZT, predicting the performance of thermoelectric generator modules (TGMs) is complex due to the non-linearity and non-locality of the thermoelectric differential equations. Here, we present a simplified thermoelectric algebra framework for predicting TGM performance within the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation (CSA). First, we revisit the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Model (CSM) to transform the differential equations into exact algebraic equations for thermoelectric heat flux and conversion efficiency in terms of the load resistance ratio and relative Fourier heat flux. Next, we introduce the CSA, where the Thomson term is neglected, and the device parameters are assumed to be fixed. We define average thermoelectric properties and device parameters at the zero-current condition using a simple temperature integral. Finally, we derive approximate thermoelectric algebraic equations for voltage, resistance, heat flux, and conversion efficiency as functions of current. We numerically validate that the CSA formalism is superior to other single-parameter theories, such as peak-ZT, integral-ZT, and the generic engineering-ZT, in predicting efficiency. The relative standard error in optimal efficiency is less than 11% for average ZT values not exceeding 2. By combining CSM and CSA, TGM performance can be easily estimated without the need for calculus or solving differential equations.</description>

      <title>Transition between cooperative emission regimes in giant perovskite nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions between emitters within an ensemble can give rise to cooperative processes that significantly alter the properties of the emitted light. One such process is superfluorescence (SF), where excited electric dipoles spontaneously couple coherently and effectively radiate as one macroscopic emitter. It requires low energetic disorder, high temporal coherence and oscillator strength, and sub-wavelength volumes of material can be sufficient. Conversely, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) originates from an avalanche-like stimulated amplification of initially spontaneously emitted photons and does not necessitate temporally coherent interactions among the emitters, but rather requires spatially long enough light propagation within the material to harvest the optical gain. Cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are one of the very few materials where both ASE (in disordered films) and SF (in ordered assemblies) were observed, however leaving unclear whether and how these regimes could be connected. Here, we demonstrate that temperature and excitation density can drive the transition between both regimes in a thin film of giant CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs. At temperatures below 45 K, excitonic SF was observed, whereas above a transition range between 45 K and 100 K, ASE prevails, but requires increased optical excitation and emitter density. Our results work out the different collective effects present in lead halide perovskites, providing fundamental insights into cooperative phenomena and important guidance for the development of compact and bright (quantum) light sources.</description>

      <title>Laser-FLASH: radiobiology at high dose, ultra-high dose-rate, single pulse laser-driven proton source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-driven proton sources have long been developed with an eye on their potential for medical application to radiation therapy. These sources are compact, versatile, and show peculiar characteristics such as extreme instantaneous dose rates, short duration and broad energy spectrum. Typical temporal modality of laser-driven irradiation, the so-called fast-fractionation, results from the composition of multiple, temporally separated, ultra-short dose fractions. In this paper we present the use of a high-energy laser system for delivering the target dose in a single nanosecond pulse, for ultra-fast irradiation of biological samples. A transport line composed by two permanent magnet quadrupoles and a scattering system is used to improve the dose profile and to control the delivered dose-per-pulse. A single-shot dosimetry protocol for the broad-spectrum proton source using Monte Carlo simulations was developed. Doses as high as 20Gy could be delivered in a single shot, lasting less than 10ns over a 1.0cm diameter sample holder, at a dose-rate exceeding 10^9 Gy/s. Exploratory application of extreme laser-driven irradiation conditions, falling within the FLASH irradiation protocol, are presented for in vitro and in vivo irradiation are presented. A reduction of radiation-induced oxidative stress in-vitro and radiation-induced developmental damage in vivo were observed, whereas anti-tumoral efficacy was confirmed by cell survival assay.</description>

Abstract: Photonic memory is an important building block to delay, route and buffer optical information, for instance in optical interconnects or for recurrent optical signal processing. Photonic-phononic memory based on stimulated Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering (SBS) has been demonstrated as a coherent optical storage approach with broad bandwidth, frequency selectivity and intrinsic nonreciprocity. Here, we experimentally demonstrated the storage of quadrature-phase encoded data at room temperature and at cryogenic temperatures. We store and retrieve the 2-bit states $\{00, 01, 10, 11\}$ encoded as optical pulses with the phases $\{0, {\pi}/2 , {\pi}, 3{\pi}/2\}$ - a quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) signal. The 2-bit signals are retrieved from the acoustic domain with a global phase rotation of ${\pi}$, which is inherent in the process due to SBS. We also demonstrate full phase control over the retrieved data based on two different handles: by detuning slightly from the SBS resonance, or by changing the storage time in the memory scheme we can cover the full range $[0, 2{\pi})$. At a cryogenic temperature of 3.9 K, we have increased readout efficiency as well as gained access to longer storage times, which results in a detectable signal at 140 ns. All in all, the work sets the cornerstone for optoacoustic memory schemes with phase-encoded data</description>

Abstract: The extensions of the classical Debye model of susceptibility of dielectric materials to the well-known Cole-Cole, Davidson- Cole, or the Havriliak-Negami models is done by introducing non-integer power parameters to the frequency-domain function. This is very often necessary in order to account for anomalous deviations of the experimental data from the ideal case. The corresponding time-domain descriptions expressed in terms of the relaxation or response functions are in the form of first-order differential equations for the case of Debye model, but involves relatively complex integro-differential operators for the modified ones. In this work, we study the extension of the time-domain kinetic equation describing the Debye polarization function to include two extra degrees of freedom; one to transform the first-order time derivative of the polarization function to the Caputo fractional-order time derivative and another to change the linear term to a power term. From an electrical perspective, it results in a constant-phase element with two fractional parameters.</description>

Abstract: Fractal is an intriguing geometry with self-similarity and non-integer dimensions, the elastic-wave topological phase based on fractal structures has not been revealed up to now. In this work, elastic-wave higher-order topological states in fractal structures are investigated. Elastic real-space quantized quadrupole moment is calculated and used to characterize the topology of elastic fractal metamaterials, and formation conditions of topological phase transitions in elastic fractal systems are revealed. The topological edge and corner states of elastic waves in fractal structures are realized theoretically and experimentally. It is found that different from the acoustic fractal system, the topological outer and inner edge states can emerge separately in elastic fractal systems, which is important for the integrated sensing and particle manipulation in microfluidics. Besides, the results show that the robustness of the topological corner states in rhombus fractal structures is obviously stronger than that in Sierpinski fractal structures, and the physical mechanism is clarified. Compared with traditional elastic-wave topological insulators based on periodic structures, the richness of topological states in elastic fractal structures is much higher (for the Sierpinski fractal structure, the number of topological states is 156, much greater than that of the periodic structure (only 28)), which is vital in integrated sensing and energy-location applications. The topological phenomena of elastic fractal systems revealed in this work, provides an unprecedented way of controlling elastic waves, enriches the topological physics of elastic systems and breaks the limitation of that relying on periodic elastic structures. The results have great application prospects in high-Q resonators, high-resolution elastic-wave energy locations, energy harvester, and high-sensitivity sensors.</description>

      <title>Polarization-dependent resonant phenomena in all-dielectric scatterers: inversion of magnetic inductance and electric displacement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theoretical description and experimental verification of resonant phenomena in electromagnetic fields generated in the near zone of all-dielectric rectangular thin sub wavelength frames, subjected to an incident microwave, is considered. The geometry of considered problems is presented by means of arrangements of these frames in three orthogonal planes, normal respectively to electric component, magnetic component and wave vector of the incident wave. Such trio paves the way to design of 3D all-dielectric multiresonant microwave unit cell. Displacement currents, generated by linearly polarized electromagnetic waves in the system, lead to the formation of magnetic and electric dipoles, each of which possess own resonant frequency. Resonant inversion of magnetic inductance and electric displacement is observed. The sliding incidence of plane wave on the frame is shown to provide the sharp and deep resonance in the components of generated field. The phase shift equal to $\pi$ between the magnetic components of incident and generated wave indicates the formation of negative magnetic response. There observes the angular anisotropy of arising dipoles, manifested in values of resonance frequencies and in the dependence of depths of resonant spectral dips upon the orientation of dipoles, with respect to the direction of propagation of incident wave.</description>

      <title>Integral Micromorphic Model Reproducing Dispersion in 1D Continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper develops a new integral micromorphic elastic continuum model, which can describe dispersion properties of band-gap metamaterials, i.e., metamaterials that inhibit propagation of waves in a certain frequency range. The enrichment consists in nonlocal averaging of three terms in the expression for the potential energy density of the standard micromorphic continuum. After proper calibration, such a formulation can exactly reproduce two given branches of the dispersion curve (acoustic and optical), even in cases with a band gap. The calibration process exploits Fourier images of the unknown weight functions, which are analytically deduced from the dispersion relation of the material of interest. The weight functions are then reconstructed in the spatial domain by numerical evaluation of the inverse Fourier transform. The presented approach is validated on several examples, including a discrete mass-spring chain with two alternating masses, for which the dispersion relation has an explicit analytical form and the optical and acoustic branches are separated by a band gap.</description>

      <title>Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states boost odd-frequency superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict that the occurence of zero energy Yu-Shiba-Rusinov(YSR) bound states in two different setups, metal-spin flipper-metal-s-wave superconductor ($N_{1}-sf-N_{2}-S$) and superconductor-metal-spin flipper-metal-superconductor ($S-N_{1}-sf-N_{2}-S$) junctions, can generate multi-fold enhancement of surface-induced odd-frequency superconductivity. On the other hand, in the absence of these bound states, even-frequency superconductivity dominates. Specifically, in a $S-N_{1}-sf-N_{2}-S$ Josephson junction, the emergence of zero energy YSR bound states leads to a $0-\pi$ junction transition and surface odd-frequency superconductivity dominance. Notably, odd-frequency superconductivity vanishes in the absence of YSR-bound states. Interestingly, the equal spin-triplet pairing is the dominant component in the surface induced odd-frequency superconductivity in both setups, which could have important implications for superconducting spintronics. Overall, our findings may help to detect the presence of YSR-bound states through the observation of surface induced odd-frequency superconductivity and contribute to a better understanding of their relationship.</description>

      <title>Performance of graphene Hall effect sensors: role of bias current, disorder and Fermi velocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene Hall effect magnetic field sensors hold great promise for the development of ultra-sensitive magnetometers. Their performance is frequently analysed using the two-channel model where electron and hole conductivities are simply added. Unfortunately, this model is unable to capture all the features of the sensor, particularly the bias current dependence of the magnetic field sensitivity. Here we present an advanced model that provides an in-depth understanding of how graphene Hall sensors operate, and demonstrate its ability to quantitatively assess their performance. First, we report the fabrication of sensors with different qualities of graphene, with the best devices achieving magnetic field sensitivities as high as 5000 ohms/T, outperforming the best silicon and narrow-gap semiconductor-based sensors. Then, we examine their performance in detail using the proposed numerical model, which combines Boltzmann formalism, with distinct Fermi levels for electrons and holes, and a new method for the introduction of substrate-induced electron-hole puddles. Importantly, the dependences of magnetic field sensitivity on bias current, disorder, substrate and Hall bar geometry are quantitatively reproduced for the first time. In addition, the model emphasizes that the performance of devices with widths of the order of the charge carrier diffusion length, is significantly affected by the bias current due to the occurrence of large and non-symmetric carrier accumulation and depletion areas near the edges of the Hall bar. The formation of these areas induces a transverse diffusion particle flux capable of counterbalancing the particle flux induced by the Lorentz force when the Hall electric field cancels out in the ambipolar regime. Finally, we discuss how sensor performance can be enhanced by Fermi velocity engineering, paving the way for future ultra-sensitive graphene Hall effect sensors.</description>

      <title>Measuring Absolute Velocities from Non-Equilibrium Oscillations via Single-Detector 3D Dynamic Light Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-detector 3D dynamic light scattering (3D-DLS) emerges as a reliable technique to determine the drift velocity of out-of-equilibrium colloidal particles. In particular, our investigation reveals the appearance of oscillations of a well-defined frequency in the autocorrelation function of the scattered intensity when particles are immersed in a medium exposed to thermally induced convection. These oscillations arise as a consequence of the directed motion of particles due to the convective motion of the fluid. The experimental results obtained for different colloidal systems are corroborated by a theoretical model and thoroughly validated with fluid dynamics and Brownian dynamics simulations. The excellent agreement between experimental, theoretical and simulation data allows us to provide a solid and comprehensive explanation of the observed physical phenomena. This study via advanced dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique offers insights into the field of non-equilibrium particle dynamics, applicable not only to colloidal suspension affected by steady-state diffusion-convection but also to other non-equilibrium situations, such as systems driven by external fields (gravitational, electric or magnetic fields, among others).</description>

      <title>Transport resistance strikes back: unveiling its impact on fill factor losses in organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fill factor (FF) is a critical parameter for solar cell efficiency, but its analytical description is challenging due to the interplay between recombination and charge extraction processes. An often overlooked yet significant factor contributing to FF losses, beyond recombination, is the influence of charge transport. In most state-of-the-art organic solar cells, the primary limitations of the FF arise not just from non-radiative recombination but also from low conductivity. A closer look reveals that even in the highest efficiency cells, performance losses due to transport resistance are significant, highlighting the need for refined models to predict the FF accurately.
  Here, we extend the analytical model for transport resistance to a more general case. Drawing from a large set of experimental current-voltage and light intensity-dependent open-circuit voltage data, we systematically incorporate crucial details previously omitted in the model. Consequently, we introduce a straightforward set of equations to predict the FF of a solar cell, enabling the differentiation of losses attributed to recombination and transport resistance. Our study provides valuable insights into strategies for mitigating FF losses based on the experimentally validated analytical model, guiding the development of more efficient solar cell designs and optimisation strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many claims of computational advantages have been made for quantum computing over classical, but they have not been demonstrated for practical problems. Here, we present algorithms for solving time-dependent PDEs, with particular reference to fluid equations. We build on an idea based on linear combination of unitaries to simulate non-unitary, non-Hermitian quantum systems, and generate hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that efficiently perform iterative matrix-vector multiplication and matrix inversion operations. Though these algorithms are end-to-end, they require relatively low-depth quantum circuits and protect quantum advantage, with the best-case asymptotic complexities, which we show} are near-optimal. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithms by conducting: (a) fully gate level, state-vector simulations using an in-house, high performance, quantum simulator called QFlowS; (b) experiments on a real quantum device; and (c) noisy simulations using Qiskit Aer. We also provide device specifications such as error-rates (noise) and state sampling (measurement) to accurately perform convergent flow simulations on noisy devices. The results offer evidence that the proposed algorithm is amenable for use on near-term quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Uniaxially strained Fe--Co disordered alloys have emerged as promising candidates for cost-effective rare-earth-free permanent magnets due to their high magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). Using first-principles, fully relativistic calculations within the coherent potential approximation and PBE exchange-correlation potential, we explore the MAE of tetragonal Fe--Co alloys under uniaxial compression. Our results reveal a previously uncharted high-MAE region, distinct from known structures and accessible through uniaxial compression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an external cavity laser with intrinsic linewidth below 100 Hz around an operating wavelength of 852 nm, selected for its relevance to laser cooling and manipulation of cesium atoms. This system achieves a maximum CW output power of 24 mW, wavelength tunability over 15 nm, and a side-mode suppression ratio exceeding 50 dB. This performance level is facilitated by careful design of a low-loss integrated silicon nitride photonic circuit serving as the external cavity combined with commercially available semiconductor gain chips. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of compact integrated lasers with sub-kHz linewidth centering on the needs of emerging sensor concepts based on ultracold atoms and can be further extended to shorter wavelengths via selection of suitable semiconductor gain media.</description>

      <title>Windmill droplets. Optically induced rotation of biphase oil-in-water droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of microdroplet manipulation, optical tweezers have been used to form and grow droplets, to transport them, or to measure forces between droplet pairs. However, the exploration of out-of-equilibrium phenomena in optically trapped droplets remains largely uncharted. Here, we report the rotation of biphasic droplets fabricated by co-emulsifying two immiscible liquids (i.e., hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon oils) with a refractive index mismatch in water. When trapped, droplets of a specific geometry rotate around the axis of the laser beam, in what appears to be a dissipative, out-of-equilibrium phenomenon. The rotational frequency, obtained from image analysis is stable and proportional to the beam power. Remarkably, droplets that do not interact with the trapping beam can also be rotated indirectly. This is achieved by positioning the droplets at the center of a circular arrangement of multiple, sequentially activated traps. In this case, the droplet orients towards the location of the active trap by a mechanism yet to be understood. Altogether, our results demonstrate out-from-equilibrium phenomenology in optically trapped biphase droplets, which could inspire the development of devices based on them (e.g., optically induced mixing, etc.). In addition, they may shed light on fundamental principles of optical manipulation of asymmetric particles.</description>
