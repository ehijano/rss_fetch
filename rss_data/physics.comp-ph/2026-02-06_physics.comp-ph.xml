      <title>Path Sampling for Rare Events Boosted by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study by Jung et al. (Jung H, Covino R, Arjun A, et al., Nat Comput Sci. 3:334-345 (2023)) introduced Artificial Intelligence for Molecular Mechanism Discovery (AIMMD), a novel sampling algorithm that integrates machine learning to enhance the efficiency of transition path sampling (TPS). By enabling on-the-fly estimation of the committor probability and simultaneously deriving a human-interpretable reaction coordinate, AIMMD offers a robust framework for elucidating the mechanistic pathways of complex molecular processes. This commentary provides a discussion and critical analysis of the core AIMMD framework, explores its recent extensions, and offers an assessment of the method's potential impact and limitations.</description>

      <title>Numerical Evaluation of Angle-Dependent IR-Transparent Radiative Cooling Performance for Asymmetric Periodic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared (IR)-transparent passive radiative cooling (PRC) enables non-contact thermal management by regulating radiative heat exchange without direct attachment to the cooling object. While asymmetric IR transmission at a specific incidence angle -- typically normal incidence -- is often emphasized, we show that such single-angle asymmetry is neither sufficient nor predictive of practical cooling performance. In this work, we demonstrate that effective non-contact PRC requires angularly distributed asymmetric IR transparency evaluated through hemispherical integration over emission directions, rather than asymmetry at a single incidence angle. To quantify this effect, an angle-resolved full-wave electromagnetic (EM) model with Bloch periodic boundary conditions and Floquet mode decomposition is employed to compute wavelength- and angle-dependent bidirectional reflection and transmission of periodic PRC structures. The resulting EM response is coupled to an energy-balance-based thermal model to predict the transient temperature evolution of the cooling object. By comparing models that account for the full angular distribution with normal-incidence-only approximations, we show that pronounced asymmetric transmission at normal incidence is generally not preserved at oblique angles. As a result, angular integration yields only marginal cooling or may even result in net heating, whereas normal-incidence-based models can substantially overestimate cooling performance. These results establish angularly distributed asymmetric transparency as a key EM design principle for IR-transparent PRC and wide-angle asymmetric metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>The near-continuum mechanism for extended Boltzmann theory: the non-equilibrium relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collision phenomenon of polyatomic gases is described by the collision operator of extended Boltzmann equation or the energy-exchange model in particle direct simulations, for example, the Borgnakke-Larsen model. However, as a collision kernel, it dose not guarantee the entrinsic detailed balance and is not integrable. In this work, the Pullin equation, which possesses an integrable collision kernel and satisfies the detailed balance constraint, is adopted as an extended Boltzmann equation for the theoretical analysis of near-continuum relaxation mechanisms. For clarity, only the translational and rotational degrees are considered in this work. Explicit analytical expressions for the temporal relaxation of macroscopic variables, including the stress force, (translational/rotational) temperature and heat flux, are obtained at the first time. This is achieved by approximating the distribution function in mixed Hermite and Laguerre for rotation and computing the collision operator moments, enabling a direct description of macroscopic non-equilibrium evolution. Base on the same elementary moment (integral) of collision operator, the macroscopic transport coefficients is found in Chapman-Enskog framework. The long-standing speculation, that thermal conduction coefficient should be depended on the degrees of thermal non-equilibrium, is rigorously confirmed and evaluated. When thermal equilibrium is enforced, the present thermal conduction coefficients can be degenerated to the famous results of Mason and Monchick. Given the correct relaxation rate, a Rykov-type novel relaxation model for Pullin equation is proposed. It can recover the interaction of transaltional and rotatioanl heat fluxes in relaxation process, which is ignored in the widely used Rykov equation. Finally, the precision of this new Rykov-type equation is examined using a series of benchmark test cases.</description>

      <title>Penalized Likelihood Parameter Estimation for Differential Equation Models: A Computational Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation connects mathematical models to real-world data and decision making across many scientific and industrial applications. Standard approaches such as maximum likelihood estimation and Markov chain Monte Carlo estimate parameters by repeatedly solving the model, which often requires numerical solutions of differential equation models. In contrast, generalized profiling (also called parameter cascading) focuses directly on the governing differential equation(s), linking the model and data through a penalized likelihood that explicitly measures both the data fit and model fit. Despite several advantages, generalized profiling is relatively rarely used in practice. This tutorial-style article outlines a set of self-directed computational exercises that facilitate skills development in applying generalized profiling to a range of ordinary differential equation models. All calculations can be repeated using reproducible open-source Jupyter notebooks that are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>lrux: Fast low-rank updates of determinants and Pfaffians in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present lrux, a JAX-based software package for fast low-rank updates of determinants and Pfaffians, targeting the dominant computational bottleneck in various quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms. The package implements efficient low-rank updates that reduce the cost of successive wavefunction evaluations from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$ when the update rank $k$ is smaller than the dimension $n$ of matrices. Both determinant and Pfaffian updates are supported, together with delayed-update strategies that trade floating-point operations for reduced memory traffic on modern accelerators. lrux natively integrates with JAX transformations such as JIT compilation, vectorization, and automatic differentiation, and supports both real and complex data types. Benchmarks on GPUs demonstrate up to $1000\times$ speedup at large matrix sizes. lrux enables scalable, high-performance evaluation of antisymmetric wavefunctions and is designed as a drop-in component for a wide range of QMC workflows. lrux is available at https://github.com/ChenAo-Phys/lrux.</description>

      <title>Branch-and-Bound Tensor Networks for Exact Ground-State Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the ground-state properties of disordered systems, such as spin glasses and combinatorial optimization problems, is fundamental to science and engineering. However, computing exact ground states and counting their degeneracies are generally NP-hard and #P-hard problems, respectively, posing a formidable challenge for exact algorithms. Recently, Tensor Networks methods, which utilize high-dimensional linear algebra and achieve massive hardware parallelization, have emerged as a rapidly developing paradigm for efficiently solving these tasks. Despite their success, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the exponential growth of space complexity, which severely limits their scalability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the Branch-and-Bound Tensor Network (BBTN) method, which seamlessly integrates the adaptive search framework of branch-and-bound with the efficient contraction of tropical tensor networks, significantly extending the reach of exact algorithms. We show that BBTN significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art solvers, setting new benchmarks for exact computation. It pushes the boundaries of tractability to previously unreachable scales, enabling exact ground-state counting for $\pm J$ spin glasses up to $64 \times 64$ and solving Maximum Independent Set problems on King's subgraphs up to $100 \times 100$. For hard instances, BBTN dramatically reduces the computational cost of standard Tropical Tensor Networks, compressing years of runtime into minutes. Furthermore, it outperforms leading integer-programming solvers by over 30$\times$, establishing a versatile and scalable framework for solving hard problems in statistical physics and combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Exchange Monte Carlo for continuous-space Path Integral Monte Carlo simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel Exchange Monte Carlo (EMC) method designed for application in continuous-space Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations at finite temperature. Traditional PIMC methods for bosonic systems suffer from long autocorrelation times, particularly when measuring observables affected by particle permutations, such as the winding number. To address this issue, we introduce an exchange update scheme that facilitates replica transitions between different interaction regimes, significantly accelerating Monte Carlo dynamics-especially for global observables sensitive to permutation effects. Furthermore, we incorporate Stochastic Potential Switching (SPS) to efficiently decompose interactions, substantially enhancing computational efficiency for long-range interatomic pair potentials such as the Lennard-Jones and Aziz potentials.</description>

      <title>MultiAtomLiouvilleEquationGenerator: A Mathematica package for Liouville superoperators and master equations of multilevel atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MulAtoLEG (Multi-Atom Liouville Equation Generator) is an open-source Mathematica package for generating Liouville superoperators and Liouville equations, specialized for multilevel atomic systems comprising an arbitrary number of atoms. This scheme is based on an extension to multilevel atomic systems, originally developed by Lehmberg [R. H. Lehmberg, Phys. Rev. A 2, 883 (1970)] as an adjoint master equation for ensembles of two-level emitters and later reformulated by Genes [M. Reitz, C. Sommer and C. Genes, PRX Quantum 3, 010201 (2022)] as a master equation. The package facilitates the generation of equations for complex transition configurations in alkali atoms. Although primarily designed for atomic systems, it can also generate the master and adjoint master equations for general Hamiltonians and Lindbladians. In addition, it includes functionalities to construct the differential equations in the dressed-state basis, where, in many cases, the non-unitary evolution operator can be determined explicitly. To maximize computational efficiency, the package leverages Mathematica's vectorization and sparse linear algebra capabilities. Since MulAtoLEG produces exact equations without approximations, the feasible system size is naturally limited by the available computational resources.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical-trap loading in a large optical-access experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental, numerical, and analytical study of strontium magneto-optical trap (MOT) loading from a cold atomic beam in a configuration optimized for high numerical aperture optical tweezers. Our approach orients the beam flow along the MOT symmetry axis to reduce the experimental complexity and maximize the overall optical access into the scientific region of study. We use a moving molasses technique to enable this configuration and show that its performance depends critically on metastable-state shelving (to 5s5p 3P2) during the atom transfer to the three-dimensional (3D) MOT. Furthermore, we find that the parameters for optimal transfer efficiency are bounded by dark-state loss (to 5s5p 3P0) in the trap region where repumping is present. These observations are verified to great degree of accuracy using both our developed analytical and numerical models. The corresponding 3D simulation tool is used to perform a comprehensive study of the trap loading dynamics, beginning at the oven exit and ending at the 3D MOT, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing an effusive oven experiment.</description>

      <title>High-temperature series expansion of the dynamic Matsubara spin correlator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high-temperature series expansion for quantum spin models is a well-established tool to compute thermodynamic quantities and equal-time spin correlations, in particular for frustrated interactions. We extend the scope of this expansion to the dynamic Matsubara spin-spin correlator and develop an algorithm that yields exact expansion coefficients in the form of rational numbers. We focus on Heisenberg models with a single coupling constant J and spin lengths S=1/2,1. The expansion coefficients up to 12th order in J/T are precomputed on all possible $\sim 10^6$ graphs embeddable in arbitrary lattices and are provided in a repository. This enables calculation of static momentum-resolved susceptibilities for arbitrary site-pairs or wavevectors. We test our results for the antiferromagnetic S=1/2 chain and triangular lattice model. An important application that we discuss in a companion letter is the calculation of real-frequency dynamic structure factors. This is achieved by identifying the high-frequency expansion coefficients of the Matsubara correlator with frequency moments of the spectral function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lax-Wendroff methods combined with discontinuous Galerkin/flux reconstruction spatial discretization provide a high-order, single-stage, quadrature-free method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. In this work, we introduce automatic differentiation (AD) for performing the Cauchy-Kowalewski procedure used in the element-local time average flux computation step (the predictor step) of Lax-Wendroff methods. The application of AD is similar for methods of any order and does not need positivity corrections during the predictor step. This contrasts with the approximate Lax-Wendroff procedure, which requires different finite difference formulas for different orders of the method and positivity corrections in the predictor step for fluxes that can only be computed on admissible states. The method is Jacobian-free and problem-independent, allowing direct application to any physical flux function. Numerical experiments demonstrate the order and positivity preservation of the method. Additionally, performance comparisons indicate that the wall-clock time of automatic differentiation is always on par with the approximate Lax-Wendroff method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14665v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a modular user-oriented simulation toolbox for studying highharmonic generation in gases. The first release consists of the computational pipeline to 1) compute the unidirectional IR-pulse propagation incylindrical symmetry, 2) solve the microscopic responses in the whole macroscopic volume using a 1D-TDSE solver, 3) obtain the far-field harmonic field using a diffraction-integral approach. The code comes with interfaces and tutorials, based on practical laboratory conditions, to facilitate the usage and deployment of the code both locally and in HPC-clusters. Additionally, the modules are designed to work as stand-alone applications as well, e.g., 1D-TDSE is available through Pythonic interface.</description>

Abstract: The Amazon rainforest and the AMOC are considered to be tipping elements: they are important components of the Earth system, but may collapse under climate change. Moreover, an AMOC collapse may favor the transition of the rainforest to a degraded forest by influencing the precipitation patterns over the Amazon. This phenomenon is known as tipping cascade and better understanding it is key to anticipating the impact of tipping events. Here, we investigate in a coupled conceptual AMOC-Amazon model the probability that an AMOC weakening affects tree cover loss in two regions of the rainforest. To get more insight into the mechanisms behind the tipping cascade, we also analyze the dynamics of both systems and their evolution during the Amazon transition. Namely, we track the transition probability and the transition time of the Amazon, and reconstruct the distribution of AMOC strength at every stage of this transition. These tasks require a large ensemble simulation, containing in particular a large number of transitions. Since such events may be too rare to be sampled by direct numerical simulation, the collapse of both systems is studied using TAMS, a "rare-event" algorithm designed to efficiently sample rare transitions. We find that, in the northwest of Brazil, a transition of the Amazon rainforest to a degraded forest within 200 years is very unlikely. However, in this region, such transition can only occur after an AMOC collapse, which would have a large drying effect that favors the development of extreme wildfires.</description>

      <title>Persistent Charge and Spin Currents in a Ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06109</link>

Abstract: We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in a ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping, where non-reciprocal hopping generates a synthetic magnetic flux and drives a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. The system supports both real and imaginary persistent currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin transport in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting biased noise in variational quantum models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising tools for demonstrating quantum utility on near-term quantum hardware, with applications in optimisation, quantum simulation, and machine learning. While researchers have studied how easy VQAs are to train, the effect of quantum noise on the classical optimisation process is still not well understood. Contrary to expectations, we find that twirling, which is commonly used in standard error-mitigation strategies to symmetrise noise, actually degrades performance in the variational setting, whereas preserving biased or non-unital noise can help classical optimisers find better solutions. Analytically, we study a universal quantum regression model and demonstrate that relatively uniform Pauli channels suppress gradient magnitudes and reduce expressivity, making optimisation more difficult. Conversely, asymmetric noise such as amplitude damping or biased Pauli channels introduces directional bias that can be exploited during optimisation. Numerical experiments on a variational eigensolver for the transverse-field Ising model confirm that non-unital noise yields lower-energy states compared to twirled noise. Finally, we show that coherent errors are fully mitigated by re-parameterisation. These findings challenge conventional noise-mitigation strategies and suggest that preserving noise biases may enhance VQA performance.</description>

      <title>Granite sliding on granite: friction, wear rates, surface topography, and the scale-dependence of rate-state effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study tribological granite-granite contacts as a model for tectonic faulting, combining experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. The high friction in this system is not dominated by particulate wear or plowing, as frequently assumed, but by cold welding within plastically deformed asperity junctions. We base this conclusion on the observation that wear is repeatedly high after cleaning contacts but decreases as gouge accumulates, while friction shows the opposite trend. Moreover, adding water reduces wear by a factor of ten but barely decreases friction. Thermal and rate-dependent effects-central to most earthquake models-are negligible: friction remains unchanged between -40{\deg}C and 20{\deg}C, across abrupt velocity steps, and after hours of stationary contact. The absence of rate-state effects in our macroscopic samples is rationalized by the scale-dependence of pre-slip. The evolution of surface topography shows that quartz grains become locally smooth, with height spectra isotropic for wavelength below 10 microns but anisotropic at longer wavelengths, similar to natural faults. The resulting gouge particles have the usual characteristic sizes near 100 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid, amorphous silica tip sliding on {\alpha}-quartz reproduce not only similar friction coefficients near unity but also other experimentally observed features, including stress-introduced transitions to phases observed in post-mortem faults, as well as theoretical estimates of local flash temperatures. Additionally, they reveal a marked decrease of interfacial shear strength above 600{\deg}C.</description>

      <title>Numerical model for pellet rocket acceleration in PELOTON</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04484</link>

Abstract: A direct numerical simulation model for the rocket acceleration of pellets in thermonuclear fusion devices has been developed for PELOTON, a 3D Lagrangian particle pellet code [R. Samulyak et al, Nuclear Fusion 61 (4), 046007 (2021)], and validated using shattered pellet injection (SPI) experiments in JET. The pellet rocket acceleration is driven by grad-B drift of the ablation cloud that creates asymmetry and non-uniform heating of the cloud. The model accounts for non-uniform charging of the ablation cloud by hot plasma electrons as well as local plasma gradients. The increased pressure on the high-field-side compared to the low-field-side leads to pellet (fragment) rocket acceleration. Pure deuterium and deuterium-neon mixture models have been implemented. The background plasma states have been obtained by using a new plasma cooling model for PELOTON. The cooling model distributes the ablated material within the corresponding flux volumes and accounts for ionization and other energy losses, Ohmic heating by toroidal currents, and the energy exchange between ions and electrons. Plasma profiles predicted by PELOTON cooling model have been compared with JOREK and INDEX simulations. PELOTON simulations of rocket acceleration and the corresponding trajectories of deuterium fragments are consistent with experimentally measured trajectories in JET. We show that composite deuterium-neon pellets containing 0.5% of neon experienced smaller deviation of their trajectories compared to the pure deuterium case. We simulate various spatial configurations of pellet fragments and demonstrate the cloud overlap impact on rocket acceleration. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of plasma state gradients on the rocket acceleration. Future work will focus on the rocket acceleration of SPI in projected ITER plasmas and the development of the corresponding scaling law for the rocket acceleration.</description>

      <title>Streaming Operator Inference for Model Reduction of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projection-based model reduction enables efficient simulation of complex dynamical systems by constructing low-dimensional surrogate models from high-dimensional data. The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Mechanical Fingerprints for THz Sensing of 'Hidden' Nanoparticles in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy holds transformative potential for non-invasive sensing, yet characterizing individual nanoparticles in complex biological environments remains challenging due to the far-field diffraction limit. While near-field dipolar theory is well established, its application to characterizing/identifying nanoparticles immersed in complex media at THz frequencies is largely unexplored.
  This work utilizes numerical simulations of magneto-optical (MO) heterodimers -- comprising n-doped Indium Antimonide (n-InSb) and isotropic or birefringent particles (e.g., SiO2, GaSe) -- under counter-propagating, circularly polarized THz illumination. We demonstrate that while far-field observables like absorption cross-sections are often dominated by the MO-active particle, mechanical variables-specifically induced binding forces and spin/orbital torques-exhibit superior sensitivity for detecting "hidden" neighboring components. Because these mechanical signatures depend directly on near-field interactions, they provide higher information density regarding interparticle coupling.
  Key findings reveal material-specific spectral "hotspots" and "zeros" that serve as robust calibration markers even within dispersive biological surrogates. We show that the spin torque on non-MO particles is significantly modified by MO-neighbor proximity, a phenomenon controllable via static magnetic fields. Furthermore, these variables exhibit high angular sensitivity in perpendicular configurations. Our results provide a roadmap for using optomechanical signatures as high-resolution detectors for in-vivo diagnostics, signal transduction, and low-energy nanocircuit control.</description>
