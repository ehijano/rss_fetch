      <title>The dependency digraph for irreducible finite-range random walk in free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is one of a triptych composed with [Che25a] and [Che25b], that aims at proving an asymptotic expansion to any order of the passage probability of an irreducible equivariant finite range random walk on a tree. In this text we study the analytic and geometric properties of the objects introduced in [Che25b]. To do so we introduce the definition of a ''flooded cavern tree'' enabling a precise study of some dependency digraph associated with a given irreducible finite-range random walk on a free group.</description>

      <title>Conditional GMC within the stochastic heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that the family of polymer measures $M^{\theta}_{[s,t]}$ associated with the Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF), indexed by $\theta\in\mathbb{R}$, has a conditional Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos (GMC) structure. Namely, taking the random measure $M^{\theta}_{[s,t]}$ as the reference measure, we construct the path-space GMC with noise strength $a &gt; 0$ and prove that the resulting random measure is equal in law to $M^{\theta+a}_{[s,t]}$. As two applications, we prove that the polymer measure and SHF tested against general nonnegative functions are almost surely strictly positive and that the SHF converges to $0$ as $\theta\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>The noisy voter model with general initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the noisy voter model with $q\geq 2$ states and noise probability $\theta$ on arbitrary bounded-degree $n$-vertex graphs $G$ with subexponential growth of balls (e.g., finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^d$). Cox, Peres and Steif (2016) showed for the binary case $q=2$ (and a wider class of chains) that, when starting from a worst-case initial state, this Markov chain has total variation cutoff at $t_n=\frac1{2\theta}\log n$. The second author and Sly (2021) analyzed faster initial conditions for Glauber dynamics for the 1D Ising model, which is the noisy voter for $q=2$ and $G=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. They showed that the ``alternating'' initial state is the fastest one if $\theta\geq \frac23$, and conjectured that this holds for all values of the noise $\theta$.
  Here we show that for every graph $G$ as above and all $\theta,q$ and initial states $x_0$, the noisy voter model exhibits cutoff at an explicit function of the autocorrelation of the model started at $x_0$. Consequently, for $G=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ and $q=2$ (Glauber dynamics for the 1D Ising model), we confirm the conjecture of [LS21] that the alternating initial condition is asymptotically fastest for all $\theta$. Analogous results hold in $\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ for $q=2$ and all $d\geq 1$ (``checkerboard'' initial conditions are fastest) as well as for $d=1$ and all $q\geq 2$ (``rainbow'' initial conditions are fastest).</description>

      <title>Functional limit theorems for edge counts in dynamic random connection hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic random hypergraph model constructed from a bipartite graph. In this model, both vertex sets of the bipartite graph are generated by marked Poisson point processes. Vertices of both vertex sets are equipped with marks representing their weight that influence their connection radii. Additionally, we also assign the vertices of the first vertex set a birth-death process with exponential lifetimes and the vertices of the second vertex set a time instant representing the occurrence of the corresponding vertices. Connections between vertices are established based on the marks and the birth-death processes, leading to a weighted dynamic hypergraph model featuring power-law degree distributions. We analyze the edge-count process in two distinct regimes. In the case of finite fourth moments, we establish a functional central limit theorem for the normalized edge count, showing convergence to a Gaussian AR(2)-type process as the observation window grows. In the challenging case of the heavy-tailed regime with infinite variance, we prove convergence to a novel stable process that is not L\'evy and not even Markov.</description>

      <title>Pontryagin Maximum Principle for McKean-Vlasov Reaction-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic control of a semi-linear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) of McKean-Vlasov type. Based on a recent novel approach to the Lions derivative for Banach space valued functions, we prove the Gateaux differentiability of the control to state map and, using adjoint calculus, we derive explicit representations of the gradient of the cost functional and a Pontryagin maximum principle. On the way, we also prove a novel existence and uniqueness result for linear McKean-Vlasov backward SPDE. Furthermore, for deterministic controls, we prove the existence of optimal controls using a martingale approach and a novel compactness method. This result is complemented in the appendix with a rigorous proof of folklore results on the compactness method in the variational approach to SPDE. Our setting uses the variational approach to SPDE with monotone coefficients, allowing for a polynomial perturbation and allowing the drift and diffusion coefficients to depend on the state, the distribution of the state and the control.</description>

      <title>Epi-convergence in distribution of normal integrands with applications to sets of epsilon-optimal solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for epi-convergence in distribution of normal integrands. As a basic tool for the proof a new characterisation for distributional convergence of random closed sets is used. Our approach via the epi-topology allows us to show that, if a net of normal integrands epiconverges in distribution, then the pertaining sets of epsilon-optimal solutions converge in distribution in the underlying hyperspace endowed with the upper-Fell topology. Under some boundedness and uniquenss assumptions the convergence even holds for the Fell topology. Finally, measurable selections converge weakly to a Choquet-capacity.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Ruin for the Compound Markov Binomial Risk Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study finite-time ruin probabilities for the compound Markov binomial risk model - a discrete-time model where claim sizes are modulated by a finite-state ergodic Markov chain. In the classic (non-modulated) case, the risk process has interchangeable increments and consequently, its finite-time ruin probability can be obtained in terms of Tak\'acs' famous Ballot Theorem results. Unfortunately, due to the dependency of our process on the state(s) of the modulating chain these do not necessarily extend to the modulated setting. We show that a general form of the Ballot Theorem remains valid under the stationary distribution of the modulating chain, yielding a Tak\'acs-type expression for the finite-time ruin probability which holds only when the initial surplus is equal to zero. For the case of arbitrary initial surplus, we develop an approach based on multivariate Lagrangian inversion, from which we derive distributional results for various hitting times of the risk process, including a Seal-type formula for the finite-time ruin probability.</description>

      <title>Low complexity convergence rate bounds for push-sum algorithms with homogeneous correlation structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to establish an upper bound for the almost sure convergence rate for a class of push-sum algorithms. The current work extends the methods and results of the authors on a similar low-complexity bound on push-sum algorithms with some particular synchronous message passing schemes and complements the general approach of Gerencs\'er and Gerencs\'er from 2022 providing an exact, but often less accessible description. Furthermore, a parametric analysis is presented on the ``weight'' of the messages, which is found to be convex with an explicit expression for the gradient. This allows the fine-tuning of the algorithm used for improved efficiency. Numerical results confirm the speedup in evaluating the computable bounds without deteriorating their performance, for a graph on 120 vertices the runtime drops by more than 4 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>To see the forest for the trees: On the infinite divisibility of unlabeled forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Stufler's recent probabilistic proof of Otter's asymptotic number of unlabeled trees, we revisit work of Palmer and Schwenk, and study unlabeled forests from a probabilistic point of view. We show that the number of trees in a random forest converges, with all of its moments, to a shifted compound Poisson. We also find the asymptotic proportion of forests that are trees. The key fact is that the number of trees $t_n$ and forests $f_n$ are related by a L\'evy process. As such, the results by Palmer and Schwenk follow by an earlier and far-reaching limit theory by Hawkes and Jenkins. We also show how this limit theory implies results by Schwenk and by Meir and Moon, related to degrees in large random trees. Our arguments apply, more generally, to the enumeration of sub-exponentially weighted integer partitions, or, in fact, any setting where the underlying L\'evy process follows the one big jump principle.</description>

      <title>Particle systems and the supercooled Stefan problem with non-integrable initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an infinite system of particles on the positive real line, initiated from a Poisson point process, which move according to Brownian motion up until the hitting time of a barrier. The barrier increases when it is hit, allowing for the possibility of sequences of successive jumps to occur instantaneously. Under certain conditions, the scaling limit gives a representation for the supercooled Stefan problem and its free boundary. This allows us to give a precise asymptotic limit for the barrier and determine the rate of convergence, resolving a conjecture of arXiv:1112.6257. From this representation, we also investigate properties of the supercooled Stefan problem for initial data not in $L^1(\mathbb{R}^+)$. In a critical case, where the jump size matches the density of the Poisson process and the Stefan problem has an instantaneous explosion, we instead recover the same scaling limit result as in arXiv:1705.10017.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the empirical measures of roots of Eulerian polynomials converge to a certain log-Cauchy distribution. To do so, we show that the moments of the roots of a related family of polynomials not only converge, but are in fact ultimately constant. These asymptotic moments are expressed in terms of N\"orlund's numbers.</description>

      <title>Moment stability and large deviations for random dynamical systems on non-compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rate function for large deviations of the finite time Lyapunov exponent for the derived process in TM corresponding to a stochastic differential equation in M is related, via the Gartner-Ellis theorem, to the p-th moment Lyapunov exponent. When M is compact there is a characterization of the p-th moment Lyapunov exponent in terms of an eigenvalue problem for an associated differential operator acting on functions on the unit sphere bundle SM. For the non-compact case, we formulate growth conditions which, together with standard assumptions of hypoellipticity and positivity, ensure that the eigenvalue characterization remains valid so long as the corresponding eigenfunction is restricted to be in a suitable function space. There is a central limit theorem for finite time Lyapunov exponent, and there are moderate deviation estimates for the finite time Lyapunov exponent, both involving the second derivative of the moment exponent function at 0.</description>

      <title>Diversification and Stochastic Dominance: When All Eggs Are Better Put in One Basket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom warns against "putting all your eggs in one basket," and diversification is widely regarded as a reliable strategy for reducing risk. Yet under certain extreme conditions, this intuition not only fails - it reverses. This paper explores such reversals by identifying new settings in which diversification increases risk. Our main result - the one-basket theorem - provides sufficient conditions under which a weighted average of independent risks is larger, in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance, than a corresponding mixture model that concentrates all exposure on a single risk chosen at random. Our framework handles non-identically distributed risks and includes new examples, such as infinite-mean discrete Pareto variables and the St. Petersburg lottery. We further show that these reversals are not isolated anomalies, but boundary cases of a broader phenomenon: diversification always increases the likelihood of exceeding small thresholds, and under specific conditions, this local effect extends globally, resulting in first-order stochastic dominance.</description>

      <title>A Distributional View of High Dimensional Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This PhD thesis presents a distributional view of optimization in place of a worst-case perspective. We motivate this view with an investigation of the failure point of classical optimization. Subsequently we consider the optimization of a randomly drawn objective function. This is the setting of Bayesian Optimization. After a review of Bayesian optimization we outline how such a distributional view may explain predictable progress of optimization in high dimension. It further turns out that this distributional view provides insights into optimal step size control of gradient descent. To enable these results, we develop mathematical tools to deal with random input to random functions and a characterization of non-stationary isotropic covariance kernels. Finally, we outline how assumptions about the data, specifically exchangability, can lead to random objective functions in machine learning and analyze their landscape.</description>

      <title>Last passage percolation in lower triangular domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Last passage percolation (LPP) in an $n\times n$ lower triangular domain has nice connections with various generalizations of Schur measures. LPP along an anti-diagonal, from $(1,n)$ to $(n,1)$, gives a distribution of a highest column of a random composition with respect to a Demazure measure (a non-symmetric analog of a Schur measure). LPP along a main diagonal, from $(1,1)$ to $(n,n)$, is distributed as a marginal of a Pfaffian Schur process. In the first case we show that the asymptotics for the constant specialization is governed by the GOE Tracy-Widom distribution, in the second case - by the GSE Tracy-Widom distribution. In the latter case we were also able to study the truncated lower triangular case, obtaining an interesting generalization of the GSE Tracy-Widom distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.10376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study random Peano paths on planar square grids that arise from fair random spanning trees. These are trees that are sampled in such a way as to have the same (if possible) edge probabilities. In particular, we are interested in identifying the scaling limit as the mesh-size of the grid tends to zero. It is known \cite{lawler-schramm-werner2002} that if the trees are sampled uniformly, then the scaling limit exists and equals ${\rm SLE}_8$. We show that if we simply follow the same steps as in \cite{lawler-schramm-werner2002}, then fair Peano paths have a deterministic scaling limit.</description>

      <title>The critical Karp--Sipser core of random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02463v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Karp--Sipser core of a random graph made of a configuration model with vertices of degree $1,2$ and $3$. This core is obtained by recursively removing the leaves as well as their unique neighbors in the graph. We settle a conjecture of Bauer &amp; Golinelli and prove that at criticality, the Karp--Sipser core has size $ \approx \mathrm{Cst} \cdot \vartheta^{-2} \cdot n^{3/5}$ where $\vartheta$ is the hitting time of the curve $t \mapsto \frac{1}{t^{2}}$ by a linear Brownian motion started at $0$. Our proof relies on a detailed multi-scale analysis of the Markov chain associated to Karp-Sipser leaf-removal algorithm close to its extinction time.</description>

      <title>First passage percolation on Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs with general weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider first passage percolation on the Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi graph with $n$ vertices in which each pair of distinct vertices is connected independently by an edge with probability $\lambda/n$ for some $\lambda&gt;1$. The edges of the graph are given non-negative i.i.d. weights with a non-degenerate distribution such that the probability of zero is not too large. We consider the paths with small total weight between two distinct typical vertices and analyse the joint behaviour of the numbers of edges on such paths, the so-called hopcounts, and the total weights of these paths. For $n\to\infty$, we show that, after a suitable transformation, the pairs of hopcounts and total weights of these paths converge in distribution to a Cox process, i.e., a Poisson process with a random intensity measure. The random intensity measure is controlled by two independent random variables, whose distribution is the solution of a distributional fixed point equation and is related to branching processes. For non-arithmetic and arithmetic edge-weight distributions we observe different behaviour. In particular, we derive the limiting distribution for the minimal total weight and the corresponding hopcount(s). Our results generalise earlier work of Bhamidi, van der Hofstad and Hooghiemstra, who assume that edge weights have an absolutely continuous distribution. The main tool we employ is the method of moments.</description>

      <title>Conditional Optimal Sets and the Quantization Coefficients for Some Uniform Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bucklew and Wise (1982) showed that the quantization dimension of an absolutely continuous probability measure on a given Euclidean space is constant and equals the Euclidean dimension of the space, and the quantization coefficient exists as a finite positive number. By giving different examples, in this paper, we have shown that the quantization coefficients for absolutely continuous probability measures defined on the same Euclidean space can be different. We have taken uniform distribution as a prototype of an absolutely continuous probability measure. In addition, we have also calculated the conditional optimal sets of $n$-points and the $n$th conditional quantization errors for the uniform distributions in constrained and unconstrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>A computational transition for detecting correlated stochastic block models by low-degree polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detection of correlation in a pair of random graphs is a fundamental statistical and computational problem that has been extensively studied in recent years. In this work, we consider a pair of correlated (sparse) stochastic block models $\mathcal{S}(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};k,\epsilon;s)$ that are subsampled from a common parent stochastic block model $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};k,\epsilon)$ with $k=O(1)$ symmetric communities, average degree $\lambda=O(1)$, divergence parameter $\epsilon$, and subsampling probability $s$.
  For the detection problem of distinguishing this model from a pair of independent Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs with the same edge density $\mathcal{G}(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n})$, we focus on tests based on \emph{low-degree polynomials} of the entries of the adjacency matrices, and we determine the threshold that separates the easy and hard regimes. More precisely, we show that this class of tests can distinguish these two models if and only if $s&gt; \min \{ \sqrt{\alpha}, \frac{1}{\lambda \epsilon^2} \}$, where $\alpha\approx 0.338$ is the Otter's constant and $\frac{1}{\lambda \epsilon^2}$ is the Kesten-Stigum threshold. Combining a reduction argument in \cite{Li25+}, our hardness result also implies low-degree hardness for partial recovery and detection (to independent block models) when $s&lt; \min \{ \sqrt{\alpha}, \frac{1}{\lambda \epsilon^2} \}$. Finally, our proof of low-degree hardness is based on a conditional variant of the low-degree likelihood calculation.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for the Dynamical Foundation of the Fractional Brownian Motion and Related Models of Anomalous Diffusion with Random Diffusion Coefficient and Time-Dependent Random Hurst parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomalous diffusion is an established phenomenon but still a theoretical challenge in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Physical models are built incrementally, and the most recent and most general family is based on the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) with a random diffusion coefficient (superstatistical fBm) together with a time-dependent random Hurst parameter. We provide here a dynamical foundation for such general family of models. We consider a dynamical system describing the motion of a test-particle surrounded by $N$ Brownian particles with different masses. This dynamic is governed by underdamped Langevin equations. Physical principles of conservation of momentum and energy are met. We prove that, in the limit $N\to\infty$, the test-particle diffuses in time according to a quite general (non-Markovian) Gaussian process whose covariance function is determined by the distribution of the masses of the surround-particles. In particular, with proper choices of the distribution of the masses of the surround-particles, we obtain fBm together with a number of other special cases of interest in modelling anomalous diffusion including time-dependent anomalous exponent. Furthermore, when the ensemble heterogeneity of the surround-particles embodying the environment becomes non-uniform and joins with the individual inhomogeneity of the test-particles, we show that, in the limit $N\to\infty$, the test-particle diffuses in time according to a quite general conditionally Gaussian process that can be calibrated into a fBm with random diffusion coefficient and random time-dependent Hurst parameter. We conclude our study by reporting the generalised Kolmogorov--Fokker--Planck equations associated to these highly general processes.</description>

Abstract: This note establishes that the opposite Gaussian product inequality (GPI) of the type proved by Russell &amp; Sun (2022a) in two dimensions, and partially extended to higher dimensions by Zhou et al. (2024), continues to hold for an arbitrary mix of positive and negative exponents. A general quantitative lower bound is also obtained conditionally on the GPI conjecture being true.</description>

      <title>Capacity of the range of random walk: Moderate deviations in dimensions 4 and 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a moderate deviation principle for the capacity of the range of random walk in $\mathbb{Z}^5$. Depending on the scale of deviation, we get two different regimes. We observe Gaussian tails when the deviation scale is smaller than $n^{1/2} (\log n)^{3/4}$. Otherwise, we get non-Gaussian tails with a constant arising from a generalized Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality. This is analogous to the behavior of the volume of the random walk range in $\mathbb{Z}^3$. Our methods can also be applied to the $d = 4$ case to prove the moderate deviation principle in almost the full range of interest. This extends the work of Okada and the first author \cite{AdhikariOkada2023}, where they showed moderate deviations up to a deviation scale of $\log \log n$ times the standard deviation.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the existence and uniqueness of random-field solutions to the elliptic SPDE $-\mathcal{L}u=\dot{\xi}$ on a bounded domain $D$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions $u=0$ on $\partial D$, driven by symmetric L\'evy noise $\dot{\xi}$. Under general sufficient conditions on the coefficients of the second-order operator $\mathcal{L}$, we prove the existence of a mild solution via the corresponding Green's function and show that the same framework applies to the spectral fractional Laplacian of power $\gamma \in (0,\infty)$. In particular, whenever $\gamma&gt;\tfrac{d}{2}$, the solution admits a continuous modification.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for multivalued McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MMVSDEs) driven by Levy noise with non-Lipschitz coefficients. It is important to note that these findings are based upon the well-posedness of strong solutions for MMVSDEs under Lipschitz conditions, which will be stated briefly. Secondly, we study the existence of weak solutions under linear growth condition. Finally, we prove the existence of martingale solutions.</description>

      <title>Rapid Mixing at the Uniqueness Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decades, a fascinating computational phase transition has been identified in sampling from Gibbs distributions. Though, the computational complexity at the critical point remains poorly understood, as previous algorithmic and hardness results all required a constant slack from this threshold.
  In this paper, we resolve this open question at the critical phase transition threshold, thus completing the picture of the computational phase transition. We show that for the hardcore model on graphs with maximum degree $\Delta\ge 3$ at the uniqueness threshold $\lambda = \lambda_c(\Delta)$, the mixing time of Glauber dynamics is upper bounded by a polynomial in $n$, but is not nearly linear in the worst case.
  For the Ising model (either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic), we establish similar results. For the Ising model on graphs with maximum degree $\Delta\ge 3$ at the critical temperature $\beta$ where $|\beta| = \beta_c(\Delta)$, with the tree-uniqueness threshold $\beta_c(\Delta)$, we show that the mixing time of Glauber dynamics is upper bounded by $\tilde{O}\left(n^{2 + O(1/\Delta)}\right)$ and lower bounded by $\Omega\left(n^{3/2}\right)$ in the worst case. For the Ising model specified by a critical interaction matrix $J$ with $\left \lVert J \right \rVert_2=1$, we obtain an upper bound $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ for the mixing time, matching the lower bound $\Omega\left(n^{3/2}\right)$ on the complete graph up to a logarithmic factor.
  Our mixing time upper bounds are derived from a new interpretation and analysis of the localization scheme method introduced by Chen and Eldan (2022), applied to the field dynamics for the hardcore model and the proximal sampler for the Ising model. As key steps in both our upper and lower bounds, we establish sub-linear upper and lower bounds for spectral independence at the critical point for worst-case instances.</description>

      <title>Node Reliability: Approximation, Upper Bounds, and Applications to Network Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the reliability of a graph in which the links are perfectly reliable but the nodes may fail with certain probability p. Calculating graph node reliability is an NP-Hard problem. We introduce an efficient and accurate Monte Carlo method and a stochastic approximation for the node reliability polynomial based solely on the degree distribution. We provide the formulas for the node reliability polynomial of both Erdos-Renyi graphs and Random Geometric graphs. The phase transition in the node reliability of Erdos-Renyi graphs is also discussed. Additionally, we propose two increasingly accurate upper bounds for the node reliability polynomial solely based on the graph's degree distributions. The advantages and disadvantages of these two upper bounds are thoroughly compared. Beyond the computation of node reliability polynomials, we also estimate the number of cut sets and present a solution to the reliability-based network enhancement problem.</description>

      <title>A divisor generating $q$-series and cumulants arising from random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uchimura, in 1987, introduced a probability generating function for a random variable $X$ and using properties of this function he discovered an interesting $q$-series identity. He further showed that the $m$-th cumulant with respect to the random variable $X$ is nothing but the generating function for the generalized divisor function $\sigma_{m-1}(n)$. Simon, Crippa, and Collenberg, in 1993, explored the $G_{n,p}$-model of a random acyclic digraph and defined a random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$. Quite interestingly, they found links between limit of its mean and the generating function for the divisor function $d(n)$. Later in 1997, Andrews, Crippa and Simon extended these results using $q$-series techniques. They calculated limit of the mean and variance of the random variable $\gamma_n^{*}(1)$ which correspond to the first and second cumulants. In this paper, we generalize the result of Andrews, Crippa and Simon by calculating limit of the $t$-th cumulant in terms of the generalized divisor function. Furthermore, we also discover limit forms for identities of Uchimura and Dilcher. This provides a fourth side to the Uchimura-Ramanujan-divisor type three way partition identities expounded by the first four authors recently.</description>

      <title>Modeling Maritime Transportation Behavior Using AIS Trajectories and Markovian Processes in the Gulf of St. Lawrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maritime transportation is central to the global economy, and analyzing its large-scale behavioral data is critical for operational planning, environmental stewardship, and governance. This work presents a spatio-temporal analytical framework based on discrete-time Markov chains to model vessel movement patterns in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with particular emphasis on disruptions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. We discretize the maritime domain into hexagonal cells and construct mobility signatures for distinct vessel types using cell transition frequencies and dwell times. These features are used to build origin-destination matrices and spatial transition probability models that characterize maritime dynamics across multiple temporal resolutions. Focusing on commercial, fishing, and passenger vessels, we analyze the temporal evolution of mobility behaviors during the pandemic, highlighting significant yet transient disruptions to recurring transport patterns. The methodology we contribute to this paper allows for an extensive behavioral analytics key for transportation planning. Accordingly, our findings reveal vessel-specific mobility signatures that persist across spatially disjoint regions, suggesting behaviors invariant to time. In contrast, we observe temporal deviations among passenger and fishing vessels during the pandemic, reflecting the influence of social isolation measures and operational constraints on non-essential maritime transport in this region.</description>
