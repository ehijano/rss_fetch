      <title>Application of Ideal Observer for Thresholded Data in Search Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study advances task-based image quality assessment by developing an anthropomorphic thresholded visual-search model observer. The model is an ideal observer for thresholded data inspired by the human visual system, allowing selective processing of high-salience features to improve discrimination performance. By filtering out irrelevant variability, the model enhances diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency.
  The observer employs a two-stage framework: candidate selection and decision-making. Using thresholded data during candidate selection refines regions of interest, while stage-specific feature processing optimizes performance. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of thresholding on feature maps, candidate localization, and multi-feature scenarios. Results demonstrate that thresholding improves observer performance by excluding low-salience features, particularly in noisy environments. Intermediate thresholds often outperform no thresholding, indicating that retaining only relevant features is more effective than keeping all features.
  Additionally, the model demonstrates effective training with fewer images while maintaining alignment with human performance. These findings suggest that the proposed novel framework can predict human visual search performance in clinically realistic tasks and provide solutions for model observer training with limited resources. Our novel approach has applications in other areas where human visual search and detection tasks are modeled such as in computer vision, machine learning, defense and security image analysis.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Enhanced Interpretable Multi-Modal Prognosis and Risk Stratification Framework for Diabetic Retinopathy (TIMM-ProRS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), affecting millions globally with projections indicating a significant rise, poses a severe blindness risk and strains healthcare systems. Diagnostic complexity arises from visual symptom overlap with conditions like age-related macular degeneration and hypertensive retinopathy, exacerbated by high misdiagnosis rates in underserved regions. This study introduces TIMM-ProRS, a novel deep learning framework integrating Vision Transformer (ViT), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Graph Neural Network (GNN) with multi-modal fusion. TIMM-ProRS uniquely leverages both retinal images and temporal biomarkers (HbA1c, retinal thickness) to capture multi-modal and temporal dynamics. Evaluated comprehensively across diverse datasets including APTOS 2019 (trained), Messidor-2, RFMiD, EyePACS, and Messidor-1 (validated), the model achieves 97.8\% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.96, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and outperforming existing methods like RSG-Net and DeepDR. This approach enables early, precise, and interpretable diagnosis, supporting scalable telemedical management and enhancing global eye health sustainability.</description>

      <title>Region of interest detection for efficient aortic segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thoracic aortic dissection and aneurysms are the most lethal diseases of the aorta. The major hindrance to treatment lies in the accurate analysis of the medical images. More particularly, aortic segmentation of the 3D image is often tedious and difficult. Deep-learning-based segmentation models are an ideal solution, but their inability to deliver usable outputs in difficult cases and their computational cost cause their clinical adoption to stay limited. This study presents an innovative approach for efficient aortic segmentation using targeted region of interest (ROI) detection. In contrast to classical detection models, we propose a simple and efficient detection model that can be widely applied to detect a single ROI. Our detection model is trained as a multi-task model, using an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation and a fully connected network attached to the bottleneck for detection. We compare the performance of a one-step segmentation model applied to a complete image, nnU-Net and our cascade model composed of a detection and a segmentation step. We achieve a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.944 with over 0.9 for all cases using a third of the computing power. This simple solution achieves state-of-the-art performance while being compact and robust, making it an ideal solution for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>A Single-Parameter Factor-Graph Image Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel piecewise smooth image model with piecewise constant local parameters that are automatically adapted to each image. Technically, the model is formulated in terms of factor graphs with NUP (normal with unknown parameters) priors, and the pertinent computations amount to iterations of conjugate-gradient steps and Gaussian message passing. The proposed model and algorithms are demonstrated with applications to denoising and contrast enhancement.</description>

      <title>M3CoTBench: Benchmark Chain-of-Thought of MLLMs in Medical Image Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08758v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has proven effective in enhancing large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning, and recent advances have extended this paradigm to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In the medical domain, where diagnostic decisions depend on nuanced visual cues and sequential reasoning, CoT aligns naturally with clinical thinking processes. However, Current benchmarks for medical image understanding generally focus on the final answer while ignoring the reasoning path. An opaque process lacks reliable bases for judgment, making it difficult to assist doctors in diagnosis. To address this gap, we introduce a new M3CoTBench benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency of CoT reasoning in medical image understanding. M3CoTBench features 1) a diverse, multi-level difficulty dataset covering 24 examination types, 2) 13 varying-difficulty tasks, 3) a suite of CoT-specific evaluation metrics (correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency) tailored to clinical reasoning, and 4) a performance analysis of multiple MLLMs. M3CoTBench systematically evaluates CoT reasoning across diverse medical imaging tasks, revealing current limitations of MLLMs in generating reliable and clinically interpretable reasoning, and aims to foster the development of transparent, trustworthy, and diagnostically accurate AI systems for healthcare.

      <title>Predicting Region of Interest in Human Visual Search Based on Statistical Texture and Gabor Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding human visual search behavior is a fundamental problem in vision science and computer vision, with direct implications for modeling how observers allocate attention in location-unknown search tasks. In this study, we investigate the relationship between Gabor-based features and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture features in modeling early-stage visual search behavior. Two feature-combination pipelines are proposed to integrate Gabor and GLCM features for narrowing the region of possible human fixations. The pipelines are evaluated using simulated digital breast tomosynthesis images. Results show qualitative agreement among fixation candidates predicted by the proposed pipelines and a threshold-based model observer. A strong correlation is observed between GLCM mean and Gabor feature responses, indicating that these features encode related image information despite their different formulations. Eye-tracking data from human observers further suggest consistency between predicted fixation regions and early-stage gaze behavior. These findings highlight the value of combining structural and texture-based features for modeling visual search and support the development of perceptually informed observer models.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Distracted Driver Detection via Vision Language Models with Double Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distracted driving is a major cause of traffic collisions, calling for robust and scalable detection methods. Vision-language models (VLMs) enable strong zero-shot image classification, but existing VLM-based distracted driver detectors often underperform in real-world conditions. We identify subject-specific appearance variations (e.g., clothing, age, and gender) as a key bottleneck: VLMs entangle these factors with behavior cues, leading to decisions driven by who the driver is rather than what the driver is doing. To address this, we propose a subject decoupling framework that extracts a driver appearance embedding and removes its influence from the image embedding prior to zero-shot classification, thereby emphasizing distraction-relevant evidence. We further orthogonalize text embeddings via metric projection onto Stiefel manifold to improve separability while staying close to the original semantics. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains over prior baselines, indicating the promise of our approach for practical road-safety applications.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Super-Resolution: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13620v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single image super-resolution (SISR) has played an important role in the field of image processing. Recent generative adversarial networks (GANs) can achieve excellent results on low-resolution images. However, there are little literatures summarizing different GANs in SISR. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study of GANs from different perspectives. We begin by surveying the development of GANs and popular GAN variants for image-related applications, and then analyze motivations, implementations and differences of GANs based optimization methods and discriminative learning for image super-resolution in terms of supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised manners, where these GANs are analyzed via integrating different network architectures, prior knowledge, loss functions and multiple tasks. Secondly, we compare the performances of these popular GANs on public datasets via quantitative and qualitative analysis in SISR. Finally, we highlight challenges of GANs and potential research points for SISR.</description>

      <title>A Pre-trained Foundation Model Framework for Multiplanar MRI Classification of Extramural Vascular Invasion and Mesorectal Fascia Invasion in Rectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objectives Accurate MRI-based identification of extramural vascular invasion (EVI) and mesorectal fascia invasion (MFI) is crucial for risk-stratified rectal cancer treatment. However, subjective visual assessment and inter-institutional variability limit diagnostic consistency. This study developed and externally evaluated a multi-centre, foundation model-driven framework that automatically classifies EVI and MFI on axial and sagittal MRI. Methods A total of 331 pre-treatment rectal cancer T2-weighted MRI scans from three European hospitals were retrospectively recruited. A self-supervised frequency domain harmonization strategy was applied to reduce scanner variability. Three classifiers, SeResNet, the universal biomedical pretrained model (UMedPT) with a multilayer perceptron head, and a logistic-regression variant using frozen UMedPT features (UMedPT_LR), were trained (n=265) and tested (n=66). Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualized model predictions. Results UMedPT_LR achieved the best EVI performance with multiplanar fusion (AUC=0.82, test set). For MFI, UMedPT trained on axial harmonized images yielded the highest performance (AUC = 0.77). Both tasks outperformed the CHAIMELEON 2024 benchmark (EVI: 0.82 vs 0.74; MFI: 0.77 vs 0.75). Harmonization enhanced MFI classification, and multiplanar fusion further boosted EVI performance. Grad-CAM confirmed biologically plausible attention on peritumoral regions (EVI) and mesorectal fascia margins (MFI). Conclusion The proposed foundation model-driven framework, leveraging frequency domain harmonization and multiplanar fusion, achieves state-of-the-art performance for automated EVI and MFI classification on MRI, demonstrating strong generalizability across multiple centers.</description>

      <title>Quantization-Aware Neuromorphic Architecture for Skin Disease Classification on Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-device skin lesion analysis is constrained by the compute and energy cost of conventional CNN inference and by the need to update models as new patient data become available. We propose QANA, a quantization-aware CNN backbone embedded in an end-to-end pipeline engineered for conversion-stable neuromorphic execution. QANA replaces conversion-fragile components with spike-compatible transformations by bounding intermediate activations and aligning normalization with low-bit quantization, reducing conversion-induced distortion that disproportionately impacts rare classes. Efficiency is achieved through Ghost-based feature generation under tight FLOP budgets, while spatially-aware efficient channel attention and squeeze-and-excitation recalibrate channels without heavy global operators that are difficult to map to spiking cores. The resulting quantized projection head produces SNN-ready logits and enables incremental updates on edge hardware without full retraining or data offloading. On HAM10000, QANA achieves 91.6% Top-1 accuracy and 91.0% macro F1, improving the strongest converted SNN baseline by 3.5 percentage points in Top-1 accuracy, corresponding to a 4.0% relative gain, and by 12.0 points in macro F1, corresponding to a 15.2% relative gain. On a clinical dataset, QANA achieves 90.8% Top-1 accuracy and 81.7% macro F1, improving the strongest converted SNN baseline by 3.2 points in Top-1 accuracy, which corresponds to a 3.7% relative gain, and by 3.6 points in macro F1, corresponding to a 4.6% relative gain. When deployed on BrainChip Akida, QANA runs in 1.5 ms per image with 1.7 mJ per image, corresponding to 94.6% lower latency and 99.0% lower energy than its GPU-based CNN implementation.</description>

      <title>HiFi-Mamba: Dual-Stream W-Laplacian Enhanced Mamba for High-Fidelity MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data remains a challenging problem in MRI. While Mamba variants for vision tasks offer promising long-range modeling capabilities with linear-time complexity, their direct application to MRI reconstruction inherits two key limitations: (1) insensitivity to high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) reliance on redundant multi-directional scanning. To address these limitations, we introduce High-Fidelity Mamba (HiFi-Mamba), a novel dual-stream Mamba-based architecture comprising stacked W-Laplacian (WL) and HiFi-Mamba blocks. Specifically, the WL block performs fidelity-preserving spectral decoupling, producing complementary low- and high-frequency streams. This separation enables the HiFi-Mamba block to focus on low-frequency structures, enhancing global feature modeling. Concurrently, the HiFi-Mamba block selectively integrates high-frequency features through adaptive state-space modulation, preserving comprehensive spectral details. To eliminate the scanning redundancy, the HiFi-Mamba block adopts a streamlined unidirectional traversal strategy that preserves long-range modeling capability with improved computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on standard MRI reconstruction benchmarks demonstrate that HiFi-Mamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based, Transformer-based, and other Mamba-based models in reconstruction accuracy while maintaining a compact and efficient model design.</description>
