      <title>Reddit Deplatforming and Toxicity Dynamics on Generalist Voat Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deplatforming, the permanent banning of entire communities, is a primary tool for content moderation on mainstream platforms. While prior research examines effects on banned communities or source platform health, the impact on alternative platforms that absorb displaced users remains understudied. We analyze four major Reddit ban waves (2015--2020) and their effects on generalist communities on Voat, asking how post-ban arrivals reshape community structure and through what mechanisms transformation occurs. Combining network analysis, toxicity detection, and dynamic reputation modeling, we identify two distinct regimes of migration impact: (1) Hostile Takeover (2015--2018), where post-ban arrival cohorts formed parallel social structures that bypassed existing community cores through sheer volume, and (2) Toxic Equilibrium (2018--2020), where the flattening of existing user hierarchy enabled newcomers to integrate into the now-dominant toxic community. Crucially, community transformation occurred through peripheral dynamics rather than hub capture: fewer than 5% of newcomers achieved central positions in most months, yet toxicity doubled. Migration structure also shaped outcomes: loosely organized communities dispersed into generalist spaces, while ideologically cohesive groups concentrated in dedicated enclaves. These findings suggest that receiving platforms face a narrow intervention window during the hostile takeover phase, after which toxic norms become self-sustaining.</description>

      <title>A new adaptive two-layer model for opinion spread in hypergraphs: parameter sensitivity and estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When opinion spread is studied, peer pressure is often modeled by interactions of more than two individuals (higher-order interactions). In our work, we introduce a two-layer random hypergraph model, in which hyperedges represent households and workplaces. Within this overlapping, adaptive structure, individuals react if their opinion is in majority in their groups. The process evolves through random steps: individuals can either change their opinion, or quit their workplace and join another one in which their opinion belongs to the majority. Based on computer simulations, our first goal is to describe the effect of the parameters responsible for the probability of changing opinion and quitting workplace on the homophily and speed of polarization. We also analyze the model as a Markov chain, and study the frequency of the absorbing states. Then, we quantitatively compare how different statistical and machine learning methods, in particular, linear regression, xgboost and a convolutional neural network perform for estimating these probabilities, based on partial information from the process, for example, the distribution of opinion configurations within households and workplaces. Among other observations, we conclude that all methods can achieve the best results under appropriate circumstances, and that the amount of information that is necessary to provide good results depends on the strength of the peer pressure effect.</description>

      <title>Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for 6G Networks: Principles, Challenges, and Quantum Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is an innovative type of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that has recently been proposed and is considered a revolutionary advancement in wave manipulation. Unlike the mutually disconnected arrangement of elements in traditional RISs, BD-RIS creates cost-effective and simple inter-element connections, allowing for greater freedom in configuring the amplitude and phase of impinging waves. However, there are numerous underlying challenges in realizing the advantages associated with BD-RIS, prompting the research community to actively investigate cutting-edge schemes and algorithms in this direction. Particularly, the passive beamforming design for BD-RIS under specific environmental conditions has become a major focus in this research area. In this article, we provide a systematic introduction to BD-RIS, elaborating on its functional principles concerning architectural design, promising advantages, and classification. Subsequently, we present recent advances and identify a series of challenges and opportunities. Additionally, we consider a specific case study where beamforming is designed using four different algorithms, and we analyze their performance with respect to sum rate and computation cost. To augment the beamforming capabilities in 6G BD-RIS with quantum enhancement, we analyze various hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (ML) models to improve beam prediction performance, employing real-world communication Scenario 8 from the DeepSense 6G dataset. Consequently, we derive useful insights about the practical implications of BD-RIS.</description>

      <title>Information is localized in growing network models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic network models can capture salient characteristics of empirical networks using a small set of domain-specific, interpretable mechanisms. Yet inference remains challenging because the likelihood is often intractable. We show that, for a broad class of growing network models, information about model parameters is localized in the network, i.e., the likelihood can be expressed in terms of small subgraphs. We take a Bayesian perspective to inference and develop neural density estimators (NDEs) to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters using graph neural networks (GNNs) with limited receptive size, i.e., the GNN can only "see" small subgraphs. We characterize nine growing network models in terms of their localization and demonstrate that localization predictions agree with NDEs on simulated data. Even for non-localized models, NDEs can infer high-fidelity posteriors matching model-specific inference methods at a fraction of the cost. Our findings establish information localization as a fundamental property of network growth, theoretically justifying the analysis of local subgraphs embedded in larger, unobserved networks and the use of GNNs with limited receptive field for likelihood-free inference.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and Adaptive Node Classification on Heterophilic Graphs via Combinatorial Scoring and Hybrid Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance on homophilic graphs but often struggle under heterophily, where adjacent nodes frequently belong to different classes. We propose an interpretable and adaptive framework for semi-supervised node classification based on explicit combinatorial inference rather than deep message passing. Our method assigns labels using a confidence-ordered greedy procedure driven by an additive scoring function that integrates class priors, neighborhood statistics, feature similarity, and training-derived label-label compatibility. A small set of transparent hyperparameters controls the relative influence of these components, enabling smooth adaptation between homophilic and heterophilic regimes.
  We further introduce a validation-gated hybrid strategy in which combinatorial predictions are optionally injected as priors into a lightweight neural model. Hybrid refinement is applied only when it improves validation performance, preserving interpretability when neuralization is unnecessary. All adaptation signals are computed strictly from training data, ensuring a leakage-free evaluation protocol. Experiments on heterophilic and transitional benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance with modern GNNs while offering advantages in interpretability, tunability, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>BLISS: Bandit Layer Importance Sampling Strategy for Efficient Training of Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, but their application to large graphs is hindered by computational costs. The need to process every neighbor for each node creates memory and computational bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce BLISS, a Bandit Layer Importance Sampling Strategy. It uses multi-armed bandits to dynamically select the most informative nodes at each layer, balancing exploration and exploitation to ensure comprehensive graph coverage. Unlike existing static sampling methods, BLISS adapts to evolving node importance, leading to more informed node selection and improved performance. It demonstrates versatility by integrating with both Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), adapting its selection policy to their specific aggregation mechanisms. Experiments show that BLISS maintains or exceeds the accuracy of full-batch training.</description>

      <title>Periodical embeddings uncover hidden interdisciplinary patterns in the subject classification scheme of science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subject classification schemes are foundational to the organization, evaluation, and navigation of scientific knowledge. While expert-curated systems like Scopus provide widely used taxonomies, they often suffer from coarse granularity, subjectivity, and limited adaptability to emerging interdisciplinary fields. Data-driven alternatives based on citation networks show promise but lack rigorous, external validation against the semantic content of scientific literature. Here, we propose a novel quantitative framework that leverages classification tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of journal classification schemes. Using over 23 million paper abstracts, we demonstrate that labels derived from k-means clustering on Periodical2Vec (P2V)--a periodical embedding learned from paper-level citations--yield significantly higher classification performance than both Scopus and other data-driven baselines (e.g., citation, co-citation, and Node2Vec variants). By comparing journal partitions across classification schemes, two structural patterns emerge on the map of science: (1) the reorganization of disciplinary boundaries--splitting overly broad categories (e.g., "Medicine" into "Oncology", "Cardiology", and other specialties) while merging artificially fragmented ones (e.g., "Chemistry" and "Chemical Engineering"); and (2) the identification of coherent interdisciplinary clusters--such as "Biomedical Engineering", "Medical Ethics", and "Information Management"--that are dispersed across multiple categories but unified in citation space. These findings underscore that citation-derived periodical embeddings not only outperform traditional taxonomies in predictive validity but also offer a dynamic, fine-grained map of science that better reflects both the specialization and interdisciplinarity inherent in contemporary research.</description>

      <title>R&amp;D Networks under Heterogeneous Firm Productivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce heterogeneous R&amp;D productivities into an endogenous R&amp;D network formation model, generalizing the framework in Goyal and Moraga-Gonzalez (2001). Heterogeneous productivities endogenously create asymmetric gains for connecting firms: the less productive firm benefits disproportionately, while the more productive firm exerts greater R&amp;D effort and incurs higher costs. For sufficiently large productivity gaps between two firms, the more productive firm experiences reduced profits from being connected to the less productive one. This overturns the benchmark results on pairwise stable networks: for sufficiently large productivity gaps, the complete network becomes unstable, whereas the Positive Assortative (PA) network -- where firms cluster by productivity levels -- emerges as stable. Simulations show that the PA structure delivers higher welfare than the complete network; nevertheless, welfare under PA formation follows an inverted U-shape in the fraction of high-productivity firms, reflecting crowding-out effects at high fractions. Altogether, a counterintuitive finding emerges: economies with higher average R&amp;D productivity may exhibit lower welfare through (i) the formation of alternative stable R&amp;D network structures or (ii) a crowding-out effect of high-productivity firms. Our findings highlight that productivity-enhancing policies should account for their impact on endogenous R&amp;D alliances and effort, as such endogenous responses may offset or even reverse the intended welfare gains.</description>

      <title>Epidemiology-informed Graph Neural Network for Heterogeneity-aware Epidemic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among various spatio-temporal prediction tasks, epidemic forecasting plays a critical role in public health management. Recent studies have demonstrated the strong potential of spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) in extracting heterogeneous spatio-temporal patterns for epidemic forecasting. However, most of these methods bear an over-simplified assumption that two locations (e.g., cities) with similar observed features in previous time steps will develop similar infection numbers in the future. In fact, for any epidemic disease, there exists strong heterogeneity of its intrinsic evolution mechanisms across geolocation and time, which can eventually lead to diverged infection numbers in two ``similar'' locations. However, such mechanistic heterogeneity is non-trivial to be captured due to the existence of numerous influencing factors like medical resource accessibility, virus mutations, mobility patterns, etc., most of which are spatio-temporal yet unreachable or even unobservable. To address this challenge, we propose a Heterogeneous Epidemic-Aware Transmission Graph Neural Network (HeatGNN), a novel epidemic forecasting framework. By binding the epidemiology mechanistic model into a GNN, HeatGNN learns epidemiology-informed location embeddings of different locations that reflect their own transmission mechanisms over time. With the time-varying mechanistic affinity graphs computed with the epidemiology-informed location embeddings, a heterogeneous transmission graph network is designed to encode the mechanistic heterogeneity among locations, providing additional predictive signals to facilitate accurate forecasting. Experiments on three benchmark datasets have revealed that HeatGNN outperforms various strong baselines. Moreover, our efficiency analysis verifies the real-world practicality of HeatGNN on datasets of different sizes.</description>
