      <title>Quantile connectedness across BRICS and international grain futures markets: Insights from the Russia-Ukraine conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the quantile connectedness among grain futures markets in BRICS and international markets, with a particular focus on the ongoing and escalating impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The findings reveal significant heterogeneity in spillover effects across different quantiles and market conditions. Specifically, the time-varying total connectedness index (TCI) consistently fluctuated around 95\% under both extreme bearish and bullish market conditions, markedly higher than in normal market conditions. Moreover, across all quantile levels, the TCI was higher during the pre-outbreak period than in the post-outbreak period. This systemic risk has notably decreased following the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the subsequent changes to the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Apart from rice, U.S. grain futures maintained a dominant position as benchmarks for international grain prices, exerting substantial influence over the grain futures markets in BRICS throughout most of the period. Finally, the study highlights that the influence of grain type and regional proximity strengthens pairwise connectedness among futures markets, with short-term spillovers being dominant and the spillover effect generally symmetric across quantiles.</description>

      <title>Best- and worst-case Scenarios for GlueVaR distortion risk measure with Incomplete information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives the best- and worst-case GlueVaR distortion risk measure within a unified framework, based on partial information of the underlying distributions and shape information such as symmetry. In addition, we characterize the extremal distributions of GlueVaR with convex envelopes of the corresponding distortion functions. As examples, extremal cases of VaR, TVaR and RVaR are derived.</description>
