      <title>Passivity-Based Robust Shape Control of a Cable-Driven Solar Sail Boom for the CABLESSail Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar sails provide a means of propulsion using solar radiation pressure, which offers the possibility of exciting new spacecraft capabilities. However, solar sails have attitude control challenges because of the significant disturbance torques that they encounter due to imperfections in the sail and its supporting structure, as well as limited actuation capabilities. The Cable-Actuated Bio-inspired Lightweight Elastic Solar Sail (CABLESSail) concept was previously proposed to overcome these challenges by controlling the shape of the sail through cable actuation. The structural flexibility of CABLESSail introduces control challenges, which necessitate the design of a robust feedback controller for this system. The purpose of the proposed research here is to design a robust controller to ensure precise and reliable control of CABLESSail's boom. Taking into account the system dynamics and the dynamic properties of the CABLESSail concept, a passivity-based proportional-derivative (PD) controller for a single boom on the CABLESSail system is designed. To reach the nonzero desired setpoints, a feedforward input is additionally applied to the control law and a time-varying feedforward input is used instead of the constant one to effectively track a time-varying desired boom tip deflection. This control law is assessed by numerical simulations and by tests using a smaller-scale prototype of Solar Cruiser. Both the simulation and the test results show that this PD control with the time-varying feedforward input robustly controls the flexible cable-actuated solar sail.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Soft and Comfortable Pressure-Sensing Shoe Sole for Intuitive Monitoring of Human Quality Gaits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study discusses the design and fabrication of flexible pressure sensors using Ecoflex/Graphene composites. The fabricated sensor is used for the application of intuitive monitoring of human quality gaits and implementation of the soft and comfortable shoe sole for rehabilitation of the patients with foot disorder is also taken into consideration. The sensor is fabricated using molding and casting technique by sandwiching the thin film Ecoflex/Graphene composites between the copper (Cu) electrodes with the dimension of 15 x 15 mm2 with high sensitivity. There are five pressure sensors integrated in the shoe sole, a sensor at the forefoot, three sensors at the midfoot and one sensor at the lower foot (heel). The behavior of the sensor is negative piezoresistive in which the resistance decreases as the pressure increases. The sensors are embedded in a soft and comfortable shoe sole and then integrated with a laptop or mobile application to monitor and analyze human gait in real-time. Furthermore, a dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI) is designed to read the data. The pressure sensors are integrated with ESP32 microcontroller which wirelessly transmit data to the GUI and smart phones which could be further used in the intuitive monitoring, rehabilitation of the patients with foot disorder or neuromotor diseases.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Online Control for Decarbonizing Water Infrastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water infrastructures are essential for drinking water supply, irrigation, fire protection, and other critical applications. However, water pumping systems, which are key to transporting water to the point of use, consume significant amounts of energy and emit millions of tons of greenhouse gases annually. With the wide deployment of digital water meters and sensors in these infrastructures, Machine Learning (ML) has the potential to optimize water supply control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, the inherent vulnerability of ML methods in terms of worst-case performance raises safety concerns when deployed in critical water infrastructures. To address this challenge, we propose a learning-augmented online control algorithm, termed LAOC, designed to dynamically schedule the activation and/or speed of water pumps. To ensure safety, we introduce a novel design of safe action sets for online control problems. By leveraging these safe action sets, LAOC can provably guarantee safety constraints while utilizing ML predictions to reduce energy and environmental costs. Our analysis reveals the tradeoff between safety requirements and average energy/environmental cost performance. Additionally, we conduct an experimental study on a building water supply system to demonstrate the empirical performance of LAOC. The results indicate that LAOC can effectively reduce environmental and energy costs while guaranteeing safety constraints.</description>

      <title>Optimal Investment under Mutual Strategy Influence among Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In financial markets, agents often mutually influence each other's investment strategies and adjust their strategies to align with others. However, there is limited quantitative study of agents' investment strategies in such scenarios. In this work, we formulate the optimal investment differential game problem to study the mutual influence among agents. We derive the analytical solutions for agents' optimal strategies and propose a fast algorithm to find approximate solutions with low computational complexity. We theoretically analyze the impact of mutual influence on agents' optimal strategies and terminal wealth. When the mutual influence is strong and approaches infinity, we show that agents' optimal strategies converge to the asymptotic strategy. Furthermore, in general cases, we prove that agents' optimal strategies are linear combinations of the asymptotic strategy and their rational strategies without others' influence. We validate the performance of the fast algorithm and verify the correctness of our analysis using numerical experiments. This work is crucial to comprehend mutual influence among agents and design effective mechanisms to guide their strategies in financial markets.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Meta Distribution Analysis of Wireless Systems with Application to the Reliability of UWB THz Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication reliability, as defined by 3GPP, refers to the probability of providing a desired quality of service (QoS). This metric is typically quantified for wireless networks by averaging the QoS success indicator over spatial and temporal random variables. Recently, the meta distribution (MD) has emerged as a two-level performance analysis tool for wireless networks, offering a detailed examination of the outer level (i.e., system-level) reliability assessment versus the inner level (i.e., link-level) reliability thresholds. Most existing studies focus on first-order spatiotemporal MD reliability analyses, and the benefits of leveraging MD reliability for applications beyond this structure remain unexplored, a gap addressed in this paper. We present wireless application examples that can benefit the higher-order MD reliability analysis. Specifically, we provide the analysis and numerical results for a second-order spatial-spectral-temporal MD reliability of ultra-wideband THz communication. The results demonstrate the value of the hierarchical representation of MD reliability across three domains and the impact of the inner-layer target reliability on the overall MD reliability measure.</description>

      <title>Joint Infrastructure Planning and Order Assignment for On-Demand Food-Delivery Services with Coordinated Drones and Human Couriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal infrastructure planning and order assignment problem of an on-demand food-delivery platform with a mixed fleet of drones and human couriers. The platform has two delivery modes: (a) ground delivery and (b) drone-assisted delivery (i.e., air delivery). In ground delivery, couriers directly collect and transport orders from restaurants to destinations. For air delivery, the delivery process involves three legs: initially, a human courier picks up the order from the restaurant and transports it to a nearby launchpad, where personnel load the orders onto drones and replace batteries as needed. The loaded drone then transports the order from the launchpad to a kiosk, where another courier retrieves the order from the kiosk for final delivery. The platform must determine the optimal locations for launchpads and kiosks within a transportation network, and devise an order assignment strategy that allocates food-delivery orders between ground and air delivery considering the bundling probabilities of ground deliveries and the waiting times at launchpads and kiosks. We formulate the platform's problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program and develop a novel neural network-assisted optimization method to obtain high-quality solutions. A case study in Hong Kong validates our model and algorithm, revealing that drone delivery reduces operational costs, minimizes courier fleet size, and increases order bundling opportunities. We also find that the expansion of air delivery services may entail larger delivery times due to the trade-off between the travel time savings induced by the faster air delivery and the associated detours incurred by intermodal transfer and extra waiting times at launchpads and kiosks, which crucially depends on the distance of the orders and the sequence of activating long-distance air delivery routes versus short-distance ones.</description>

      <title>CSI-Free Low-Complexity Remote State Estimation over Wireless MIMO Fading Channels using Semantic Analog Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate low-complexity remote system state estimation over wireless multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels without requiring prior knowledge of channel state information (CSI). We start by reviewing the conventional Kalman filtering-based state estimation algorithm, which typically relies on perfect CSI and incurs considerable computational complexity. To overcome the need for CSI, we introduce a novel semantic aggregation method, in which sensors transmit semantic measurement discrepancies to the remote state estimator through analog aggregation. To further reduce computational complexity, we introduce a constant-gain-based filtering algorithm that can be optimized offline using the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) method. We derive a closed-form sufficient condition for the estimation stability of our proposed scheme via Lyapunov drift analysis. Numerical results showcase significant performance gains using the proposed scheme compared to several widely used methods.</description>

      <title>A Transferable Physics-Informed Framework for Battery Degradation Diagnosis, Knee-Onset Detection and Knee Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The techno-economic and safety concerns of battery capacity knee occurrence call for developing online knee detection and prediction methods as an advanced battery management system (BMS) function. To address this, a transferable physics-informed framework that consists of a histogram-based feature engineering method, a hybrid physics-informed model, and a fine-tuning strategy, is proposed for online battery degradation diagnosis and knee-onset detection. The hybrid model is first developed and evaluated using a scenario-aware pipeline in protocol cycling scenarios and then fine-tuned to create a local model deployed in a dynamic cycling scenario. A 2D histogram-based feature set is found to be the best choice in both source and target scenarios. The fine-tuning strategy is proven to be effective in improving battery degradation mode estimation and degradation phase detection performance in the target scenario. Again, a strong linear correlation was found between the identified knee-onset and knee points. As a result, advanced BMS functions, such as online degradation diagnosis and prognosis, online knee-onset detection and knee prediction, aging-aware battery classification, and second-life repurposing, can be enabled through a battery performance digital twin in the cloud.</description>

      <title>A sub-structuring approach for model reduction of frictionally clamped thin-walled structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-walled structures clamped by friction joints, such as aircraft skin panels are exposed to bending-stretching coupling and frictional contact. We propose an original sub-structuring approach, where the system is divided into thin-walled and support regions, so that geometrically nonlinear behavior is relevant only in the former, and nonlinear contact behavior only in the latter. This permits to derive reduced component models, in principle, with available techniques. The Hurty-/Craig-Bampton method, combined with an interface reduction relying on an orthogonal polynomial series, is used to construct the reduction basis for each component. To model geometrically nonlinear behavior, implicit condensation is used, where an original, engineering-oriented proposition is made for the delicate scaling of the static load cases required to estimate the coefficients of the nonlinear terms. The proposed method is validated and its computational performance is assessed for the example of a plate with frictional clamping, using finite element analysis as reference. The numerical results shed light into an interesting mutual interaction: The extent of geometric hardening is limited by the reduced boundary stiffness when more sliding occurs in the clamping. On the other hand, the frictional dissipation is increased by the tangential loading induced by membrane stretching.</description>

      <title>Predictive Position Estimation for Remote Surgery under Packet Loss Using the Informer Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and real-time position estimation of the robotic arm on the patient's side is crucial for the success of remote robotic surgery in Tactile Internet environments. This paper proposes a predictive approach using the computationally efficient Transformer-based Informer model for position estimation, combined with a Four-State Hidden Markov Model (4-State HMM) to simulate realistic packet loss scenarios. The method effectively addresses network-induced delays, jitter, and packet loss, ensuring reliable performance in remote robotic surgery. The study evaluates the Informer model on the JIGSAWS dataset, demonstrating its capability to handle sequential data challenges caused by network uncertainties. Key features, including ProbSparse attention and a generative-style decoder, enhance prediction accuracy, computational speed, and memory efficiency. Results indicate that the proposed method achieves over 90 percent accuracy across varying network conditions. Furthermore, the Informer framework outperforms traditional models such as TCN, RNN, and LSTM, highlighting its suitability for real-time remote surgery applications.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-Process-based Adaptive Tracking Control with Dynamic Active Learning for Autonomous Ground Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes an active-learning-based adaptive trajectory tracking control method for autonomous ground vehicles to compensate for modeling errors and unmodeled dynamics. The nominal vehicle model is decoupled into lateral and longitudinal subsystems, which are augmented with online Gaussian Processes (GPs), using measurement data. The estimated mean functions of the GPs are used to construct a feedback compensator, which, together with an LPV state feedback controller designed for the nominal system, gives the adaptive control structure. To assist exploration of the dynamics, the paper proposes a new, dynamic active learning method to collect the most informative samples to accelerate the training process. To analyze the performance of the overall learning tool-chain provided controller, a novel iterative, counterexample-based algorithm is proposed for calculating the induced L2 gain between the reference trajectory and the tracking error. The analysis can be executed for a set of possible realizations of the to-be-controlled system, giving robust performance certificate of the learning method under variation of the vehicle dynamics. The efficiency of the proposed control approach is shown on a high-fidelity physics simulator and in real experiments using a 1/10 scale F1TENTH electric car.</description>

      <title>Decision-Focused Learning for Complex System Identification: HVAC Management System Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As opposed to conventional training methods tailored to minimize a given statistical metric or task-agnostic loss (e.g., mean squared error), Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) trains machine learning models for optimal performance in downstream decision-making tools. We argue that DFL can be leveraged to learn the parameters of system dynamics, expressed as constraint of the convex optimization control policy, while the system control signal is being optimized, thus creating an end-to-end learning framework. This is particularly relevant for systems in which behavior changes once the control policy is applied, hence rendering historical data less applicable. The proposed approach can perform system identification - i.e., determine appropriate parameters for the system analytical model - and control simultaneously to ensure that the model's accuracy is focused on areas most relevant to control. Furthermore, because black-box systems are non-differentiable, we design a loss function that requires solely to measure the system response. We propose pre-training on historical data and constraint relaxation to stabilize the DFL and deal with potential infeasibilities in learning. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method on a building Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning day-ahead management system for a realistic 15-zone building located in Denver, US. The results show that the conventional RC building model, with the parameters obtained from historical data using supervised learning, underestimates HVAC electrical power consumption. For our case study, the ex-post cost is on average six times higher than the expected one. Meanwhile, the same RC model with parameters obtained via DFL underestimates the ex-post cost only by 3%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a non-cooperative distributed model predictive controller for the control of large-scale District Heating Networks. To enable the design of this controller a novel information passing scheme and feasibility restoration method are created, allowing the local controllers to achieve a global consensus while minimizing a local cost function. The effectiveness of this controller is demonstrated on an 18-user District Heating Network decomposed into six subsystems. The results show that the developed control scheme effectively uses flexibility to manage the buildings' heat demands reducing the total losses by 14% and the return temperature by 37%.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Cyber-Attack Detection in IIoT Using Attention-Based LSTM-CNN Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) has introduced new challenges in securing critical infrastructures against sophisticated cyberthreats. This study presents the development and evaluation of an advanced Intrusion detection (IDS) based on a hybrid LSTM-convolution neural network (CNN)-Attention architecture, specifically designed to detect and classify cyberattacks in IIoT environments. The research focuses on two key classification tasks: binary and multi-class classification. The proposed models was rigorously tested using the Edge-IIoTset dataset. To mitigate the class imbalance in the dataset, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was employed to generate synthetic samples for the underrepresented classes. This ensured that the model could learn effectively from all classes, thereby improving the overall classification performance. Through systematic experimentation, various deep learning (DL) models were compared, ultimately demonstrating that the LSTM-CNN-Attention model consistently outperformed others across key performance metrics. In binary classification, the model achieved near-perfect accuracy, while in multi-class classification, it maintained a high accuracy level (99.04%), effectively categorizing different attack types with a loss value of 0.0220%.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Explainable Verification of Image-based Neural Network Controllers for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing formal verification methods for image-based neural network controllers in autonomous vehicles often struggle with high-dimensional inputs, computational inefficiency, and a lack of explainability. These challenges make it difficult to ensure safety and reliability, as processing high-dimensional image data is computationally intensive and neural networks are typically treated as black boxes. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{SEVIN} (Scalable and Explainable Verification of Image-Based Neural Network Controllers), a framework that leverages a Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to encode high-dimensional images into a lower-dimensional, explainable latent space. By annotating latent variables with corresponding control actions, we generate convex polytopes that serve as structured input spaces for verification, significantly reducing computational complexity and enhancing scalability. Integrating the VAE's decoder with the neural network controller allows for formal and robustness verification using these explainable polytopes. Our approach also incorporates robustness verification under real-world perturbations by augmenting the dataset and retraining the VAE to capture environmental variations. Experimental results demonstrate that SEVIN achieves efficient and scalable verification while providing explainable insights into controller behavior, bridging the gap between formal verification techniques and practical applications in safety-critical systems.</description>

      <title>Development of a Validation and Inspection Tool for Armband-based Lifelog Data (VITAL) to Facilitate the Clinical Use of Wearable Data: A Prototype and Usability Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: The rise of mobile technology and health apps has increased the use of person-generated health data (PGHD). PGHD holds significant potential for clinical decision-making but remains challenging to manage. Objective: This study aimed to enhance the clinical utilization of wearable health data by developing the Validation and Inspection Tool for Armband-Based Lifelog Data (VITAL), a pipeline for data integration, visualization, and quality management, and evaluating its usability. Methods: The study followed a structured process of requirement gathering, tool implementation, and usability evaluation. Requirements were identified through input from four clinicians. Wearable health data from Samsung, Apple, Fitbit, and Xiaomi devices were integrated into a standardized dataframe at 10-minute intervals, focusing on biometrics, activity, and sleep. Features of VITAL support data integration, visualization, and quality management. Usability evaluation involved seven clinicians performing tasks, completing the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) survey, and participating in interviews to identify usability issues. Results: VITAL successfully integrated wearable data, thus enabling all participants to complete tasks with minimal errors without prior participant training. UTAUT survey results were positive, with average scores of 4.2 for performance expectancy, 3.96 for effort expectancy, and 4.14 for intention to use, indicating high user satisfaction and intent to adopt the tool. Conclusions: By enhancing wearable data integration, visualization, and quality management, the VITAL prototype shows significant potential for clinical application. Positive feedback highlights its promise, while emphasizing the need for further studies to confirm its real-world effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Constrained Fuel and Time Optimal 6DOF Powered Descent Guidance Using Indirect Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powered descent guidance (PDG) problems subject to six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) dynamics allow for enforcement of practical attitude constraints. However, numerical solutions to 6DOF PDG problems are challenging due to fast rotational dynamics coupled with translational dynamics, and the presence of highly nonlinear state/control path inequality constraints. In this work, constrained fuel- and time-optimal 6DOF PDG problems are solved leveraging a regularized indirect method, subject to inequality constraints on the thrust magnitude, thruster gimbal angle, rocket tilt angle, glideslope angle, and angular velocity magnitude. To overcome the challenges associated with solving the resulting multipoint boundary-value problems (MPBVPs), the state-only path inequality constraints (SOPICs) are enforced through an interior penalty function method, which embeds the resulting MPBVPs into a multi-parameter smooth neighboring families of two-point BVPs. Extremal solutions are obtained using an indirect multiple-shooting solution method with numerical continuation. Moreover, an empirical relation is derived for the directly-adjoined Lagrange multipliers associated with SOPICs. The fuel- and time-optimal trajectories are compared against solutions of DIDO -- a capable pseudospectral-based software for solving practical constrained optimal control problems.</description>

Abstract: For educational institutions in STEM areas, the provision of practical learning scenarios is, traditionally, a major concern. In the 21st century, the explosion of ICTs, as well as the universalization of low-cost hardware, have allowed the proliferation of technical solutions for any field; in the case of experimentation, encouraging the emergence and proliferation of non-traditional experimentation platforms. This movement has resulted in enriched practical environments, with wider adaptability for both students and teachers. In this paper, the evolution of scholar production has been analyzed at the global level from 2000 to 2020. Current and emerging experimentation scenarios have been identified, specifying the scope and boundaries between them.</description>

      <title>Robustified Time-optimal Point-to-point Motion Planning and Control under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to formulate time-optimal point-to-point motion planning and control under uncertainty. The approach defines a robustified two-stage Optimal Control Problem (OCP), in which stage 1, with a fixed time grid, is seamlessly stitched with stage 2, which features a variable time grid. Stage 1 optimizes not only the nominal trajectory, but also feedback gains and corresponding state covariances, which robustify constraints in both stages. The outcome is a minimized uncertainty in stage 1 and a minimized total motion time for stage 2, both contributing to the time optimality and safety of the total motion. A timely replanning strategy is employed to handle changes in constraints and maintain feasibility, while a tailored iterative algorithm is proposed for efficient, real-time OCP execution.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Operation and Control of a Multi-Stack Alkaline Water Electrolysis System with Shared Gas Separators and Lye Circulation: A Model-Based Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An emerging approach for large-scale hydrogen production using renewable energy is to integrate multiple alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) stacks into a single balance of plant (BoP) system, sharing components such as gas-lye separation and lye circulation. This configuration, termed the $N$-in-1 AWE system, packs $N$ stacks into a modular system, reducing land requirements, the complexity of plant topology, and overall capital costs. However, the coupling of these stacks through the shared BoP introduces challenges in dynamic operation under varying energy inputs, making their performance unclear compared to traditional 1-in-1 systems. To address this, we develop a state-space model of the $N$-in-1 AWE system, capturing the dynamic behaviors of lye circulation, temperature, and HTO impurity, and their impact on energy conversion efficiency. We then propose a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) to coordinately optimize inter-stack electrolytic current distribution, lye flow, and cooling, enabling the system to dynamically track varying load commands while maximizing efficiency, stabilizing temperature, and limiting HTO impurity accumulation. Simulation studies on a 4,000 Nm$^3$/h-rated 4-in-1 system verify the proposed controller under dynamic operation. Comparison with 4 independent 1-in-1 systems reveals that, with proper control, the $N$-in-1 configuration offers comparable flexibility in accommodating real-world wind power inputs. The average differences in the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for load-tracking and stack temperature stabilization, and specific energy consumption are below 0.014 MW, 2.356 K, and 0.003 kWh/Nm$^3$.</description>

      <title>Predictor-Feedback Stabilization of Globally Lipschitz Nonlinear Systems with State and Input Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a switched nonlinear predictor-feedback control law to achieve global asymptotic stabilization for nonlinear systems with arbitrarily long input delay, under state quantization. The proposed design generalizes the nonlinear predictor-feedback framework by incorporating quantized measurements of both the plant and actuator states into the predictor state formulation. Due to the mismatch between the (inapplicable) exact predictor state and the predictor state constructed in the presence of state quantization, a global stabilization result is possible under a global Lipschitzness assumption on the vector field, as well as under the assumption of existence of a globally Lipschitz, nominal feedback law that achieves global exponential stability of the delay and quantization-free system. To address the constraints imposed by quantization, a dynamic switching strategy is constructed, adjusting the quantizer's tunable parameter in a piecewise constant manner-initially increasing the quantization range, to capture potentially large system states and subsequently refining the precision to reduce quantization error. The global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is established through solutions estimates derived using backstepping transformations, combined with small-gain and input-to-state stability arguments. We also extend our approach to the case of input quantization.</description>

Abstract: With advancements in technology, the smaller versions of satellites have gained momentum in the space industry for earth monitoring and communication-based applications. The rise of CanSat technology has significantly impacted the space industry by providing a cost-effective solution for space exploration. CanSat is a simulation model of a real satellite and plays a crucial role in collecting and transmitting atmospheric data. This paper discusses the design of an Onboard Computer System forCanSat, used to study various environmental parameters by monitoring the concentrations of gases in the atmosphere. The Onboard Computer System uses GPS, accelerometer, altitude, temperature, pressure, gyroscope, magnetometer, UV radiation, and air quality sensors for atmospheric sensing. A highly efficient and low-power ESP32 microcontroller and a transceiver module are used to acquire data, facilitate seamless communication and transmit the collected data to the ground station.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic Disturbance Observer for Wideband Harmonic Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic disturbances composed of harmonics typically occur during periodic operations, impairing performance of mechanical and electrical systems. To improve the performance, control of periodic-disturbance suppression has been studied, such as repetitive control and periodic-disturbance observers. However, actual periodic disturbances are typically quasiperiodic owing to perturbations in each cycle, identification errors of the period, variations in the period, and/or aperiodic disturbances. For robustness against quasiperiodicity, although wideband harmonic suppression is expected, conventional methods have trade-offs among harmonic suppression bandwidth, amplification of aperiodic disturbances, and deviation of harmonic suppression frequencies. This paper proposes a quasiperiodic disturbance observer to compensate for quasiperiodic disturbances while simultaneously achieving the wideband harmonic suppression, non-amplification of aperiodic disturbances, and proper harmonic suppression frequencies. A quasiperiodic disturbance is defined as comprising harmonics and surrounding signals. On the basis of this definition, the quasiperiodic disturbance observer is designed using a periodic-pass filter of a first-order periodic/aperiodic separation filter for its Q-filter, time delay integrated with a zero-phase low-pass filter, and an inverse plant model with a first-order low-pass filter. The periodic-pass filter achieves the wideband harmonic suppression while the zero-phase and first-order low-pass filters prevent the amplification of aperiodic disturbances and deviation of harmonic suppression frequencies. For the implementation, the Q-filter is discretized by an exact mapping of the s-plane to the z-plane, and the inverse plant model is discretized by the backward Euler method. The experiments validated the frequency response and position-control precision of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>ElectricityEmissions.jl: A Framework for the Comparison of Carbon Intensity Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An increasing number of individuals, companies and organizations are interested in computing and minimizing the carbon emissions associated with their real-time electricity consumption. To achieve this, they require a carbon signal, i.e. a metric that defines the real-time carbon intensity of their electricity supply. Unfortunately, in a grid with multiple generation sources and multiple consumers, the physics of the system do not provide an unambiguous way to trace electricity from source to sink. As a result, there are a multitude of proposed carbon signals, each of which has a distinct set of properties and method of calculation. It remains unclear which signal best quantifies the carbon footprint of electricity. This paper seeks to inform the discussion about which carbon signal is better or more suitable for two important use cases, namely carbon-informed load shifting and carbon accounting. We do this by developing a new software package ElectricityEmissions$.$jl, that computes several established and newly proposed carbon emission metrics for standard electric grid test cases. We also demonstrate how the package can be used to investigate the effects of using these metrics to guide load shifting. Our results affirm previous research, which showed that the choice of carbon emission metric has significant impact on shifting results and associated carbon emission reductions. In addition, we demonstrate the impact of load shifting on both the consumers that perform the shifting and consumers that do not. Disconcertingly, we observe that shifting according to common metrics such as average carbon emissions can reduce the amount of emissions allocated to the consumer doing the shifting, while increasing the total emissions of the power system.</description>

      <title>Input Convex Lipschitz RNN: A Fast and Robust Approach for Engineering Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07494v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational efficiency and robustness are essential in process modeling, optimization, and control for real-world engineering applications. While neural network-based approaches have gained significant attention in recent years, conventional neural networks often fail to address these two critical aspects simultaneously or even independently. Inspired by natural physical systems and established literature, input convex architectures are known to enhance computational efficiency in optimization tasks, whereas Lipschitz-constrained architectures improve robustness. However, combining these properties within a single model requires careful review, as inappropriate methods for enforcing one property can undermine the other. To overcome this, we introduce a novel network architecture, termed Input Convex Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Networks (ICLRNNs). This architecture seamlessly integrates the benefits of convexity and Lipschitz continuity, enabling fast and robust neural network-based modeling and optimization. The ICLRNN outperforms existing recurrent units in both computational efficiency and robustness. Additionally, it has been successfully applied to practical engineering scenarios, such as modeling and control of chemical process and the modeling and real-world solar irradiance prediction for solar PV system planning at LHT Holdings in Singapore.

      <title>Hidden Markov Models and the Bayes Filter in Categorical Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Markov categories to generalize the basic theory of Markov chains and hidden Markov models to an abstract setting. This comprises characterizations of hidden Markov models in terms of conditional independences and algorithms for Bayesian filtering and smoothing applicable in all Markov categories with conditionals. When instantiated in appropriate Markov categories, these algorithms specialize to existing ones such as the Kalman filter, forward-backward algorithm, and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. We also prove that the sequence of outputs of our abstract Bayes filter is itself a Markov chain with a concrete formula for its transition maps.
  There are two main features of this categorical framework. The first is its abstract generality, as manifested in our unified account of hidden Markov models and algorithms for filtering and smoothing in discrete probability, Gaussian probability, measure-theoretic probability, possibilistic nondeterminism and others at the same time. The second feature is the intuitive visual representation of information flow in terms of string diagrams.</description>
