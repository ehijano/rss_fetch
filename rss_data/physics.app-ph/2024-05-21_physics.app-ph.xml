      <title>Wafer-scale fabrication of evacuated alkali vapor cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a process for fabricating a wafer-scale array of alkali metal vapor cells with low residual gas pressure. We show that by etching long, thin channels between the cells on the Si wafer surface, the residual gas pressure in the evacuated vapor cell can be reduced to below 0.5 kPa (4 Torr) with a yield above 50 %. The low residual gas pressure in these mass-producible alkali vapor cells can enable a new generation of low-cost chip-scale atomic devices such as vapor cell optical clocks, wavelength references, and Rydberg sensors.</description>

      <title>Extended T2 times of shallow implanted NV in chemically mechanically polished diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical polishing of diamond is known to be detrimental to the spin lifetime and strain environment of near-surface defects. By utilising a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process, we demonstrate that we can achieve 13C-limited spin lifetimes of shallow implanted (&lt;34 nm) NV centres in an industrially scalable process. We compare spin lifetimes (T2) of three diamonds processed with CMP with one processed by inductively-coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE), and observe an increased median T2 of 355 microseconds in the CMP-processed samples for 15NV centres implanted and annealed under identical conditions.</description>

      <title>Laser Offset Stabilization with Chip-Scale Atomic Diffractive Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving precise and adjustable control over laser frequency is an essential requirement in numerous applications such as precision spectroscopy, quantum control, and sensing. In many such applications it is desired to stabilize a laser with a variable detuning from an atomic line. In this study, we employ an offset-stabilization scheme by utilizing phase contrast spectroscopy in microfabricated atomic diffractive elements vapor-cells. The spectroscopic response of such a device generates oscillating optical fringes, providing multiple optical frequency stabilization points across a bandwidth of tens of gigahertz, centered around the absorption resonances of Rb. Using this device, we demonstrate laser stabilization at various offset frequencies with instabilities reaching sub-megahertz levels. We further explore the fundamental limitations of our hybrid atomic-photonic device, drawing parallels to birefringent and dichroic spectroscopy apparatuses, which are commonly employed for offset stabilization. Our system showcases a broad offset lock bandwidth, a highly compact footprint, scalability to chip-scale production, and the ability to operate without reliance on magnetic fields. These attributes pave the way for a multitude of applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Non-Invasive Readout of the Kinetic Inductance of Superconducting Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy landscape of multiply connected superconducting structures is ruled by fluxoid quantization due to the implied single-valuedness of the complex wave function. The transitions and interaction between these energy states, each defined by a specific phase winding number, are governed by classical and/or quantum phase slips. Understanding these events requires the ability to probe, non-invasively, the state of the ring. Here, we employ a niobium resonator to examine the superconducting properties of an aluminum loop. By applying a magnetic field, adjusting temperature, and altering the loop's dimensions via focused ion beam milling, we correlate resonance frequency shifts with changes in the loop's kinetic inductance. This parameter is a unique indicator of the superconducting condensate's state, facilitating the detection of phase slips in nanodevices and providing insights into their dynamics. Our method presents a proof-of-principle spectroscopic technique with promising potential for investigating the Cooper pair density in inductively coupled superconducting nanostructures.</description>

      <title>About "Float stacked graphene PMMA laminate"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the scientific and technical queries regarding the article reported by Kim et al.1 on the mechanical properties of graphene-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) composites. Our analysis finds that the current experimental data is insufficient to fully support the conclusions presented in the article. We suggest the enhancement in Youngs modulus and strength of the graphene-PMMA laminates (GPL) samples are mainly due to the heat treatment of the polymer rather than the incorporation of graphene. The Raman spectroscopy data (as per our analysis) for the GPL samples indicates that large cracks and defects were introduced during the hot rolling process used to fabricate the graphene-PMMA composite. We believe that the queries will aid the audience in better understanding the mechanical response of graphene-PMMA composites.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the role of electron transfer in the photoluminescence of $\mathrm{MoS_{2}}$ quantum dots synthesized by fs-pulse ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herein, $\mathrm{MoS_{2}}$ quantum dot (QDs) with controlled optical, structural, and electronic properties are synthesized using the femtosecond pulsed laser ablation in liquid (fs-PLAL) technique by varying pulse-width, ablation power, and ablation time to harness the potential for next-generation optoelectronics and quantum technology. Furthermore, this work elucidates key aspects of the mechanisms underlying the near-UV and blue emission, the accompanying large Stokes-shift, and the consequent change in sample color with laser exposure parameters pertaining to $\mathrm{MoS_{2}}$ QDs. Through spectroscopic analysis, including UV-visible absorption, photoluminescence, and Raman spectroscopy, we successfully unravelled the mechanisms for the change in optoelectronic properties of $\mathrm{MoS_{2}}$ QDs with laser parameters. We realize that the occurrence of a secondary phase, specifically $\mathrm{MoO_{3-x}}$, is responsible for the significant Stokes-shift and blue emission observed in this QDs system. The primary factor influencing these activities is the electron transfer observed between these two phases, as validated by excitation dependent photoluminescence, XPS and Raman spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Formation of C1 oxygenates by Activation of Methane on B, N Co-doped Graphene Surface Decorated by Oxygen Pre-covered Ir13 Cluster: A First Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the adsorption and dehydrogenation of methane on the BNG-Ir13 cluster at both low and high oxygen coverage. The DFT calculations show that the low-oxygen-coverage BNG-Ir13 cluster (BNG-Ir13O cluster) forms methanol and formaldehyde with a lower activation energy barrier compared to the high-oxygen-coverage BNG Ir13 cluster. Furthermore, the results reveal that the BNG-Ir13 cluster with low oxygen coverage has a higher methane adsorption energy and a lower activation energy barrier for methane dissociation compared to the high-oxygen-coverage BNG-Ir13 cluster. Quantitatively, the methane adsorption energy on the low-oxygen-coverage BNG-Ir13 cluster is -0.44 eV, and the second dehydrogenation of methane is the rate-determining step with an energy barrier of 1.24 eV, in both cases lower numbers than those observed for the high-oxygen-coverage BNG-Ir13 cluster.</description>

      <title>Mixing in superhydrophobic biomimetic rose petal passive microchannel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laminar flow prevails in microfluidic channels, and mixing is limited by the slow diffusive process at the interface between the mixing liquids. Whitesides and co-workers demonstrated a chaotic mixer by patterning the floor of the microchannel with obliquely oriented microridges. This creates an anisotropic resistance to flow, inducing exponential increase in stretching and folding of fluid elements leading to a dramatic increase in mixing. Rose petals that have micro papillae decorated with nanofolds, present a unique biomimetic, superhydrophobic, super adhesive surface. In the present work, a positive and negative replica of the rose petal surface was created using a simple, inexpensive soft lithographic technique and these replicas formed the floor of the microchannel. The floor of the channel naturally presents alternating slip and no slip boundary conditions for the fluid flow that in turn provides anisotropic drag reduction. We find that mixing index obtained for positive replica floor channel is distinctly higher than that of a negative replica floor channel. The variation in mixing index with Peclet number for the replicated channels are explained by characterizing their wetting behavior using contact angle and confocal microscopy. The enhancement in mixing due to the patterning of the floor is quantified by calculating the percentage change in mixing in the replicated channels from the corresponding simple Y channel values. The maximum percentage change is obtained for the positive replica floor channel (77.2 %) and compares well with chaotic mixer having obliquely oriented ridges on the floor (74.7 %).</description>

      <title>Frequency stabilization of self-sustained oscillations in a sideband-driven electromechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to stabilize the frequency of self-sustained vibrations in micro- and nanomechanical resonators. The method refers to a two-mode system with the vibrations at significantly different frequencies. The signal from one mode is used to control the other mode. In the experiment, self-sustained oscillations of micromechanical modes are excited by pumping at the blue-detuned sideband of the higher-frequency mode. Phase fluctuations of the two modes show near perfect anti-correlation. They can be compensated in either one of the modes by a stepwise change of the pump phase. The phase change of the controlled mode is proportional to the pump phase change, with the proportionality constant independent of the pump amplitude and frequency. This finding allows us to stabilize the phase of one mode against phase diffusion using the measured phase of the other mode. We demonstrate that phase fluctuations of either the high or low frequency mode can be significantly reduced. The results open new opportunities in generating stable vibrations in a broad frequency range via parametric downconversion in nonlinear resonators.</description>

      <title>CMOS-Compatible, AlScN-Based Integrated Electro-Optic Modulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commercial production of integrated photonic devices is limited by scalability of desirable material platforms. We explore a relatively new photonic material, AlScN, for its use in electro-optic modulation. Its CMOS-compatibility could facilitate large-scale production of integrated photonic modulators, and it exhibits an enhanced second-order optical nonlinearity compared to intrinsic AlN, indicating the possibility for efficient modulation. Here, we measure the electro-optic effect in AlScN-based modulators, demonstrating $V_{\pi}L$ around 750 V$\cdot$cm. Since the electro-optic response is smaller than expected, we discuss potential causes for the reduced response and future outlook for AlScN-based photonics.</description>

      <title>Computational predictions of hydrogen-assisted fatigue crack growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new model is presented to predict hydrogen-assisted fatigue. The model combines a phase field description of fracture and fatigue, stress-assisted hydrogen diffusion, and a toughness degradation formulation with cyclic and hydrogen contributions. Hydrogen-assisted fatigue crack growth predictions exhibit an excellent agreement with experiments over all the scenarios considered, spanning multiple load ratios, H2 pressures and loading frequencies. These are obtained without any calibration with hydrogen-assisted fatigue data, taking as input only mechanical and hydrogen transport material properties, the material's fatigue characteristics (from a single test in air), and the sensitivity of fracture toughness to hydrogen content. Furthermore, the model is used to determine: (i) what are suitable test loading frequencies to obtain conservative data, and (ii) the underestimation made when not pre-charging samples. The model can handle both laboratory specimens and large-scale engineering components, enabling the Virtual Testing paradigm in infrastructure exposed to hydrogen environments and cyclic loading.</description>

      <title>High Discrimination Ratio, Broadband Circularly Polarized Light Photodetector Using Dielectric Achiral Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The on-chip measurement of polarization states plays an increasingly crucial role in modern sensing and imaging applications. While high-performance monolithic linearly polarized photodetectors have been extensively studied, integrated circularly polarized light (CPL) photodetectors are still hindered by inadequate discrimination capability. In this study, we employ achiral all-dielectric nanostructures to develop a broadband CPL photodetector with an impressive discrimination ratio of ~107 at the wavelength of 405 nm, significantly surpassing its counterparts by two orders of magnitude. Our device shows outstanding CPL discrimination capability across the visible band without requiring intensity calibration. Its function mechanism is based on the CPL-dependent near-field modes within achiral structures: under left or right CPL illumination, distinct near-field modes are excited, resulting in asymmetric irradiation of the two electrodes and generating a photovoltage with directions determined by the chirality of the incident light field. The proposed design strategy facilitates the realization of ultra-compact CPL detection across diverse materials, structures, and spectral ranges, presenting a novel avenue for achieving high-performance monolithic CPL detection.</description>

      <title>Lattice matched heterogeneous nucleation eliminate defective buried interface in halide perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskite-based semi-conducting hetero-structures have emerged as promising electronics for solar cells, light-emitting diodes, detectors, and photo-catalysts. Perovskites' efficiency, electronic properties and their long-term stability directly depend on their morphology [1-24]. Therefore, to manufacture stable and higher efficiency perovskite solar cells and electronics, it is now crucial to understand their micro-structure evolution. In this study, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the formation of cesium lead bromide perovskite on interfaces. Our simulations reveal that perovskite crystallizes in a heteroepitaxial manner on widely employed oxide interfaces. This could introduce the formation of dislocations, voids and defects in the buried interface, and grain boundaries in the bulk crystal. From simulations, we find that lattice-matched interfaces could enable epitaxial ordered growth of perovskites and may prevent defect formation in the buried interface.</description>

      <title>Towards realistic magneto-optical matter: Modeling dynamics of magneto-optical dimers with arbitrary collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical matter, a rapidly growing field, aims to develop novel methods for controlling and assembling mesoscale systems through fascinating light-matter interactions. Its traditional approaches often involve complex illumination fields with costly and unstable setups. These methods require strong gradient forces, high-intensity laser spots that could harm samples, and substrate support. This work introduces an alternative approach using magneto-optical particles and straightforward illumination to effectively create magneto-optical matter. Our numerical framework, grounded in Langevin dynamics and realistic collision phenomena, serves as a robust and universal tool for exploring various optomechanical designs. To illustrate the capabilities of the developed method, we examine the impact of thermal noise, collision types, geometric variations, and resonance excitation on a dimer system, generating multiple scenarios for favorable dimer formation and subsequent manipulation. It is found that anisotropic dimers tuned initially at magneto-optical resonance can bind in stable average positions even when particle-particle collisions are present. We believe our method and subsequent findings provide essential knowledge for studying optical binding and the dynamics of any small-scale cluster of electromagnetically interacting components.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging of asymmetric interfaces and electrostatic potentials inside a hafnia-zirconia ferroelectric nanocapacitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In hafnia-based thin-film ferroelectric devices, chemical phenomena during growth and processing such as oxygen vacancy formation and interfacial reactions appear to strongly affect device performance. However, the nanoscale structure, chemistry, and electrical potentials in these devices are not fully known, making it difficult to understand their influence on device properties. Here, we directly image the composition and electrostatic potential with nanometer resolution in the cross section of a nanocrystalline W / Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_{2-\delta}$ (HZO) / W ferroelectric capacitor using multimodal electron microscopy. This reveals a 1.4 nm wide tungsten sub-oxide interfacial layer formed at the bottom interface during fabrication which introduces a potential dip and leads to asymmetric switching fields. Additionally, the measured inner potential in HZO is consistent with the presence of about 20% oxygen vacancies and a negative built-in potential in HZO. These chemical and electrostatic details are important to characterize and tune to achieve high performance ferroelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Thermal contribution to current-driven antiferromagnetic-order switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In information technology devices, current-driven state switching is crucial in various disciplines including spintronics, where the contribution of heating to the switching mechanism plays an inevitable role. Recently, current-driven antiferromagnetic order switching has attracted considerable attention due to its implications for next-generation spintronic devices. Although the switching mechanisms can be explained by spin dynamics induced by spin torques, some reports have claimed that demagnetization above the Neel temperature due to Joule heating is critical for switching. Here we present a systematic method and an analytical model to quantify the thermal contribution due to Joule heating in micro-electronic devices, focusing on current-driven octupole switching in the non-collinear antiferromagnet, Mn3Sn. The results consistently show that the critical temperature for switching remains relatively constant above the Neel temperature, while the threshold current density depends on the choice of substrate and the base temperature. In addition, we provide an analytical model to calculate the Joule-heating temperature which quantitatively explains our experimental results. From numerical calculations, we illustrate the reconfiguration of magnetic orders during cooling from a demagnetized state of polycrystalline Mn3Sn. This work not only provides deeper insights into magnetization switching in antiferromagnets, but also a general guideline for evaluating the Joule-heating temperature excursions in micro-electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Can we improve the energy efficiency of EUV lithography?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses a simple, low-cost, highly efficient two-mirror projector with a simplified illumination system. The EUV source power can be reduced by 1/10 compared to the current six-mirror EUV projector system. The required EUV power is 20 watts for process speed of 100 wafers per hour. The proposed in-line projector achieves 0.2 NA (20 mm field) and 0.3 NA (10 mm field), which can be assembled in a cylindrical tube configuration similar to a DUV projector, providing superior mechanical stability and easier assembly/maintenance. The EUV light is introduced in front of the mask through two narrow cylindrical mirrors located on both side of the diffraction cone, providing average normal illumination and reducing the mask 3D effect. The simplified illumination system provides symmetric quadrupole off-axis illumination, bypassing central obscuration and improving spatial resolution, also realizing K\"ohler illumination. The theoretical resolution limit is 24 nm (20 mm field), image reduction factor x5 and object image distance (OID) 2000 mm. With the curved surface mask, the tool height can be reduced to (OID) 1500 mm, which provides resolution 16 nm (10 mm field). It will be suitable for small die size chip production for mobile applications as well as the latest chiplet technology.</description>

      <title>A Flat Dual-Polarized Millimeter-Wave Luneburg Lens Antenna Using Transformation Optics with Reduced Anisotropy and Impedance Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a compact wideband dual-polarized Luneburg lens antenna (LLA) with reduced anisotropy and improved impedance matching is proposed in Ka band with a wide 2D beamscanning capability. Based on transformation optics, the spherical Luneburg lens is compressed into a cylindrical one, while the merits of high gain, broad band, wide scanning, and free polarization are preserved. A trigonometric function is employed to the material property of the flattened Luneburg lens with reduced anisotropy, thus effectively alleviates the strong reflection, the high sidelobes and back radiation with a free cost on the antenna weight and volume. Furthermore, a light thin wideband 7-by-1 metasurface phased array is studied as the primary feed for the LLA. The proposed metantenna, shorted for metamaterial-based antenna, has a high potential for B5G, future wireless communication and radar sensing as an onboard system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern neuroscience has evolved into a frontier field that draws on numerous disciplines, resulting in the flourishing of novel conceptual frames primarily inspired by physics and complex systems science. Contributing in this direction, we recently introduced a mathematical framework to describe the spatiotemporal interactions of systems of neurons using lattice field theory, the reference paradigm for theoretical particle physics. In this note, we provide a concise summary of the basics of the theory, aiming to be intuitive to the interdisciplinary neuroscience community. We contextualize our methods, illustrating how to readily connect the parameters of our formulation to experimental variables using well-known renormalization procedures. This synopsis yields the key concepts needed to describe neural networks using lattice physics. Such classes of methods are attention-worthy in an era of blistering improvements in numerical computations, as they can facilitate relating the observation of neural activity to generative models underpinned by physical principles.</description>

      <title>Auger photoemission as a laser-like coherent cathode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In pursuit of quantum advancements across disciplines, a bright and coherent electron source is expected to be a cornerstone of diverse applications including electron microscopy, laser accelerators, and free electron lasers. Current cathodes, such as cold field and photoemission, can generate high-quality electron beams with different cathode materials, geometric configurations, and laser excitation profiles, but their maintenance of both quantum coherence and high beam brightness suffers from the space-charge repulsion of many electrons. Here, we propose a new mechanism to provide collective emission of coherent electrons based on Auger photoemission. Our approach leverages a photon-induced four-level Auger process that necessitates a combination of photoemission and Auger recombination. The Auger electrons, energized through a recycling process of photoelectrons, emit collectively into the vacuum as secondary electrons. We compare coherent and incoherent Auger photoemission, identifying that the working condition of the coherent photoemission requires population inversion, akin to the four-level laser system. Our work provides insights for experimental realization and nanofabrication of Auger photocathodes, addressing a critical need in advancing quantum technologies relating to correlated coherent sources.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent optimization of acoustic holograms for transcranial focused ultrasound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic holographic lenses, also known as acoustic holograms, can change the phase of a transmitted wavefront in order to shape and construct complex ultrasound pressure fields, often for focusing the acoustic energy on a target region. These lenses have been proposed for transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) to create diffraction-limited focal zones that target specific brain regions while compensating for skull aberration. Holograms for tFUS are currently designed using time-reversal approaches in full-wave time-domain numerical simulations. However, such simulations need time-consuming computations, which severely limits the adoption of iterative optimization strategies. Furthermore, in the time-reversal method, the number and distribution of virtual sources can significantly influence the final sound field. Because of the computational constraints, predicting these effects and determining the optimal arrangement is challenging. This study introduces an efficient method for designing acoustic holograms using a volumetric holographic technique to generate focused fields inside the skull. The proposed method combines a modified mixed-domain method for ultrasonic propagation with a gradient descent iterative optimization algorithm. This approach enables substantially faster holographic computation than previously reported techniques. The iterative process uses explicitly defined loss functions to bias the ultrasound field's optimization parameters to specific desired characteristics, such as axial resolution, transversal resolution, coverage, and focal region uniformity, while eliminating the uncertainty associated with virtual sources in time-reversal techniques. Numerical studies are conducted on four brain structures: the anterior insula, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and amygdala. The findings are further validated in underwater experiments with a 3D-printed skull phantom.</description>

      <title>Modeling the performance and bandwidth of single-atom adiabatic quantum memories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum memories are essential for quantum repeaters that will form the backbone of the future quantum internet. Such memory can capture a signal state for a controllable amount of time after which this state can be retrieved. In this work, we theoretically investigated how atomic material and engineering parameters affect the performance and bandwidth of a quantum memory. We have applied a theoretical model for quantum memory operation based on the Lindblad master equation and adiabatic quantum state manipulation. The materials properties and their uncertainty are evaluated to determine the performance of Raman-type quantum memories by showcasing two defects in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We have derived a scheme to calculate the signal bandwidth based on the material parameters as well as the maximum efficiency that can be realized. The bandwidth depends on four factors: the signal photon frequency, the dipole transition moments in the electronic structure, cavity volume, and the strength of the external control electric field. As our scheme is general and independent of materials, it can be applied to many other quantum materials with a suitable three-level structure. We therefore provided a promising route for designing and selecting materials for quantum memories. Our work is therefore an important step toward the realization of a large-scale quantum network.</description>

      <title>Microstructural investigation of hybrid CAD/CAM restorative dental materials by micro-CT and SEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objectives: An increasing number of CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing) hybrid materials have been introduced to the dental market in recent years. In addition, CAD/CAM hybrid materials for additive manufacturing (AM) are becoming more attractive in digital dentistry. Studies on material microstructures using micro-computed tomography ($\mu$-CT) combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have only been available to a limited extent so far.
  Methods: One CAD/CAM three-dimensional- (3D-) printable hybrid material (VarseoSmile Crown plus) and two CAD/CAM millable hybrid materials (Vita Enamic; Voco Grandio), as well as one direct composite material (Ceram.x duo), were included in the present study. Cylindrical samples with a diameter of 2 mm were produced from each material and investigated by means of synchrotron radiation $\mu$-CT at a voxel size of 0.65 $\mu$m. Different samples from the same materials, obtained by cutting and polishing, were investigated by SEM.
  Results: The 3D-printed hybrid material showed some agglomerations and a more irregular distribution of fillers, as well as a visible layered macrostructure and a few spherical pores due to the printing process. The CAD/CAM millable hybrid materials revealed a more homogenous distribution of ceramic particles. The direct composite material showed multiple air bubbles and microstructural irregularities based on manual processing.
  Significance: The $\mu$-CT and SEM analysis of the materials revealed different microstructures even though they belong to the same class of materials. It could be shown that $\mu$-CT and SEM imaging are valuable tools to understand microstructure and related mechanical properties of materials.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional imaging of buried heterointerfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report three-dimensional (3D) structure determination of a twisted hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterointerface from a single-view data set using multislice ptychography. We identify the buried heterointerface between two twisted h-BN flakes with a lateral resolution of 0.57 {\AA} and a depth resolution of 2.5 nm. The latter is a significant improvement (~2.7 times) over the aperture-limited depth resolution of incoherent imaging modes such as annular-dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. This is attributed to the diffraction signal extending beyond the aperture edge with the depth resolution set by the curvature of the Ewald sphere. Future advances to this approach could improve the depth resolution to the sub-nanometer level and enable the identification of individual dopants, defects and color centers in twisted heterointerfaces and other materials.</description>

      <title>Control of the damage threshold of Si via a SiO2 coating upon irradiation with Mid-IR femtosecond laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key issue in the use of high-power mid-infrared (Mid-IR) laser sources for a plethora of applications is the investigation of the exciting laser driven physical phenomena taking place in materials coated with dielectric films. Here, we present a theoretical investigation of the ultrafast processes and thermal response upon excitation of two-layered complexes consisting of fused silica thin films placed on silicon substrates with ultrashort pulsed lasers in the Mid-IR spectral regime. Through the development of a theoretical model, we demonstrate that the control of the underlying ultrafast phenomena and the damage threshold (DT) of the substrate are achieved via an appropriate modulation of the thickness of the SiO2 film. It is shown that a decrease of DT by up to 27% compared to the absence of coating is feasible emphasising the impact of coatings of a lower refractive index than the substrate. Besides this, it is demonstrated that no absorption of energy occurs within the SiO2 layer, therefore the dynamics of the reflectivity of the two-layered complex is directly associated with the electron excitation in the substrate. These remarkable predictions can be employed for the development of new optical coatings and components for nonlinear optics and photonics for a large range of Mid-IR laser-based applications.</description>
