      <title>Do Low-Mass, Low-Luminosity AGNs Deviate from the Quasar Main Sequence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectroscopic and variability-based characterisation of a sample of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) hosting low mass black holes, identified by $H\beta$ full width at half maximum (FWHM) $&lt; 2200$ km s$^{-1}$. While the narrow line widths are consistent with the formal definition of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies, the broader accretion and emission properties reveal key distinctions. The sample exhibits sub-Eddington accretion rates (median $\log R_{Edd} \approx -0.68$) and comparatively weak FeII emission (median $R_{FeII} \approx 0.61$), in contrast to the strong FeII strengths and high Eddington ratios characteristic of classical NLSy1s. Optical variability amplitudes, derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves, are similar to those typically seen in Seyfert 1 galaxies, with a median $\log(\sigma) \approx -0.68$, suggesting the AGN component's significant contribution to variability. In the optical plane of the 4D Eigenvector 1 (4DE1) parameter space, these sources occupy a distinct locus in the low-$R_{FeII}$, low-$R_{Edd}$ regime, suggesting a physically distinct accretion state. Our findings indicate that this population may represent a low-accretion analogue within the broader narrow-line AGN family, offering new insights into black hole growth at low mass scales.</description>

      <title>The quenched fraction of satellites around simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare satellite quenched fractions across three cosmological simulation suites (FIREbox, the FIRE-2 zoom-ins, and IllustrisTNG50) and observational datasets from SAGA, ELVES, and the combined satellite population of the Milky Way and M31. To enable consistent comparisons, we select Milky Way-mass hosts with $M_{\rm halo} = 10^{11.9}$ - $10^{12.2} \, M_{\odot}$ and satellites with stellar masses of $10^{7}$ - $10^{10}\, M_{\odot}$, applying uniform projected apertures and a common quenching definition. All three simulations reproduce the strong observed trend that lower-mass satellites are more likely to be quenched, closely matching the stellar-mass dependence seen in SAGA, ELVES, and the MW+M31 system. This agreement indicates that the mass dependence of satellite quenching is a robust outcome of contemporary galaxy formation models. Radial trends, however, show meaningful differences. SAGA and ELVES exhibit gently declining quenched fractions with projected distance, reflecting strong environmental quenching at small radii. TNG50 most closely matches this behavior, FIREbox, remains consistent with with a nearly flat trend within uncertainties, and the FIRE-2 zoom-ins show suppressed inner quenched fractions driven almost entirely by their paired MW-M31 hosts, which lack high-mass satellites and show strong radial segregation between star-forming and quenched systems. This environmental imprint suggests that host environment and assembly history can influence satellite quenching outcomes and may contribute to diversity across simulations. Overall, while the simulations consistently recover the stellar-mass dependence of quenching their radial trends vary, highlighting the influence of host-halo conditions and motivating deeper exploration of how host environments shape satellite quenching.</description>

      <title>Lyman-$\alpha$ Visibility During the Epoch of Reionization: Combining JWST FRESCO Grism Data with Keck Archival Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The visibility of Lyman-$\alpha$ emission at $z&gt;7$ provides crucial insights into the reionization process and the role of galaxies in shaping the ionized intergalactic medium. Using JWST FRESCO data, we investigate the environments of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) in the GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields by identifying [OIII] emitters and analyzing their large-scale distribution. Using the FRESCO redshifts, we recover eight new LAEs from archival Keck/MOSFIRE observations at $z=7.0-7.7$, including a potential AGN candidate at $z \sim 7.2$. Complemented by six literature LAEs, our sample consists of 14 LAEs in total, all of which are [OIII] emitters except for one very faint source not detected by FRESCO. We define seven groups of [OIII] emitters centered around the brightest LAEs and find that these bright LAEs do not reside in more overdense environments than the average galaxy population. The overdensity parameters for LAEs and [OIII] emitters without Lyman-$\alpha$, calculated for sources with $\mathrm{M_{UV}&lt;-19.5}$ to ensure completeness, are similar, indicating that overdensities alone cannot fully explain Lyman-$\alpha$ visibility. While LAEs have slightly higher recent star formation (SFR$_{10}$/SFR$_{50} \approx 1.3\times$) and [OIII] EW ($\approx1.5\times$), they show no significant differences from [OIII] emitters in UV slope ($\beta$), UV magnitude ($\mathrm{M_{UV}}$), or stellar mass ($\log_{\mathrm{M}_{\star}}$). Our results suggest that other factors may contribute to the observability of Lyman-$\alpha$ emission. Future spectroscopic surveys with broader wavelength coverage and more complete sampling will be crucial for refining our understanding of reionization.</description>

      <title>A Galactic Transformation -- Understanding the SMC's Structural and Kinematic Disequilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SMC is in disequilibrium. Gas line-of-sight (LoS) velocity maps show a gradient of $60-100$ km s$^{-1}$, generally interpreted as a rotating gas disk consistent with the Tully-Fisher relation. Yet, the stars don't show rotation. Despite a small on-sky extent ($\sim4$ kpc), the SMC exhibits a large ($\sim10$ kpc) LoS depth, and the stellar photometric center is offset from the HI kinematic center by $\sim$1 kpc. With N-body hydrodynamical simulations, we show that a recent ($\sim$100 Myr ago) SMC-LMC collision (impact parameter $\sim2$ kpc) explains the observed SMC's internal structure and kinematics. The simulated SMC is initialized with rotating stellar and gaseous disks. Post-collision, the SMC's tidal tail accounts for the large LoS depth. The SMC's stellar kinematics become dispersion dominated ($v/\sigma\approx0.2$), with radially outward motions at $R&gt;2$ kpc, and a small ($&lt;10$ km s$^{-1}$) remnant rotation at $R&lt;2$ kpc, consistent with observations. Post-collision gas kinematics are also dominated by radially outward motions, without remnant rotation. Hence, the observed SMC's gas LoS velocity gradient is due to radial motions as opposed to disk rotation. Ram pressure from the LMC's gas disk during the collision imparts $\approx30$ km s$^{-1}$ kick to the SMC's gas, sufficient to destroy gas rotation and offset the SMC's stellar and gas centers. Our work highlights the critical role of group processing through galaxy collisions in driving dIrr to dE/dSph transformation, including the removal of gas. Consequently, frameworks that treat the SMC as a galaxy in transformation are required to effectively use its observational data to constrain interstellar medium and dark matter physics.</description>

      <title>Globular clusters in \textsc{OrbIT}: complete dynamical characterisation of the globular cluster population of the Milky Way through updated orbital reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hierarchical structure formation, the content of a galaxy is determined both by its in-situ processes and by material added via accretions. Globular clusters in particular represent a window for the study of the different merger events that a galaxy underwent. Establishing the correct classification of in-situ and accreted tracers, and distinguishing the various different progenitors that contributed to the accreted population are important tools to deepen our understanding of galactic formation and evolution. Our aim is to refine our knowledge of the assembly history of the Milky Way by studying the dynamics of its globular cluster population and establishing an updated classification among in-situ objects and the different merger events identified. We used a custom built orbit integrator to derive precise orbital parameters, integrals of motions and adiabatic invariants for the globular cluster sample studied. By properly accounting for the rotating bar, which transforms the underlying model in a time-varying potential, we proceeded to a complete dynamical characterisation of the globular clusters. We present a new catalogue of clear associations between globular clusters and structures (both in-situ and accreted) in the Milky Way, and a full table of derived parameters. By using all dynamical information available, we were able to attribute previously unassociated or misclassified globular clusters to the different progenitors, including those responsible for the Aleph, Antaeus, Cetus, Elqui, and Typhon merger events. By using a custom built orbit integrator and properly accounting for the time-varying nature of the Milky Way potential, we have shown the depth of information that can be extracted from a purely dynamical analysis of the globular clusters of our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>SHORES II: Multi-frequency Characterisation of the Sub-mJy Radio Population in FIR-selected Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new deep multi-frequency radio survey of two extragalactic fields observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) as part of the SHORES project (Serendipitous H-ATLAS fields Observations of Radio Extragalactic Sources). The observations, centred at 2.1, 5.5, and 9 GHz, cover the central 0.5 deg$^2$ of two Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) fields down to rms sensitivities of 9-17 $\mu$Jy$/$beam at 2.1 GHz, 28-39 $\mu$Jy/beam at 5.5 GHz and 38-61 $\mu$Jy/beam at 9 GHz. This setup allows us to investigate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of faint radio sources and probe the nature of the sub-mJy population. We extract and validate a robust catalogue of 489 sources at 2.1 GHz, 101 of which are also detected at 5.5 GHz. We perform a multi-frequency analysis of the radio number counts and derive the spectral indices of sources in the deep fields. The spectral index distribution of our sources peaks around $\alpha \sim -0.7$, consistent with synchrotron emission from the faint radio population. The number counts at 2.1 GHz are consistent with previous deep surveys and theoretical models, and provide a lower limit on the star-forming galaxy population, which is expected to dominate the faint end. The 5.5 GHz data offer new, direct constraints on the sub-mJy radio sky at higher frequencies. By cross-matching with the H-ATLAS catalogue, we identify a sample of sources with far-infrared (FIR) counterparts and explore the far-infrared-radio correlation (FIRRC). The sources with $q_{FIR} \geq 1.69$ exhibit radio spectral indices typical of star-forming galaxies. Furthermore, we identify a population of radio-only sources with similar indices that may correspond to high-redshift SFGs, lacking counterparts in the FIR survey due to its limited resolution and sensitivity.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Intracluster Light based on the High-resolution Simulation, NewCluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracluster light (ICL) is a key component of galaxy clusters, with the potential to trace their dynamical assembly histories and the underlying dark matter distribution. Despite these prospects, its faint nature makes a consensus on its origin or population properties difficult to achieve, both in observations and simulations. In the hope of finding a breakthrough, we utilize the ongoing high-resolution cluster simulation, NewCluster. By classifying billions of particles in and around the cluster with a rigorous tracking procedure, we find that the majority of the ICL originates from satellites, including surviving and disrupted galaxies. Another notable finding is that the preprocessed component follows the density profile of dark matter better than the other components and has distinctive properties: old age, low metallicity, and enhanced $\alpha$-element abundance. We further investigate the orbital dynamics, and our results demonstrate that the stripped fraction of satellites is primarily determined by the time since infall and the pericenter distance. By linking the demographic, chemical, and orbital properties of ICL stars to their origins, this work proposes a quantitative approach for tracing the assembly history of galaxy clusters from the ICL.</description>

      <title>From the Intergalactic to the Interstellar Scales -- EQUALS: a High-resolution Legacy Survey of Gas in the Distant Universe Using ESPRESSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the Universe evolved from diffuse primordial gas into the rich cosmic web we observe today is one of the great challenges of modern astrophysics. Quasar absorption lines - the imprints left by intervening gas on the light from distant quasars - provide key diagnostics of many aspects of this investigation, ranging from fundamental physics to cosmology and galaxy formation. The unprecedented combination of extremely precise wavelength calibration, high spectral resolution and high sensitivity of the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) has finally enabled observations that will further constrain both state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution and theoretical stellar nucleosynthetic yields. In this article, we present the ESPRESSO Quasar Absorption Line Survey (EQUALS), an ESO Large Programme, designed to tackle several outstanding questions from constraining the properties of dark matter at the smallest scales probed by the Lyman-alpha forest to determining the temperature of the intergalactic medium at z ~ 4 and precisely quantifying the chemical contributions of stellar populations in the early Universe. EQUALS will provide a legacy sample of deep spectra to showcase ESPRESSO capabilities to the quasar absorption line community whilst providing epoch measurements for the key science goals of upcoming spectroscopic instrumentation on the next generations of telescopes.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way Project: Bridging Intermediate- and High-Mass Star Formation with the MIRION Catalog of Yellowballs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the construction and use of the Mid-InfraRed Interstellar Objects and Nebulae (MIRION) catalog, which was compiled from 6176 objects identified as "yellowballs" (YBs) by participants in the Milky Way Project. The majority of YBs are compact photodissociation regions generated by intermediate- and high-mass young stellar objects that are embedded in star-forming clumps ranging in mass from ten to one million solar masses and luminosity from ten to ten thousand solar luminosities. The MIRION catalog increases the number of candidate intermediate-mass star-forming regions (SFRs) by nearly two orders of magnitude, providing an extensive database with which to explore the transition from isolated low-mass to clustered high-mass star formation. The catalog comprises five tables that include mid- and far-infrared photometry; velocities of source-associated molecular clouds; distances to these molecular clouds; physical properties of source-associated star-forming clumps; and source crossmatches with other catalogs. The structure of the catalog enables users to easily sort objects for further study based on distance or environmental properties. Our preliminary analysis extends our earlier findings that indicate a relationship between IR colors and the physical properties and evolutionary stages of SFRs. Photometry will be periodically updated online to incorporate measurements from volunteers participating in a classroom activity known as the People Enabling Research: a Yellowball Survey of the Colors Of Protostellar Environments (PERYSCOPE) Project. These updates will continue to refine the IR flux measurements and reduce photometric errors. A follow-up paper will present a detailed analysis of how IR colors can be used to predict the properties of star-forming environments.</description>

      <title>Effects of helium sedimentation on late star formation in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how helium sedimentation in galaxy clusters can affect the history of star formation in the central cluster galaxy. As helium sediments, the gas density in the inner regions of the cluster increases and there is also a non-trivial, radially dependent redistribution of the atomic nuclei and electrons. As a result, the cooling rate in the center increases and this can enhance star formation. On the other hand, there is a slow contraction of the intracluster gas, which may induce gravitational heating and therefore has an opposite effect on star formation. In this work we present these effects and aim to estimate their relevance. For this we have performed a 1-dimensional numerical simulation of helium sedimentation and applied it to a simple semi-analytical model of star formation. We find that for clusters with a halo mass $M_{\rm halo} \lesssim 10^{14} M_{\rm sun}$, helium sedimentation effects on the star formation rate are negligible, even under idealized conditions. In the intermediate range, $10^{14} M_{\rm sun} \lesssim M_{\rm halo} \lesssim 10^{15} M_{\rm sun}$, the effects are at most mild, below a factor ~ 2 in the isothermal model we consider, even for idealized conditions. For clusters with a halo mass $M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{15} M_{\rm sun}$, helium sedimentation effects can potentially be very important and renew star formation activity in the central galaxy.</description>

      <title>A pan-galaxy study of synthetic giant molecular filaments: a turbulence-dominated life cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent surveys of the Galactic plane have revealed dozens of giant molecular filaments (GMFs), with lengths ranging from tens to hundreds of parsecs, yet their origins and life cycles remain debated. In this work, we analyze over 700 GMFs identified from synthetic CO emission maps of a high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, whose lengths range from $\sim 10$ pc to $\sim 300$ pc. We find that turbulent shock from galactic shear and stellar feedback are the primary drivers of GMF formation. Magnetized turbulence dominates their internal dynamics, supporting the filaments against global collapse while simultaneously inducing fragmentation into dense clumps. This fragmentation follows the turbulence-driven sausage instability model, rather than pure Jeans instability, and triggers efficient star formation along the filaments. Cloud-cloud collisions are frequent, affecting more than $70\%$ of GMFs, and often disrupt or reshape their morphology. The typical filamentary lifetime is $t_{\text{fil}} \sim 14$ Myr, comparable to the crossing time of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). The molecular gas half-life is $\sim 7$ Myr, similar to that of GMCs, indicating that GMFs are transient but dynamically important structures.</description>

      <title>CLASSY XIV: The Nitrogen Exception -- Multi-Phase Enrichment and Feedback in High-$z$ Analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-of-its-kind analysis of the metal content across two interstellar medium (ISM) phases in a sample of 31 local star-forming galaxies from the COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY), selected as analogues of high-$z$ systems. Using co-spatial UV absorption and optical emission-line spectroscopy, we compare abundances of N, O, S, and Fe in the low-ionization (neutral) and high-ionization (ionized) gas, providing a multi-phase view of enrichment shortly after the current starburst and over longer timescales when ejecta from previous episodes have cooled and mixed. We find that O and S, produced predominantly in short-lived massive stars, are well mixed between the two phases, with scatter reflecting local inhomogeneities. Fe, predominantly produced by Type Ia supernovae on $\sim$1 Gyr timescales, is higher in the neutral gas, reflecting either delayed mixing of older Fe-enriched material or preferential depletion of Fe from the ionized phase through dust formation in core-collapse supernova ejecta. N exhibits the largest phase offset, with N/H$_{ion}$ systematically $\sim$0.7 dex higher than N/H$_{neu}$, and the magnitude of this offset correlates with stellar mass, metallicity, star-formation rate, and most strongly with the ISM outflow velocity. N/O ratios in the ionized phase rise rapidly within 3-6 Myr relative to the neutral gas, consistent with N enrichment dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars rather than intermediate-mass AGB stars on longer timescales. These results demonstrate that localized stellar feedback, outflows, and phase-dependent mixing collectively regulate the chemical evolution of star-forming galaxies, providing key insight into the extreme N/O abundances recently observed in galaxies at cosmic dawn.</description>

      <title>Unified models revisited I: modelling the effect of source geometry on radio galaxy/quasar unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orientation-based unification model proposes that radio-loud quasars and radio galaxies are the same objects observed at different angles. A key prediction of this model is that the quasars are seen at smaller angles to the line of sight and so should be more affected by projection, and hence apparently physically smaller, than corresponding radio galaxies, but this has not always been found in earlier studies. We argue that the interpretation of observations requires a less simplistic model for the effects of projection, which takes into account radio sources' finite width and their intrinsic axial ratio distribution. Using this cylindrical configuration as a basis for the simulation of radio galaxies and quasars, we simulate the distribution of the linear size ratio of quasars to radio galaxies for different sample sizes and critical angles. Our simulations that predict the ratio of observed lengths in the presence of a distribution of intrinsic physical sizes and axial ratios that we derive from observation. We conclude that to test the unified scheme, samples should be completely optically identified, sizes should be measurable for all targets, and the sample size should be greater than $\sim 800$ sources. Such large samples with uniform optical identification and accurate size measurements have not been available in previous work, but should become available from wide-area sky surveys in the near future.</description>

      <title>The impact of surface acetylene cyclotrimerization on the abundance of aromatic hydrocarbons in carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the catalytic role of dust grains in forming aromatic hydrocarbons via acetylene cyclotrimerization on their surfaces within the circumstellar envelopes of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We present a comprehensive computational astrochemical model coupling the gas-phase, gas-surface, and surface (cyclotrimerization) reactions, and the physical evolution of the dust grains (coagulation). The model expands upon the basic chemical network from previous models, enhancing them with updated reactions involving hydrocarbons up to pyrene. We applied this model to simulate the chemical evolution of the envelope of the prototypical AGB star IRC+10216, utilizing physical conditions derived from a hydrodynamical model available in literature. To quantify the impact of surface chemistry, we compared scenarios with and without the cyclotrimerization reaction, further testing the sensitivity of our results by varying the key parameter of hydrocarbon desorption energy. We find that surface-catalyzed cyclotrimerization is a viable pathway for aromatic formation in circumstellar environments, capable of enhancing the total abundance of aromatic species by up to an order of magnitude. Crucially, we show that gas-phase chemistry and dust surface processes are intrinsically linked; their synergistic evolution should be modeled self-consistently to accurately predict chemical abundances. This work underscores that constraining uncertain parameters, particularly desorption energies of hydrocarbons, is essential for future realistic modeling of astrochemical processes in evolved stellar systems.</description>

      <title>A New Torus Generator for AGAMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code is presented that computes and exploits orbital tori for any axisymmetric gravitational potential. The code is a development of the AGAMA software package for action-based galaxy modelling and can be downloaded as the AGAMAb code library. Although coded in C++, most of its functions can be accessed from Python. We add to the package functions that facilitate confronting models with data, which involve sky coordinates, lines of sight, distances, extinction, etc. The new torus generator can produce tori for both highly eccentric and nearly circular orbits that lie beyond the range of the earlier torus-mapping code. Tori can be created by interpolation between tori at very low cost. Tori are fundamentally devices for computing ordinary phase-space coordinates from angle-action coordinates, but AGAMAb includes an action finder that returns angle-action coordinates from any given phase-space location. This action finder yields the torus through the given point, so it includes the functionality of an orbit integrator. The action finder is more accurate and reliable but computationally more costly than the widely used Staeckel Fudge. We show how AGAMAb can be used to generate sophisticated but cheap models of tidal streams and use it to analyse data for the GD1 stream. With the most recently published distances to the stream, energy and angular momentum imply that the end that must be leading is trailing, but extremely small changes to the distances rectify the problem.</description>

      <title>Actions of highly eccentric orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge presented by computing actions for eccentric orbits in axisymmetric potentials is discussed. In the limit of vanishing angular momentum about the potential's symmetry axis, there is a clean distinction between box and loop orbits. We show that this distinction persists into the regime of non-zero angular momentum. In the case of a Staeckel potential, there is a critical value I_{3crit}(E) of the third integral I_3 below which I_3 does not contribute to the centrifugal barrier. An orbit is of box or loop type according as its value of I_3 is smaller or greater than I_{3crit}. We give algorithms for determining I_{3crit}(E) and the critical action Jzcrit below which orbits in any given potential are boxes. It is hard to compute the actions and especially the frequencies of orbits that have Jz ~ Jzcrit using the Staeckel Fudge. A modification of the Fudge that alleviates the problem is described.</description>

      <title>Rotational Spectra and Search for Aromatic Imines: 9-Iminofluorene and Benzophenone imine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar detections of several cyano derivatives of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have now been achieved, enabled by accurate laboratory measurements of their microwave rotational spectra. These results highlight the continued promise of other N-containing unsaturated PAHs, such as aromatic imines, as candidates for future laboratory studies and astronomical searches. In this work, we present broadband spectroscopic measurements of 9-iminofluorene and benzophenone imine in the 6-18\,GHz band. These measurements yield accurate rotational, centrifugal distortion, and $^{14}$N quadrupole coupling constants for both molecules. Using these experimentally-derived constants, we attempted a search for both molecules in the cold molecular cloud TMC-1 using observations from the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Neither of these two ketimines was detected above the current noise level, establishing upper limits for their column densities of $5.1\times10^{12}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$ for 9-iminofluorene and $1.3\times10^{13}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$ for benzophenone imine. We also attempted a search for phenylmethanimine (both E/Z isomers) as the simplest aromatic aldimine, but neither was detected in TMC-1. To provide insight into these non-detections, we propose and evaluate different formation pathways using respective potential energy surfaces as determined by high-precision quantum chemical calculations. The result suggests the presence of an entrance barrier to forming the intermediate species, potentially explaining the low abundance.</description>

      <title>A XRISM/Resolve view of the dynamics in the hot gaseous atmosphere of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The XRISM/Resolve microcalorimeter directly measured the gas velocities in the core of the Virgo Cluster, the closest example of AGN feedback in a cluster. This proximity allows us to resolve the kinematic impact of feedback on scales down to 5 kpc. Our spectral analysis reveals a high velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v$=262 (+45 / -38) km/s near the AGN, which steeply declines to ~60 km/s between 5 and 25 kpc in the northwest direction. The observed line-of-sight bulk velocity in all regions is broadly consistent with the central galaxy, M87, with a mild trend toward blueshifted motions at larger radii. Systematic uncertainties have been carefully assessed and do not affect the measurements. The central velocities, if attributed entirely to isotropic turbulence, correspond to a transonic ICM at sub-6 kpc scales with three-dimensional Mach number 0.69 (+0.14 / -0.11) and a non-thermal pressure fraction of 21 (+7 / -5)%. Simple models of weak shocks and sound waves and calculations assuming isotropic turbulence both support the hypothesis that the velocity field reflects a mix of shock-driven expansion and turbulence. Compared to other clusters observed by XRISM to date, M87's central region stands out as the most kinematically disturbed, exhibiting both the highest velocity dispersion and the largest 3D Mach number, concentrated at the smallest physical scales.</description>

      <title>The influence of external environment at cosmic noon on the subsequent evolution of galaxy stellar mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connecting high-redshift galaxies to their low-redshift descendants is one of the most important and challenging tasks of galaxy evolution studies. In this work, we investigate whether incorporating high-redshift environmental factors improves the accuracy of matching high-redshift galaxies to their $z\sim0$ descendants, using data from the EAGLE and MAGNETICUM simulations. Using random forest regression, we evaluate the relative importance of a set of environmental metrics at $z\sim3$ in determining the stellar mass of descendant galaxies at $z\sim0$. We identify the spherical overdensity within 1 cMpc ($\delta_{1,\mathrm{sp}}$) as the most important environmental predictor. Tracking galaxies at $z\sim3$ with similar initial stellar masses but different $\delta_{1,\mathrm{sp}}$ values, we find that, across all mass bins in both simulations, high-density environments produce $z\sim0$ descendants with median stellar masses up to eight times higher than the descendants of galaxies in low-density environments. For galaxies with $M_{*}\lesssim10^{10}M_{\odot}$, the difference is attributable to more merger-induced mass growth in high-density environments, whereas for higher-mass galaxies, it results from a combination of enhanced in-situ star formation and greater external mass accretion. By assessing the importance of overdensity across multiple scales and redshifts, we find that at $z\gtrsim2$, environmental factors become as important as stellar mass in predicting the stellar mass of $z\sim0$ descendants. Compared to using stellar mass at $z\sim3$ alone, incorporating $\delta_{1,\mathrm{sp}}$ reduces the scatter in the residuals between the predicted and actual stellar masses by approximately 20% in EAGLE and 35% in MAGNETICUM.</description>

      <title>The GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy) Sample: III. Further host-galaxy identification, and redshift assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present 127 new host-galaxy identifications for G4Jy sources (S_151MHz &gt; 4 Jy), based on radio images from MeerKAT, the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS), and the Rapid ASKAP (Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder) Continuum Survey (RACS). This includes identifications that result from visual inspection of radio contours on K_s-band images, as opposed to the AllWISE-W1 images that were used for the original set of overlays when defining the G4Jy Sample (Papers I and II). Our aim is to achieve 100 per cent spectroscopic completeness for the sample, where all of the spectroscopy is available in digital form online. For now, we have gathered (i) digital optical spectroscopy for 34 per cent of the sample, (ii) photometric redshifts for an additional 21 per cent of the sample, and (iii) further redshifts found through the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (but not recently verified). Our assessment of the redshifts includes visual inspection of all of the digital spectroscopy, and re-fitting redshift templates where necessary. The resulting redshift range is (currently) 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 3.6. We also present 151-MHz luminosities and linear sizes for the G4Jy Sample, based on initial analysis.</description>

      <title>JWST reveals extended stellar disks for ALMA-bright dusty star-forming galaxies in the Spiderweb protocluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRCam imaging of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) detected by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Spiderweb protocluster at $z=2.16$. We identify 22 DSFGs detected by both ALMA and JWST, 10 of which are spectroscopically confirmed as protocluster members. This is the first systematic analysis of a statistical DSFG sample in $z\sim2$ protocluster environments using JWST/NIRCam data. Most of the DSFG members exhibit very red colors and reside in the dusty star-forming region of the rest-frame UVJ diagram, indicating strong dust obscuration. The Gini-M20 diagram suggests that most DSFGs in this protocluster are late-type disks, with a significant fraction displaying clumpy and disturbed rest-frame UV/optical morphologies, but few showing clear merger signatures. The DSFG members exhibit relatively large stellar disks and effective radii with a median stellar mass of log(M/Msun) = 10.8 +/- 0.3, placing them above coeval field DSFGs and typical protocluster galaxies in the size-mass relation at both rest-frame optical and near-infrared wavelengths. These sizes are comparable to those of more evolved field DSFGs at z~1-2, indicating accelerated structural growth in dense environments. Moreover, these DSFG members show a decreasing trend in stellar size from shorter to longer wavelengths, with a moderately steep slope comparable to coeval field DSFGs. These results may support an inside-out growth scenario for protocluster evolution, in which massive galaxies near the center are more evolved and more strongly affected by AGN feedback and environmental effects, e.g., ram-pressure stripping. We propose that the cold gas accretion at the protocluster outskirts drives intense star formation and stellar disk growth in ALMA-detected DSFGs, which are expected to evolve into massive elliptical galaxies at later stages.</description>

      <title>Statistics of the projected angles between the black-hole spin and the host-galaxy rotation axes from NewHorizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the alignment between AGN jets and their host galaxies is crucial for interpreting AGN unification models, jet feedback processes, and the co-evolution of galaxies and their central black holes (BH). In this study, we use the high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation NewHorizon, which self-consistently evolves BH mass and spin, to statistically examine the relationship between AGN jet orientation and host galaxy structure. Building upon our previous work, we extend the analysis of projected (2-d) alignment angles to facilitate more direct comparisons with recent observational studies. In our methodology, galaxy orientations are estimated using optical position angles derived from synthetic DESI-LS and Euclid images, while BH spin vectors serve as proxies for AGN jet directions. From a carefully selected sample of 100 BH-galaxy systems at low redshift, we generate a catalog of 5,000 mock optical images using a Monte Carlo approach that samples random viewing angles and redshifts. Our results reveal a statistically significant tendency for AGN jets to align with the orientation of their host galaxies, consistent with recent observations combining Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and optical imaging of nearby AGNs. Furthermore, we find a slightly stronger alignment when using kinematic position angles derived from synthetic MaNGA-like stellar velocity fields. These findings underscore the importance of combining morphological, kinematic, and polarimetric information to disentangle the complex interplay between black hole spin evolution, accretion mode, and the galactic environment in shaping the direction of relativistic jets.</description>

      <title>FEASTS Compared with Simulations: Abnormally Irregular and Extended HI Morphologies at a Column Density of $10^{18}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$ in TNG50 and Auriga</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With new atomic-hydrogen (HI) observations of FAST Extended Atlas of Selected Targets Survey (FEASTS), we present the first statistical comparison of HI morphology between observations and cosmological simulations, focusing on low-column density ($10^{18}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$) regions of Milky Way-like central galaxies. We select a 330-galaxy sample from IllustrisTNG50 (TNG50) matched to 33 FEASTS galaxies by stellar and HI masses, and mock observe them to the FAST resolution and depth at corresponding inclinations and distances for a fair comparison. In contrast to FEASTS, abnormally irregular and extended morphology is found in more than one-third of TNG50 galaxies, especially those massive and HI poor. Stellar feedback is the property that most significantly correlates with the HI morphological deviation from observations, although these deviations mostly occur at a high stellar or black-hole mass. These results indicate that in TNG50, stellar feedback significantly influences the HI morphology at $10^{18}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$, while active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback has not so direct a role as expected. With an additional sample from Auriga, we find that the magnetic field may help HI to be more regular in its morphology, while improving the mass resolution does not alleviate the discrepancy from observation. This study reveals the potential of constraining future simulations of galaxies by observing low-column density HI.</description>

      <title>Generating LSB-optimised synthetic images for simulated galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an emission-biasing scheme in the SKIRT radiative transfer code that enables efficient generation of synthetic galaxy images optimized for low-surface-brightness (LSB) science. Standard Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations achieve high signal-to-noise in bright regions but require prohibitively many photon packets to reach reliable depth in galaxy outskirts. By assigning stellar particles bias factors that scale with their smoothing lengths, our method boosts photon emission from low-density regions while conserving energy through weight corrections. Tests on a Milky-Way-like galaxy from the TNG50 cosmological simulation show that bias factors proportional to the smoothing length substantially extend the reliable LSB regime, providing an inexpensive improvement for deep synthetic imaging of simulated galaxies.</description>

      <title>Relationship between Poincar\'e Sections and Spectral Characteristics of Orbits of Globular Clusters in the Central Region of the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, orbital dynamics, regular or chaotic, of globular clusters (GCs) in the central region of the Galaxy, which is subject to the greatest influence of the rotating bar, has been studied. Such methods for determining chaos as Poincar\'e sections and spectral methods have been compared. The relationship between the Poincar\'e sections and the spectral characteristics of the orbits has been estimated. The sample includes 45 globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc. To form the 6D-phase space required for integrating the orbits, the most accurate astrometric data to date from the Gaia satellite, as well as new refined average distances, have been used. The following, most realistic, bar parameters have been adopted: mass $10^{10} M_\odot$, length of the major semi-axis of the bar model in the form of a triaxial ellipsoid is 5 kpc, angle of rotation of the bar axis is $25^o$, rotation velocity is 40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc $^{-1}$. The result of the study is that a 100\% correlation between the classification by Poincar\'e sections and the spectral characteristics of the orbits has been established. Consequently, the classification by Poincar\'e sections can be replaced by a more visual analysis of the amplitude spectra of the orbits. Thus, two lists of GCs: with regular and chaotic dynamics have been compiled. The GCs with varying degrees of orbital chaos have separately been distinguish.</description>

      <title>Chemical complexity in star formation induced by stellar feedback: cores shock-formed by the supernova remnant W44</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-velocity shocks from Supernova Remnants (SNRs) may set the physical and chemical conditions of star formation in molecular clouds. Recent evidence suggests that the Sun might have formed through this process. However, the chemical conditions of shock-induced star forming region remain poorly constrained. We study the chemical complexity of a shock-impacted clump, with potential to yield star formation, named the Clump, and located at the interface between the SNR W44 and the infrared dark cloud G034.77-00.55. We test whether the Clump has chemical properties consistent with those observed in star forming regions unaffected by SNRs. We use high-sensitivity, broad spectral surveys at 3 and 7 mm obtained with the 30m antenna at IIRAM and the 40 m YEBES antenna, to identify D-bearing species and complex organic molecules (COMs) toward the Clump. For all species, we estimate molecular abundances and compare them with those observed across star forming regions at different evolutionary stages and masses, as well as comets. We detect multiple deuterated molecules (DCO+, DNC, DCN, CH2DOH) and COMs (CH3OH, CH3CHO, CH3CCH, CH3CN, CH3SH) with excitation temperatures of 5-13 K. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detection of COMs toward a site of SNR-cloud interaction. The derived D/H ratios (0.01-0.04) and COM abundances are consistent with those reported toward typical low-mass starless cores and comparable to cometary values. The overall level of chemical complexity is relatively low, in line with an early evolutionary stage. We suggest that the Clump is a early stage shock-induced low-mass star forming region, not yet protostellar. We speculate that SNR shocks may set the physical and chemical conditions to form stars. The resulting chemical budget may be preserved along the formation process of a planetary system, being finally incorporated into planetesimals and cometesimals.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Medium in Extremely High Star-Formation Regions: A Prospect of Observations on the Millimetron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High star-formation rate and active galactic nucleus' emission can significantly transform the interstellar medium. In ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, in which the star-formation rate reaches thousands of solar masses per year, the gas and dust are considerably affected by the ionizing radiation, cosmic rays and shock waves, that can be about a factor of 100--1000 larger than typical values in quiet star-forming galaxies. In these conditions, the emissivity of the gas and dust changes: in dense gas, high ionic and molecular transitions become excited, while dust grains are heated to high temperatures. In this paper, we analyze the possibilities for studying the interstellar medium in extreme conditions of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies at redshifts of $\sim 0-3$, utilizing the atomic and molecular lines, and dust continuum in far infrared range of $100-500\mu$m. We discuss the prospect of observations using the instruments of the Millimetron Space Observatory.</description>

      <title>Diverse stages of star formation in the IRAS 18162-2048 region. Emergence of UV Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods: We obtained adaptive optics-assisted integral field spectroscopy in the near-infrared (IR) $K$ band ($1.93-2.47 \mathrm{\mu m}$) with VLT/SINFONI, complemented by VLA X and C bands (3$-$6 cm) and ALMA band 3 ($\sim$3.3 mm) observations. Results: The near-IR continuum reveals two infrared sources, IRS 2 and IRS 7, while the main protostellar core IRAS 18162-2048 remains undetected up to $2.47 \mathrm{\mu m}$. IRS 7 shows a peculiar Hydrogen Recombination Line Br$\gamma$ profile with a narrow emission component superimposed on a broad absorption feature, consistent with a B2/B3 zero-age main-sequence star. Extended H$_2$ emission exhibits a `sawtooth' pattern in the excitation diagram, characteristic of UV radiation in a PDR rather than shock excitation. The radiative transfer model Cloudy reproduces the H$_2$ ro-vibrational populations for $T_\mathrm{gas}=600$ K and $n_\mathrm{H}=7.9\times10^3 \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. VLA X and C bands observations reveal a compact radio source previously reported as a stationary condensation (SC) and coincident with IRS 7. For the first time, we detect IRS 7/SC in mm wavelengths. The spectral index in the 3$-$6 cm and 3.3 mm regime is consistent with optically thin free-free emission. Conclusions: Our near-IR and radio observations reveal that IRS 7/SC is a B2/B3 ZAMS star that has begun to photoionise its environment, giving rise to an extended PDR and a compact \ion{H}{ii} region. The coexistence of this source with the deeply embedded protostar IRAS 18162-2048 and other bubble-like structures in the field, suggests a multigenerational star-forming environment. Future \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} observations targeting the H$_2$ pure rotational lines ($3-28 \mathrm{\mu m}$) and other HRLs less affected by extinction will be essential to characterise the cooler molecular and ionised gas to fully disclose the formation history of the region.</description>

      <title>The shape-velocity alignment of satellites forged by tidal locking and dynamical friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the TNG50 simulation, we study two types of alignments for satellites/subhalos: 1) the alignment of their major axes with the galactocentric radial directions (radial alignment), and 2) with the motion directions (orbital alignment). We find that radial alignment is substantially stronger than orbital alignment, with both signals being consistently stronger for subhalos than for satellites. Interestingly, inward- and outward-moving satellites/subhalos show contrasting orbital alignment behaviors, which can be understood in terms of their radial alignment, orbit decay due to dynamical friction and the effect of tidal stripping. The orbital alignment is stronger in more massive halos. In the end, we explore the orbital alignment measured by a mock observer, and find that the alignment reported by Pace et al. (2022) for MW satellites is due to projection effects, as the major axes of satellites lie within their orbital planes, approximately coplanar with the observer.</description>

      <title>The heartbeat of stellar halos: Insights from the stellar halo mass-metallicity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the presence and evolution of the MZhR from redshift z=3.5 to z=0, and identifies when galaxies settle on the present-day MZhR. We used central galaxies with log10(Mgal/Msun)=[9,11] from CIELO simulations. We identified stellar halos, from z=3.5 to z=0, using the AM-E method, focusing on the region between the 1.5 optical radius and the virial radius. We presented halo cardiograms, a novel approach to studying the assembly history of stellar halos. Using them, we defined a stability time (tst) as the first time that the median halo metallicity does not change more than \pm 0.1 dex with respect to its value at z=0. CIELO stellar halos reproduce the present-day observed MZhR. At z=3.5, stellar halos already define an MZhR whose slope is similar to the slope at z=0. For a fixed stellar halo mass, the metallicity increases ~0.21 dex from z=3.5 to z=0, reflecting the progressive chemical enrichment provided by the accretion of satellites with diverse masses and different levels of enrichment. When the first stellar halo main contributor (SHMC1) provides a mass fraction at least 20% higher than the remaining contributors, the stellar halo metallicity is set once SHMC1 is fully disrupted (tmerger). This yields a clear correlation between tst and tmerger, with a scatter of 2.2 Gyr driven by the relative importance of the second and third main contributing satellites. We provide two observational tracers for tst: t90 and a stability time from the age-metallicity relation. Our results suggest that estimating tst could serve as a proxy for dating the moment at which the stellar halo reaches the present-day MZhR, as well as for dating the last major merger that builds them. Combined with an estimation of the merger time of the main contributing satellite, it can provide insights into the relative importance of the second and third contributing satellites.

      <title>Hot, Photoionized X-ray Gas in Two Luminous Type 2 Quasars: Chandra-HST Evidence for a Wind-Driven Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new Chandra/ACIS-S imaging spectroscopy of two luminous type 2 quasars, FIRST J120041.4+314745 (z=0.116) and 2MASX J13003807+5454367 (z=0.088), and compare their X-ray emission with Hubble Space Telescope [O III]$\lambda$5007 morphologies and kinematics. Both systems show kiloparsec-scale soft X-ray emission. In FIRST J120041, the X-ray morphology is clumpy and closely follows the [O III] structures, with surface-brightness peaks co-spatial with the highest [O III] velocities (600-750 km s$^{-1}$) and broadest line widths (FWHM~1700 km s$^{-1}$). In 2MASX J130038, the X-rays are more centrally concentrated and only weakly correlated with the largely rotational [O III] kinematics. Spectral modeling indicates that photoionization dominates the soft X-rays in both quasars. The inferred hot-gas reservoirs are substantial, M$_{\rm x-ray}$ ~ 4.5x10$^{8}$M$_{\odot}$ (FIRST J120041) and M$_{\rm x-ray}$ ~ 1.8x10$^{8}$M$_{\odot}$ (2MASX J130038), exceeding the outflowing [O III] masses (volume-normalized) by factors of ~4 and ~16, respectively. In 2MASX J130038, we also identify a tentative blueshifted Fe XXVI Ly$\alpha$ line at E$_{\rm rest}$ = 7.14 $\pm$ 0.06 keV (v~7600 km s$^{-1}$), consistent with a nascent hot wind confined to the inner few hundred parsecs. Combining these results with a broader sample of twelve type 2 quasars, we argue that luminous quasars evolve along a continuous feedback sequence regulated by the progressive clearing of circumnuclear gas. As AGN radiation and winds pierce through the surrounding medium, systems transition from heavily enshrouded, compact configurations to phases where the X-ray and [O III] components strongly couple and, eventually, to large-scale, energetically dominant outflows. FIRST J120041 and 2MASX J130038 represent two points along this sequence, tracing the emergence and growth of hot winds as primary drivers of quasar-scale feedback.</description>

      <title>SN 2024afav: A Superluminous Supernova with Multiple Light Curve Bumps and Spectroscopic Signatures of Circumstellar Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive optical and near-infrared spectroscopic study of SN 2024afav - a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) that peaks at $\approx$ -20.7 mag and exhibits an unusual multi-bumped light curve. Our spectroscopic observations, spanning phases of -14 to +160 d, reveal several unusual features: (i) a narrow (1,800 km s$^{-1}$) and blueshifted (11,000 km s$^{-1}$) absorption from H$\alpha$ starting at +20 d; (ii) persistent optical and NIR He I lines at all available phases, showing double absorption structure in NIR spectra at +23 d, with a high velocity component at a similar velocity to H$\alpha$; (iii) early appearance of nebular [O III] emission starting at $\approx$ +50 d; and (iv) strong [O II] + [Ca II] 7300 {\AA} emission complex starting at $\approx$ +110 d. These unusual features, and their onset at the time of the light curve bumps, provide compelling evidence of circumstellar interaction between the SN ejecta and a nearby hydrogen-rich shell, as well as the presence of helium in both the outer layers of the progenitor star and in the circumstellar medium. A comparison of SN 2024afav to other SLSNe-I showing bumpy light curves and similar spectral properties (PTF10hgi, SN 2017egm, SN 2019hge), points to a rare sub-group of SLSNe-I in which CSM interaction provides an important modulation to the energy input.</description>

      <title>A Song of Lines and Winds: Tracing the Signatures of AGN Outflows in X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) are highly ionized, mildly relativistic winds seen in the X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and are thought to contribute to AGN feedback and galaxy evolution. We investigate UFO signatures by analyzing a broad collection of published detections. Our final sample comprises 122 robust (&gt; 2$\sigma$) UFO detections in 57 AGN, spanning wide ranges in redshift, luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio. By combining phenomenological and photoionization modeling of the absorption features, we characterize empirical correlations among UFO properties. We find that line width, equivalent width, and outflow velocity are positively correlated, indicating that the broadest and strongest absorption lines trace the fastest winds, although the $\upsilon_\mathrm{out} - \sigma$ trend is comparatively weak. The large inferred velocity dispersions, often exceeding the uncertainty on the centroid velocity, must be included when estimating wind energetics and scaling relations. From the velocity constraints we derive lower limits on the launching radii, finding a minimum distance consistent with the innermost stable circular orbit of a weakly or non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole. We also assess for the first time how UFO properties depend on AGN class: differences between Seyferts and quasars, bridged by narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, appear to be driven mainly by black hole mass and luminosity. The observed co-variation of velocity, width, and equivalent width supports a picture of clumpy, multi-component winds propagating through a thermally unstable multiphase medium within the chaotic cold accretion (CCA) cycle, and is consistent with both magnetically and line-driven acceleration. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with missions such as XRISM and NewAthena will be crucial to resolve the structure, kinematics, and physical origin of these flows.</description>

      <title>Black hole merger rates for LISA and LGWA from semi-analytical modelling of light seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the upcoming space- and Moon-based gravitational-wave detectors, LISA and LGWA respectively, a new era of GW astronomy will begin with the possibility of detections of the mergers of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We generate populations of synthetic black hole (BH) binaries with masses ranging from the intermediate ($10^3-10^5 M_\odot$) to the supermassive regime ($&gt;10^5 M_\odot$), formed from the dynamical processes of merging halos and their residing galaxies, assuming that each galaxy is initially seeded with a single black hole at its centre. The aim is to estimate the rate of these BH mergers which could be detected by LISA and LGWA. Using PINOCCHIO cosmological simulation and a semi-analytical model based on GAEA, we construct a population of merging BHs by implementing a "light" seeding scheme and calculating the merging timescales using the Chandrasekhar prescription. We provide upper and lower limits of dynamical friction timescale by varying the mass of the infalling object to create "pessimistic" and "optimistic" merger rates respectively. We find that for our synthetic population of MBHs, both LGWA and LISA are able to detect more than $15$ binary IMBH mergers per year in the optimistic case, while in the pessimistic case less than $\sim5$ detections would be possible considering the entire lifetime of the detectors. For SMBHs, the rates are slightly lower in both cases. Most mergers below $z\approx4$ are detected in the optimistic case, although mergers beyond $z=8$ are also detectable at a lower rate. We find that LGWA is better suited for high-SNR IMBH detections at higher redshift, while LISA is more sensitive to massive SMBHs. Joint observations will probe the full BH mass spectrum and constrain BH formation and seeding models.</description>

      <title>Fast X-ray Variability from the Coronae of Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first systematic study of short-timescale X-ray variability in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGN), utilizing archival Chandra observations of approximately 3,000 broad-line AGN selected from the SDSS and DESI spectroscopic surveys. We identify 14 AGN exhibiting rapid (on timescales of tens of kiloseconds) X-ray flux variations by factors of two or more that are statistically significant ($p\le6\times10^{-4}$), indicative of fast coronal variability. By converting minimum variability timescales to light-crossing times, we place upper limits on the sizes of the variable coronal regions, finding typical scales of $\lesssim10^{-4}$~pc. The coronal variable region size upper limits of an AGN in our sample are found to be much smaller than the typical coronal sizes inferred from microlensing, suggesting that its corona is composed of localized, transient structures rather than smooth, homogeneous plasmas. Such efficient magnetic energy dissipation in compact volumes is consistent with expectations for magnetically dominated coronae and is supported by recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Future high-throughput X-ray observatories will enable the detection of even faster coronal variability, providing direct constraints on the physical mechanisms driving plasma energization and flux fluctuation near supermassive black holes. Our results suggest that luminous AGN hosting massive black holes are prime targets for probing the small-scale structure and dynamics of AGN coronae.</description>

      <title>Precise determination of circumstellar disk lifetimes: Disk evolution in a single star-forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining how long circumstellar disks last is key to understanding the timescale of planet formation. Typically, this is done by measuring the fraction of young stars with infrared-excess, a sign of circumstellar material, in stellar clusters of different ages. However, comparing data from different star-forming regions at different distances introduces uncertainties and biases because of the different sample completeness and environment. This study addresses these challenges by analyzing 33 clusters, aged 3 to 21 million years (PARSEC isochrones), within the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, sampling the stellar IMF from the hydrogen burning limit to about 8 M$_\odot$. By using $\mathit{Gaia}$, 2MASS, and WISE data, we identified stars with infrared-excess through color-color diagrams and spectral energy distributions, ensuring a consistent selection of disk-bearing sources. Our results indicate a disk lifetime of $5.8 \pm 0.3$ Myr, about a factor of two longer than most previous estimates, suggesting that planet formation may have more time than previously thought. We also find that an exponential decay model best describes disk dispersal. These findings emphasize the importance of studying disk evolution in a single star-forming region to reduce uncertainties and refine our understanding of planet formation timelines.</description>

      <title>SS433 PeV neutron jet feeding the far TeV gamma beam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SS433 is a well-known binary system with an internal black hole, which is stripping mass from an orbiting companion of ten solar masses, at a hundred of light-seconds away. The black hole and its accretion disk fuel a thin precessing jet, whose spirals are well-observed. Surprisingly, disconnected gamma-ray tails have recently been discovered by H.E.S.S., HAWC and LHAASO, hundreds of light-years away and with energies of tens of TeV. We suggest that tens PeV neutron burst jets were ejected from the SS433 system over the past century. These beams of ultra high-energy PeVatron neutrons, by their in-flight beta decay and Inverse Compton scattering, could be the source of the enigmatic, distant and disconnected tens of TeV gamma-ray beams. These ultra-relativistic PeV neutron jets could have been formed during one of the system's rare and intense tidal eruptions, when tens of PeV protons collide CV October 2025 with thermal ultraviolet photons, creating delta resonances. Their decay into secondary neutron beams of tens of PeV is well consistent with observations. Alternative models appear uncompetitive.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Planetary Formation and Evolution in Star Clusters(UPiC)-II: Catalog of planets/candidates in Open Clusters and Moving Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting planets in open clusters offers a unique opportunity to test planet formation theories in clustered environments. The precisely determined ages of young open clusters make their planets particularly valuable for tracing the early evolution of planetary systems. As the second paper of the UPiC project, this study focuses on stars in stellar groups that host transiting planets or planetary candidates. We categorize these stellar groups into Open Clusters (OCs) and Moving Groups (MGs) based on the Jacobi radius to investigate potential differences in their planetary systems. By cross-matching the latest star cluster catalogs with catalogs of transiting planets and candidates, we have compiled the most extensive catalog to date, containing 106 confirmed planets and 168 candidates within OCs and MGs. We refitted the structural parameters of these stellar groups and identified substructures using the \texttt{HDBSCAN} and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithms. Our analysis reveals the density evolution of both MGs and OCs during their first Gyr. We find that MGs consistently exhibit a significantly higher planet fraction than OCs, regardless of sample selection, particularly for Hot Jupiters. Furthermore, exoplanet radii show a clear dichotomy at early stages: most sub-Jupiters evolve into Neptune-sized planets within 100 Myr, while super-Jupiters undergo only minimal contraction. These results suggest that young sub-Jupiters (\textless 100 Myr) represent puffy, Neptune-mass planets undergoing vigorous photoevaporation, whereas Jupiter-mass planets can maintain their atmospheres. We also report evidence for the early emergence of the hot-Neptune desert at 100 Myr in both OCs and MGs.</description>

      <title>Shock trapping and inertial escape: Dust-particle clustering in compressible turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and clustering of dust particles with inertia in shock-dominated compressible turbulence using the two-dimensional, stochastically forced Burgers equation. At small Stokes numbers, shock trapping leads to extreme density inhomogeneities and nearly singular aggregation, with correlation dimensions approaching zero. With increasing inertia, particles undergo inertial escape and intermittently cross shock fronts, producing a sharp crossover from shock-dominated trapping to quasi-ballistic dynamics. This crossover is accompanied by a pronounced reduction in density fluctuations, a continuous increase of the correlation dimension from zero to the embedding dimension, and a power-law dependence of density fluctuations on the Stokes number over an extended intermediate regime. In this regime, particle distributions show scale-free coarse-grained density statistics arising from repeated trap--escape dynamics. This behaviour is qualitatively distinct from inertial-particle clustering in incompressible turbulence and is directly relevant to dust concentration in shock-rich regions of protoplanetary discs and other compressible astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Escaping Cosmic Rays and Interstellar Medium: Driving of Galactic Winds and Shaping the Local Proton Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of escaping cosmic rays (CRs) on the interstellar medium (ISM) around their source with spherically symmetric CR-hydrodynamical simulations taking into account the evolution of the CR energy spectrum, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction. We show how the escaping CRs accelerate and heat the ISM fluid depending on the CR diffusion coefficient. The CR heating effects are potentially responsible for the recent observations of the unexpected H$\alpha$ and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 lines in old supernova remnants. The implied gas outflow by CRs can be comparable to the Galactic star formation rate, compatible with the Galactic wind required for the metal-polluted halo gas and the production of eROSITA bubbles. Assuming a locally suppressed CR diffusion and a few nearby CR sources in the Local Bubble, we also propose alternative interpretations for the Galactic CR proton spectrum around the Earth measured with CALET, AMS02, and Voyager I.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx Pre-Perihelion Mapping of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, and $\mathrm{CO}$ in Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From 01- to 15-Aug-2025 UT, the SPHEREx spacecraft observed interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Using $R = 40$-$130$ spectrophotometry at $\lambda = 0.7$-$5\mu$m, light curves, spectra, and imaging of 3I were obtained. From these, robust detections of water gas emission at $2.7$-$2.8\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ and CO$_2$ gas at $4.23$-$4.27\,\mu$m plus tentative detections of $^{13}$CO$_2$ and CO gas were found. A slightly extended H$_2$O coma was detected, and a huge CO$_2$ atmosphere extending out to at least $4.2\times10^{5}\,$km was discovered. Gas production rates for H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, and CO were $Q_{\mathrm{gas}} = 3.2\times10^{26} \pm 20\%$, $1.6\times10^{27} \pm 10\%$, $1.3\times10^{25} \pm 25\%$, and $1.0\times10^{26} \pm 25\%$, respectively. Co-addition of all $\lambda = 1.0$-$1.5\,\mu$m scattered light continuum images produced a high SNR image consistent with an unresolved source. The scattered light lightcurve showed $\lesssim 15\%$ variability over the observation period. The absolute brightness of 3I at $1.0$-$1.5\,\mu$m is consistent with a $&lt; 2.5\,$km radius nucleus surrounded by a 100 times brighter coma. The $1.5$-$4.0\,\mu$m continuum structure shows a strong feature commensurate with water ice absorption seen in KBOs and distant comets. The observed cometary behavior of 3I, including its preponderance of CO$_2$ emission, lack of CO output, small size, and predominance of large icy chunks of material in a flux-dominant coma is reminiscent of the behavior of short period comet 103P/Hartley 2, target of the NASA Deep Impact extended mission in 2010 and a ``hyperactive comet'' near the end of its outgassing lifetime. This correspondence places 3I closer to barely- or non-active 1I/Oumuamua than primitive, ice rich 2I/Borisov, suggesting that ISOs are often highly thermally processed before ejection into the ISM.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Evolutionary Status of Massive Stars at the central parsec of the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars and their winds have a large influence in their environment, e.g, determining the accretion rate on to the Galactic Centre (GC) super-massive black hole Sgr A*. The winds of those stars collide and are accreted, at a rate that depends on their chemical composition. Here we aim to revisit the evolutionary status of the evolved massive stars at the GC, by means of new tracks based on updated mass-loss rate recipes for the earlier stages of massive stars.
  We use the Geneva-evolution-code for initial stellar masses ranging from 20 to 60 $M_\odot$, for metallicity $Z=0.020$. We adopt a new mass-loss rate recipe for the line-driven winds of O-type stars and B-supergiants, plus a new recipe for the dust-driven winds of red supergiants (RSG). Additionally, we set up initial rotation $\Omega/\Omega_\text{crit}=0.4$, and we adopt the Ledoux criterion for the treatment of convection in inner layers.
  We found that evolution models adopting new mass-loss rate prescriptions predict that stars will lose less of their outer layers during their initial phases, while a big reduction of mass happens at the RSG phase. As a consequence, the resulting Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are less radially homogeneous in their inner structure from the core to the surface. Also, these new evolution models predict the absence of hydrogen-free WN stars. These evolutionary predictions agree better with the observed chemical abundances of the WR stars at the GC.
  We provide a table with the chemical H, He, and CNO abundances calculated for the different subtypes of WR stars. We propose a different re-arrangement of the WR subtypes to be used for the modelling of the collision of their winds. We discuss the potential implications of these changes for the colliding winds generated from the massive stars at the GC, which are accreting onto the supermassive black hole Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>DESI Strong Lens Foundry V: A Sample of HST-Observed Strong Lenses Modeled with GIGA-Lens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present six galaxy-scale strong lenses with HST imaging modeled using GIGA-Lens. This is Paper V of the DESI Strong Lens Foundry series. These systems were discovered in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using ML/AI methods and confirmed with DESI, Keck/NIRES, and VLT/MUSE spectroscopy. They span $z_d = 0.39 - 1.1$ and $z_s = 1.4 - 3.3$. This is the first HST strong lens sample modeled with full forward modeling -- all lens and source parameters sampled simultaneously in a single inference -- with explicit convergence validation using both $\widehat{R}$ and effective sample size (ESS) for each system. All inferred parameters satisfy $\widehat{R} &lt; 1.1$ and ${\rm ESS} \gtrsim 10,000$, demonstrating that GIGA-Lens achieves statistically robust inference even for some of the most complex galaxy-scale lenses known. These results pave the way for scaling to much larger, high-resolution strong lens samples from HST, Euclid, JWST, and Roman. Convergence-validated modeling will be critical for key science goals, including constraining the mass-density profile of galaxies, detecting low-mass dark matter (sub)halos, and delivering precise and accurate cosmological constraints.</description>

Abstract: Secure methods for identifying the host galaxies of individual massive black hole (MBH) binaries and mergers detected by gravitational wave experiments such as LISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays are currently lacking, but will be critical to a variety of science goals. Recently in Bardati et al. (2024, Paper I), we used the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to show that MBH merger host galaxies have unique morphologies in imaging, due to their stronger bulges. Here, we use the same sample of simulated MBH merger host galaxies to investigate their stellar kinematics, as probed by optical integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. We perform stellar population synthesis and dust radiative transfer to generate synthetic 3D optical spectral datacubes of each simulated galaxy, and produce mock stellar kinematic maps. Based on a linear discriminant analysis of a combination of kinematic parameters derived from these maps, we show that this approach can identify MBH binary and merger host galaxies with accuracies that increase with chirp mass and mass ratio. For mergers with high chirp masses (&gt;10^8.2 Msun) and high mass ratios (&gt;0.5), the accuracies reach &gt;85%, and their host galaxies are uniquely characterized by slower rotation and stronger stellar kinematic misalignments. These kinematic properties are commonly associated with massive early-type galaxies that have experienced major mergers, and naturally act as signposts for MBH binaries and mergers with high chirp masses and mass ratios. These results suggest that IFU spectroscopy should also play a role in telescope follow-up of future MBH binaries and mergers detected in gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: Galactic disks lie at the heart of many of the most pressing astrophysical puzzles. There are sophisticated kinetic theories that describe some aspects of galaxy disk dynamics, but extracting quantitative predictions from those theories has proven very difficult, meaning they have shed little light on observations/simulations of galaxies. Here, we begin to address this issue by developing a tractable theory describing fluctuations and transport in thin galactic disks. Our main conceptual advance is to split potential fluctuations into asymptotic wavelength regimes relative to orbital guiding radius and epicyclic amplitude (similar to plasma gyrokinetics), and then to treat separately the dynamics in each regime. As an illustration, we apply our results to quasilinear theory, calculating the angular-momentum transport due to a transient spiral. At each stage we verify our formulae with numerical examples. Our approach should simplify many important calculations in galactic disk dynamics. In a follow-up paper, we apply these ideas to the theory of linear spiral structure in stellar disks.</description>

These AGNs are identified by their broad H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ emission lines through the NIRCam grism wide-field slitless spectroscopy. One object at $z = 7.646$ with broad H$\beta$ emission has an F444W magnitude of 23.6 mag, making it one of the brightest $z &gt; 7.5$ broad-line AGNs yet known. Among the 13 AGNs, 10 objects have reddened optical continua with slopes $\beta_{\rm opt}&gt;0$. The remaining three objects have their overall SEDs that resemble those of UV-luminous quasars at similar redshifts, but their $\beta_{\rm opt}$, though negative, are not as blue as those of unobscured quasars. We also obtain MIRI photometry at 7.7-18 $\mu$m for two AGNs and place strong constraints on their rest-frame near-IR SED. We find no significant variability in the rest-frame UV by comparing the COSMOS-3D and COSMOS-Web F115W images taken apart by 60 days in the rest-frame. We compute the H$\alpha$ luminosity functions (LFs) for the broad H$\alpha$ emitters at $z \approx 5-6$ and find a potential redshift evolution when compared with that of the $z \approx 4-5$ sample. We also derive the H$\beta$ LF at $z\sim8$ for AGNs and galaxies by combining our sample with those from the literature. The broad H$\beta$ emitters in this work suggest a number density two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by the quasar LF based on rest-frame UV-selected samples. As a preview, our work showcases the ability of the COSMOS-3D grism survey to provide a complete view of the properties, growth, and evolution of bright broad-line AGNs at $z&gt;5$.</description>

      <title>The Tantalizing Case of the Quasar J0950+5128 -- I. Presentation of the Data and Detailed Exploration of the Binary Supermassive Black Hole Scenario</title>

Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of the quasar J0950$+$5128 spanning 22 years reveal monotonic radial velocity variations in its broad H$\beta$ emission line. Moreover, the line profile becomes broader over time, necessitating careful measurements. We present robust H$\beta$ velocity shift measurements obtained via cross correlation, applied to both the full spectra and to isolated broad H$\beta$ components derived from spectral decomposition. We also examine the light curves for variability consistent with the spectroscopic trends. Using Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis we find no significant periodic signal. We consider several interpretations for the observed changes, including a binary supermassive black hole, dust-cloud obscuration, outflows, a recoiling black hole, and a single perturbed, disk-like broad-line region. We disfavor all but the binary and perturbed broad-line region scenarios. The binary interpretation is the only one for which we can immediately compare a physical model to the available data. Thus, we incorporate radial velocity ''jitter'' to emulate typical quasar variability and fit the radial velocity curve with a Keplerian model to examine whether it can reproduce the observations. In this context, the available observations trace only a segment of the putative orbit. The fit yields a period of 33 years (observed frame) and an eccentricity of 0.65, with lower limits on the semi-major axis and black hole mass of $10^{-2}\;$pc and $10^7\;{\rm M}_\odot$, respectively. Thus, J0950$+$5128 is a compelling supermassive binary candidate. The single, perturbed broad-line region interpretation remains viable but requires additional observations and modeling for further evaluation. Continued monitoring is, therefore, essential.</description>

      <title>Black Hole - Neutron Star and Binary Neutron Star Mergers from Population III and II stars</title>

Abstract: Population III (Pop.$~$III) stars are expected to be massive and to undergo minimal mass loss due to their lack of metals, making them ideal progenitors of black holes and neutron stars. Here, we investigate the formation and properties of binary neutron star (BNS) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers originating from Pop.$~$III stars, and compare them to their metal-enriched Population II (Pop.$~$II) counterparts, focusing on their merger rate densities (MRDs), primary masses and delay times. We find that, despite the high merger efficiency of Pop.$~$III BNSs and BHNSs, their low star formation rate results in a MRD at least one order of magnitude lower than that of Pop.$~$II stars. The MRD of Pop.$~$III BNSs peaks at redshift $z\sim15$, attaining a value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BNS}(z\sim15) \sim 15\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$, while the MRD of Pop.$~$III BHNSs is maximum at $z\sim13$, reaching a value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BHNS}(z\sim13) \sim 2\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$. Finally, we observe that the black hole masses of Pop.$~$III BHNS mergers have a nearly flat distribution with a peak at $\sim 20\,\rm M_{\odot}$ and extending up to $\sim 50\,\rm M_{\odot}$. Black holes in Pop.$~$II BHNS mergers show instead a peak at $\lesssim 15\,\rm M_{\odot}$. We consider these predictions in light of recent gravitational-wave observations in the local Universe, finding that a Pop.$~$III origin is preferred relative to Pop.$~$II for some events.</description>

      <title>On the origins of oxygen: ALMA and JWST characterise the multi-phase, metal-enriched, star-bursting medium within a 'normal' $z &gt; 11$ galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22888</link>

Abstract: The unexpectedly high abundance of galaxies at $z &gt; 11$ revealed by JWST has sparked a debate on the nature of early galaxies and the physical mechanisms regulating their formation. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has begun to provide vital insights on their gas and dust content, but so far only for extreme 'blue monsters'. Here we present new, deep ALMA observations of JADES-GS-z11-0, a more typical (sub-$L^*$) $z &gt; 11$ galaxy that bridges the discovery space of JWST and the Hubble Space Telescope. These data confirm the presence of the [O III] 88 $\mu$m line at $4.5\sigma$ significance, precisely at the redshift of several faint emission lines previously seen with JWST/NIRSpec, while the underlying dust continuum remains undetected ($F_\nu &lt; 9.0 \, \mathrm{\mu Jy}$), implying an obscured star formation rate (SFR) of $\text{SFR}_\text{IR} \lesssim 6 \, \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr^{-1}}$ and dust mass of $M_\text{dust} \lesssim 1.0 \times 10^{6} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ (all $3\sigma$). The accurate ALMA redshift of $z_\text{[O III]} = 11.1221 \pm 0.0006$ ($\gtrsim \! 5\times$ refined over NIRSpec) helps confirm that redshifts measured purely from the Lyman-$\alpha$ break, even spectroscopically, should properly take into account the effects of potential damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption (DLA) systems to avoid systematic overestimates of up to $\Delta z \approx 0.5$. The [O III] 88 $\mu$m luminosity of $L_\text{[O III]} = (1.1 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{8} \, \mathrm{L_\odot}$, meanwhile, agrees well with the scaling relation for local metal-poor dwarfs given the SFR measured by NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI. The spatially resolved MIRI and ALMA emission also underscores that JADES-GS-z11-0 is likely to consist of two low-mass components that are undergoing strong bursts of star formation yet are already pre-enriched in oxygen (~20-30% solar), only 400 Myr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>SHELLQs-JWST perspective on the intrinsic mass relation between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies at z &gt; 6</title>

Abstract: The relation between the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies encodes information on their mode of growth, especially at the earliest epochs. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened such investigations by detecting the host galaxies of AGN and more luminous quasars within the first billion years of the universe (z &gt; 6). Here, we evaluate the relation between the mass of SMBHs and the total stellar mass of their host galaxies using a sample of nine quasars at 6.18 &lt; z &lt; 6.4 from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) survey with NIRCam and NIRSpec observations. We find that the observed location of these quasars in the SMBH-galaxy mass plane (log M_BH/Msun ~ 8-9; log M_*/Msun ~ 9.5-11) is consistent with a non-evolving intrinsic mass relation with dispersion (0.80_{-0.28}^{+0.23} dex) higher than the local value (~0.3-0.4 dex) of their more massive descendants. Our analysis is based on a forward model of systematics and includes a consideration of the impact of selection effects and measurement uncertainties with an assumption on the slope of the mass relation. While degeneracies between parameters persist, the best-fit solution has a reasonable AGN fraction (2.3%) of galaxies at z ~ 6 with an actively growing UV-unobscured black hole. In particular, models with a substantially higher normalisation in M_BH would require an unrealistically low intrinsic dispersion (~0.22 dex). Consequently, our results predict a large population of AGNs at lower black hole masses, as are now just starting to be discovered in focused efforts with JWST.</description>

      <title>PRIMER &amp; JADES reveal an abundance of massive quiescent galaxies at 2 &lt; z &lt; 5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We select a mass-complete sample of 225 quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;2$ with $M_* &gt; 10^{10}\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ from PRIMER and JADES photometry spanning a total area of $\simeq320$ sq. arcmin. We restrict our analysis to only area with optical coverage in three $HST$ ACS filters, and provide evidence that this is important for selecting the most complete and clean samples of $z&gt;2$ massive quiescent galaxy candidates. We investigate the contamination in our sample via $JWST$ NIRSpec spectroscopic validation, $Chandra$ X-ray imaging, and ALMA interferometry, calculating a modest total contamination fraction of $12.9_{-3.1}^{+4.0}$ per cent. The removal of $HST$ data increases star-forming galaxy contamination by $\simeq10$ per cent and results in a $\simeq20$ per cent loss of candidates recovered from $HST$+$JWST$ data combined. We calculate massive quiescent galaxy number densities at $2&lt;z&lt;5$, finding values three times larger than pre-$JWST$ estimates, but generally in agreement with more-recent and larger-area $JWST$ studies. In comparison with galaxy evolution simulations, we find that most can now reproduce the observed massive quiescent galaxy number density at $2&lt;z&lt;3$, however they still increasingly fall short at $z&gt;3$, with discrepancies of up to $\simeq 1$ dex. We place 14 of our $z&gt;3$ massive quiescent galaxies on the BPT and WHaN diagrams using medium-resolution spectroscopic data from the EXCELS survey. We find a very high incidence of faint AGN in our sample, at a level of $\simeq50$ per cent, consistent with recent results at cosmic noon. This is interesting in the context of maintenance-mode feedback, which is invoked in many simulations to prevent quenched galaxies from re-igniting star formation. To properly characterise the evolution of early massive quiescent galaxies, greater coverage in optical filters and significantly larger spectroscopic samples will be required.</description>

      <title>Disclosing Submillimeter Galaxy Formation: Mergers or Secular Evolution?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the morphology of 125 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the PRIMER-COSMOS field using double Sersic modeling on JWST NIRCam images across six bands (F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M and F444W), with SMGs being classified by bulge Sersic index (n_bulge) and bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the bright (SFR &gt; 175 M_sun yr^{-1}) and the faint group (SFR &lt; 175 M_sun yr^{-1}) reveals no significant statistical differences in morphology across bands. However, we notice that SMGs skew towards higher B/T ratios and lower n_bulge from shorter to longer wavelengths. In F444W, bright SMGs exhibit higher B/T and lower n_bulge, indicating flatter, disturbed bulges, while faint SMGs show lower B/T and higher n_bulge. Notably, SMGs with higher B/T tend to have low Sersic index, challenging the local universe dichotomy of classical bulges (B/T &gt; 0.5, n &gt; 4) versus pseudo-bulges (B/T &lt; 0.35, n &lt; 2). In the F277W band, non-parametric measurements indicate predominantly disk-dominated patterns, with only 24 percent of SMGs demonstrating merger signatures. After the removal of SMGs with disturbed morphology, the bulge classification scheme in F277W shows pseudo-bulges (21 percent) and clump migration bulges (16 percent) from secular evolution, compared to 4 percent merger-built bulges. Surprisingly, 48 percent of SMGs defy the classification scheme, showing high B/T (approximately 0.7) but low Sersic index (n_bulge &lt;= 1). Bars are confirmed in 7 percent of SMGs. This work suggests that secular evolution takes precedence over major mergers, supporting the idea that isolated evolution fueled by filamentary gas inflow plays a non-negligible role in the SMG bulge formation.</description>

      <title>Early Stages of Dusty Tori: The First Infrared Spectra from a Highly Multiscale Quasar Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first infrared spectral predictions from a self-consistent simulation of the formation of a quasar in a starburst galaxy, spanning the cosmological environment to scales well below the dust sublimation region. The infrared (IR) emission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly magnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas tidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the active galactic nuclei (AGN) is buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by almost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from the inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses silicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads to prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation structure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent extinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated scattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge substantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the central black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine in later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features. These results suggest that dusty starburst quasars can undergo a buried, IR-bright phase early in their evolution.</description>

      <title>The JWST-NIRCam View of Sagittarius C. III. The Extinction Curve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre is crucial for accurately correcting observed data and deriving the underlying stellar populations. However, extinction curves reported in the literature often show discrepancies. We aim to derive the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre based on JWST-NIRCam data for the first time, using observations of the Sagittarius C region in the 1-5 $\mu$m range. We determined extinction ratios using two different methods, both based on measuring the reddening vector using the slope of red clump stars, whose intrinsic properties are well known, in observed colour-magnitude diagrams. The extinction curve derived in this work is in good agreement with previous results in the literature. We obtained the following extinction ratios relative to F162M: $A_\mathrm{F115W} : A_\mathrm{F162M} : A_\mathrm{F182M} : A_\mathrm{F212N} : A_\mathrm{F360M} : A_\mathrm{F405N} : A_\mathrm{F470N} : A_\mathrm{F480M} = 1.84 \pm 0.03 : 1.00 : 0.789 \pm 0.005 : 0.607 \pm 0.014 : 0.306 \pm 0.011 : 0.248 \pm 0.017 : 0.240 \pm 0.019 : 0.21 \pm 0.03$. Besides, we found different values of the extinction index for the short- ($\lambda \sim 1-2.5\,\mu$m, $\alpha \sim 2$) and long-wavelength ($\lambda \sim 2.5-5\,\mu$m, $\alpha \sim 1.4$) regimes, with the extinction curve flattening at longer wavelengths. Comparison with extinction curves derived both inside and outside the Galactic centre suggests that the infrared extinction curve does not significantly vary in the central regions, and shows no significant evidence for variations between different lines of sight beyond the inner Galaxy within the uncertainties.</description>

      <title>XRISM Observations of The Prototypical Cold Front in Abell 3667</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the merging galaxy cluster Abell 3667 with \textit{XRISM}/Resolve. Two observations, targeting the cluster X-ray core and the prototypical cold front, were performed with exposures of 105 ks and 276 ks, respectively. We find that the gas in the core is blueshifted by $v_z\sim-200$ km s$^{-1}$ relative to the brightest cluster galaxy, while the low-entropy gas inside the cold front is redshifted by $v_z\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$. As one moves further off-center across the front, the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity changes significantly, by $\Delta v_z=535^{+167}_{-154}$ km s$^{-1}$, back to the value similar to that in the core. There are no significant LoS velocity gradients perpendicular to the cluster symmetry axis. These features suggest that the gas forming the cold front is flowing in the plane oriented along the LoS, supporting an offset merger scenario in which the main cluster has passed in front of the subcluster and induced rotation of the core gas in the plane perpendicular to the sky. The region just inside the front exhibits the largest LoS velocity dispersion seen across two pointings, $\sigma_z\sim420$ km s$^{-1}$, which can be interpreted as a developing turbulence or a projection of the LoS velocity shear within the front. The large LoS velocity jump across the cold front, combined with the lack of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the surface of the front, suggests some mechanism to suppress it. For example, a magnetic field with $B&gt;5\,\mu$G is required if the cold front is stabilized by magnetic draping.</description>

      <title>Igniting galaxy formation in the post-reionization universe</title>

Abstract: It is widely believed that the ultraviolet background produced during the epoch of reionization conspires against the formation of low-mass galaxies. Indeed, this mechanism is often invoked as a solution to the so-called `missing satellites problem.' In this paper we employ FIREbox, a large-volume cosmological simulation based on the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model, to characterize the mechanisms governing galaxy ignition in the post-reionization era. By carefully matching recently-ignited halos (with stellar ages below $100$ Myr at the time of selection) to halos that failed to form any stars, we conclude that the presence of cold-dense gas and halo concentration help incite the process of galaxy formation. Concretely, we find that $100\%$ of recently-ignited halos experience cold-dense gas enhancements relative to their matched failed counterparts. Likewise, approximately $83\%$ display enhancements in both cold-dense gas and Navarro-Frenk-White concentration ($c_{\rm NFW}$), while the remaining $\sim17\%$ exhibit enhanced cold-dense gas content and suppressed $c_{\rm NFW}$ values. Lastly, our simulation suggests that galaxy ignition can occur as late as $z=2$, potentially allowing us to observationally catch this process `in the act' in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>Hidden metallic iron in amorphous silicate dust? Insights from condensation experiments and mid-infrared spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amorphous silicate dust is a major component in the interstellar and circumstellar dust formed in the outflow of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Although iron depletion is observed in the interstellar medium (ISM), the exact form and fraction of iron in solid remains under debate. In particular, it is unclear whether amorphous silicate dust around AGB stars contains metallic iron. We aimed to provide optical constants of amorphous silicate nanoparticles and examine the effects of metallic iron on their spectral features to better constrain the dust properties by producing amorphous silicate nanoparticles with and without metallic cores. We performed condensation experiments using an induction thermal plasma system to produce dust analogues of the CI chondritic composition in the Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-Fe-Ni-O and Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-O systems. We measured the absorbance and reflectance of the samples, observed the structure of the products, and determined the optical constants. Two types of amorphous silicate nanoparticles (10-200 nm in diameter) with nearly CI chondritic composition were produced: one contained kamacite (Fe: Ni=0.9: 0.1) cores with a diameter ratio ranging 0-0.87 (average ~0.50), and the other was iron-free homogeneous amorphous silicate. The amorphous silicates of the CI chondritic composition with various sized metallic cores may be prevalent in circumstellar and interstellar dust.</description>

      <title>A three-dimensional model for the reversal in the local large-scale interstellar magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We probe the three-dimensional geometry of the large-scale Galactic magnetic field within 1 kpc of the Sun using the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS) of the Northern Sky (DRAGONS). DRAGONS is a new full polarization survey of the Northern sky from 350 to 1030 MHz covering declinations -20{\deg} &lt; $\delta$ &lt; 90{\deg} and a component of GMIMS. The first moment of the Faraday depth spectra produced from DRAGONS above 500 MHz reveals large-angular-scale Faraday depth structures with signs that alternate only once in the Southern Galactic hemisphere and twice in the Northern hemisphere, patterns shared by other Faraday rotation datasets. DRAGONS is the first survey to achieve high Faraday depth resolution while maintaining sensitivity to broad Faraday depth structures, enabling the first use of Galactic longitude-Faraday depth plots. These plots reveal Faraday-complex structures across the sky, indicating a slab-like scenario in which emission and Faraday rotation are mixed. This complexity is overlaid on the same large-scale Faraday depth patterns that appear in the first moment map. We model these patterns as a magnetic reversal slicing through the disk on a diagonal and passing above the Sun in Galactic coordinates. We describe this reversal as a plane with a normal vector parallel to the line directed along ($\ell$, b) = (168.5{\deg}, -60{\deg}) and estimate its distance to be between 0.25 and 0.55 kpc. Our results show that much of the observed Faraday sky may be dominated by the local magnetic field configuration.</description>

      <title>A short review on joint weak and strong cluster lens-mass reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distinction between weak and strong lensing is somewhat arbitrary, and both regimes are manifestations of the same physical phenomenon: gravity bending the path of light. Nevertheless, these two regimes have to a large extent been treated separately, since they require different approaches. This review traces the development of methods combining weak-lensing and strong-lensing data for joint lens-mass reconstruction, with a particular emphasis on cluster lenses, where both effects occur. We conclude that so-called inverse methods have been successful in merging the two regimes insofar data analysis is concerned. However, a number of improvements seem to be in place. First, not many studies include weak lensing data beyond shear. In light of the unprecedented quality of the data of JWST and future surveys, this is a clear point of improvement. Especially so since flexion terms have proven useful in determining sub-structures. Second, considering the amount of data available, and the complexity of non-parametric lenses, automating the processes of lens-mass reconstruction would be beneficial. Towards this end, invoking machine learning seems like a promising way forward.</description>

      <title>Using Wavelet Decomposition to Determine the Dimension of Structures from Projected Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mesoscale structures can often be described as fractional dimensional across a wide range of scales. We consider a $\gamma$ dimensional measure embedded in an $N$ dimensional space and discuss how to determine its dimension, both in $N$ dimensions and projected into $D$ dimensions.
  It is a highly non-trivial problem to decode the original geometry from lower dimensional projection of a high-dimensional measure. The projections are space-feeling, the popular box-counting techniques do not apply, and the Fourier methods are contaminated by aliasing effects. In the present paper we demonstrate that under the "Copernican hypothesis'' that we are not observing objects from a special direction, projection in a wavelet basis is remarkably simple: the wavelet power spectrum of a projected $\gamma$ dimensional measure is $P_j \propto 2^{-j\gamma}$. This holds regardless of the embedded dimension, $N$, and the projected dimension, $D$. This approach could have potentially broad applications in data sciences where a typically sparse matrix encodes lower dimensional information embedded in an extremely high dimensional field and often measured in projection to a low dimensional space.
  Here, we apply this method to JWST and Chandra observations of the nearby supernova Cas A. We find that the emissions can be represented by projections of mesoscale substructures with fractal dimensions varying from $\gamma = 1.7$ for the warm CO layer observed by JWST, up to $\gamma = 2.5$ for the hot X-ray emitting gas layer in the supernova remnant. The resulting power law indicates that the emission is coming from a fractal dimensional mesoscale structure likely produced by magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities in the expanding supernova shell.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the small-scale web around galaxies with miniJPAS and DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first statistical observational study detecting filaments in the immediate surroundings of galaxies, i.e. the local web of galaxies. Simulations predict that cold gas, the fuel for star formation, is channeled through filamentary structures into galaxies. Yet, direct observational evidence for this process has been limited by the challenge of mapping the cosmic web at small scales. Using miniJPAS spectro-photometric data combined with spectroscopic DESI redshifts when available, we construct a high-density observational galaxy sample spanning 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8. Local filaments are detected within a 3 Mpc physical radius of each galaxy with stellar mass M* &gt;10^(10) Msun using all nearby galaxies as tracers, combined with a probabilistic adaptation of the DisPerSE algorithm designed to overcome limitations due to photometric redshift uncertainties. Our methodology is tested and validated using mock catalogues built with random forest models applied to a simulated lightcone. Besides recovering the expected increase in galaxy connectivity (defined as the number of filaments attached to a galaxy) with stellar mass, we show that our connectivity measurements agree with 3D reference estimates from the mock galaxies. Thanks to these filament reconstructions, we explore the relation between small-scale connectivity and galaxy star formation rate, finding a mild positive trend which needs to be confirmed by follow up studies with larger sample sizes. We propose galaxy connectivity to local filaments as a powerful and physically motivated metric of environment, offering new insights into the role of cosmic structure in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Cool Cores: An Inverse-Compton Origin for Cool Core Cluster Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray bright cool-core (CC) clusters contain luminous radio sources accelerating cosmic ray (CR) leptons at prodigious rates. Near the acceleration region, high-energy leptons produce synchrotron (mini)halos and sometimes observable gamma rays, but these leptons have short lifetimes and so cannot propagate far from sources without some rejuvenation. However, low-energy (~0.1-1 GeV) CRs should survive for &gt;Gyr, potentially reaching ~100 kpc before losing energy via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons to keV X-ray energies, with remarkably thermal X-ray spectra. In groups/clusters, this will appear similar to relatively 'cool' gas in cluster cores (i.e. CCs). In lower-mass (e.g. Milky Way/M31) halos, analogous CR IC emission will appear as hot (super-virial) gas at outer CGM radii, explaining recent diffuse X-ray observations. We show that for plausible (radio/gamma-ray observed) lepton injection rates, the CR-IC emission could contribute significantly to the X-ray surface brightness (SB) in CCs, implying that CC gas densities may have been overestimated and alleviating the cooling flow problem. A significant IC contribution to diffuse X-ray emission in CC clusters also explains the tight correlation between the X-ray 'cooling luminosity' and AGN/cavity/jet power, because the apparent CC emission is itself driven by the radio source. Comparing observed Sunyaev Zeldovich to X-ray inferred pressures at $\ll 100$ kpc in CCs represents a clean test of this scenario, and existing data appears to favor significant CR-IC. A significant IC contribution also implies that X-ray inferred gas-phase metallicities have been underestimated in CCs, potentially explaining the discrepancy between X-ray (sub-Solar) and optical/UV (super-Solar) observed metallicities in the central ~10 kpc of nearby CCs. We also discuss the model's connection to observations of multiphase gas in clusters.</description>

      <title>jFoF: GPU Cluster Finding with Gradient Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present jFoF, a fully GPU-native Friends-of-Friends (FoF) halo finder designed for both high-performance simulation analysis and differentiable modeling. Implemented in JAX, jFoF achieves end-to-end acceleration by performing all neighbor searches, label propagation, and group construction directly on GPUs, eliminating costly host--device transfers. We introduce two complementary neighbor-search strategies, a standard k-d tree and a novel linked-cell grid, and demonstrate that jFoF attains up to an order-of-magnitude speedup compared to optimized CPU implementations while maintaining consistent halo catalogs. Beyond performance, jFoF enables gradient propagation through discrete halo-finding operations via both frozen-assignment and topological optimization modes. Using a topological optimization approach via a REINFORCE-style estimator, our approach allows smooth optimization of halo connectivity and membership, bridging continuous simulation fields with discrete structure catalogs. These capabilities make jFoF a foundation for differentiable inference, enabling end-to-end, gradient-based optimization of structure formation models within GPU-accelerated astrophysical pipelines. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/bhorowitz/jFOF/.</description>

      <title>Effects of New Forces on Scalar Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New long range forces acting on ordinary matter are highly constrained. However it is possible such forces act on dark matter, as it is less constrained observationally. In this work, we consider dark matter to be made of light bosons, such as axions. We introduce a mediator that communicates a new force between dark matter particles, in addition to gravity. The mediator is taken to be light, but not massless, so that it can affect small scale galactic behavior, but not current cosmological behavior. As a concrete application of this idea, we analyze the effects on scalar dark matter solitons bound by gravitation, i.e., boson stars, which have been claimed to potentially provide cores of galaxies. We numerically determine the soliton's profiles in the presence of this new force. We also extend the analysis to multiple mediators. We show that this new force alters the relation between core density and core radius in a way that can provide improvement in fitting data to observed galactic cores, but for couplings of order the gravitational strength, the improvement is only modest.</description>
