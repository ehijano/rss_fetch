      <title>An empirical view of the extended atmosphere and inner envelope of the asymptotic giant branch star R Doradus. II. Constraining the dust properties with radiative transfer modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass loss in oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars remains poorly understood, as the dust detected around them appears too transparent to drive winds through absorption alone. The current paradigm invokes outflows driven by photon scattering on relatively large grains ($\sim0.3\,\mu$m), but whether such grains exist in sufficient quantities remains uncertain.
  We test whether the dust around the oxygen-rich AGB star R~Doradus can drive its wind by combining polarimetric constraints, elemental abundance limits, and force-balance calculations. We examine Fe-free silicates (MgSiO$_3$), alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$), and Fe-bearing silicates (MgFeSiO$_4$) to evaluate whether any species can produce enough radiative pressure under realistic conditions.
  Using high-angular-resolution polarimetric observations from SPHERE/ZIMPOL at the VLT, we model the circumstellar dust with RADMC-3D and explore a broad parameter space in grain size, density structure, and wavelength-dependent stellar radius. For models consistent with the observations, we assess wind feasibility using updated gas-density profiles, elemental depletion constraints, and radiation-pressure thresholds.
  Although several dust configurations reproduce the observed scattering patterns, none generate sufficient radiative force at realistic gas-to-dust ratios, even under maximal elemental depletion. Our results for R~Doradus indicate that photon scattering on dust cannot by itself launch the wind, implying that additional mechanisms must contribute.</description>

      <title>Measuring Dust Masses of Protoplanetary Disks in Serpens and L1641/L1647 with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are an essential component of the planet-formation process. The amount of dust and gas in the disk constrains the number and size of planets that can form in a system. We analyze 178 T-Tauri stars, 18 in Serpens and 160 in L1641/L1647, and measure their disk dust masses using spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling and multiwavelength data, including 1.3 mm (ALMA band 6) fluxes from the literature. The disk masses calculated in this work are up to $\sim$2 times higher than those previously reported. We conclude that this is because disks may be partially optically thick at millimeter wavelengths while most calculations of the disk mass assume that the disk is optically thin at 1.3 mm. We calculate optical depths at 1.3 and 7 mm for a subset of the Serpens and L1641/L1647 disk sample and show that the vast majority of disks become optically thin at longer millimeter wavelengths; thus, observations at 7 mm (i.e., ALMA band 1) are vital to better characterize disk dust masses.</description>

      <title>Automated all-sky detection of {\gamma} Doradus / {\delta} Scuti hybrids in TESS data from positive unlabelled (PU) learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has observed hundreds of millions of stars, substantially contributing to the available pool of high-precision photometric space data. Among them are the relatively rare $\gamma$ Doradus / $\delta$ Scuti ($\gamma$ Dor / $\delta$ Sct) hybrid pulsators, which have been previously studied using Kepler data. These stars are perfect laboratories to probe both inner and outer interior stellar layers thanks to them exhibiting both pressure and gravity modes. We seek to classify an all-sky sample of AF stars observed by TESS to find previously undiscovered hybrid pulsators and supply them in a catalogue of candidates. We also aim to compare the light curves produced with the TESS-Gaia Light Curve (TGLC) pipeline, currently underused in variability studies, with other publicly available light curves. We compared dominant and secondary frequencies of confirmed hybrid pulsators in Kepler, extended mission Quick Look Pipeline (QLP) data, and nominal and extended mission TGLC data. We then used a feature-based positive unlabelled (PU) learning classifier to search for new hybrid pulsators amongst TESS AF stars and investigated the properties of the detected populations. We find that the variability of confirmed hybrids in TGLC agrees well with the one occurring in QLP light curves and has a high recovery rate of \kepler-extracted frequencies. Our `smart binning' method allows for robust extraction of hybrids from large unlabelled datasets, with an average out-of-bag prediction for test set hybrids at 93.04\%. The analysis of dominant frequencies in high-probability candidates shows that we find more pressure-mode dominant hybrids. Our catalogue includes 62,026 new candidate light curves from the nominal and extended TESS missions, with individual probabilities of being a hybrid in each available sector.</description>

      <title>High-order Gravity-mode Period Spacing Patterns of Intermediate-mass ($1.5 \, M_\odot &lt; M &lt; 3 \, M_{\odot}$) Main-sequence Stars I. Perturbative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical study of high-order gravity-mode period spacing ($\Delta P_g$) pattern is relevant for the better understanding of internal properties of intermediate-mass ($1.5 \, M_\odot &lt; M &lt; 8 \, M_{\odot}$) main-sequence g-mode pulsators. In this paper, we carry out the first-order perturbative analysis to evaluate effects of a sharp, though not discontinuous, transition in the Brunt-V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} (BV) frequency on the $\Delta P_g$ pattern. Such a finite-width transition in the BV frequency, whose scale height can be comparable to the local wavelength of gravity waves, is expected to develop in relatively low-mass ($1.5 \, M_\odot &lt; M &lt; 3 \, M_{\odot}$) main-sequence stars, causing a bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency. Inspired by Unno et al.'s formulation, we treat the bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency as a small perturbation, which allows us to derive an analytical expression of the $\Delta P_g$ pattern. The analytical expression shows that the amplitude of the oscillatory $\Delta P_g$ pattern is determined by a weighted average of the bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency where the weighting function is given by the g-mode eigenfunction. Tests with low-mass ($\sim 2 \, M_\odot$) main-sequence stellar models show that the analytical expression can reproduce the $\Delta P_g$ patterns numerically computed reasonably well. The results of our perturbative analysis will be useful for, e.g., improving semi-analytical expressions of the $\Delta P_g$ pattern, which would enable us to investigate $\Delta P_g$ patterns of SPB stars and $\gamma$ Dor stars for inferring chemical composition profile and rotation rates.</description>

      <title>Refined classification of YSOs and AGB stars by IR magnitudes, colors, and time-domain analysis with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a binary classification model, {\it the Double Filter Model}, utilizing various machine learning and deep learning methods to classify Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) and Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. Since YSOs and AGB stars share similar infrared (IR) photometric characteristics due to comparable temperatures and the presence of circumstellar dust, distinguishing them is challenging and often leads to misclassification. While machine learning and deep learning techniques have helped reduce YSO-AGB misclassifications, achieving a reliable separation remains challenging. Given that YSOs and AGB stars exhibit distinct light curves resulting from different variability mechanisms, our Double Filter Model leverages light curve data to enhance classification accuracy. This approach uncovered YSOs and AGB stars that were misclassified in IR photometry and was validated against Taurus YSOs and spectroscopically confirmed AGB stars. We applied the model to the {\it Spitzer/IRAC Candidate YSO Catalog for the Inner Galactic Midplane} (SPICY) catalog for catalog refinement and identified potential AGB star contaminants.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Observations for a Double-decker Filament Channel in AR 13102</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the observational evidence of the existence of a double-decker filament channel (FC) by using observations in extreme ultraviolet and H{\alpha} wavelengths. For both FCs, the east foot-point roots in the active region (AR), while the west one roots in the remote quiet region. The bottom FC (FC1) appears as intermittent filaments. Within the AR, the FC1 appears as an S-shaped filament (F1), which consisted of two J-shaped filaments (F1S/F1N for the south/north one). For the upper one (FC2), only the east part is filled with dark plasma and visible as a small filament (F2). Its east foot-point roots around the junction of F1S and F1N. Initially, due to the recurrent reconnections, F1N and F1S link to each other and form a new filament (F3) thread by thread. Meanwhile, the heated plasma, which appears as brightening features, flows from the east foot-point of F2 to the west, and becomes invisible about 1.1$\times$10^{5} km away. The failed eruption of F1S is triggered by the reconnection, which appears as the brightening threads changing their configuration from crossed to quasiparallel in between the F1S and F3, and is confined by the upper magnetic field. Associated with the eruption, the distant invisible plasma becomes visible as a brightening feature. It continuously flows to the remote foot-point, and becomes invisible before reaching it. The brightening plasma flow outlines the skeleton of FC2 gradually. The observations show the existence of a double-decker FC, as a magnetic structure, before they appear as a brightening/dark feature when fully filled with hot/cool plasma.</description>

      <title>Shock-type inference of L1157 B2 using methanol desorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock types of low-velocity molecular outflows are not always well constrained. Astrochemical comparisons are often made between low-velocity and high-velocity outflows, but without considering the question of the shock type. We investigated molecular abundances of post-shock regions to determine whether strong differences between non-irradiated C-type and J-type shocks can be highlighted. One of the main application goals is to diagnose the shock type of the protostellar object L1157 B2 through the use of molecular tracers. We simulated grid sets of shock models with the Paris-Durham Shock code with velocities ranging from 5 to 19 km/s and low densities from $10^2$ to $10^5$ cm$^{-3}$. We computed the desorption percentage of methanol in these simulations and estimated it at higher velocities. We compared our results to observational measurements of L1157 B2 and with a benchmark of four already identified shocks. L1157 B2 has been diagnosed as a non-irradiated C-type shock, and the method showed a good applicability through the benchmark. Methanol formed in the icy mantle of grains can serve to trace the differences between shock types, at least in non-irradiated conditions. A requirement for the applicability of a species as a shock-type tracer is that it does not undergo significant enhancement or destruction, but is mainly impacted by desorption processes under shocked conditions. The desorption percentage of methanol is a good criterion in characterizing the shock type of L1157 B2 and should be investigated as a general method to diagnose the shock type in non-irradiated regions. We identify L1157 B2 as a non-irradiated C-type shock with velocities and densities fitting with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Resonance locking and tidal evolution in rotating {\gamma}-Doradus binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In binary systems, studying tidal interactions is key to understanding the evolution of binary populations. The primary dissipation process occurring in stars with radiative envelopes is believed to be radiative damping of high-radial-order tidally excited oscillations, which is in agreement with observations of most binary systems. However, recent studies have suggested that outside this dissipation regime, dynamical tides can act in the opposite manner (a phenomenon known as inverse tides), and resonance locking could significantly impact the orbital evolution of binary systems. We aim to study inverse tides and resonance locking by simultaneously including the effect of all the forcing frequencies and accounting for the effect of the rotation on the forced oscillations. We have developed an orbital evolution code that is coupled to a stellar oscillation code to compute on the fly the impact of dynamical tides on the rotational and orbital evolution of binary systems including multiple simultaneous forcing frequencies. We find that resonance locking can be stable over a long period of time and a source of long-term exchange of angular momentum for rapidly rotating stars. Long-term locking can increase the total angular momentum of a fast-rotating star by approximately 70% during the main sequence. For slow-rotating stars, resonance locking can slow down the rotational evolution of the system over most of the main-sequence phase, even in the presence of strong tidal interactions. This mechanism efficiently drives asynchronisation in binary systems where significant discrepancies already exist between the orbital and rotational frequencies.</description>

      <title>Variability of H$\alpha$ chromospheric activity of solar-like stars revealed by the time-domain data of LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variability of H$\alpha$ chromospheric activity of solar-like stars is investigated by using the time-domain data of LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (MRS). We use $R_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ index (ratio of H$\alpha$ luminosity to bolometric luminosity) to measure the H$\alpha$ activity intensity of a spectrum, and utilize the median of the $R_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ values of multiple observations ($R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{median}$) as the representative activity intensity of a stellar source. The H$\alpha$ variability of a stellar source is indicated by the extent of $R_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ fluctuation ($R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{EXT}$) of multiple observations. Our sample shows that $R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{EXT}$ of solar-like stars is about one order of magnitude smaller than $R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{median}$. The distribution of $\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{EXT}$ versus $\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{median}$ reveals the distinct behaviors between the stellar source categories with lower ($\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{median} &lt; -4.85$) and higher ($\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{median} &gt; -4.85$) activity intensity. For the former stellar source category, the top envelope of the distribution first increases and then decreases with $\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{median}$; while for the latter category, the top envelope of the distribution is largely along a positive correlation line. In addition, for the stellar sources with lower activity intensity, the large-$\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{EXT}$ objects near the top envelope of the $\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{EXT}$ versus $\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{median}$ distribution tend to have long-term and regular variations of H$\alpha$ activity; while for the stellar sources with higher activity intensity, the H$\alpha$ variations are more likely to be random fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Formation and nature of Huntsman binary pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spider systems are a class of close binaries in which a neutron star first accretes from a normal companion, and later ablates it in some cases. New observations have expanded this category, with the addition of a Huntsman group, tentatively linked to a short donor phase along the red bump in the secondary evolutionary track. We present explicit evolutionary tracks that support the Huntsman nature recently suggested, and discuss how the whole class of spiders emerges from the full consideration of irradiation and ablating winds. We address the irradiation feedback (IFB) effects and the hydrogen-shell burning detachment (HSBD) simultaneously, and show that they act independently and do not interfere with each other, supporting a physical picture of the Huntsman group. We employ our binary evolution code to compute a suite of binary systems formed by a donor star and a neutron star for different initial orbital periods, assuming solar composition and Z=0.01. Although many models do not consider IFB, we also present the evolution with IFB for one system as an example. We found that the recently suggested association of Huntsman pulsar with the evolutionary stage where (as a consequence of the dynamics of HSBD) the system remains detached for a few million years is plausible. However, this feature alone is unable to account for the occurrence of Redback spider pulsars. Meanwhile, models including IFB, with pulsed mass transfer, display detachment episodes that can be naturally associated with the Redback stage. Irradiation feedback does not preclude or modify HSBD and in fact, Huntsman systems were already present as an implicit prediction in our earlier calculations. We conclude that Huntsman is an expected stage of the spider systems under quite general conditions. This is another step towards a unified picture of spider pulsars as a group.</description>

      <title>Axion Constraints from White Dwarf Cooling in 47 Tucanae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the cooling of white dwarfs in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae to look for evidence of axion emission affecting the rate of white dwarf cooling. If axions exist and couple to electrons, then axions could be produced at an appreciable rate in the electron-degenerate core of a white dwarf through axion bremsstrahlung from electrons. The emission of these axions would provide an additional cooling mechanism for white dwarfs that would affect the cooling rate, and hints of axions have been suggested based on observations of anomalous cooling reported for white dwarfs in the Galactic disc and halo. We performed stellar evolution simulations of white dwarf cooling that accounted for the additional energy loss due to axion bremsstrahlung from electrons, producing a suite of white dwarf cooling models for different values of the axion-electron coupling constant, as well as the white dwarf mass and envelope thickness. These cooling models are compared to observations of white dwarfs in 47 Tucanae from the Hubble Space Telescope through an unbinned likelihood analysis. The optimal model found by this analysis corresponds to the case of no axion emission with a thick white dwarf envelope, and we find a new bound on the axion-electron coupling of $g_{aee} \leq 0.81 \times 10^{-13}$ at 95% confidence level. This improves upon the previous white dwarf cooling bound for this coupling and excludes the range of values favoured by the axion hints from the anomalous cooling of Galactic white dwarfs.</description>

Abstract: Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration &amp; University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.</description>

      <title>StarEstate: A Python Package for Galactic Population Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present StarEstate, an open-source Python package for producing rapid, statistically robust galactic population synthesis models. By utilizing optimized pre-calculated inverse-cumulative distribution function samplers, the tool generates synthetic populations from pre-generated grids of stellar tracks orders of magnitude faster than traditional numerical integration methods. A key morphological feature is the probabilistic assignment of stars to spiral arms based on age-dependent dynamical temperature, reproducing the observation that young tracers tightly confine to arms while older populations disperse. The software combines statistical generation with stellar physics by mapping synthetic populations to MESA or rapid SSE/BSE evolutionary tracks. Users can inspect specific evolutionary stages through automatic hierarchical classification, distinguishing evolutionary phases and spectral classes like Wolf-Rayet, O-type, or red supergiant stars across different metallicity environments. StarEstate's features allow the user to predict spatial distributions of diverse stellar objects, providing a flexible resource for interpreting galactic surveys.</description>

      <title>The galactic chemical evolution of carbon: Implications for stellar nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon (C) is thought to be produced by both core collapse supernovae (CCSN) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, but the relative contributions of these two sources are uncertain. We investigate the astrophysical origin of C using models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) appropriate for the Milky Way disk. We benchmark our results against APOGEE subgiant abundances. The trend between [C/Mg] and [Mg/H] is set by the total C yield as a function of metallicity. Observations indicate a gently rising [C/Mg] with [Mg/H], but AGB C production is predicted to decline with metallicity. Our sample therefore favours a scenario in which CCSN yields rise with metallicity to offset declining AGB C yields and drive a subtle increase in [C/Mg] with [Mg/H]. This result is consistent with massive star nucleosynthesis models incorporating rotation. The [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend is sensitive to delayed enrichment and therefore constrains the amount of AGB C production. Given the slope of this relation, we find that AGB stars likely account for 10-40 per cent of C at solar metallicity. Artificially shifting the AGB C yields towards lower mass stars with longer lifetimes also improves agreement with the observed [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend, possibly indicating a discrepancy with stellar evolution predictions or our assumed Fe production rate.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Fast-Flavor Instability on Core-Collapse Supernova Models: II. Quasi-Equipartition and the Impact of Various Angular Reconstruction Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore in a consistent fashion the effects of fast flavor conversion (FFC) in 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations. In addition, we investigate the impact of various angular reconstruction methods and compare the ``3-species'' and ``4-species'' neutrino transport schemes. We find that the FFC effects are insensitive to the different methods tested and that the FFC alters supernova hydrodynamics is only minor ways. We also present a ``quasi-equipartition'' approximation which can be used to estimate the FFC-altered neutrino properties by post-processing the neutrino signals extracted from no-oscillation CCSN simulations. The relative errors in neutrino number and energy luminosities of this phenomenological method are less than 2\% for 1D models, and less than 10\% for 2D models. This method provides a simple way to include the effects of FFC on neutrino signals without implementing a complex and expensive FFC scheme or redoing simulations.</description>

      <title>The Diversity of Cold Worlds: Age and Characterization of the Exoplanet COCONUTS-2b</title>

Abstract: Studying cold brown dwarfs is key to understanding the diverse characteristics of cold giant exoplanets atmospheres. COCONUTS-2, is a wide binary system composed of a T9 brown dwarf and an M3 star, which presents a unique opportunity to characterize a cold benchmark brown dwarf. As part of a JWST program to study the range of physical and atmospheric properties of the coldest brown dwarfs, we obtained NIRSpec G395H spectra (R~2700, 2.87-5.13 um) and MIRI F1000W, F1280W, and F1800W photometry for COCONUTS-2b. In this work, we find a 99% probability of the system belonging to the Corona of Ursa Major (414+/-23 Myr) using BANYAN Sigma and its full kinematics. We also re-estimate the astrometry of COCONUTS-2b using the MIRI data. We support the membership with a comparison of rotation period, metallicity and C/O ratio of the group with those of the COCONUTS-2 system. We also calculate its bolometric luminosity, which combined with our age estimation, allows us to derive its mass, effective temperature, surface gravity, and radius with high precision. As a result of our analysis, we support the conclusion that COCONUTS-2b is a planetary mass object (7.5+/-0.4 MJup) which was likely formed via the same mechanism as stars. In addition we compare the JWST spectrum to another object in the sample, J082507.35+280548.5 (0825+2805), a Y0.5 brown dwarf, which is a candidate member of the same moving group, but has a lower mass (3.7+/-0.2 MJup). We identify absorption feature differences which could indicate that 0825+2805 has stronger vertical mixing.</description>

      <title>The diverse morphology of gravitational wave signals from merging neutron-star white-dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In sufficiently compact neutron star-white dwarf (NSWD) binary systems, orbital decay means the white dwarf eventually fills its shrinking Roche lobe, initiating a phase of mass transfer. The exchange of angular momentum-both internal and external-plays a critical role in determining the binary's evolutionary outcome. For neutron stars with relatively low magnetic fields and spin frequencies, whether the orbital separation continues to shrink depends on the interplay between gravitational wave (GW) radiation and mass transfer dynamics. We compute the orbital evolution of NSWD binaries across a broad parameter space, incorporating four key variables. Our results reveal distinct boundaries in the NS-WD mass-mass diagram: binaries with white dwarf masses above these thresholds undergo rapid orbital decay and direct coalescence. The dependence of these boundaries on system parameters indicates that Roche-lobe-filling NSWD binaries can follow multiple evolutionary pathways -- a phenomenon we refer to as branched or polymorphic evolution. NSWD binary systems emit strong and diverse GW signals, many of which would be detectable by space-based GW observatories. The morphology of the evolving GW waveform provides a direct diagnostic for the NSWD binary configuration, including any contribution from an accretion disk. Our models can provide critical waveform templates for identifying merging binary signals in real-time GW data.</description>

      <title>The FAST-SETI Milky Way Globular Cluster Survey I: A Pilot Multibeam On-the-Fly Search of Five Globular Clusters at L-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a narrowband technosignature search toward five Milky Way globular clusters (NGC 6171, NGC 6218, NGC 6254, NGC 6838, and IC 1276) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) 19-beam L-band receiver (1.05-1.45 GHz). We adapt the MultiBeam Point-source Scanning (MBPS) strategy to extended targets by gating detections to generalized on-target windows (gOTWs), i.e. the time intervals when a beam main lobe intersects a buffered cluster mask, and by enforcing the deterministic multibeam illumination sequence as a geometry test. Dynamic spectra with frequency resolution about 7.5 Hz and time resolution about 10 s are searched with turboSETI over drift rates |nu_dot| &lt;= 4 Hz s^-1 at signal-to-noise ratio S/N &gt;= 10. From about 2.75e5 raw hits across both linear polarizations, none survive the gOTW gating, array-wide simultaneity veto, in-stripe ordering, and single-drift coherence checks, yielding a robust null result. With system equivalent flux density SEFD about 1.5 Jy and an effective 60 s per illuminated crossing, our per-crossing flux density threshold is S_min about 0.50 Jy, corresponding to minimum isotropic-equivalent radiated power EIRP_min in the range (0.72-1.8)e16 W for cluster distances 4-6.5 kpc; when multiple illuminated crossings occur, non-coherent stacking improves sensitivity by up to sqrt(N). To our knowledge this is the first FAST technosignature survey dedicated to globular clusters and the first to use MBPS as the primary observing strategy. These limits disfavor bright, persistent, isotropic L-band beacons above the stated thresholds during our epochs and establish a scalable blueprint, based on geometry-aware gating and verification, for multi-epoch MBPS campaigns that expand signal morphologies and combine passes to deepen constraints on transmitters in dense stellar systems.</description>

      <title>A Bottom-Up EFT Approach To Superdense Baryonic Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How to arrive at the densest matter in massive compact stars starting from Walecka's linear $\omega$-$\sigma$ mean-field model is described in a series of arguments anchored on hidden local symmetry, hidden scale symmetry and emergent parity-doublet symmetry. I follow the bottom-up approach from chiral symmetry with pions, coupled to hidden local and scale symmetry degrees of freedom. Exploiting the renormalization-group treatment \`a la Shankar and Polchinski of the fermionic interactions on the Fermi sphere, leading to Landau-Migdal Fermi-liquid, one obtains a sort of generalized ``Density Functional" that allows via a topology change hadrons transform to quarks without phase changes at the center of massive stars. The highly dense matter is ``pseudo-conformal" with the sound velocity $v_{pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$ but the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is not equal to zero, hence the matter is non-conformal.</description>

      <title>The WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey: Expanding WEAVE's Reach to Bright and Low-Surface-Density Targets with a Novel Observing Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current-day multi-object spectroscopic surveys are often limited in their ability to observe bright stars due to their low surface densities, resulting in increased observational overheads and reduced efficiency. Addressing this, we have developed a novel observing mode for WEAVE (William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer) that enables efficient observations of low-surface-density target fields without incurring additional overheads from calibration exposures. As a pilot for the new mode, we introduce the WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey (WTLS), focusing on bright exoplanet-host stars and their immediate surroundings on the sky. High observational efficiency is achieved by superimposing multiple low-target-density fields and allocating the optical fibres in this configuration. We use a heuristic method to define fields relative to a central guide star, which serves as a reference for their superposition. Suitable guide fibres for each merged configuration are selected using a custom algorithm. Test observations have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of the new observing mode. We show that merged field configurations can be observed with WEAVE using the proposed method. The approach minimizes calibration times and opens twilight hours to WEAVE's operational schedule. WTLS is built upon the new observing mode and sourced from the ESA PLATO long-duration-phase fields. This survey will result in a homogeneous catalogue of approximately 6300 bright stars, including 62 known planet hosts, laying the groundwork for future elemental abundance studies tracing chemical patterns of planetary formation. This new observing mode (WEAVE-Tumble-Less) expands WEAVE's capabilities to rarely used on-sky time and low-density field configurations without sacrificing efficiency.</description>

      <title>Transit Timing of the White Dwarf-Cold Jupiter System WD 1856+534</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new transit timing measurements for the white dwarf-cold Jupiter system WD 1856+534, extending the baseline of observations from 311 epochs to 1498 epochs. The planet is unlikely to have survived the host star's red-giant phase at its present location and is likely too small for common-envelope evolution to take place. As such, a plausible explanation for the short semimajor axis is that the exoplanet started out on a much larger orbit and then spiraled inward through high-eccentricity tidal migration (HETM). A past transit-timing analysis found tentative evidence for orbital growth, which could have been interpreted as a residual effect of HETM, but we find the data are consistent with a constant-period model after adding 18 new transit measurements. We use the estimated period derivative $\dot{P} = 0.04\pm0.43$ ms yr$^{-1}$ to place a lower limit on the planetary tidal quality factor of $Q_p' \gtrsim 3.1 \times 10^6$, consistent with that of Jupiter in our own Solar System. We also test for the presence of companion planets in the system, which could have excited WD 1856 b onto an eccentric orbit via the Kozai-Lidov process, and ultimately rule out the presence of an additional planet with a mass greater than $4.1\,M_J$ and a period shorter than 1500 days. We find no evidence for nonzero eccentricity, with an upper limit of $e\lesssim10^{-2}$. If the planet indeed reached its current orbit through HETM, the low present-day eccentricity indicates that the migration process has now ceased, and any further orbital evolution will be governed solely by weak planetary tides.</description>

      <title>Spectral synthesis of 3D unified model atmospheres with winds for O stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectroscopic studies of massive and luminous O-type stellar atmospheres and winds have primarily been done by using 1D, spherically symmetric and stationary models. Both observations and modern theoretical models show that such stars have highly structured and variable atmospheres and winds. We present first spectral synthesis based on 3D time-dependent unified RHD model atmospheres with winds for O stars. We first carried out time-dependent, 3D simulations of unified atmospheres with winds. We then used 3D radiative transfer to compute surface brightness maps for the optical continuum as well as integrated flux profiles for select diagnostic lines. To derive occupation numbers and source functions, an aNLTE method was used, as well as scattering source functions. Our continuum intensity maps of a prototypical early O star reveal a highly variable and time-dependent surface, characterised by local emergent radiation temperature variations. Our averaged synthetic line profiles of optical absorption lines have large widths, without applying any macro- or microturbulence. From the simulations we find correspondingly large velocity dispersions in the photospheric layers. Additionally, the absorption line EWs are larger than for comparable 1D models. First results using scattering source functions further demonstrate that characteristic features like the softening of the blue edge of strong ultra-violet wind lines are qualitatively well-reproduced by our models. Our 3D simulations clearly predict a highly structured and strongly variable O star surface. First line profile results further suggest that several observed features are naturally reproduced by our models without the need to introduce ad-hoc spectral fitting parameters. We also discuss how using 3D rather than 1D simulations as a basis for future studies may affect the derivation of fundamental stellar parameters.</description>

Abstract: We present the description of the instruments and the first results of the PRime-focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME). PRIME is the first dedicated near-infrared (NIR) microlensing survey telescope located at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in Sutherland, South Africa. Among its class, it offers one of the widest fields of view in the NIR regime. PRIME's main goals are (1) To study planetary formation by measuring the frequency and mass function of planets. In particular, we compare results from the central Galactic bulge (GB), accessible only in the NIR by PRIME, with those from the outer GB by optical surveys. (2) To conduct concurrent observations with NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope. Due to the different lines of sight between the ground and space, we detect slight variations in light curves, known as ``Space-based parallax." This effect allows us to measure the mass of lens systems and their distance from the Earth. It is the only method to measure the mass of the free-floating planets down to Earth-mass. We began the GB survey in February 2024 and analyzed images through June 1, 2025, identifying 486 microlensing candidates and over a thousand variable stars, including Mira variables, which are useful to study the Galactic structure. We issue real-time alerts for follow-up observations, supporting exoplanet searches, and the chemical evolution studies in the GB. During the off-bulge season, we conduct an all-sky grid survey and Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations of transients, including gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and other science.</description>
