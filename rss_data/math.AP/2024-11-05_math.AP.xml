      <title>A rigidity theorem for Kolmogorov-type operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 3$, be a bounded open set and let $x_0\in D$. Assume that the Newtonian potential of $D$ is proportional outside $D$ to the Newtonian potential of a mass concentrated at $\{x_0\}.$ Then $D$ is a Euclidean ball centered at $x_0$. This Theorem, proved by Aharonov, Shiffer and Zalcman in 1981, was extended to the caloric setting by Suzuki and Watson in 2001. In this note, we show that Suzuki--Watson Theorem is a particular case of a more general rigidity result related to a class of Kolmogorov-type PDEs.</description>

      <title>Shock profiles for the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation with hard potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation models gas dynamics in the low density or high Mach number regime, using a statistical description of molecular interactions. Planar shock wave solutions have been constructed for the Boltzmann equation for hard potentials with angular cutoff, and more recently for the Landau equation of plasma dynamics. In this work, we construct shock profile solutions for the Boltzmann equation where the molecular interactions are long-range, and we show these solutions to be smooth and well approximated by compressible Navier Stokes shock profiles. Our proof procedes by standard energy estimates and a quantitative Chapman-Enskog approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00993v1 Announce Type: new

For $p&gt;n$, we construct a solution $u$ with a moving gradient singularity in the sense that $|\nabla u(x,t)|\to \infty$ for each $t$ as $x\to\xi(t)$, where $\xi:[0,\infty)\to\mathbb{R}^n$ is a given curve.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness Results for Mixed Local and Nonlocal Equations with Singular Nonlinearities and Source Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a local and non-local problem characterized by singular nonlinearity and a source term. Specifically, we focus on the following problem:
  \begin{equation}\label{A}\tag{P}
  -\Delta_{p} u + (-\Delta)^{s}_{q} u = f(x) u^{-\alpha} + g(x) u^{\beta}, \quad u &gt; 0 \quad \text{in } \Omega; \quad u = 0, \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^{N} \setminus \Omega,
  \end{equation}
  where \( \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N \) is an open bounded domain with a \( C^{2} \) boundary \( \partial \Omega \), and \( N &gt; p \). We assume that \( 0 &lt; s &lt; 1 \) and \( 1 &lt; p, q &lt; \infty \), with the conditions \( q = p \) or \( q &lt; p \), corresponding to the homogeneous and non-homogeneous cases, respectively. The parameters satisfy \( 0 &lt; \beta &lt; q - 1 \) and \( \alpha &gt; 0 \). The function \( f \) is non-zero and belongs to a suitable Lebesgue space \( L^{r}(\Omega) \) for some \( r \in [1, \infty] \), or satisfies a growth condition involving negative powers of the distance function \( d(\cdot) \) near the boundary \( \partial \Omega \). Additionally, \( g \) is a nonnegative function within appropriate Lebesgue spaces. The primary objectives of this paper are twofold. First, we establish the uniqueness of infinite energy solutions to problem \eqref{A} by introducing a novel comparison principle under certain conditions. Second, we derive several existence results for weak solutions in various senses, accompanied by regularity results for problem \eqref{A}. Furthermore, we present a non-existence result when the function \( f(x) \sim d^{-\delta}(x) \) and \( x \) is near the boundary, under the condition \( \delta \geq p \). Our approach leverages the Picone identities on one hand and the interaction between the local and non-local terms on the other hand.</description>

      <title>Spatial profiles of a reaction-diffusion epidemic model with nonlinear incidence mechanism and constant total population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic reaction-diffusion model with no-flux boundary conditions and constant total population. The infection mechanism in the model is described by a nonlinear term of the form $S^qI^p$ with $0&lt;p\leq1$ and $q&gt;0$. We explore the spatial profiles of the endemic equilibrium with respect to small movement rates of susceptible and/or infected populations. Our results extend and improve existing results in the literature, providing further insights into how transmission mechanisms and population mobility limitations impact the spread of infectious diseases. We reinforce and complement the theoretical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>On a quadratic gradient natural term for the Pucci extremal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quadratic gradient type term for the Pucci extremal operators. Our analysis demonstrates that this proposed term extends the classical quadratic gradient term associated with the Laplace equation, and we investigate the impact of the Kazdan-Kramer transformation. As an application, we explore the existence, non-existence, uniqueness, Liouville-type results, and asymptotic behavior of solutions for the new class of Pucci equations under various conditions on both nonlinearity and domains.</description>

      <title>On the free-boundary Incompressible Elastodynamics with and without surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a free-boundary problem for the incompressible elastodynamics describing the motion of an elastic medium in a periodic domain with a moving boundary and a fixed bottom under the influence of surface tension. The local well-posedness in Lagrangian coordinates is proved by extending arXiv:2105.00596 on incompressible magnetohydrodynamics. We adapt the idea in arXiv:2211.03600 on compressible gravity-capillary water waves to obtain an energy estimate in graphic coordinates. The energy estimate is uniform in surface tension coefficient if the Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition holds and thus yields the zero-surface-tension limit.</description>

      <title>Global boundedness for a two-dimensional doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system $u_t=\nabla \cdot(u^{l-1} v \nabla u)- \nabla \cdot\left(u^{l} v \nabla v\right)+ uv$ and $v_t=\Delta v-u v$ for some $l \geqslant 1$, subjected to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in a smooth bounded convex domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ $(n \leqslant 2)$. Through distinct approaches, we establish that for sufficiently regular initial data, in two-dimensional contexts, if $l \in[1,3]$, then the system possesses global weak solutions, and in one-dimensional settings, the same conclusion holds for $l \in[1,\infty)$. Notably, the solution remains uniformly bounded when $l \in[1,\infty)$ in one dimension or $l \in(1,3]$ in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>A bifurcation phenomenon for the critical Laplace and $p$-Laplace equation in the ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the number of radial positive solutions of the following critical problem $$ \Delta_p u(x) + \lambda K(|x|) \,u(x) \, |u(x)|^{q-2} =0\,,$$ $$ u(x)&gt;0 \quad |x|&lt;1,$$ $$ u(x)=0 \quad |x|=1,$$ where $q= \frac{np}{n-p}$, $\frac{2n}{n+2} \le p \le 2$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, undergoes a bifurcation phenomenon. Namely, the problem admits one solution for any $\lambda&gt;0$ if $K$ is steep enough at $0$, while it admits no solutions for $\lambda$ small and two solutions for $\lambda$ large if $K$ is too flat at $0$.
  The existence of the second solution is new, even in the classical Laplace case. The proofs use Fowler transformation and dynamical systems tools.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the existence of ground states for degenerative ($a=0$) and non-degenerative ($a&gt;0$) double weighted critical Kirchhoff equation \begin{eqnarray*} \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll} \displaystyle-\left(a+b\int_B |\nabla u|^2dx\right)\Delta u=|x|^{\alpha_1} |u|^{4+2\alpha_1}u+\mu|x|^{\alpha_2} |u|^{4+2\alpha_2}u+\lambda h(|x|) f(u) &amp;{\rm in}\ B,\\ u=0 &amp;{\rm on}\ \partial B,
  \end{array} \right. \end{eqnarray*} where $B$ is a unit open ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with center $0$, $a\geq0, b&gt;0, \mu\in \mathbb{R}, \lambda&gt;0, \alpha_1&gt;\alpha_2&gt;-2$, $4+2\alpha_i=2^*(\alpha_i)-2\ (i=1,2)$ with $2^*(\alpha_i)=\frac{2(N+\alpha_i)}{N-2} $ $(N=3)$ being Hardy-Sobolev ($-2&lt;\alpha_i&lt;0$), Sobolev ($\alpha_i=0$) or H\'{e}non-Sobolev ($\alpha_i&gt;0$) critical exponent of the embedding $H_{0,r}^1(B)\hookrightarrow L^p(B;|x|^{\alpha_i})$. Noting that the sign of $\mu$ gives rise to a great effect on the existence of solutions. The methods rely on Nehari manifold and the mountain pass theorem.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear eigenvalue problems for a biharmonic operator in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new higher-order Laplacian operator in the framework of Orlicz-Sobolev spaces, the biharmonic g-Laplacian $$\Delta_g^2 u:=\Delta \left(\dfrac{g(|\Delta u|)}{|\Delta u|} \Delta u\right),$$ where $g=G'$, with $G$ an N-function. This operator is a generalization of the so called bi-harmonic Laplacian $\Delta^2$. Here, we also established basic functional properties of $\Delta_g^2$, which can be applied to existence results. Afterwards, we study the eigenvalues of $\Delta_g^2$, which depend on normalisation conditions, due to the lack of homogeneity of the operator. Finally, we study different nonlinear eigenvalue problems associated to $\Delta_g^2$ and we show regimes where the corresponding spectrum concentrate at $0$, $\infty$ or coincide with $(0, \infty)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the initial value problem (IVP) associated to the semi-linear fractional Sch\"odinger equation with variable coefficients. We deduce several properties of the anisotropic fractional elliptic operator modelling the dispersion relation and use them to establish the local well-posedness for the corresponding IVP. Also, we obtain unique continuation results concerning the solutions of this problem. These are consequences of uniqueness properties that we prove for the fractional elliptic operator with variable coefficients</description>

      <title>Condensation effects in kinetic models for consensus dynamics: finite-time blow-up and regularity aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the main properties of the solution of a Fokker-Planck equation characterized by a variable diffusion coefficient and a polynomial superlinear drift, modeling the formation of consensus in a large interacting system of individuals. The Fokker-Planck equation is derived from the kinetic description of the dynamics of a quantum particle system, and in presence of a high nonlinearity in the drift operator, mimicking the effects of the mass in the alignment forces, allows for steady states similar to a Bose-Einstein condensate. The analysis shows that the regularity of the solution is strongly linked to the degree of nonlinearity in the drift, and that finite-time blow-up of the solution can occur when the degree of nonlinearity is sufficiently high. However, the presence of diffusion prevents the solution from forming condensation after the blow-up time.</description>

      <title>Well-posedeness for the non-isotropic Schr\"odinger equations on cylinders and periodic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial value problem (IVP) for the non-isotropic Schr\"odinger equation posed on the two-dimensional cylinders and $\mathbb{T}^2$ is considered. The IVP is shown to be locally well-posed for small initial data in $H^s(\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R})$ if $s\geq0$. For the IVP posed on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$, given data are considered in the anisotropic Sobolev spaces thereby obtaining the local well-posedness result in $H^{s_1, s_2}(\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T})$, if $s_1\geq0$ and $s_2&gt;\frac12$. In the purely periodic case, a particular case of the IVP is shown to be locally well-posed for any given initial data in $H^s(\mathbb{T}^2)$ if $s&gt;\frac18$. In some cases, ill-posedness issues are also considered showing that the IVP posed on $\mathbb{T}\times \mathbb{R}$, in the focusing case, is ill-posed in the sense that the application data-solution fails to be uniformly continuous for data in $H^s(\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R})$ if $-\frac12\leq s&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of a multiscale model for water transport in vegetated soil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the multiscale modelling of water transport in vegetated soil. In the microscopic model we distinguish between subdomains of soil and plant tissue, and use the Richards equation to model the water transport through each. Water uptake is incorporated by means of a boundary condition on the surface between root tissue and soil. Assuming a simplified root system architecture, which gives a cylindrical microstructure to the domain, the two-scale convergence and periodic unfolding methods are applied to rigorously derive a macroscopic model for water transport in vegetated soil. The degeneracy of the Richards equation and the dependence of root tissue permeability on the small parameter introduce considerable challenges in deriving macroscopic equations, especially in proving strong convergence. The variable-doubling method is used to prove the uniqueness of solutions to the model, and also to show strong two-scale convergence in the non-linear terms of the equation for water transport through root tissue.</description>

      <title>Large time behavior of solutions to the 2D damped wave-type magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the 2D damped wave-type magnetohydrodynamic system (abbreviated as MHD-wave system). The purpose of this paper is to study the large time behavior of solutions to the MHD-wave system, espesically to investigate the influence of the bad term $\gamma \partial_{tt}b$ on the large time behavior. Rates of decay are obtained for both the solutions and higher derivatives in different Sobolev spaces with explicit rates of $\gamma$, which shows that the decay rates closely align with that of the MHD system under the same norm, for any fixed $\gamma&gt;0$. In this sense, these decay rates are optimal.</description>

      <title>On the existence of multiple normalized solutions for a class of fractional Choquard equations with mixed nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of normalized solutions for the following nonlinear fractional Choquard equation: $$ (-\Delta)^s u+V(\epsilon x)u=\lambda u+\left(I_\alpha *|u|^q\right)|u|^{q-2} u+\left(I_\alpha *|u|^p\right)|u|^{p-2} u, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^N, $$ subject to the constraint $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u|^2 \mathrm{d}x=a&gt;0, $$ where $N&gt;2 s, s \in(0,1), \alpha \in(0, N), \frac{N+\alpha}{N}&lt;q&lt;\frac{N+2 s+\alpha}{N}&lt;p\leq \frac{N+\alpha}{N-2 s}$, $\epsilon&gt;0$ is a parameter, and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ serves as an unknown parameter acting as a Lagrange multiplier. By employing the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category theory, we estimate the number of normalized solutions to this problem by virtue of the category of the set of minimum points of the potential function $V$.</description>

      <title>The Muskat problem with a large slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish local well-posedness results for the Muskat equation in any dimension using modulus of continuity techniques. By introducing a novel quantity \(\beta_\sigma(f_0')\) which encapsulates local monotonicity and slope, we identify a new class of initial data within \(W^{1,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)\). This includes scenarios where the product of the maximal and minimal slopes is large, thereby guaranteeing the local existence of a classical solution.</description>

      <title>Refined $L^p$ restriction estimate for eigenfunctions on Riemannian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine the $L^p$ restriction estimates for Laplace eigenfunctions on a Riemannian surface, originally established by Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov. First, we establish estimates for the restriction of eigenfunctions to arbitrary Borel sets on the surface, following the formulation of Eswarathasan and Pramanik. We achieve this by proving a variable coefficient version of a weighted Fourier extension estimate of Du and Zhang. Our results naturally unify the $L^p(M)$ estimates of Sogge and the $L^p(\gamma)$ restriction bounds of Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov, and are sharp for all $p \geq 2$, up to a $\lambda^\varepsilon$ loss. Second, we derive sharp estimates for the restriction of eigenfunctions to tubular neighborhoods of a curve with non-vanishing geodesic curvature. These estimates are closely related to a variable coefficient version of the Mizohata--Takeuchi conjecture, providing new insights into eigenfunction concentration phenomena.</description>

      <title>Higher-order non-local gradient theory of phase-transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of double-well energies perturbed by a higher-order fractional term, which, in the one-dimensional case, take the form $$ \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\int_I W(u(x))dx+\varepsilon^{2(k+s)-1}\frac{s(1-s)}{2^{1-s}}\int_{I\times I} \frac{|u^{(k)}(x)-u^{(k)}(y)|^2}{|x-y|^{1+2s}} dx\,dy $$ defined on the higher-order fractional Sobolev space $H^{k+s}(I)$, where $W$ is a double-well potential, $k\in \mathbb N$ and $s\in(0,1)$ with $k+s&gt;\frac12$. We show that these functionals $\Gamma$-converge as $\varepsilon\to 0$ to a sharp-interface functional with domain $BV(I;\{-1,1\})$ of the form $m_{k+s}\#(S(u))$, with $m_{k+s}$ given by the optimal-profile problem \begin{equation*} m_{k+s} =\inf\Big\{\int_{\mathbb R} W(v)dx+\frac{s(1-s)}{2^{1-s}}\int_{\mathbb R^2}\frac{|v^{(k)}(x)-v^{(k)}(y)|^2}{|x-y|^{1+2s}} dx\,dy : v\in H^{k+s}_{\rm loc}(\mathbb R), \lim_{x\to\pm\infty}v(x)=\pm1\Big\}. \end{equation*} The normalization coefficient $\frac{s(1-s)}{2^{1-s}}$ is such that $m_{k+s}$ interpolates continuously the corresponding $m_k$ defined on standard higher-order Sobolev space $H^k(I)$, obtained by Modica and Mortola in the case $k=1$, Fonseca and Mantegazza in the case $k=2$ and Brusca, Donati and Solci for $k\ge 3$. The results also extends previous works by Alberti, Bouchitt\'e and Seppecher, Savin and Valdinoci, and Palatucci and Vincini, in the case $k=0$ and $s\in(\frac12,1)$.</description>

      <title>Power law convergence and concavity for the Logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study concavity properties of positive solutions to the Logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation $-\Delta u=u\, \log u^2$ in a general convex domain with Dirichlet conditions. To this aim, we analyse the auxiliary Lane-Emden problems $-\Delta u = \sigma\, (u^q-u)$ and build, for any $\sigma&gt;0$ and $q&gt;1$, solutions $u_q$ such that $u_q^{(1-q)/2}$ is convex. By choosing $\sigma_q=2/(1-q)$ and letting $q \to 1^+$ we eventually construct a solution $u$ of the Logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation such that $\log u$ is concave. This seems one of the few attempts in studying concavity properties for superlinear, sign changing sources. To get the result, we both make inspections on the constant rank theorem and develop Liouville theorems on convex epigraphs, which might be useful in other frameworks.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of star domains and the spectra of Hodge-Laplace operators under domain approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the eigenvalues of Hodge--Laplace operators over bounded convex domains. Generalizing contributions by Guerini and Savo, we show that the Poincar\'e--Friedrichs constants of the Sobolev de~Rham complexes increase with the degree of the forms. We establish that the spectra of Hodge--Laplace operators converge when the domain is approximated by a sequence of convex domains up to a bi-Lipschitz deformation of the boundary. As preparatory work with independent relevance, we study the gauge function and the reciprocal radial function of convex sets, providing new proofs for Lipschitz estimates by Vre\'{c}ica and Toranzos for the reciprocal radial function and improving a Lipschitz estimate for the gauge function due to Beer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a version of Calder\'on's problem for harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds. By using the higher linearization method, we first show that the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map determines the metric on the domain up to a natural gauge in three cases: on surfaces, on analytic manifolds, and in conformally transversally anisotropic manifolds on a fixed conformal class with injective ray transform on the transversal manifold. Next, using higher linearizations we obtain integral identities that allows us to show that the metrics on the target have the same jets at one point. In particular, if the target is analytic, the metrics are equal. We also prove an energy rigidity result, in the sense that the Dirichlet energies of harmonic maps determines the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.</description>

      <title>Global self-similar solutions for the 3D Muskat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of global self-similar solutions to the 3D Muskat equation when the two fluids have the same viscosity but different densities. These self-similar solutions are globally defined in both space and time, with exact cones as their initial data. Furthermore we estimate the difference between our self-similar solutions and solutions of the linearized equation around the flat interface in terms of critical spaces and some weighted $\dot{W}^{k,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ spaces for $k=1,2$. The main ingredients of the proof are new estimates in the sense of $\dot{H}^{s_1}(\mathbb{R}^2) \cap \dot{H}^{s_2}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with $3/2&lt;s_1&lt;2&lt;s_2&lt;3$, which is continuously embedded in critical spaces for the 3D Muskat problem: $\dot{H}^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ and $\dot{W}^{1,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^2)$.</description>

Abstract: We study the well-posedness of solutions to the general nonlinear parabolic equations with merely integrable data in time-dependent Musielak-Orlicz spaces. With the help of a density argument, we establish the existence and uniqueness of both renormalized and entropy solutions. Moreover, we conclude that the entropy and renormalized solutions for this equation are equivalent. Our results cover a variety of problems, including those with Orlicz growth, variable exponents, and double-phase growth.</description>

      <title>Exact periodic solutions of the generalized Constantin-Lax-Majda equation with dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present exact pole dynamics solutions to the generalized Constantin-Lax-Majda (gCLM) equation in a periodic geometry with dissipation $-\Lambda^\sigma$, where its spatial Fourier transform is $\widehat{\Lambda^\sigma}=|k|^\sigma$. The gCLM equation is a simplified model for singularity formation in the 3D incompressible Euler equations. It includes an advection term with parameter $a$, which allows different relative weights for advection and vortex stretching. There has been intense interest in the gCLM equation, and it has served as a proving ground for the development of methods to study singularity formation in the 3D Euler equations. Several exact solutions for the problem on the real line have been previously found by the method of pole dynamics, but only one such solution has been reported for the periodic geometry. We derive new periodic solutions for $a=0$ and $1/2$ and $\sigma=0$ and $1$, for which a closed collection of (periodically repeated) poles evolve in the complex plane. Self-similar finite-time blow-up of the solutions is analyzed and compared for the different values of $\sigma$, and to a global-in-time well-posedness theory for solutions with small data presented in a previous paper of the authors. Motivated by the exact solutions, the well-posedness theory is extended to include the case $a=0$, $\sigma \geq 0$. Several interesting features of the solutions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Compressible fluids and elastic plates in 2D: A conditional no-contact theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the interaction of a compressible fluid with a flexible plate in two space dimensions. The fluid is described by the Navier--Stokes equations in a domain that is changing in accordance with the motion of the structure. The displacement of the latter evolves according to a beam equation. Both are coupled through kinematic boundary conditions and the balance of forces. We prove that for any weak solution to the coupled system, which satisfies certain additional regularity requirements, no contact occurs between the elastic wall and the bottom of the fluid cavity. This applies to both isentropic and heat-conducting fluids. As a special case of our general theory we extend the unconditional result from Grandmont and Hillairet (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 220, 1283--1333, 2016) on incompressible fluids from visco-elastic to perfectly elastic plates.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions with higher regularity to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations under Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we aim to establish global existence of weak solutions with higher regularity to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations under no-slip boundary conditions. Though Lions\cite{L1} and Feireisl\cite{F1} have established global weak solutions with finite energy under Dirichelet boundary conditions by making use of so called effective viscous flux and oscillation defect measure,Hoff has investigated global weak solutions with higher regularity in \cite{H1,Hof2} when the domain is either whole space or half space with Navier-slip boundary conditions, yet the existence theory of global weak solution with higher regularity under Dirichlet boundary conditions remains unknown. In this paper we prove that the system will admit at least one global weak solutions with higher regularity as long as the initial energy is suitably small when the domain is a 2D solid disc. This is achieved by exploiting the structure of the exact Green function of the disc to decompose the effective viscous flux into three parts, which corresponds to the pressure term, boundary term and the remaining term respectively. In order to control the boundary term, one of the key observations is to use the geometry of the domain which sucessfully to bound the integral of the effective viscous flux where $L^1$ norm is always unbounded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helical Kelvin waves were conjectured to exist for the 3D Euler equations in Lucas and Dritschel \cite{LucDri} (as well as in \cite{Chu}) by studying dispersion relation for infinitesimal linear perturbations of a circular helically symmetric vortex patch. This paper aims to rigorously establish the existence of these $m$-fold symmetric helical Kelvin waves, in both simply and doubly connected cases, for the 3D Euler equations. The construction is based on linearization of contour dynamics equations and bifurcation theory. Our results rigorously verify the prediction in aforementioned papers and extend $m$-waves of Kelvin from the 2D Euler equations to the 3D helically symmetric Euler equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of ground state solutions by considering the minimization problem on a Nehari-Pohozaev set. The presence of a doping profile causes several difficulties, especially in the proof of the uniqueness of a maximum point of a fibering map. A key ingredient is to establish the energy inequality. We also establish the relation between ground state solutions and $L^2$-constraint minimizers. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, some geometric quantities related to the domain, such as the mean curvature,are responsible for the existence of ground state solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the question of regularity of solutions to evolutionary (quasi-static and dynamic) perfect plasticity models. Under the assumption that the elasticity set is a compact convex subset of deviatoric matrices, with $C^2$ boundary and positive definite second fundamental form, it is proved that the Cauchy stress admits spatial partial derivatives that are locally square integrable. In the dynamic case, a similar regularity result is established for the velocity as well. In the latter case, one-dimensional counterexamples show that, although solutions are Sobolev in the interior of the domain, singularities may appear at the boundary and the Dirichlet condition may fail to be attained.</description>

Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional compressible Navier--Stokes system with the Coriolis force and prove the long-time existence of a unique strong solution. More precisely, we show that for any $0&lt;T&lt;\infty$ and arbitrary large initial data in the scaling critical Besov spaces, the solution uniquely exists on $[0,T]$ provided that the speed of rotation is high and the Mach numbers are low enough. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first contribution to the well-posedness of the \textit{compressible} Navier--Stokes system with the Coriolis force in the whole space $\mathbb R^3$. The key ingredient of our analysis is to establish the dispersive linear estimates despite a quite complicated structure of the linearized equation due to the anisotropy of the Coriolis force.</description>

      <title>Global controllability of Boussinesq channel flows only through the temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the global approximate controllability of the Boussinesq system with viscosity and diffusion in a planar periodic channel by using only a temperature control supported in a thin strip. At the walls, a slip boundary condition is chosen for the fluid and the normal derivative of the temperature is assumed to vanish. This contributes a first global controllability result of such type for the Boussinesq system in the presence of non-periodic boundary conditions. We resort to a small-time scaling argument to control the vorticity through a large initial temperature. Moreover, relying on the special choice of the domain, we employ J.-M. Coron's return method in order to steer the temperature without significantly impacting the vorticity.</description>

      <title>Critical points of the one dimensional Ambrosio-Tortorelli functional with an obstacle condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family of critical points of the Ambrosio-Tortorelli energy with an obstacle condition on the phase field variable. This problem can be interpreted as a time discretization of a quasistatic evolution problem where the obstacle at step $n$ is defined as the solution at step $n-1$. The obstacle condition now reads as an irreversibility condition (the crack can only increase in time). The questions tackled here are the regularity of the critical points, the properties inherited from the obstacle sequence, the position of the limit points and the equipartition of the phase field energy. The limits of such critical points turn out to be critical points of the Mumford-Shah energy that inherit the possible discontinuities induced by the obstacle sequence.</description>

      <title>Stability of spectral partitions with corners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spectral minimal partition of a manifold is a decomposition into disjoint open sets that minimizes a spectral energy functional. While it is known that bipartite minimal partitions correspond to nodal partitions of Courant-sharp Laplacian eigenfunctions, the non-bipartite case is much more challenging. In this paper, we unify the bipartite and non-bipartite settings by defining a modified Laplacian operator and proving that the nodal partitions of its eigenfunctions are exactly the critical points of the spectral energy functional. Moreover, we prove that the Morse index of a critical point equals the nodal deficiency of the corresponding eigenfunction. Some striking consequences of our main result are: 1) in the bipartite case, every local minimum of the energy functional is in fact a global minimum; 2) in the non-bipartite case, every local minimum of the energy functional minimizes within a certain topological class of partitions. Our results are valid for partitions with non-smooth boundaries; this introduces considerable technical challenges, which are overcome using delicate approximation arguments in the Sobolev space $H^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Approximating Diffusion on Finite Multi-Topology Systems Using Ultrametrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by multi-topology building and city model data, first a lossless representation of multiple $T_0$-topologies on a given finite set by a vertex-edge-weighted graph is given, and the subdominant ultrametric of the associated weighted graph distance matrix is proposed as an index structure for these data. This is applied in a heuristic parallel topological sort algorithm for edge-weighted directed acyclic graphs. Such structured data are of interest in simulation of processes like heat flows on building or city models on distributed processors. With this in view, the bulk of this article calculates the spectra of certain unbounded self-adjoint $p$-adic Laplacian operators on the $L^2$-spaces of a compact open subdomain of the $p$-adic number field associated with a finite graph $G$ with respect to the restricted Haar measure. as well as to a Radon measure coming from an ultrametric on the vertices of $G$ with the help of $p$-adic polynomial interpolation. In the end, error bounds are given for the solutions of the corresponding heat equations by finite approximations of such operators.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Gini-type discrepancies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring distances in a multidimensional setting is a challenging problem, which appears in many fields of science and engineering. In this paper, to measure the distance between two multivariate distributions, we introduce a new measure of discrepancy which is scale invariant and which, in the case of two independent copies of the same distribution, and after normalization, coincides with the scaling invariant multidimensional version of the Gini index recently proposed in [34]. A byproduct of the analysis is an easy-to-handle discrepancy metric, obtained by application of the theory to a pair of Gaussian multidimensional densities. The obtained metric does improve the standard metrics, based on the mean squared error, as it is scale invariant. The importance of this theoretical finding is illustrated by means of a real problem that concerns measuring the importance of Environmental, Social and Governance factors for the growth of small and medium enterprises.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation for the Robin eigenvalue problem on manifolds and flexibility of optimal Schr\"odinger potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the spectrum of a Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problem posed on a closed Riemannian manifold $M$ with non-negative potential can be approached by that of Robin eigenvalue problems with constant positive boundary parameter posed on a sequence of domains in $M$. We construct these Robin problems by means of a homogenisation procedure. We show a similar result for compact manifolds with non-empty boundary and sign-indefinite potential; in this case the Robin boundary parameter can be taken to be constant on each boundary component and to have constant magnitude. As an application, we prove a flexibility result for optimal Schr\"odinger potentials: for certain problems where it is known that there exists some potential $V$ which extremises some Schr\"odinger eigenvalue, we show that this extremal eigenvalue is also approached by the corresponding eigenvalues for a sequence of smooth potentials which remain bounded away from $V$ in some dual Sobolev space.</description>

      <title>Error Estimate for a Semi-Lagrangian Scheme for Hamilton-Jacobi Equations on Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the numerical approximation of time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations on networks, providing a convergence error estimate for the semi-Lagrangian scheme introduced in (Carlini and Siconolfi, 2023), where convergence was proven without an error estimate. We derive a convergence error estimate of order one-half. This is achieved showing the equivalence between two definitions of solutions to this problem proposed in (Imbert and Monneau, 2017) and (Siconolfi, 2022), a result of independent interest, and applying a general convergence result from (Carlini, Festa and Forcadel, 2020).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider blowup of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the following biharmonic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS), $$ \textnormal{i} \, \partial_t u=\Delta^2 u-\mu \Delta u-|u|^{2 \sigma} u \quad \text{in} \,\, \R \times \R^d, $$ where $d \geq 1$, $\mu \in \R$ and $0&lt;\sigma&lt;\infty$ if $1 \leq d \leq 4$ and $0&lt;\sigma&lt;4/(d-4)$ if $d \geq 5$. In the mass critical and supercritical cases, we establish the existence of blowup solutions to the problem for cylindrically symmetric data. The result extends the known ones with respect to blowup of solutions to the problem for radially symmetric data.</description>

First we establish the existence of ground states in the mass subcritical, critical and supercritical cases. Then we consider the well-posedness and dynamical behaviors of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the associated time-dependent equations.</description>

      <title>Set-decomposition of normal rectifiable G-chains via an abstract decomposition principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of set-decomposition of a normal G-flat chain. We show  that any normal rectifiable $G$-flat chain admits a decomposition in set-indecomposable sub-chains. This generalizes the decomposition of sets of finite perimeter in their ``measure theoretic'' connected components due to Ambrosio, Caselles, Masnou and Morel. It can also be seen as a variant of the decomposition of integral currents in indecomposable components by Federer.As opposed to previous results, we do not assume  that G is boundedly compact. Therefore we cannot rely on the  compactness of sequences of chains with uniformly bounded N-norms. We deduce instead  the result from a new abstract decomposition principle. As in earlier proofs a central ingredient is  the validity of an isoperimetric inequality. We obtain it here using the finiteness of some h-mass to replace integrality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The morphology of crystalline thin films evolving on flat rigid substrates by condensation of extra film atoms or by evaporation of their own atoms in the surrounding vapor is studied in the framework of the theory of Stress Driven Rearrangement Instabilities (SDRI). By following the literature both the elastic contributions due to the mismatch between the film and the substrate lattices at their theoretical (free-standing) elastic equilibrium, and a curvature perturbative regularization preventing the problem to be ill-posed due to the otherwise exhibited backward parabolicity, are added in the evolution equation. The resulting Cauchy problem under investigation consists in an anisotropic mean-curvature type flow of the fourth order on the film profiles, which are assumed to be parametrizable as graphs of functions measuring the film thicknesses, coupled with a quasistatic elastic problem in the film bulks. The existence of a regular solution for a finite period of time is established under periodic boundary conditions by means of employing minimizing movements to exploit the gradient-flow structure of the evolution equation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we establish for the first time local semiconvexity estimates for fully nonlinear equations and for obstacle problems driven by integro-differential operators with general kernels. Our proof is based on the Bernstein technique, which we develop for a natural class of nonlocal operators and consider to be of independent interest. In particular, we solve an open problem from Cabr\'e-Dipierro-Valdinoci [CDV22]. As an application of our result, we establish optimal regularity estimates and smoothness of the free boundary near regular points for the nonlocal obstacle problem on domains. Finally, we also extend the Bernstein technique to parabolic equations and nonsymmetric operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper's aim is threefold. First, using Feynman's path approach to the derivation of theclassical Schr{\"o}dinger's equation in [6] and by introducing a slight path (or wave) dependency ofthe action, we derive a new class of equations of Schr{\"o}dinger type where the driving operatoris no longer the Laplace one but rather of complex porous media-type. Second, using suitableconcepts of monotonicity in the complex setting and on appropriate functional spaces, we showthe existence and uniqueness of the solution to this type of equation. In the formulation of ourequation, we adjoin possible measurement absolute errors translating in an additive Brownianperturbation and interactions between different waves translating in a mean-field (or McKean-Vlasov) dependency of drift coefficient. Finally, using Fitzpatrick's characterization of maximalmonotone operators (cf. [7]), we propose a Br{\'e}zis-Ekeland type characterization of the solutionof the deterministic equation via a control problem. This is envisaged as a possible way toovercome strict monotonicity requirements in the complex setting.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we propose some Harris-like criteria in order to study the long time behavior of general positive and periodic semiflows. These criteria allow us to obtain new existence results of principal eigenelements, and their exponential attractiveness. We present applications to two biological models in a space-time varying environment: a non local selection-mutation equation and a growth-fragmentation equation. The particularity of this article is to study some inhomogeneous problems that are periodic in time, as it appears for instance when the environment changes, due for instance to the seasonal cycle or circadian rhythms.</description>

This includes flows in vertical Hele-Shaw cells and in porous media (the one-phase Muskat problem) with finite or infinite depth. The free boundary is acted upon by an external pressure posited to be in traveling wave form with an arbitrary periodic profile and an amplitude parameter. For any given wave speed, we first prove that there exists a unique local curve of small periodic traveling waves corresponding to small values of the parameter. Then we prove that as the parameter increases but could possibly be bounded, the curve belongs to a connected set $\mathcal{C}$ of traveling waves. The set $\mathcal{C}$ contains traveling waves that either have arbitrarily large gradients or are arbitrarily close to the rigid bottom in the finite depth case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of large traveling surface waves for a viscous free boundary problem.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates and low regularity solutions of 3D relativistic Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the low regularity well-posedness for Cauchy problem of 3D relativistic Euler equations. Firstly, we introduce a new decomposition for relativistic velocity and derive new transport equations for vorticity, which both play a crucial role in energy and Strichartz estimates. According to Smith-Tataru's approach, we then establish a Strichartz estimate of linear wave equations endowed with the acoustic metric. This leads us to prove a complete local well-posedness result if the initial logarithmic enthalpy, velocity, and modified vorticity $(h_0, \bu_0, \bw_0) \in H^s \times H^s \times H^{s_0} (2&lt;s_0&lt;s)$. Therefore, we give an affirmative answer to "Open Problem D" proposed by Disconzi.
  Moreover, for $(h_0,{\bu}_0,\bw_0) \in H^{2+} \times H^{2+} \times H^2$, by frequency truncation, there is a stronger Strichartz estimate for solutions on a short-time-interval. By semi-classical analysis and induction method, these solutions can be extended from short time intervals to a regular time interval, and a uniform Strichartz estimate with loss of derivatives can be obtained. This allows us to prove the local well-posedness of 3D relativistic equations if $(h_0,{\bu}_0,\bw_0) \in H^{2+} \times H^{2+} \times H^2$.</description>

      <title>Sharp Spectral Projection Estimates for the Torus at $p_c=\frac{2(n+1)}{n-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove sharp spectral projection estimates for tori in all dimensions at the exponent $p_c=\frac{2(n+1)}{n-1}$ for shrinking windows of width $1$ down to windows of length $\lambda^{-1+\kappa}$ for fixed $\kappa&gt;0$. This improves and slightly generalizes the work of Blair-Huang-Sogge who proved sharp results for windows of width $\lambda^{-\frac{1}{n+3}}$, and the work of Hickman, Germain-Myerson, and Demeter-Germain who proved results for windows of all widths but incurred a sub-polynomial loss. Our work uses the approaches of these two groups of authors, combining the bilinear decomposition and microlocal techniques of Blair-Huang-Sogge with the decoupling theory and explicit lattice point lemmas used by Hickman, Germain-Myerson, and Demeter-Germain to remove these losses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Harnack inequality fails for nonlocal kinetic equations. Such equations arise as linearized models for the Boltzmann equation without cutoff and are of hypoelliptic type. We provide a counterexample for the simplest equation in this theory, the fractional Kolmogorov equation. Our result reflects a purely nonlocal phenomenon since the Harnack inequality holds true for local kinetic equations like the Kolmogorov equation.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the asymptotic behavior of global solutions to the convection-diffusion equation in the Fujita-subcritical case. We improve the result by Zuazua (1993) and establish higher order asymptotic expansions with decay estimates of the remainders.

      <title>Long-time behavior to the 3D isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with the long-time behavior of classical solutions to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb R^3$. Our main results and innovations can be stated as follows: Under the assumption that the density $\rho({\bf{x}}, t)$ verifies $\rho({\bf{x}},0)\geq c&gt;0$ and $\sup_{t\geq 0}\|\rho(\cdot,t)\|_{L^\infty}\leq M$, we establish the optimal decay rates of the solutions. This greatly improves the previous result (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 234 (2019), 1167--1222), where the authors require an extra hypothesis $\sup_{t\geq 0}\|\rho(\cdot,t)\|_{C^\alpha}\leq M$ with $\alpha$ arbitrarily small. We prove that the vacuum state will persist for any time provided that the initial density contains vacuum and the far-field density is away from vacuum, which extends the torus case obtained in (SIAM J. Math. Anal. 55 (2023), 882--899) to the whole space. We derive the decay properties of the solutions with vacuum as far-field density. This in particular gives the first result concerning the $L^\infty$-decay with a rate $(1+t)^{-1}$ for the pressure to the 3D compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of vacuum. The main ingredient of the proof relies on the techniques involving blow-up criterion, a key time-independent positive upper and lower bounds of the density, and a regularity interpolation trick.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the results in [16] to more general domains. More precisely, we obtain transmission eigenvalue-free regions for the interior transmission problem with one complex-valued refraction index, that is, with a damping term which does not vanish on the boundary. In particular, we remove the non-trapping condition as well as the strict concavity condition from [16]. Instead, we impose new, more general conditions in terms of the highfrequency behavior of certain cut-off resolvents associated to exterior problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the perturbation problem of the incompressible porous media (IPM) equation on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^2$. We prove the mild ill-posedness of IPM equation in the critical space $W^{1,\infty}$ when the initial data are small perturbations of the more general stable profile $g(x_2),$ and accordingly, instability can be inferred. It is emphasized that our result holds for any vertically layered density $g(x_2)$ without requirement on the sign of $g'(x_2).$</description>

      <title>The generalized K\"ahler Calabi-Yau problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate an extension of the Calabi conjecture to the setting of generalized K\"ahler geometry. We show a transgression formula for the Bismut Ricci curvature in this setting, which requires a new local Goto/Kodaira-Spencer deformation result, and use it to show that solutions of the generalized Calabi-Yau equation on compact manifolds are classically K\"ahler, Calabi-Yau, and furthermore unique in their generalized K\"ahler class. We show that the generalized K\"ahler-Ricci flow is naturally adapted to this conjecture, and exhibit a number of a priori estimates and monotonicity formulas which suggest global existence and convergence. For initial data in the generalized K\"ahler class of a K\"ahler Calabi-Yau structure we prove the flow exists globally and converges to this unique fixed point. This has applications to understanding the space of generalized K\"ahler structures, and as a special case yields the topological structure of natural classes of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms on hyperK\"ahler manifolds. In the case of commuting-type generalized K\"ahler structures we establish global existence and convergence with arbitrary initial data to a K\"ahler, Calabi-Yau metric, which yields a new $d d^c$-lemma for these structures.</description>

      <title>The short memory limit for long time statistics in a stochastic Coleman-Gurtin model of heat conduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of semi-linear differential Volterra equations with polynomial-type potentials that incorporates the effects of memory while being subjected to random perturbations via an additive Gaussian noise. Our main study is the long time statistics of the system in the singular regime as the memory kernel collapses to a Dirac function. Specifically, we show that provided that sufficiently many directions in the phase space are stochastically forced, there is a unique invariant probability measure to which the system converges, with respect to a suitable Wasserstein-type topology, and at an exponential rate which is independent of the decay rate of the memory kernel. We then prove the convergence of this unique statistically steady state to the unique invariant probability measure of the classical stochastic reaction-diffusion equation in the zero-memory limit. Consequently, we establish the global-in-time validity of the short memory approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mapping properties of a large class of elliptic operators $P_T$ in gluing problems where two non-compact manifolds with asymptotically cylindrical geometry are glued along a neck of length $2T$. In the limit where $T \rightarrow \infty$, we reduce the question of constructing approximate solutions of $P_T u = f$ to a finite-dimensional linear system, and provide a geometric interpretation of the obstructions to solving this system. Under some assumptions on the real roots of the model operator $P_0$ on the cylinder, we construct a Fredholm inverse for $P_T$ with good control on the growth of its norm. As applications of our method, we study the decay rate and density of the low eigenvalues of the Laplacian acting on differential forms, and give improved estimates for compact $G_2$-manifolds constructed by twisted connected sum. We relate our results to the swampland distance conjectures in physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07146v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study analytically the dynamics of a $d$-dimensional Klein-Gordon lattice with periodic boundary conditions, for $d \leq 3$. We consider initial data supported on one low-frequency Fourier mode. We show that, in the continuous approximation, the resonant normal form of the system is given by a small-dispersion nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. By exploiting a result about the growth of Sobolev norms for solutions of small-dispersion NLS, we are able to describe an energy cascade phenomenon for the Klein-Gordon lattice, where part of the energy is transferred to modes associated to higher frequencies. Such phenomenon holds within the time-scale for which we can ensure the validity of the continuous approximation.</description>
