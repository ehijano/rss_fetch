      <title>Understanding solid nitrogen through machine learning simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a fast, transferable, general purpose, machine-learning interatomic potential suitable for large-scale simulations of $N_2$. The potential is trained only on high quality quantum chemical molecule-molecule interactions, no condensed phase information is used. The potential reproduces the experimental phase diagram including the melt curve and the molecular solid phases of nitrogen up to 10 GPa. This demonstrates that many-molecule interactions are unnecessary to explain the condensed phases of $N_2$. With increased pressure, transitions are observed from cubic ($\alpha-N_2$), which optimises quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, through tetragonal ($\gamma-N_2$) which allows more efficient packing, through to monoclinic ($\lambda-N_2$) which packs still more efficiently. On heating, we obtain the hcp 3D rotor phase ($\beta-N_2$) and, at pressure, the cubic $\delta-N_2$ phase which contains both 3D and 2D rotors, tetragonal $\delta^\star-N_2$ phase with 2D rotors and the rhombohedral $\epsilon-N_2$. Molecular dynamics demonstrates where these phases are indeed rotors, rather than frustrated order. The model does not support the existence of the wide range of bondlengths reported for the complex $\iota-N_2$ phase. The thermodynamic transitions involve both shifts of molecular centres and rotations of molecules. We simulate these phase transitions between finding that the onset of rotation is rapid whereas motion of molecular centres is inhibited and the cause of the observed sluggishness of transitions. Routine density functional theory calculations give a similar picture to the potential.</description>

      <title>Temperature and Solvent Viscosity Tune the Intermediates During the Collapse of a Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamics of a polymer chain in solution gets significantly affected by the temperature and the frictional forces arising due to solvent viscosity. Here, using an explicit solvent framework for polymer simulation with the liberty to tune the solvent viscosity, we study the nonequilibrium dynamics of a flexible homopolymer when it is suddenly quenched from an extended coil state in good solvent to poor solvent conditions. Results from our extensive simulations reveal that depending on the temperature $T$ and solvent viscosity, one encounters long-lived sausage-like intermediates following the usual pearl-necklace intermediates. Use of shape factors of polymers allows us to disentangle these two distinct stages of the overall collapse process, and the corresponding relaxation times. The relaxation time $\tau_s$ of the sausage stage, which is the rate-limiting stage of the overall collapse process, follows an anti-Arrhenius behavior in the high-$T$ limit, and the Arrhenius behavior in the low-$T$ limit. Furthermore, the variation of $\tau_s$ with the solvent viscosity provides evidence of internal friction of the polymer, that modulates the overall collapse significantly, analogous to what is observed for relaxation rates of proteins during their folding. This suggests that the origin of internal friction in proteins is plausibly intrinsic to its polymeric backbone rather than other specifications.</description>

      <title>Comparison of two different integration methods for the (1+1)-Dimensional Schro\"odinger-Poisson Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare two different numerical methods to integrate in time spatially delocalized initial densities using the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation system as the evolution law. The basic equation is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with an auto-gravitating potential created by the wave function density itself. The latter is determined as a solution of Poisson's equation modelling, e.g., non-relativistic gravity. For reasons of complexity, we treat a one-dimensional version of the problem whose numerical integration is still challenging because of the extreme long-range forces (being constant in the asymptotic limit). Both of our methods, a Strang splitting scheme and a basis function approach using B-splines, are compared in numerical convergence and effectivity. Overall, our Strang-splitting evolution compares favourably with the B-spline method. In particular, by using an adaptive time-stepper rather large one-dimensional boxes can be treated. These results give hope for extensions to two spatial dimensions for not too small boxes and large evolution times necessary for describing, for instance, dark matter formation over cosmologically relevant scales.</description>

      <title>Computation of some dispersive equations through their iterated linearisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often the case that, while the numerical solution of the non-linear dispersive equation $\mathrm{i}\partial_t u(t)=\mathcal{H}(u(t),t)u(t)$ represents a formidable challenge, it is fairly easy and cheap to solve closely related linear equations of the form $\mathrm{i}\partial_t u(t)=\mathcal{H}_1(t)u(t)+\widetilde{\mathcal H}_2(t)u(t)$, where $\mathcal{H}_1(t)+\mathcal{H}_2(v,t)=\mathcal{H}(v,t)$. In that case we advocate an iterative linearisation procedure that involves fixed-point iteration of the latter equation to solve the former. A typical case is when the original problem is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger or Gross--Pitaevskii equation, while the `easy' equation is linear Schr\"odinger with time-dependent potential.
  We analyse in detail the iterative scheme and its practical implementation, prove that each iteration increases the order, derive upper bounds on the speed of convergence and discuss in the case of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with cubic potential the preservation of structural features of the underlying equation: the $\mathrm{L}_2$ norm, momentum and Hamiltonian energy. A key ingredient in our approach is the use of the Magnus expansion in conjunction with Hermite quadratures, which allows effective solutions of the linearised but non-autonomous equations in an iterative fashion. The resulting Magnus--Hermite methods can be combined with a wide range of numerical approximations to the matrix exponential. The paper concludes with a number of numerical experiments, demonstrating the power of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Accurate estimation of the normalized mutual information of multidimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the linear Pearson correlation coefficient represents a well-established normalized measure to quantify the interrelation of two stochastic variables $X$ and $Y$, it fails for multidimensional variables such as Cartesian coordinates. Avoiding any assumption about the underlying data, the mutual information $I(X, Y)$ does account for multidimensional correlations. However, unlike the normalized Pearson correlation, it has no upper bound ($I \in [0, \infty)$), i.e., it is not clear if say, $I = 0.4$ corresponds to a low or a high correlation. Moreover, the mutual information (MI) involves the estimation of high-dimensional probability densities (e.g., six-dimensional for Cartesian coordinates), which requires a k-nearest neighbor algorithm, such as the estimator by Kraskov et al. [Phys. Rev. E 69, 066138 (2004)]. As existing methods to normalize the MI cannot be used in connection with this estimator, a new approach is presented, which uses an entropy estimation method that is invariant under variable transformations. The algorithm is numerically efficient and does not require more effort than the calculation of the (un-normalized) MI. After validating the method by applying it to various toy models, the normalized MI between the $C_{\alpha}$ -coordinates of T4 lysozyme is considered and compared to a correlation analysis of inter-residue contacts.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of the self-similar supersonic Marshak wave problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the similarity solutions for the Marshak wave problem, in the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) diffusion approximation and in the supersonic regime. Self-similar solutions exist for a temporal power law surface temperature drive and a material model with power law temperature dependent opacity and energy density. The properties of the solutions in both linear and nonlinear conduction regimes are studied as a function of the temporal drive, opacity and energy density exponents. We show that there exists a range of the temporal exponent for which the total energy in the system decreases, and the solution has a local maxima. For nonlinear conduction, we specify the conditions on the opacity and energy density exponents under which the heat front is linear or even flat, and does posses its common sharp character; this character is independent of the drive exponent. We specify the values of the temporal exponents for which analytical solutions exist and employ the Hammer-Rosen perturbation theory to obtain highly accurate approximate solutions, which are parameterized using only two numerically fitted quantities. The solutions are used to construct a set of benchmarks for supersonic LTE radiative heat transfer, including some with unusual and interesting properties such as local maxima and non sharp fronts. The solutions are compared in detail to implicit Monte-Carlo and discrete-ordinate transport simulations as well gray diffusion simulations, showing a good agreement, which highlights their usefulness as a verification test problem for radiative transfer simulations.</description>

      <title>Spatial distribution of local elastic moduli in nanocrystalline metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elastoplastic properties of nanocrystalline metals are non-uniform on the scale of the grain size, and this non-uniformity affects macroscopic quantities as, in these systems, a significant part of the material is at or adjacent to a grain boundary.
  We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the spatial distributions of local elastic moduli in nano-grained pure metals and analyze their dependence on grain size.
  Calculations are performed for copper and tantalum with grain sizes ranging from 5-20nm. Shear modulus distributions for grain and grain-boundary atoms were calculated. It is shown that the non-crystalline grain boundary has a wide shear-modulus distribution, which is grain-size independent, while grains have a peaked distribution, which becomes sharper with increasing grain size. Average elastic moduli of the bulk, grains, and grain boundary are calculated as a function of grain size. The atomistic simulations show that the reduction of total elastic moduli with decreasing grain size is mainly due to a resulting larger grain-boundary atoms fraction, and that the total elastic moduli can be approximated by a simple weighted average of larger grains elastic moduli and a lower grain-boundary elastic moduli.</description>

      <title>Chemistry Beyond Exact Solutions on a Quantum-Centric Supercomputer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A universal quantum computer can be used as a simulator capable of predicting properties of diverse quantum systems. Electronic structure problems in chemistry offer practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. This appears promising since current quantum processors have reached these sizes. However, mapping these use cases onto quantum computers yields deep circuits, and for for pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors, the large number of measurements to estimate molecular energies leads to prohibitive runtimes. As a result, realistic chemistry is out of reach of current quantum computers in isolation. A natural question is whether classical distributed computation can relieve quantum processors from parsing all but a core, intrinsically quantum component of a chemistry workflow. Here, we incorporate quantum computations of chemistry in a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture, using up to 6400 nodes of the supercomputer Fugaku to assist a Heron superconducting quantum processor. We simulate the N$_2$ triple bond breaking in a correlation-consistent cc-pVDZ basis set, and the active-space electronic structure of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, using 58, 45 and 77 qubits respectively, with quantum circuits of up to 10570 (3590 2-qubit) quantum gates. We obtain our results using a class of quantum circuits that approximates molecular eigenstates, and a hybrid estimator. The estimator processes quantum samples, produces upper bounds to the ground-state energy and wavefunctions supported on a polynomial number of states. This guarantees an unconditional quality metric for quantum advantage, certifiable by classical computers at polynomial cost. For current error rates, our results show that classical distributed computing coupled to quantum processors can produce good approximate solutions for practical problems beyond sizes amenable to exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Equivalence analysis between Quasi-coarse-grained and Atomistic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, simulation methods based on the scaling of atomic potential functions, such as quasi-coarse-grained dynamics and coarse-grained dynamics, have shown promising results for modeling crystalline systems at multiple scales. However, this letter presents evidence suggesting that the spatiotemporal trajectories of coarse-grained systems generated by such simulation methods exhibit a complete correspondence with those of specific molecular dynamics systems. In essence, current coarse-grained simulation methods involve a direct amplification of the results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations across spatial and temporal scales, yet they may lack the capability to adequately capture authentic scale effects. Consequently, the findings of related studies warrant careful re-evaluation. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of not only verifying the consistency of mesoscale simulation methods with microscopic simulations but also meticulously assessing their capability to accurately forecast mesoscale physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems in Structured Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity quantum materials combine the rich many-body physics of condensed matter systems with strong coupling to the surrounding electromagnetic field, which presents both novel prospects and intricate challenges. One is often interested in the properties of one specific aspect of the material, e.g. the electronic many-body dynamics, subject to a structured bath of phononic and photonic modes. Open quantum systems featuring non-Markovian dynamics are routinely solved using techniques such as the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) but their usage of the system density-matrix renders them intractable for many-body systems. Here, we combine the HEOM with the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy to reach a consistent and rigorous description of open many-body systems and their quantum dynamics. We demonstrate first the strength and limitations of this stacked hierarchy for superradiant emission and spin-squeezing of established quantum optical models before presenting its full potential for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we explicitly simulate the impact of charge noise on the dynamic of the Fermi-Hubbard model subject to a structured bath comprising cavity and vibro-phononic environment. Strong optical coupling not only modifies the dynamic of the many-body system but serves furthermore as measurement channel providing information about the correlated motion imprinted by charge noise. Our work establishes an accessible, yet rigorous, route between condensed matter and quantum optics, fostering the growth of a new domain at their interface.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based variational autoencoder for classification of quantum and classical states of light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in optical quantum technologies have been enabled by the generation, manipulation, and characterization of light, with identification based on its photon statistics. However, characterizing light and its sources through single photon measurements often requires efficient detectors and longer measurement times to obtain high-quality photon statistics. Here we introduce a deep learning-based variational autoencoder (VAE) method for classifying single photon added coherent state (SPACS), single photon added thermal state (SPACS), mixed states between coherent/SPACS and thermal/SPATS of light. Our semisupervised learning-based VAE efficiently maps the photon statistics features of light to a lower dimension, enabling quasi-instantaneous classification with low average photon counts. The proposed VAE method is robust and maintains classification accuracy in the presence of losses inherent in an experiment, such as finite collection efficiency, non-unity quantum efficiency, finite number of detectors, etc. Additionally, leveraging the transfer learning capabilities of VAE enables successful classification of data of any quality using a single trained model. We envision that such a deep learning methodology will enable better classification of quantum light and light sources even in the presence of poor detection quality.</description>

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have attracted intense interest worldwide as they offer several routes to design materials with novel features wide-ranging applications. Unfortunately, at present, vdW heterostructures are restricted to a small number of stackable layers, due to the weak vdW forces holding adjacent layers together. In this work, we report on computational studies of a bulk vdW material consisting of alternating TiS2 and TiSe2 (TSS) vertically arranged layers as a potential candidate for anode applications. We use density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to explore the effect of high entropy on several electrochemically relevant properties of the bulk heterostructure (TSS-HS) by substituting Mo6+ and Al3+ at the transition metal site (Ti4+). We also study the solvation shell formation at the electrode-electrolyte interface (EEI) using AIMD to determine Li-coordination. Based on the properties computed using DFT and AIMD we propose that high entropy TSS-HS (TSS-HE) might possess improved electrochemical performance over standard TSS-HS. Factors that could improve the performance of TSS-HE are 1) Less structural deformation, 2) Strong bonding (Metal-O), 3) Better electron mobility, 4) Higher theoretical specific capacity, 5) Wider operational voltage window, and 6) Faster Li-ion diffusion. Our observations suggests that 'high entropy' can be an effective strategy to design new anode materials for improving electrochemical performance of Li-ion batteries.</description>

Abstract: The evaluation of new computing languages for a large community, like HEP, involves comparison of many aspects of the languages' behaviour, ecosystem and interactions with other languages. In this paper we compare a number of languages using a common, yet non-trivial, HEP algorithm: the \akt\ clustering algorithm used for jet finding. We compare specifically the algorithm implemented in Python (pure Python and accelerated with numpy and numba), and Julia, with respect to the reference implementation in C++, from Fastjet. As well as the speed of the implementation we describe the ergonomics of the language for the coder, as well as the efforts required to achieve the best performance, which can directly impact on code readability and sustainability.</description>

Abstract: By systematic theoretical calculations, we have revealed an excitonic insulator (EI) in a van der Waals (vdW) layered compound Ta2Pd3Te5. The interlayer binding energy in the vdW layered compound is 19.6 meV/$\unicode{x212B}$$^2$. The computed phonon spectrum suggests that the monolayer is dynamically stable without lattice distortion. The monolayer can be obtained by exfoliation or molecular-beam epitaxy. First-principles calculations show that the monolayer is a nearly zero-gap semiconductor with the modified Becke-Johnson functional. Due to the like symmetry of the band-edge states, the 2D polarization $\alpha_{2D}$ would be finite as the band gap goes to zero, allowing for the EI state in the compound. Using the first-principles many-body perturbation theory, the $GW$-BSE calculation reveals that the exciton binding energy $E_b$ is larger than the single-particle band gap $E_g$, indicating the excitonic instability. Our findings suggest that the Ta2Pd3Te5 monolayer is an excitonic insulator without structural distortion.</description>

      <title>Core performance predictions in projected SPARC first-campaign plasmas with nonlinear CGYRO</title>

Abstract: This work characterizes the core transport physics of SPARC early-campaign plasmas using the PORTALS-CGYRO framework. Empirical modeling of SPARC plasmas with L-mode confinement indicates an ample window of breakeven (Q&gt;1) without the need of H-mode operation. Extensive modeling of multi-channel (electron energy, ion energy and electron particle) flux-matched conditions with the nonlinear CGYRO code for turbulent transport coupled to the macroscopic plasma evolution using PORTALS reveal that the maximum fusion performance to be attained will be highly dependent on the near-edge pressure. Stiff core transport conditions are found, particularly when fusion gain approaches unity, and predicted density peaking is found to be in line with empirical databases of particle source-free H-modes. Impurity optimization is identified as a potential avenue to increase fusion performance while enabling core-edge integration. Extensive validation of the quasilinear TGLF model builds confidence in reduced-model predictions. The implications of projecting L-mode performance to high-performance and burning-plasma devices is discussed, together with the importance of predicting edge conditions.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Heating Induced Suppression of $d$-band Dominance in the Electronic Excitation Spectrum of Cuprum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of isochoric heating of solids by free electron lasers (FEL) and in situ diagnostics by X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) allows for measurements of material properties at warm dense matter (WDM) conditions relevant for astrophysics, inertial confinement fusion, and material science. In the case of metals, the FEL beam pumps energy directly into electrons with the lattice structure of ions being nearly unaffected. This leads to a unique transient state that gives rise to a set of interesting physical effects, which can serve as a reliable testing platform for WDM theories. In this work, we present extensive linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) results for the electronic dynamic structure factor of isochorically heated copper with a face-centered cubic lattice. At ambient conditions, the plasmon is heavily damped due to the presence of $d$-band excitations, and its position is independent of the wavenumber. In contrast, the plasmon feature starts to dominate the excitation spectrum and has a Bohm-Gross type plasmon dispersion for temperatures $T \geq 4~{\rm eV}$, where the quasi-free electrons in the interstitial region are in the WDM regime. In addition, we analyze the thermal changes in the $d$-band excitations and outline the possibility to use future XRTS measurements of isochorically heated copper as a controlled testbed for WDM theories.</description>

      <title>Better Optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers by combining the Unitary Block Optimization Scheme with Classical Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) are a promising approach for finding the classically intractable ground state of a Hamiltonian. The Unitary Block Optimization Scheme (UBOS) is a state-of-the-art VQE method which works by sweeping over gates and finding optimal parameters for each gate in the environment of other gates. UBOS improves the convergence time to the ground state by an order of magnitude over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It nonetheless suffers in both rate of convergence and final converged energies in the face of highly noisy expectation values coming from shot noise. Here we develop two classical post-processing techniques which improve UBOS especially when measurements have large noise. Using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), we generate artificial augmented data using original data from the quantum computer to reduce the overall error when solving for the improved parameters. Using Double Robust Optimization plus Rejection (DROPR), we prevent outlying data which are atypically noisy from resulting in a particularly erroneous single optimization step thereby increasing robustness against noisy measurements. Combining these techniques further reduces the final relative error that UBOS reaches by a factor of three without adding additional quantum measurement or sampling overhead. This work further demonstrates that developing techniques which use classical resources to post-process quantum measurement results can significantly improve VQE algorithms.</description>
