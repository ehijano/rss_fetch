      <title>Improving spliced alignment by modeling splice sites with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Spliced alignment refers to the alignment of messenger RNA (mRNA) or protein sequences to eukaryotic genomes. It plays a critical role in gene annotation and the study of gene functions. Accurate spliced alignment demands sophisticated modeling of splice sites, but current aligners use simple models, which may affect their accuracy given dissimilar sequences.
  Results: We implemented minisplice to learn splice signals with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and trained a model with 7,026 parameters for vertebrate and insect genomes. It captures conserved splice signals across phyla and reveals GC-rich introns specific to mammals and birds. We used this model to estimate the empirical splicing probability for every GT and AG in genomes, and modified minimap2 and miniprot to leverage pre-computed splicing probability during alignment. Evaluation on human long-read RNA-seq data and cross-species protein datasets showed our method greatly improves the junction accuracy especially for noisy long RNA-seq reads and proteins of distant homology.

      <title>PhenoKG: Knowledge Graph-Driven Gene Discovery and Patient Insights from Phenotypes Alone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying causative genes from patient phenotypes remains a significant challenge in precision medicine, with important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders. We propose a novel graph-based approach for predicting causative genes from patient phenotypes, with or without an available list of candidate genes, by integrating a rare disease knowledge graph (KG). Our model, combining graph neural networks and transformers, achieves substantial improvements over the current state-of-the-art. On the real-world MyGene2 dataset, it attains a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 24.64\% and nDCG@100 of 33.64\%, surpassing the best baseline (SHEPHERD) at 19.02\% MRR and 30.54\% nDCG@100. We perform extensive ablation studies to validate the contribution of each model component. Notably, the approach generalizes to cases where only phenotypic data are available, addressing key challenges in clinical decision support when genomic information is incomplete.</description>

      <title>LapDDPM: A Conditional Graph Diffusion Model for scRNA-seq Generation with Spectral Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating high-fidelity and biologically plausible synthetic single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, especially with conditional control, is challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, and complex biological variations. Existing generative models often struggle to capture these unique characteristics and ensure robustness to structural noise in cellular networks. We introduce LapDDPM, a novel conditional Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model for robust and high-fidelity scRNA-seq generation. LapDDPM uniquely integrates graph-based representations with a score-based diffusion model, enhanced by a novel spectral adversarial perturbation mechanism on graph edge weights. Our contributions are threefold: we leverage Laplacian Positional Encodings (LPEs) to enrich the latent space with crucial cellular relationship information; we develop a conditional score-based diffusion model for effective learning and generation from complex scRNA-seq distributions; and we employ a unique spectral adversarial training scheme on graph edge weights, boosting robustness against structural variations. Extensive experiments on diverse scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate LapDDPM's superior performance, achieving high fidelity and generating biologically-plausible, cell-type-specific samples. LapDDPM sets a new benchmark for conditional scRNA-seq data generation, offering a robust tool for various downstream biological applications.</description>

      <title>MLOmics: Cancer Multi-Omics Database for Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Framing the investigation of diverse cancers as a machine learning problem has recently shown significant potential in multi-omics analysis and cancer research. Empowering these successful machine learning models are the high-quality training datasets with sufficient data volume and adequate preprocessing. However, while there exist several public data portals, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multi-omics initiative or open-bases such as the LinkedOmics, these databases are not off-the-shelf for existing machine learning models. In this paper, we introduce MLOmics, an open cancer multi-omics database aiming at serving better the development and evaluation of bioinformatics and machine learning models. MLOmics contains 8,314 patient samples covering all 32 cancer types with four omics types, stratified features, and extensive baselines. Complementary support for downstream analysis and bio-knowledge linking are also included to support interdisciplinary analysis.</description>

      <title>SemanticST: Spatially Informed Semantic Graph Learning for Clustering, Integration, and Scalable Analysis of Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable gene expression profiling with spatial resolution, offering unprecedented insights into tissue organization and disease heterogeneity. However, current analysis methods often struggle with noisy data, limited scalability, and inadequate modelling of complex cellular relationships. We present SemanticST, a biologically informed, graph-based deep learning framework that models diverse cellular contexts through multi-semantic graph construction. SemanticST builds multiple context-specific graphs capturing spatial proximity, gene expression similarity, and tissue domain structure, and learns disentangled embeddings for each. These are fused using an attention-inspired strategy to yield a unified, biologically meaningful representation. A community-aware min-cut loss improves robustness over contrastive learning, particularly in sparse ST data. SemanticST supports mini-batch training, making it the first graph neural network scalable to large-scale datasets such as Xenium (500,000 cells). Benchmarking across four platforms (Visium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq, Xenium) and multiple human and mouse tissues shows consistent 20 percentage gains in ARI, NMI, and trajectory fidelity over DeepST, GraphST, and IRIS. In re-analysis of breast cancer Xenium data, SemanticST revealed rare and clinically significant niches, including triple receptor-positive clusters, spatially distinct DCIS-to-IDC transition zones, and FOXC2 tumour-associated myoepithelial cells, suggesting non-canonical EMT programs with stem-like features. SemanticST thus provides a scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded framework for spatial transcriptomics analysis, enabling robust discovery across tissue types and diseases, and paving the way for spatially resolved tissue atlases and next-generation precision medicine.</description>

      <title>Life-Code: Central Dogma Modeling with Multi-Omics Sequence Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins are fundamental to biological processes, as illustrated by the central dogma of molecular biology. Although modern biological pre-trained models have achieved great success in analyzing these macromolecules individually, their interconnected nature remains underexplored. This paper follows the guidance of the central dogma to redesign both the data and model pipeline and offers a comprehensive framework, Life-Code, that spans different biological functions. As for data flow, we propose a unified pipeline to integrate multi-omics data by reverse-transcribing RNA and reverse-translating amino acids into nucleotide-based sequences. As for the model, we design a codon tokenizer and a hybrid long-sequence architecture to encode the interactions between coding and non-coding regions through masked modeling pre-training. To model the translation and folding process with coding sequences, Life-Code learns protein structures of the corresponding amino acids by knowledge distillation from off-the-shelf protein language models. Such designs enable Life-Code to capture complex interactions within genetic sequences, providing a more comprehensive understanding of multi-omics with the central dogma. Extensive experiments show that Life-Code achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks across three omics, highlighting its potential for advancing multi-omics analysis and interpretation.</description>
