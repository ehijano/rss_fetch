      <title>Comprehensive Measurement of Three-Dimensional Thermal Conductivity Tensor Using a Beam-Offset Square-Pulsed Source (BO-SPS) Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately measuring the three-dimensional thermal conductivity tensor is essential for understanding and engineering the thermal behavior of anisotropic materials. Existing methods often struggle to isolate individual tensor elements, leading to large measurement uncertainties and time-consuming iterative fitting procedures. In this study, we introduce the Beam-Offset Square-Pulsed Source (BO-SPS) method for comprehensive measurements of three-dimensional anisotropic thermal conductivity tensors. This method uses square-pulsed heating and precise temperature rise measurements to achieve high signal-to-noise ratios, even with large beam offsets and low modulation frequencies, enabling the isolation of thermal conductivity tensor elements. We demonstrate and validate the BO-SPS method by measuring X-cut and AT-cut quartz samples. For X-cut quartz, with a known relationship between in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivities, we can determine the full thermal conductivity tensor and heat capacity simultaneously. For AT-cut quartz, assuming a known heat capacity, we can determine the entire anisotropic thermal conductivity tensor, even with finite off-diagonal terms. Our results yield consistent principal thermal conductivity values for both quartz types, demonstrating the method's reliability and accuracy. This research highlights the BO-SPS method's potential to advance the understanding of thermal behavior in complex materials.</description>

      <title>Tuning magnonic devices with on-chip permanent micromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most appealing features of magnonics is the easy tunability of spin-waves propagation via external magnetic fields. Usually this requires bulky and power-hungry electromagnets which are not compatible with device miniaturization. Here we propose a different approach, exploiting the stray field from permanent micromagnets integrated on the same chip of a magnonic wave-guide. In our monolithic device, we employ two SmCo square micromagnets (10x10 $\mu$m$^2$) flanking a CoFeB conduit at different distances from its axis, to produce a tunable transverse bias field between 7.5 and 3.0 mT in the conduit region between the magnets. Spin waves excited by an antenna just outside the region between the magnets enter a region with a variable higher (lower) effective field when an external bias field is applied parallel (antiparallel) to that from the micromagnets. Consequently, the attenuation length and phase shift of Damon-Eshbach spin waves can be tuned in a wide range by playing with the parallel-antiparallel configuration of the external bias and the distance between SmCo micromagnets and the CoFeB conduit. This work demonstrates the potential of permanent micro-magnets for the realization of low-power, integrated magnonic devices with tunable functionalities.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Nanomechanical Resonators: Sensitivity, Response Time, and Practical Considerations in Photothermal Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanomechanical photothermal sensing has significantly advanced single-molecule/particle microscopy and spectroscopy, and infrared detection through the use of nanomechanical resonators that detect shifts in resonant frequency due to photothermal heating. However, the relationship between resonator design, photothermal sensitivity, and response time remains unclear. This paper compares three resonator types - strings, drumheads, and trampolines - to explore this relationship. Through theoretical modeling, experimental validation, and finite element method simulations, we find that strings offer the highest sensitivity (with a noise equivalent power of 280 fW/Hz$^{1/2}$ for strings made of silicon nitride), while drumheads exhibit the fastest thermal response. The study reveals that photothermal sensitivity correlates with the average temperature rise and not the peak temperature. Finally, the impact of photothermal back-action is discussed, which can be a major source of frequency instability. This work clarifies the performance differences and limits among resonator designs and guides the development of advanced nanomechanical photothermal sensors, benefiting a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Calibrated absolute optical contrast for high-throughput characterization of horizontally aligned carbon nanotube arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horizontally aligned carbon nanotube (HACNT) arrays hold significant potential for various applications in nanoelectronics and material science. However, their high-throughput characterization remains challenging due to the lack of methods with both high efficiency and high accuracy. Here, we present a novel technique, Calibrated Absolute Optical Contrast (CAOC), achieved through the implementation of differential principles to filter out stray signals and high-resolution calibration to endow optical contrast with physical significance. CAOC offers major advantages over previous characterization techniques, providing consistent and reliable measurements of HACNT array density with high throughput and non-destructive assessment. To validate its utility, we demonstrate wafer-scale uniformity assessment by rapid density mapping. This technique not only facilitates the practical evaluation of HACNT arrays but also provides insights into balancing high throughput and high resolution in nanomaterial characterization.</description>

      <title>Training of Physical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical neural networks (PNNs) are a class of neural-like networks that leverage the properties of physical systems to perform computation. While PNNs are so far a niche research area with small-scale laboratory demonstrations, they are arguably one of the most underappreciated important opportunities in modern AI. Could we train AI models 1000x larger than current ones? Could we do this and also have them perform inference locally and privately on edge devices, such as smartphones or sensors? Research over the past few years has shown that the answer to all these questions is likely "yes, with enough research": PNNs could one day radically change what is possible and practical for AI systems. To do this will however require rethinking both how AI models work, and how they are trained - primarily by considering the problems through the constraints of the underlying hardware physics. To train PNNs at large scale, many methods including backpropagation-based and backpropagation-free approaches are now being explored. These methods have various trade-offs, and so far no method has been shown to scale to the same scale and performance as the backpropagation algorithm widely used in deep learning today. However, this is rapidly changing, and a diverse ecosystem of training techniques provides clues for how PNNs may one day be utilized to create both more efficient realizations of current-scale AI models, and to enable unprecedented-scale models.</description>

      <title>Construction and Observation of Flexibly Controllable High-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Skin Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is one of the most fundamental phenomena in non-Hermitian physics. Although it is established that one-dimensional NHSE originates from the nontrivial spectral winding topology, the topological origin behind the higher-dimensional NHSE remains unclear so far. This poses a substantial challenge in constructing and manipulating high-dimensional NHSEs. Here, an intuitive bottom-to-top scheme to construct high-dimensional NHSEs is proposed, through assembling multiple independent one-dimensional NHSEs. Not only the elusive high-dimensional NHSEs can be effectively predicted from the well-defined one-dimensional spectral winding topologies, but also the high-dimensional generalized Brillouin zones can be directly synthesized from the one-dimensional counterparts. As examples, two two-dimensional nonreciprocal acoustic metamaterials are experimentally implemented to demonstrate highly controllable multi-polar NHSEs and hybrid skin-topological effects, where the sound fields can be frequency-selectively localized at any desired corners and boundaries. These results offer a practicable strategy for engineering high-dimensional NHSEs, which could boost advanced applications such as selective filters and directional amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Skeletal Density Measurements for Adsorbent Nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their tunable material properties, sorptive materials have a wide range of applications in energy storage, water treatment, carbon capture, analytical chemistry, and more. One crucial factor in determining the effectiveness of such materials is their skeletal density, or "true density" because it is often used to calculate key metrics, such as storage capacities. In this paper, we present skeletal density measurements through helium pycnometry for several types of adsorbent carbon materials derived from either corncob, sawdust, coffee grounds, polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), graphitic carbon nitride (GCN), or metal organic frameworks (MOFs). The measured skeletal density of sawdust-based activated carbon was 2.02 +/- 0.05 g/$cm^{ 3}$. The measured skeletal density of coffee-based activated carbon was 2.23 +/- 0.06 $cm^{ 3}$. We also expound upon the impact that skeletal density has upon hydrogen excess adsorption measurements and other calculated engineering quantities. If a skeletal density is underestimated by 10%, it can affect the room temperature excess adsorption by at least 5% at 100 bar and by 7% at 200 bar, depending on the material type.</description>

      <title>Changes in boiling controlled by molar concentration-dependent diffusion of surfactants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boiling is a prevalent phase-change process that plays a vital role in facilitating efficient heat transfer from a heating surface. While this heat transfer mechanism is generally effective, a rapid increase in surface temperature can lead to hydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in a boiling crisis. Previous studies have shown that surfactants often improve boiling performance and change the boiling crisis behavior. Conventional wisdom in this field attributes that these changes in boiling behavior are tied to the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the particular surfactant. However, our work reveals that these changes in boiling behavior are independent of the CMC for three nonionic surfactants across a wide range of molar concentrations. In addition, visual snapshots of the bubbling behavior indicate changes in bubble formation, such as bubble size and nucleation site density, influenced by the molar concentration-dependent diffusion timescale of surfactants. Hence, these findings offer compelling evidence that boiling behavior, encompassing both boiling performance and boiling crisis, is governed by the dynamic adsorption of surfactants rather than dictated by the CMC. This becomes evident when quantifying the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat flux (CHF) using the logarithm of molar concentration, as predicted by theory. Building upon these findings, we propose insights for controlling when CHF modification occurs in specific scenarios involving any surfactants. These insights hold significant potential for optimizing heat transfer processes and leveraging surfactants in energy-related applications to maximize boiling efficiency.</description>

      <title>Leveraging KANs For Enhanced Deep Koopman Operator Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP's) have been extensively utilized in discovering Deep Koopman operators for linearizing nonlinear dynamics. With the emergence of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as a more efficient and accurate alternative to the MLP Neural Network, we propose a comparison of the performance of each network type in the context of learning Koopman operators with control.In this work, we propose a KANs-based deep Koopman framework with applications to an orbital Two-Body Problem (2BP) and the pendulum for data-driven discovery of linear system dynamics. KANs were found to be superior in nearly all aspects of training; learning 31 times faster, being 15 times more parameter efficiency, and predicting 1.25 times more accurately as compared to the MLP Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the case of the 2BP. Thus, KANs shows potential for being an efficient tool in the development of Deep Koopman Theory.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency microwave photodetection by cavity coupled double dots with single cavity-photon sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a superconducting cavity-coupled double quantum dot (DQD) photodiode that achieves a maximum photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 25% in the microwave domain. With a higher-quality-factor cavity and improved device design to prevent photon leakages through unwanted pathways, our device measures microwave signals down to 100 aW power level and achieves sensitivity to probe microwave signals with one photon at a time in the cavity. We analyze the photodiode operation using Jaynes-Cummings input-output theory, identifying the key improvements of stronger cavity-DQD coupling needed to achieve near-unity photodetection efficiency. The results presented in this work represent a crucial advancement toward near unity microwave photodetection efficiency with single cavity-photon sensitivity for studies of photon statistics in the microwave range and applications related to quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Fully printed flexible perovskite solar modules with improved energy alignment by tin oxide surface modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully printed flexible perovskite solar cells (f-PSCs) show great potential for the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics owing to their compatibility with high-throughput roll-to-roll (R2R) production. However, the challenge remains in the deficiency in controlling interfacial recombination losses of the functional layer, causing remarkable loss of power conversion efficiency (PCE) in industrial production. Here, a fullerene-substituted alkylphosphonic acid dipole layer is introduced between the R2R-printed tin oxide electron transport layer and the perovskite active layer to reduce the energetic barrier and to suppress surface recombination at the buried interface. The resulting f-PSCs exhibit a PCE of 17.0% with negligible hysteresis, retain 95% of their initial PCE over 3000 bending cycles and achieve a T95 lifetime of 1200 h under 1 sun and 65 degreeC in nitrogen atmosphere. Moreover, the fully printed flexible perovskite solar mini-modules (f-PSMs) with a 20.25 cm2 aperture area achieve a PCE of 11.6%. The encapsulated f-PSMs retain 90% of their initial PCE after 500 h damp-heat testing at 65 degreeC and 85% relative humidity (ISOS-D3). This work marks an important progress toward the realization of efficient and stable flexible perovskite photovoltaics for commercialization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing demand for quantum computing across various sectors, including finance, materials and studying chemical reactions. A promising implementation involves semiconductor qubits utilizing quantum dots within transistors. While academic research labs currently produce their own devices, scaling this process is challenging, requires expertise, and results in devices of varying quality. Some initiatives are exploring the use of commercial transistors, offering scalability, improved quality, affordability, and accessibility for researchers. This paper delves into potential realizations and the feasibility of employing off-the-shelf commercial devices for qubits. It addresses challenges such as noise, coherence, limited customizability in large industrial fabs, and scalability issues. The exploration includes discussions on potential manufacturing approaches for early versions of small qubit chips. The use of state-of-the-art transistors as hosts for quantum dots, incorporating readout techniques based on charge sensing or reflectometry, and methods like electron shuttling for qubit connectivity are examined. Additionally, more advanced designs, including 2D arrays and crossbar or DRAM-like access arrays, are considered for the path toward accessible quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Novel functions in silicon photonic chips incorporated with graphene oxide thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-chip integration of two-dimensional (2D) materials with unique structures and distinctive properties endow integrated devices with new functionalities and improved performance. With a high flexibility in modifying its properties and a strong compatibility with various integrated platforms, graphene oxide (GO) becomes an attractive 2D material for implementing functional hybrid integrated devices. Here, we demonstrate novel functionalities that go beyond the capabilities of conventional photonic integrated circuits, by harnessing the photo-thermal effects in 2D GO films integrated onto them. These include all-optical control and switching, optical power limiting, and non-reciprocal light transmission. The 2D layered GO films are on-chip integrated with precise control of their thicknesses and sizes. Benefitting from the broadband response of 2D GO films, all the three functionalities feature a very wide operational bandwidth. By fitting the experimental results with theory, we also extract the changes in material properties induced by the photo-thermal effects, which reveal interesting insights about 2D GO films. These results highlight the versatility of 2D GO films in implementing functional integrated photonic devices for a range of applications.</description>

      <title>Ferri-ionic Coupling in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ Nanoflakes: Polarization States and Controllable Negative Capacitance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$ covered by an ionic surface charge and reveal the appearance of polar states with relatively high polarization ~5 microC/cm$^2$ and stored free charge ~10 microC/cm$%2$, which can mimic "mid-gap" states associated with a surface field-induced transfer of Cu and/or In ions in the van der Waals gap. The change in the ionic screening degree and mismatch strains induce a broad range of the transitions between paraelectric phase, antiferroelectric, ferrielectric, and ferri-ionic states in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. The states' stability and/or metastability is determined by the minimum of the system free energy consisting of electrostatic energy, elastic energy, and a Landau-type four-well potential of the ferrielectric dipole polarization. The possibility to govern the transitions by strain and ionic screening can be useful for controlling the tunneling barrier in thin film devices based on CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. Also, we predict that the CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes reveal features of the controllable negative capacitance effect, which make them attractive for advanced electronic devices, such as nano-capacitors and gate oxide nanomaterials with reduced heat dissipation.</description>
