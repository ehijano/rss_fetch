      <title>Principal stratification with U-statistics under principal ignorability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Principal stratification is a popular framework for causal inference in the presence of an intermediate outcome. While the principal average treatment effects have traditionally been the default target of inference, it may not be sufficient when the interest lies in the relative favorability of one potential outcome over the other within the principal stratum. We thus introduce the principal generalized causal effect estimands, which extend the principal average causal effects to accommodate nonlinear contrast functions. Under principal ignorability, we expand the theoretical results in Jiang et. al. (2022) to a much wider class of causal estimands in the presence of a binary intermediate variable. We develop identification formulas and derive the efficient influence functions of the generalized estimands for principal stratification analyses. These efficient influence functions motivate a set of multiply robust estimators and lay the ground for obtaining efficient debiased machine learning estimators via cross-fitting based on $U$-statistics. The proposed methods are illustrated through simulations and the analysis of a data example.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Events Modeling Based on a Reflected Brownian Motion with Application to Hypoglycemia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patients with type 2 diabetes need to closely monitor blood sugar levels as their routine diabetes self-management. Although many treatment agents aim to tightly control blood sugar, hypoglycemia often stands as an adverse event. In practice, patients can observe hypoglycemic events more easily than hyperglycemic events due to the perception of neurogenic symptoms. We propose to model each patient's observed hypoglycemic event as a lower-boundary crossing event for a reflected Brownian motion with an upper reflection barrier. The lower-boundary is set by clinical standards. To capture patient heterogeneity and within-patient dependence, covariates and a patient level frailty are incorporated into the volatility and the upper reflection barrier. This framework provides quantification for the underlying glucose level variability, patients heterogeneity, and risk factors' impact on glucose. We make inferences based on a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Two model comparison criteria, the Deviance Information Criterion and the Logarithm of the Pseudo-Marginal Likelihood, are used for model selection. The methodology is validated in simulation studies. In analyzing a dataset from the diabetic patients in the DURABLE trial, our model provides adequate fit, generates data similar to the observed data, and offers insights that could be missed by other models.</description>

      <title>A Bayes Factor Framework for Unified Parameter Estimation and Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bayes factor, the data-based updating factor of the prior to posterior odds of two hypotheses, is a natural measure of statistical evidence for one hypothesis over the other. We show how Bayes factors can also be used for parameter estimation. The key idea is to consider the Bayes factor as a function of the parameter value under the null hypothesis. This 'Bayes factor function' is inverted to obtain point estimates ('maximum evidence estimates') and interval estimates ('support intervals'), similar to how P-value functions are inverted to obtain point estimates and confidence intervals. This provides data analysts with a unified inference framework as Bayes factors (for any tested parameter value), support intervals (at any level), and point estimates can be easily read off from a plot of the Bayes factor function. This approach shares similarities but is also distinct from conventional Bayesian and frequentist approaches: It uses the Bayesian evidence calculus, but without synthesizing data and prior, and it defines statistical evidence in terms of (integrated) likelihood ratios, but also includes a natural way for dealing with nuisance parameters. Applications to real-world examples illustrate how our framework is of practical value for making make quantitative inferences.</description>

      <title>Shrinkage for Extreme Partial Least-Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on dimension-reduction techniques for modelling conditional extreme values. Specifically, we investigate the idea that extreme values of a response variable can be explained by nonlinear functions derived from linear projections of an input random vector. In this context, the estimation of projection directions is examined, as approached by the Extreme Partial Least Squares (EPLS) method--an adaptation of the original Partial Least Squares (PLS) method tailored to the extreme-value framework. Further, a novel interpretation of EPLS directions as maximum likelihood estimators is introduced, utilizing the von Mises-Fisher distribution applied to hyperballs. The dimension reduction process is enhanced through the Bayesian paradigm, enabling the incorporation of prior information into the projection direction estimation. The maximum a posteriori estimator is derived in two specific cases, elucidating it as a regularization or shrinkage of the EPLS estimator. We also establish its asymptotic behavior as the sample size approaches infinity. A simulation data study is conducted in order to assess the practical utility of our proposed method. This clearly demonstrates its effectiveness even in moderate data problems within high-dimensional settings. Furthermore, we provide an illustrative example of the method's applicability using French farm income data, highlighting its efficacy in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Extremal graphical modeling with latent variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremal graphical models encode the conditional independence structure of multivariate extremes and provide a powerful tool for quantifying the risk of rare events. Prior work on learning these graphs from data has focused on the setting where all relevant variables are observed. For the popular class of H\"usler-Reiss models, we propose the \texttt{eglatent} method, a tractable convex program for learning extremal graphical models in the presence of latent variables. Our approach decomposes the H\"usler-Reiss precision matrix into a sparse component encoding the graphical structure among the observed variables after conditioning on the latent variables, and a low-rank component encoding the effect of a few latent variables on the observed variables. We provide finite-sample guarantees of \texttt{eglatent} and show that it consistently recovers the conditional graph as well as the number of latent variables. We highlight the improved performances of our approach on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Sophisticated and small versus simple and sizeable: When does it pay off to introduce drifting coefficients in Bayesian VARs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.00564v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess the relationship between model size and complexity in the time-varying parameter VAR framework via thorough predictive exercises for the Euro Area, the United Kingdom and the United States. It turns out that sophisticated dynamics through drifting coefficients are important in small data sets, while simpler models tend to perform better in sizeable data sets. To combine the best of both worlds, novel shrinkage priors help to mitigate the curse of dimensionality, resulting in competitive forecasts for all scenarios considered. Furthermore, we discuss dynamic model selection to improve upon the best performing individual model for each point in time.</description>

      <title>Trend and Variance Adaptive Bayesian Changepoint Analysis &amp; Local Outlier Scoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.09437v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adaptively estimate both changepoints and local outlier processes in a Bayesian dynamic linear model with global-local shrinkage priors in a novel model we call Adaptive Bayesian Changepoints with Outliers (ABCO). We utilize a state-space approach to identify a dynamic signal in the presence of outliers and measurement error with stochastic volatility. We find that global state equation parameters are inadequate for most real applications and we include local parameters to track noise at each time-step. This setup provides a flexible framework to detect unspecified changepoints in complex series, such as those with large interruptions in local trends, with robustness to outliers and heteroskedastic noise. Finally, we compare our algorithm against several alternatives to demonstrate its efficacy in diverse simulation scenarios and two empirical examples on the U.S. economy.</description>

      <title>Reweighting the RCT for generalization: finite sample error and variable selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07614v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) may suffer from limited scope. In particular, samples may be unrepresentative: some RCTs over- or under- sample individuals with certain characteristics compared to the target population, for which one wants conclusions on treatment effectiveness. Re-weighting trial individuals to match the target population can improve the treatment effect estimation. In this work, we establish the exact expressions of the bias and variance of such reweighting procedures -- also called Inverse Propensity of Sampling Weighting (IPSW) -- in presence of categorical covariates for any sample size. Such results allow us to compare the theoretical performance of different versions of IPSW estimates. Besides, our results show how the performance (bias, variance, and quadratic risk) of IPSW estimates depends on the two sample sizes (RCT and target population). A by-product of our work is the proof of consistency of IPSW estimates. Results also reveal that IPSW performances are improved when the trial probability to be treated is estimated (rather than using its oracle counterpart). In addition, we study choice of variables: how including covariates that are not necessary for identifiability of the causal effect may impact the asymptotic variance. Including covariates that are shifted between the two samples but not treatment effect modifiers increases the variance while non-shifted but treatment effect modifiers do not. We illustrate all the takeaways in a didactic example, and on a semi-synthetic simulation inspired from critical care medicine.</description>

      <title>The flexible Gumbel distribution: A new model for inference about the mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new unimodal distribution family indexed by the mode and three other parameters is derived from a mixture of a Gumbel distribution for the maximum and a Gumbel distribution for the minimum. Properties of the proposed distribution are explored, including model identifiability and flexibility in capturing heavy-tailed data that exhibit different directions of skewness over a wide range. Both frequentist and Bayesian methods are developed to infer parameters in the new distribution. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate satisfactory performance of both methods. By fitting the proposed model to simulated data and data from an application in hydrology, it is shown that the proposed flexible distribution is especially suitable for data containing extreme values in either direction, with the mode being a location parameter of interest. A regression model concerning the mode of a response given covariates based on the proposed unimodal distribution can be easily formulated, which we apply to data from an application in criminology to reveal interesting data features that are obscured by outliers.</description>

      <title>A non-parametric approach to detect patterns in binary sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many circumstances given an ordered sequence of one or more types of elements/ symbols, the objective is to determine any existence of randomness in occurrence of one of the elements,say type 1 element. Such a method can be useful in determining existence of any non-random pattern in the wins or loses of a player in a series of games played. Existing methods of tests based on total number of runs or tests based on length of longest run (Mosteller (1941)) can be used for testing the null hypothesis of randomness in the entire sequence, and not a specific type of element. Additionally, the Runs Test tends to show results contradictory to the intuition visualised by the graphs of say, win proportions over time due to method used in computation of runs. This paper develops a test approach to address this problem by computing the gaps between two consecutive type 1 elements and thereafter following the idea of "pattern" in occurrence and "directional" trend (increasing, decreasing or constant), employs the use of exact Binomial test, Kenall's Tau and Siegel-Tukey test for scale problem. Further modifications suggested by Jan Vegelius(1982) have been applied in the Siegel Tukey test to adjust for tied ranks and achieve more accurate results. This approach is distribution-free and suitable for small sizes. Also comparisons with the conventional runs test shows the superiority of the proposed approach under the null hypothesis of randomness in the occurrence of type 1 elements.</description>

      <title>A modelling framework for detecting and leveraging node-level information in Bayesian network inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian graphical models are powerful tools to infer complex relationships in high dimension, yet are often fraught with computational and statistical challenges. If exploited in a principled way, the increasing information collected alongside the data of primary interest constitutes an opportunity to mitigate these difficulties by guiding the detection of dependence structures. For instance, gene network inference may be informed by the use of publicly available summary statistics on the regulation of genes by genetic variants. Here we present a novel Gaussian graphical modelling framework to identify and leverage information on the centrality of nodes in conditional independence graphs. Specifically, we consider a fully joint hierarchical model to simultaneously infer (i) sparse precision matrices and (ii) the relevance of node-level information for uncovering the sought-after network structure. We encode such information as candidate auxiliary variables using a spike-and-slab submodel on the propensity of nodes to be hubs, which allows hypothesis-free selection and interpretation of a sparse subset of relevant variables. As efficient exploration of large posterior spaces is needed for real-world applications, we develop a variational expectation conditional maximisation algorithm that scales inference to hundreds of samples, nodes and auxiliary variables. We illustrate and exploit the advantages of our approach in simulations and in a gene network study which identifies hub genes involved in biological pathways relevant to immune-mediated diseases.</description>

      <title>Model-based causal feature selection for general response types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering causal relationships from observational data is a fundamental yet challenging task. Invariant causal prediction (ICP, Peters et al., 2016) is a method for causal feature selection which requires data from heterogeneous settings and exploits that causal models are invariant. ICP has been extended to general additive noise models and to nonparametric settings using conditional independence tests. However, the latter often suffer from low power (or poor type I error control) and additive noise models are not suitable for applications in which the response is not measured on a continuous scale, but reflects categories or counts. Here, we develop transformation-model (TRAM) based ICP, allowing for continuous, categorical, count-type, and uninformatively censored responses (these model classes, generally, do not allow for identifiability when there is no exogenous heterogeneity). As an invariance test, we propose TRAM-GCM based on the expected conditional covariance between environments and score residuals with uniform asymptotic level guarantees. For the special case of linear shift TRAMs, we also consider TRAM-Wald, which tests invariance based on the Wald statistic. We provide an open-source R package 'tramicp' and evaluate our approach on simulated data and in a case study investigating causal features of survival in critically ill patients.</description>

      <title>Spline-Based Multi-State Models for Analyzing Disease Progression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by disease progression-related studies, we propose an estimation method for fitting general non-homogeneous multi-state Markov models. The proposal can handle many types of multi-state processes, with several states and various combinations of observation schemes (e.g., intermittent, exactly observed, censored), and allows for the transition intensities to be flexibly modelled through additive (spline-based) predictors. The algorithm is based on a computationally efficient and stable penalized maximum likelihood estimation approach which exploits the information provided by the analytical Hessian matrix of the model log-likelihood. The proposed modeling framework is employed in case studies that aim at modeling the onset of cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and cognitive decline due to aging, where novel patterns are uncovered. To support applicability and reproducibility, all developed tools are implemented in the R package flexmsm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the \proglang{R} package \pkg{glmmrBase} and an extension \pkg{glmmrOptim}. \pkg{glmmrBase} provides a flexible approach to specifying, fitting, and analysing generalised linear mixed models. We use an object-orientated class system within \proglang{R} to provide methods for a wide range of covariance and mean functions, including specification of non-linear functions of data and parameters, relevant to multiple applications including cluster randomised trials, cohort studies, spatial and spatio-temporal modelling, and split-plot designs. The class generates relevant matrices and statistics and a wide range of methods including full likelihood estimation of generalised linear mixed models using stochastic Maximum Likelihood, Laplace approximation, power calculation, and access to relevant calculations. The class also includes Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulation of random effects, sparse matrix methods, and other functionality to support efficient estimation. The \pkg{glmmrOptim} package implements a set of algorithms to identify c-optimal experimental designs where observations are correlated and can be specified using the generalised linear mixed model classes. Several examples and comparisons to existing packages are provided to illustrate use of the packages.</description>
