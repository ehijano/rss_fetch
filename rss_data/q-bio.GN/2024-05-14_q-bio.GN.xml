      <title>LangCell: Language-Cell Pre-training for Cell Identity Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell identity encompasses various semantic aspects of a cell, including cell type, pathway information, disease information, and more, which are essential for biologists to gain insights into its biological characteristics. Understanding cell identity from the transcriptomic data, such as annotating cell types, have become an important task in bioinformatics. As these semantic aspects are determined by human experts, it is impossible for AI models to effectively carry out cell identity understanding tasks without the supervision signals provided by single-cell and label pairs. The single-cell pre-trained language models (PLMs) currently used for this task are trained only on a single modality, transcriptomics data, lack an understanding of cell identity knowledge. As a result, they have to be fine-tuned for downstream tasks and struggle when lacking labeled data with the desired semantic labels. To address this issue, we propose an innovative solution by constructing a unified representation of single-cell data and natural language during the pre-training phase, allowing the model to directly incorporate insights related to cell identity. More specifically, we introduce \textbf{LangCell}, the first \textbf{Lang}uage-\textbf{Cell} pre-training framework. LangCell utilizes texts enriched with cell identity information to gain a profound comprehension of cross-modal knowledge. Results from experiments conducted on different benchmarks show that LangCell is the only single-cell PLM that can work effectively in zero-shot cell identity understanding scenarios, and also significantly outperforms existing models in few-shot and fine-tuning cell identity understanding scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Protein Language Models with Deep Mutational Scanning improves Variant Effect Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) have emerged as performant and scalable tools for predicting the functional impact and clinical significance of protein-coding variants, but they still lag experimental accuracy. Here, we present a novel fine-tuning approach to improve the performance of PLMs with experimental maps of variant effects from Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) assays using a Normalised Log-odds Ratio (NLR) head. We find consistent improvements in a held-out protein test set, and on independent DMS and clinical variant annotation benchmarks from ProteinGym and ClinVar. These findings demonstrate that DMS is a promising source of sequence diversity and supervised training data for improving the performance of PLMs for variant effect prediction.</description>

      <title>Characterizing virulence differences in a parasitoid wasp through comparative transcriptomic and proteomic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Two strains of the endoparasitoid Cotesia typhae present a differential parasitism success on the host, Sesamia nonagrioides. One is virulent on both permissive and resistant host populations, and the other only on the permissive host. This interaction provides a very interesting frame for studying virulence factors. Here, we used a combination of comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to unravel the molecular basis underlying virulence differences between the strains.Results: First, we report that virulence genes are mostly expressed during the nymphal stage of the parasitoid. Especially, proviral genes are broadly up-regulated at this stage, while their expression is only expected in the host. Parasitoid gene expression in the host increases with time, indicating the production of more virulence factors. Secondly, comparison between strains reveals differences in venom composition, with 12 proteins showing differential abundance. Proviral expression in the host displays a strong temporal variability, along with differential patterns between strains. Notably, a subset of proviral genes including protein-tyrosine phosphatases is specifically over-expressed in the resistant host parasitized by the less virulent strain, 24 hours after parasitism. This result particularly hints at host modulation of proviral expression.Conclusions: This study sheds light on the temporal expression of virulence factors of Cotesia typhae, both in the host and in the parasitoid. It also identifies potential molecular candidates driving differences in parasitism success between two strains. Together, those findings provide a path for further exploration of virulence mechanisms in parasitoid wasps, and offer insights into host-parasitoid coevolution.</description>

      <title>DP-DCAN: Differentially Private Deep Contrastive Autoencoder Network for Single-cell Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is important to transcriptomic analysis of gene expression. Recently, deep learning has facilitated the analysis of high-dimensional single-cell data. Unfortunately, deep learning models may leak sensitive information about users. As a result, Differential Privacy (DP) is increasingly used to protect privacy. However, existing DP methods usually perturb whole neural networks to achieve differential privacy, and hence result in great performance overheads. To address this challenge, in this paper, we take advantage of the uniqueness of the autoencoder that it outputs only the dimension-reduced vector in the middle of the network, and design a Differentially Private Deep Contrastive Autoencoder Network (DP-DCAN) by partial network perturbation for single-cell clustering. Since only partial network is added with noise, the performance improvement is obvious and twofold: one part of network is trained with less noise due to a bigger privacy budget, and the other part is trained without any noise. Experimental results of six datasets have verified that DP-DCAN is superior to the traditional DP scheme with whole network perturbation. Moreover, DP-DCAN demonstrates strong robustness to adversarial attacks.</description>
