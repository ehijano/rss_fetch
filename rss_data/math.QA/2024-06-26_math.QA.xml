      <title>Classification of prime modules of quantum affine algebras corresponding to 2-column tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite dimensional simple modules of quantum affine algebras of type A correspond to semistandard Young tableaux of rectangular shapes. In this paper, we classify all prime modules corresponding to 2-column semistandard Young tableaux. Moreover, we give a conjectural sufficient condition for a module corresponding to a tableau with more than two columns to be prime.</description>

      <title>Differential calculi on quantum principal bundles in the Durdevic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis we study the Durdevic theory of differential calculi on quantum principal bundles within the domain of noncommutative geometry. Throughout the exposition, an algebraic approach based on Hopf algebras is employed. We begin by briefly recalling the foundational concepts of Hopf algebras and comodule algebras. Hopf-Galois extensions are introduced, along with an important correspondence result which relates crossed product algebras and cleft extensions. Differential calculus over algebras is reviewed, with a particular focus on the covariant case. The Durdevic theory is presented in a modern language. We compare this theory to existing literature on the topic. We extend the Durdevic theory and provide explicit realisations of quantum principal bundles and complete differential calculi on the noncommutative algebraic 2-torus, the quantum Hopf fibration and on crossed product algebras, resulting in an original contribution within this thesis.</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms of quantum spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $q\in [0,1[$, the Vaksman-Soibelman quantum sphere $S^{2n+1}_q$ is described by an associative algebra $\mathcal{A}(S^{2n+1}_q)$ deforming the algebra of polynomial functions on the 2n+1 dimensional unit sphere. Its C*-enveloping algebra is known to be independent of the deformation parameter q. In contrast to what happens in the C*-algebraic setting, we show here that, for all $q,q'$ in the above range, $\mathcal{A}(S^{2n+1}_q)$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{A}(S^{2n+1}_{q'})$ only if $q=q'$.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Spin TFTs from Gauging Line Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the input of an oriented three-dimensional TFT with framed line defects and a commutative $\Delta$-separable Frobenius algebra $A$ in the ribbon category of these line defects, we construct a three-dimensional spin TFT. The framed line defects of the spin TFT are labelled by certain equivariant modules over $A$, and the spin structure may or may not extend to a given line defect. Physically the spin TFT can be interpreted as the result of gauging a one-form symmetry in the original oriented TFT. This spin TFT extends earlier constructions in Blanchet-Masbaum (1996) and Blanchet (2005) [arXiv:math/0303240], and it reproduces the classification of abelian spin Chern-Simons theories in Belov-Moore (2005) [arXiv:hep-th/0505235].</description>

      <title>On torsion in the Kauffman bracket skein module of $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Kirby problems 1.92(E)-(G), which, roughly speaking, ask for which compact oriented $3$-manifold $M$ the Kauffman bracket skein module $\mathcal{S}(M)$ has torsion as a $\mathbb{Z}[A^{\pm 1}]$-module. We give new criteria for the presence of torsion in terms of how large the $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$-character variety of $M$ is. This gives many counterexamples to question 1.92(G)-(i) in Kirby's list. For manifolds with incompressible tori, we give new effective criteria for the presence of torsion, revisiting the work of Przytycki and Veve. We also show that $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R P}^3# L(p,1))$ has torsion when $p$ is even. Finally, we show that for $M$ an oriented Seifert manifold, closed or with boundary, $\mathcal{S}(M)$ has torsion if and only if $M$ admits a $2$-sided non-boundary parallel essential surface.</description>

      <title>Lifting of locally initial objects and universal (co)acting Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universal (co)acting bi/Hopf algebras introduced by Yu.\,I.~Manin, M.~Sweedler and D.~Tambara, the universal Hopf algebra of a given (co)module structure, as well as the universal group of a grading, introduced by J.~Patera and H.~Zassenhaus, find their applications in the classification of quantum symmetries. Typically, universal (co)acting objects are defined as initial or terminal in the corresponding categories and, as such, they do not always exist. In order to ensure their existence, we introduce the support of a given object, which generalizes the support of a grading and is used to restrict the class of objects under consideration. The existence problems for universal objects are formulated and studied in a purely categorical manner by seeing them as particular cases of the lifting problem for a locally initial object. We prove the existence of a lifting and, consequently, of the universal (co)acting objects under some assumptions on the base (braided or symmetric monoidal) category. In contrast to existing constructions, our approach is self-dual in the sense that we can use the same proof to obtain the existence of universal actions and coactions. In particular, when the base category is the category of vector spaces over a field, the category of sets or their duals, we recover known existence results for the aforementioned universal objects. The proposed approach allows us to apply our results not only to the classical categories of sets and vectors spaces and their duals but also to (co)modules over bi/Hopf algebras, differential graded vector spaces, $G$-sets and graded sets.</description>

      <title>Dualities for universal (co)acting Hopf monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general, universal (co)measuring (co)monoids and universal (co)acting bi/Hopf monoids, which prove to be a useful tool in the classification of quantum symmetries, do not always exist. In order to ensure their existence, the support of a given object was recently introduced in \cite{AGV3} and used to restrict the class of objects considered when defining universal (co)acting objects. It is well-known that, in contrast with the universal coacting Hopf algebra, for actions on algebras over a field it is usually difficult to describe the universal acting Hopf algebra explicitly and this turns the duality theorem into an important investigation tool. In the present paper we establish duality results for universal (co)measuring (co)monoids and universal (co)acting bi/Hopf monoids in pre-rigid braided monoidal categories $\mathcal C$. In addition, when the base category $\mathcal C$ is closed monoidal, we provide a convenient uniform approach to the aforementioned universal objects in terms of the cosupports, which in this case become subobjects of internal hom-objects. In order to explain our constructions, we use the language of locally initial objects. Known results from the literature are recovered when the base category is the category of vector spaces over a field. New cases where our results can be applied are explored, including categories of (co)modules over (co)quasitriangular Hopf algebras, Yetter-Drinfeld modules and dg-vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Pieri-type multiplication formula for quantum Grothendieck polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01578v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to prove a Pieri-type multiplication formula for quantum Grothendieck polynomials, which was conjectured by Lenart-Maeno. This formula would enable us to compute explicitly the quantum product of two arbitrary (opposite) Schubert classes in the (small) quantum $K$-theory ring $QK(Fl_{n})$ of the (full) flag manifold $Fl_{n}$ of type $A_{n-1}$ on the basis of the fact that quantum Grothendieck polynomials represent (opposite) Schubert classes in $QK(Fl_{n})$.</description>

      <title>A $(q,t)$-deformation of the 2d Toda integrable hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $(q,t)$-deformation of the 2d Toda integrable hierarchy is introduced by enhancing the underlying symmetry algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(\infty)\simeq \text{q-W}_{1+\infty}$ to the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra. The difference-differential equations of the hierarchy are obtained from the expansion of $(q,t)$-bilinear identities, and two equations refining the 2d Toda equation are found in this way. The derivation of the bilinear identities follows from the isomorphism between the Fock representation of level $(2,0)$ of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra and the tensor product of the q-deformed Virasoro algebra with a $u(1)$ Heisenberg algebra. It leads to identify the $(q,t)$-deformed Casimir with the screening charges of the deformed Virasoro algebra. Due to the non-trivial coproduct, equations of the hierarchy no longer involve a single tau-function, but instead relate a set of different tau functions. We then define the universal refined tau function using the $L$-matrix of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra and interpret it as the generating function of the deformed tau functions. The equations of the hierarchy, written in terms of the universal refined tau function, combine into two-term quadratic equations similar to the $RLL$ equations.</description>

      <title>Tetrahedron Instantons on Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a homomorphism $\tau$ from a suitable finite group $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ to $\mathsf{SU}(4)$ with image $\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$, we construct a cohomological gauge theory on a noncommutative resolution of the quotient singularity $\mathbb{C}^4/\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$ whose BRST fixed points are $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-invariant tetrahedron instantons on a generally non-effective orbifold. The partition function computes the expectation values of complex codimension one defect operators in rank $r$ cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory on a flat gerbe over the quotient stack $[\mathbb{C}^4/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau]$. We describe the generalized ADHM parametrization of the tetrahedron instanton moduli space, and evaluate the orbifold partition functions through virtual torus localization. If $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is an abelian group the partition function is expressed as a combinatorial series over arrays of $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-coloured plane partitions, while if $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is non-abelian the partition function localizes onto a sum over torus-invariant connected components of the moduli space labelled by lower-dimensional partitions. When $\mathsf{\Gamma}=\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a finite abelian subgroup of $\mathsf{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, we exhibit the reduction of Donaldson-Thomas theory on the toric Calabi-Yau four-orbifold $\mathbb{C}^2/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}\times\mathbb{C}^2$ to the cohomological field theory of tetrahedron instantons, from which we express the partition function as a closed infinite product formula. We also use the crepant resolution correpondence to derive a closed formula for the partition function on any polyhedral singularity.</description>
