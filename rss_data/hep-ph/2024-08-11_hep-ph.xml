      <title>A Quantum Description of Wave Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline a fundamentally quantum description of bosonic dark matter (DM) from which the conventional classical-wave picture emerges in the limit $m \ll 10~\textrm{eV}$. As appropriate for a quantum system, we start from the density matrix which encodes the full information regarding the possible measurements we could make of DM and their fluctuations. Following fundamental results in quantum optics, we argue that for DM it is most likely that the density matrix takes the explicitly mixed form of a Gaussian over the basis of coherent states. Deviations from this would generate non-Gaussian fluctuations in DM observables, allowing a direct probe of the quantum state of DM. Our quantum optics inspired approach allows us to rigorously define and interpret various quantities that are often only described heuristically, such as the coherence time or length. The formalism further provides a continuous description of DM through the wave-particle transition, which we exploit to study how density fluctuations over various physical scales evolve between the two limits and to reveal the unique behavior of DM near the boundary of the wave and particle descriptions.</description>

      <title>Dancing with invisible partners: Three-body exchanges with primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance of massive primordial black holes has historically been constrained by dynamical probes. Since these objects can participate in hard few-body scattering processes, they can readily transfer energy to stellar systems, and, in particular, can disrupt wide binaries. However, disruption is not the only possible outcome of such few-body processes. Primordial black holes could also participate in exchange processes, in which one component of a binary system is ejected and replaced by the black hole itself. In this case, the remaining object in the binary would dynamically appear to have an invisible companion. We study the rate of exchange processes for primordial black holes as a component of dark matter and evaluate possible mechanisms for detecting such binaries. We find that many such binaries plausibly exist in the Solar neighborhood, and show that this process can account for observed binary systems whose properties run counter to the predictions of isolated binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Probing (Ultra-) Light Dark Matter Using Synchrotron Based M\"ossbauer Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to search for (ultra)-light scalar dark matter (DM) using synchrotron radiation based M\"ossbauer spectroscopy technique. Such DM induces temporal variation in various fundamental constants, which in turn causes time modulation of the nuclear transition energies. When a M\"ossbauer source and absorber is separated by a large baseline, the DM induced shift between their energy levels can be tested by the modulation of the photon absorption spectrum. The narrow M\"ossbauer transitions allow the setup to efficiently probe DM in the high frequency range. We show that the reach of a M\"ossbauer experiment with the existing synchrotron beams is at par with the bounds from various equivalence principle violation searches. An improvement of the synchrotron setup would enable us to probe the hitherto uncharted territory of the DM parameter space upto MHz frequency. The proposed method would extend the DM search beyond the EP limit by several orders of magnitude, and would provide the best bound on DM interaction strength with various standard model fields in the high ($&gt;$kHz) frequency region.</description>

      <title>One Born$-$Oppenheimer Effective Theory to rule them all: hybrids, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, doubly heavy baryons and quarkonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of XYZ exotic states in the hadronic sector with two heavy quarks, represents a significant challenge in particle theory. Understanding and predicting their nature remains an open problem. In this work, we demonstrate how the Born$-$Oppenheimer (BO) effective field theory (BOEFT), derived from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) on the basis of scale separation and symmetries, can address XYZ exotics of any composition. We derive the Schr\"odinger coupled equations that describe hybrids, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, doubly heavy baryons, and quarkonia at leading order, incorporating nonadiabatic terms, and present the predicted multiples. We define the static potentials in terms of the QCD static energies for all relevant cases. We provide the precise form of the nonperturbative low-energy gauge-invariant correlators required for the BOEFT: static energies, generalized Wilson loops, gluelumps, and adjoint mesons. These are to be calculated on the lattice and we calculate here their short-distance behavior. Furthermore, we outline how spin-dependent corrections and mixing terms can be incorporated using matching computations. Lastly, we discuss how static energies with the same BO quantum numbers mix at large distances leading to the phenomenon of avoided level crossing. This effect is crucial to understand the emergence of exotics with molecular characteristics, such as the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$. With BOEFT both the tetraquark and the molecular picture appear as part of the same description.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on Coulombic effects in $pp$ and $\bar pp$ scattering and the determination of $\rho$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out a very simple method for calculating the mixed Coulomb-nuclear corrections to the $pp$ and $\bar pp$ scattering amplitudes that has been missed in the extensive past work on this problem. The method expresses the correction in terms of a rapidly convergent integral involving the inverse Fourier-Bessel transform of the nuclear amplitude and a known factor containing the Coulomb phase shift with form-factor corrections. The transform can be calculated analytically for the exponential-type model nuclear amplitudes commonly used in fits to the high-energy data at small momentum transfers, and gives very accurate results for the corrections. We examine the possible effects of the Martin zero in the real part of the nuclear amplitude, and the accuracy of the Bethe-West-Yennie phase approximation for the Coulomb-nuclear corrections. We then apply the method to a redetermination of the ratio $\rho$ of the real to the imaginary parts of the forward scattering amplitude in fits to high-energy ISR data previously analyzed using an approximate version of the correction. The only significant changes relative the accuracy of those fits are at 52.8 GeV. Our method is applicable more generally, and can be used also at lower energies and for proton-nucleus scattering.</description>

      <title>Charmonium-like states with the exotic quantum number $J^{PC} = 3^{-+}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the method of QCD sum rules to study the $q c \bar q \bar c$ tetraquark states with the exotic quantum number $J^{PC} = 3^{-+}$, and extract the mass of the lowest-lying state to be ${4.49^{+0.45}_{-0.41}}$ GeV. To construct the relevant tetraquark currents we need to explicitly add the covariant derivative operator. Our systematic analysis of these interpolating currents indicates that: a) this state readily decays into the $P$-wave $[\rho J/\psi] / [\omega J/\psi ]$ channel but not into the $ [\rho \chi_{c2}]/[\omega \chi_{c2}]/[J/\psi f_2(1270)]$ channels, and b) it readily decays into the $[D^* \bar D_2^*]$ channel but not into the $P$-wave $[D^* \bar D^*]$ channel.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Supernova Constraints on Millicharged Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hot and dense environment of the supernova core serves as an extraordinary factory for new feebly-interacting particles. Low-energy supernovae, a class of supernovae with low explosion energy, are particularly intriguing due to their stringent constraints on the energy transfer caused by new particles from the supernova core to the mantle. We investigate low-energy supernova constraints on millicharged particles by considering three production channels in the core: plasmon decay, proton bremsstrahlung, and electron-positron annihilation processes. We find that the electron-positron annihilation process, previously omitted in supernova studies on millicharged particles, is the dominant production channel in the high-mass region. By studying the energy deposition due to Coulomb scatterings with protons in the supernova mantle, we find that low-energy supernovae impose the most stringent constraints on millicharged particles in the mass range of $\sim(10-200)$ MeV, surpassing the energy loss limit from SN1987A by nearly one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Bell inequality violation in $B\to \it{\Phi\Phi}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decays of the $B$ meson into vector mesons, observed at the LHCb experiment, provide an ideal laboratory to investigate particle physics phenomena with quantum information theory methods. In this article, we focus on the decays yielding a pair of $\it{\Phi}$ mesons to investigate the presence of entanglement in the spin correlations of the system and quantify the amount of Bell inequality violation it entails. Our results show that the present LHCb data allows access to entanglement and to the Bell inequality violation with a significance exceeding the 5$\sigma$ threshold in both the cases. This demonstrates that the strong and electroweak interactions responsible for the $B$ meson decay act as a source of entanglement and the quantum mechanics nature of high-energy phenomena. Particular attention is paid to the assessment of loopholes: deficiencies in the experimental setup which could invalidate the results of the Bell test.</description>

      <title>Tensor Reduction for Feynman Integrals with Lorentz and Spinor Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient graphical approach to construct projectors for the tensor reduction of multi-loop Feynman integrals with both Lorentz and spinor indices in $D$ dimensions. An ansatz for the projectors is constructed making use of its symmetry properties via an orbit partition formula. The graphical approach allows to identify and enumerate the orbits in each case. For the case without spinor indices we find a 1 to 1 correspondence between orbits and integer partitions describing the cycle structure of certain bi-chord graphs. This leads to compact combinatorial formulae for the projector ansatz. With spinor indices the graph-structure becomes more involved, but the method is equally applicable. Our spinor reduction formulae are based on the antisymmetric basis of $\gamma$ matrices, and make use of their orthogonality property. We also provide a new compact formula to pass into the antisymmetric basis. We compute projectors for vacuum tensor Feynman integrals with up to 32 Lorentz indices and up to 4 spinor indices. We discuss how to employ the projectors in problems with external momenta.</description>

      <title>Model-independent predictions for decays of double-heavy hadrons into pairs of heavy hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-heavy hadrons can decay into pairs of heavy hadrons through transitions from confining Born-Oppenheimer potentials to heavy-hadron-pair potentials with the same Born-Oppenheimer quantum numbers. The states of the double-heavy hadron are constrained by a Born-Oppenheimer exclusion principle from the identical heavy quarks. The states of a pair of identical heavy hadrons are constrained by exclusion principles from identical particles. The transitions are also constrained by conservation of angular momentum and parity. From these constraints, we derive model-independent selection rules for decays of double-heavy hadrons into pairs of heavy hadrons. The coupling potentials are expressed as sums of products of Born-Oppenheimer transition amplitudes and angular-momentum coefficients. If there is a single dominant Born-Oppenheimer transition amplitude, it factors out of the coupling potentials between double-heavy hadrons in the same Born-Oppenheimer multiplet and pairs of heavy hadrons in specific heavy-quark-spin-symmetry multiplets and out of the corresponding partial decay rates. As examples, we discuss the Born-Oppenheimer potentials and multiplets for conventional double-heavy baryons and for double-heavy tetraquark mesons. We also discuss the relative partial decay rates for conventional double-heavy baryons into pairs of heavy hadrons.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves and Dark Matter in the Gauged Two-Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of a strong first-order electroweak phase transition during the early universe within the framework of the gauged two-Higgs doublet model (G2HDM) and explore its detectability through stochastic gravitational wave signals. The G2HDM introduces a dark replica of the Standard Model electroweak gauge group, inducing an accidental $Z_2$ symmetry which not only leads to a simple scalar potential at tree-level but also offers a compelling vectorial dark matter candidate. Using the high temperature expansion in the effective potential that manifests gauge invariance, we find a possible two-step phase transition pattern in the model with a strong first-order transition occurring in the second step at the electroweak scale temperature. Collider data from the LHC plays a crucial role in constraining the parameter space conducive to this two-step transition. Furthermore, satisfying the nucleation condition necessitates the masses of scalar bosons in the hidden sector to align with the electroweak scale, potentially probed by future collider detectors. The stochastic gravitational wave energy spectrum associated with the phase transition is computed. The results indicate that forthcoming detectors such as BBO, LISA, DECIGO, TianQin and Taiji could potentially detect the gravitational wave signals generated by the first-order phase transition. Additionally, we find that the parameter space probed by gravitational waves can also be searched for in future dark matter direct detection experiments, in particular those designed for dark matter masses in the sub-GeV range using the superfluid Helium target detectors.</description>

      <title>The effect of quantum decoherence on inflationary gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of inflation provides a mechanism to explain the structures we observe today in the Universe, starting from quantum-mechanically generated fluctuations. However, this leaves the question of: how did the quantum-to-classical transition, occur? During inflation, tensor perturbations interact (at least gravitationally) with other fields, meaning that we need to view these perturbations as an open system that interacts with an environment. In this paper, the evolution of the system is described using a Lindblad equation, which describes the quantum decoherence of the system. This is a possible mechanism for explaining the quantum-to-classical transition. We show that this quantum decoherence leads to a scale-dependent increase of the gravitational wave power spectrum, depending on the strength and time dependence of the interaction between the system and the environment. By using current upper bounds on the gravitational wave power spectrum from inflation, obtained from CMB and the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA constraints, we find an upper bound on the interaction strength. Furthermore, we compute the decoherence criterion, which indicates the minimal interaction strength needed for a specific scale to have successfully decohered by the end of inflation. Assuming that the CMB modes have completely decohered, we indicate a lower bound on the interaction strength. In addition, this decoherence criterion allows us to look at which scales might not have fully decohered and could still show some relic quantum signatures. Lastly, we use sensitivity forecasts to study how future gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and ET, could constrain the decoherence parameter space. Due to the scale-dependence of the power spectrum, LISA could only have a very small impact. However, ET will be able to significantly improve our current constraints for specific decoherence scenarios.</description>

      <title>Event Horizon Telescope observations exclude compact objects in baseline mimetic gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mimetic gravity has gained significant appeal in cosmological contexts, but static spherically symmetric space-times within the baseline theory are highly non-trivial: the two natural solutions are a naked singularity and a black hole space-time obtained through an appropriate gluing procedure. We study the shadow properties of these two objects, finding both to be pathological. In particular, the naked singularity does not cast a shadow, whereas the black hole casts a shadow which is too small. We argue that the Event Horizon Telescope images of M87$^{\star}$ and Sgr A$^{\star}$ rule out the baseline version of mimetic gravity, preventing the theory from successfully accounting for the dark sector on cosmological scales. Our results highlight an interesting complementarity between black hole imaging observations and modified gravity theories of cosmological interest.</description>

      <title>Learning the Simplicity of Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simplification and reorganization of complex expressions lies at the core of scientific progress, particularly in theoretical high-energy physics. This work explores the application of machine learning to a particular facet of this challenge: the task of simplifying scattering amplitudes expressed in terms of spinor-helicity variables. We demonstrate that an encoder-decoder transformer architecture achieves impressive simplification capabilities for expressions composed of handfuls of terms. Lengthier expressions are implemented in an additional embedding network, trained using contrastive learning, which isolates subexpressions that are more likely to simplify. The resulting framework is capable of reducing expressions with hundreds of terms - a regular occurrence in quantum field theory calculations - to vastly simpler equivalent expressions. Starting from lengthy input expressions, our networks can generate the Parke-Taylor formula for five-point gluon scattering, as well as new compact expressions for five-point amplitudes involving scalars and gravitons. An interactive demonstration can be found at https://spinorhelicity.streamlit.app .</description>

      <title>Extracting Signal Electron Trajectories in the COMET Phase-I Cylindrical Drift Chamber Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a pioneering approach to tracking analysis within the COMET Phase-I experiment, which aims to search for the charged lepton flavor violating $\mu\to e$ conversion process in a muonic atom, at J-PARC, Japan. This paper specifically introduces the extraction of signal electron trajectories in the COMET Phase-I cylindrical drift chamber (CDC) amidst a high background hit rate, with more than $40\,\%$ occupancy of the total CDC cells, utilizing deep learning techniques of semantic segmentation. Our model achieved remarkable results, with a purity rate of $98\,\%$ and a retention rate of $90\,\%$ for CDC cells with signal hits, surpassing the design-goal performance of $90\,\%$ for both metrics. This study marks the initial application of deep learning to COMET tracking, paving the way for more advanced techniques in future research.</description>

      <title>Sound Speed Resonance of Gravitational Waves in Gauss-Bonnet-coupled inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the occurrence of Sound Speed Resonances (SSR) in Gauss-Bonnet-coupled inflation across a wide range of coupling functions and parameters. After inflation, the damped oscillations of the inflaton around its potential minimum induces damped oscillations of the sound speed of tensor modes, leading to resonant amplification of the latter. Once the inflaton stabilizes around the minimum, the tensor sound speed reduces to unity (speed of light). In the context of multi-field inflation, the sound speed oscillations can be followed by a second phase of inflation, resulting in a distinctive stochastic background of Gravitational Waves (GWs). We show that these GW signals can be probed by upcoming experiments such as $\textbf{SKA}$, $\textbf{DECIGO}$, and $\textbf{BBO}$ depending on the duration of the second inflationary phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the electron self-energy in Quantum Electrodynamics to three loops in terms of iterated integrals over kernels of elliptic type. We make use of the differential equations method, augmented by an $\epsilon$-factorized basis, which allows us to gain full control over the differential forms appearing in the iterated integrals to all orders in the dimensional regulator. We obtain compact analytic expressions, for which we provide generalized series expansion representations that allow us to evaluate the result numerically for all values of the electron momentum squared. As a by product, we also obtain $\epsilon$-resummed results for the self-energy in the on-shell limit $p^2 = m^2$, which we use to recompute the known three-loop renormalization constants in the on-shell scheme.</description>

      <title>Galactic Gas Models Strongly Affect the Determination of the Diffusive Halo Height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The height of the Milky Way diffusion halo, above which cosmic-rays can freely escape the galaxy, is among the most critical, yet poorly known, parameters in cosmic-ray physics. Measurements of radioactive secondaries, such as $^{10}$Be or $^{26}$Al, which decay equivalently throughout the diffusive volume, are expected to provide the strongest constraints. This has motivated significant observational work to constrain their isotopic ratios, along with theoretical work to constrain the cross-section uncertainties that are thought to dominate radioactive secondary fluxes. In this work, we show that the imprecise modelling of the Milky Way spiral arms significantly affects our ability to translate $^{10}$Be and $^{26}$Al fluxes into constraints on the diffusive halo height, biasing our current results. Utilizing state-of-the-art spiral arms models we produce new predictions for the $^{10}$Be and $^{26}$Al fluxes that motivate upcoming measurements by AMS-02 and HELIX.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the complete set of planar two-loop five-point Feynman integrals with two off-shell external legs. These integrals are relevant, for instance, for the calculation of the second-order QCD corrections to the production of two heavy vector bosons in association with a jet or a photon at a hadron collider. We construct pure bases for these integrals and reconstruct their analytic differential equations in canonical form through numerical sampling over finite fields. The newly identified symbol alphabet, one of the most complex to date, provides valuable data for bootstrap methods. We then apply our results to initiate the study of double Lagrangian insertions in a four-cusp Wilson loop in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, computing it through two loops. We observe that it is finite, conformally invariant in four dimensions, and of uniform transcendentality. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence for its positivity within the amplituhedron region through two loops.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cosmological theory where the kinetic term and potential have $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry. Potentials have a plateau at large values of the inflaton field where the axion forms a flat direction, a saddle point at $\tau=i$, and a minimum at $\tau=e^{2\pi i\over 3}$. Due to the underlying hyperbolic geometry, the theory exhibits an $\alpha$-attractor behavior: its cosmological predictions are stable with respect to certain modifications of the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We present a supersymmetric version of this theory in the framework of $\overline {D3}$ induced geometric inflation. The choice of $\alpha$ is determined by underlying string compactification. For example, in a CY compactification with $T^2$, one has $3\alpha=1$, the lowest discrete Poincar\'e disk target for LiteBIRD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.14682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The top quark flavor changing neutral current processes are extremely suppressed within the Standard Model. Nevertheless, they could be enhanced in a new physics model beyond the Standard Model. Investigating the top quark's flavor changing neutral current interactions at colliders would be an important test in terms of new physics. In this work, we examine the potentials of the processes ${e^{-}} {p} {\rightarrow} {e^{-}} {\gamma}^{*} {p} {\rightarrow} {e^{-}} W^{+} b {\gamma}^{*}{\rightarrow} {e^{-}} {j} {\bar{j}} b {\gamma}^{*} $ and ${e^{-}} {p} {\rightarrow} {e^{-}} {\gamma}^{*} {p} {\rightarrow} {e^{-}} W^{+} b {\gamma}^{*}{\rightarrow} {e^{-}} \textit{l} {\nu}_\textit{l} b {\gamma}^{*} $ at the FCC-eh with $\sqrt{s} = 7.08 $ and $ 10.0 TeV $ to study anomalous $tq\gamma$ couplings via effective Lagrangians. We obtain $95{\%}$ confidence level sensitivities on the anomalous coupling parameters at the three FCC-eh energies and various integrated luminosities. We find that our limits are at least two orders of magnitude better than the current LHC experimental results.</description>

      <title>Small systems and the single-hit approximation in the AMY parton cascade ALPACA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how momentum anisotropies arise in small collision systems is important for a quantitative understanding of collectivity in terms of QCD dynamics in small and large collision systems. In this letter we present results for small collision systems from the newly developed parton cascade \textsc{Alpaca}, which faithfully encodes the AMY effective kinetic theory. \textsc{Alpaca} reproduces quantitatively previously know results from a calculation in the single-hit approximation for small values of the coupling. We discuss in detail how such a comparison is to be carried out. Particularly at larger coupling a generic differences between the two approaches becomes apparent, namely that in parton cascades particles interact over a finite distance while in direct integrations of the Boltzmann equation the interactions are local. This leads to quantitative differences in the extracted values for the elliptic flow coefficient. These discrepancies appear in situations where the mean free path is not large compared to the interaction time and the applicability of kinetic theory is thus questionable.</description>

Abstract: The rapid deployment of computing hardware different from the traditional CPU+RAM model in data centers around the world mandates a change in the design of event generators for the Large Hadron Collider, in order to provide economically and ecologically sustainable simulations for the high-luminosity era of the LHC. Parton-level event generation is one of the most computationally demanding parts of the simulation and is therefore a prime target for improvements. We present a production-ready leading-order parton-level event generation framework capable of utilizing most modern hardware and discuss its performance in the standard candle processes of vector boson and top-quark pair production with up to five additional jets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-site deconstructions of the $SU(2)_L$ gauge group factor of the SM. Models based on this approach can explain the hierarchies of the quark masses and CKM mixing between third and light families if these fields are localised on different sites by the presence of hierarchical new physics scales. The model leads to an accidental global $U(2)_q\times U(3)_u\times U(3)_d$ flavour symmetry which prevents dangerously large effects in flavour observables, making a TeV extension of the SM possible. Given the structure of the PMNS matrix in the neutrino sector, we explore different possibilities for the arrangement of the leptons on the two sites, and consider different models with $U(2)_{\ell}$ or $U(3)_{\ell}$ flavour symmetries. The phenomenology of the models is mostly governed by a massive vector triplet of $SU(2)_L$. We study the interesting interplay between LHC searches and precision observables. In particular, one of the models can give a sizeable lepton flavour universal effect in the Wilson coefficient $C_9$ while naturally suppressing contributions to $C_{10}$, as suggested by current $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ data, predicting simultaneously a mild positive shift in the $W$ boson mass.</description>

Abstract: The BOREXINO experiment has been collecting solar neutrino data since 2007, providing the opportunity to study the variation of the event rate over a decade. We find that at 96 \% C.L., the rate of low energy events shows a time modulation favoring a correlation with a flux from Jupiter. We present a new physics model, the Jovian Whisper Model, based on dark matter of mass $\sim 0.1-4$ GeV captured by Jupiter that can account for such modulation. We discuss how the Jovian Whisper Model (JWM) can be tested.</description>

Abstract: The study of entanglement in particle physics has been gathering pace in the past few years. It is a new field that is providing important results about the possibility of detecting entanglement and testing Bell inequality at colliders for final states as diverse as top-quark, $\tau$-lepton pairs and $\Lambda$-baryons, massive gauge bosons and vector mesons. In this review, after presenting definitions, tools and basic results that are necessary for understanding these developments, we summarize the main findings -- as published by the beginning of year 2024 -- including analyses of experimental data in $B$ meson decays and top-quark pair production. We include a detailed discussion of the results for both qubit and qutrits systems, that is, final states containing spin one-half and spin one particles. Entanglement has also been proposed as a new tool to constrain new particles and fields beyond the Standard Model and we introduce the reader to this promising feature as well.</description>

      <title>Models of Accidental Dark Matter with a Fundamental Scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider models of accidental dark matter, namely models in which the dark matter is a composite state that is stable thanks to an accidental symmetry of the theory. The fundamental constituents are vectorlike fermions, taken to be fragments of representations of the grand unifying gauge group $SU(5)$, as well as a scalar singlet. All the new fields are charged under a new confining gauge group, which we take to be $SU(N)$, leading to models with complex dark matter. We analyse the models in the context of $SU(5)$ grand unification with a non-standard approach recently proposed in the literature. The advantage of including the scalar mainly resides in the fact that it allows several undesired accidental symmetries to be broken, leading to a larger set of viable models with respect to previous literature, in which only fermions (or only scalars) were considered. Moreover these models present distinct novelties, namely dark states with non-zero baryon and lepton number and the existence of composite hybrid states of fermions and scalars. We identify phenomena that are specific to the inclusion of the scalar and discuss possibilities to test this setup.</description>

      <title>Production of hidden-heavy and double-heavy hadronic molecules at the $Z$ factory of CEPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a clean environment and high collision energy, the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) would be an excellent facility for heavy flavor physics. Using the Monte Carlo event generator Pythia, we simulate the production of the charmed (bottom) hadron pairs in the electron-positron collisions at the $Z$ factory of CEPC, and the inclusive production rates for typical candidates of the hidden/double-charm and hidden/double-bottom $S$-wave hadronic molecules are estimated at an order-of-magnitude level with the final state interactions after the hadron pair production. The predicted cross sections for the hidden-charm meson-meson molecules $X(3872)$ and $Z_c(3900)$ are at $\rm{pb}$ level, which are about two to three orders of magnitude larger than the production cross sections for the double-charm meson-meson molecules $T_{cc}$ and $T_{cc}^{*}$, as the double-charmed ones require the production of two pairs of $c\bar{c}$ from the $Z$ boson decay. The production cross sections for the hidden-charm pentaquark states $P_{c}$ and $P_{cs}$ as meson-baryon molecules are a few to tens of fb, which are about one magnitude larger than those of the possible hidden-charm baryon-antibaryon and double-charm meson-baryon molecules. In the bottom sector, the production cross sections for the $Z_b$ states as $B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{*}$ molecules are about tens to hundreds of fb, indicating $10^6$ - $10^7$ events from a two-year operation of CEPC, and the expected events from the double-bottom molecules are about 2 - 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the $Z_b$ states. Our results shows great prospects of probing heavy exotic hadrons at CEPC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the study of the quark sector of the universal seesaw model with $\mathrm{SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{Y'}}$ gauge symmetry in the massless case of the two lightest quark families. This model aims to explain the mass hierarchy of the third family quark by introducing a vector-like quark (VLQ) partner for each quark. In this model, we introduce $\mathrm{SU(2)_L}$ and $\mathrm{SU(2)_R}$ Higgs doublets. We derive explicitly the Lagrangian for the quark sector, Higgs sector, and kinetic terms of the gauge fields, starting from the Lagrangian, which is invariant under $\mathrm{SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{Y'}}$ gauge symmetry. At each stage of the symmetry breaking, we present the Lagrangian with the remaining gauge symmetry. Additionally, we investigate the flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) of Higgs ($h$) and $Z$-boson in the interaction with the top, heavy top, bottom, and heavy bottom quark.</description>

Abstract: By considering the basis-covariant constituents of N-Higgs-doublet potentials, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for canonical SO(4)_C Custodial Symmetry (CS) of potentials with N&gt;2 doublets, based on representation-theoretical and geometrical relations. In essence, our characterization relates the presence of canonical CS to basis-covariant vectors corresponding to particular bases of the defining representation of the orthogonal Lie algebras. For N=3,4 and 5, the conditions demand little computational effort to be evaluated, and we provide practical algorithms that may be efficiently implemented in a computer program, for deciding whether or not a potential is custodial-symmetric.</description>

Abstract: We present a first global closure test of the fixed parameterisation (MSHT) approach to PDF fitting. We find that the default MSHT20 parameterisation can reproduce the features of the input set in such a closure test to well within the textbook uncertainties. This provides strong evidence that parameterisation inflexibility in the MSHT20 fit is not a significant issue in the data region. We also present the first completely like-for-like comparison between two global PDF fits, namely MSHT and NNPDF, where the only difference is guaranteed to be due to the fitting methodology. To achieve this, we present a fit to the NNPDF4.0 data and theory inputs, but with the MSHT fixed parameterisation. We find that this gives a moderately, but noticeably, better fit quality than the central NNPDF4.0 fits, both with perturbative and fitted charm, and that this difference persists at the level of the PDFs and benchmark cross sections. The NNPDF4.0 uncertainties are found to be broadly in line with the MSHT results if a textbook $T^2=1$ tolerance is applied, but to be significantly smaller if a tolerance typical of the MSHT20 fit is applied. This points to an inherent inconsistency between these approaches. We discuss the need for an enlarged tolerance criterion in global PDF fits in detail, and demonstrate the impact of data/theory inconsistencies in the closure test setting; namely, these do not lead to any increase in the $T^2=1$ PDF uncertainty. We also investigate the impact of restricting the PDF parameterisation to have fewer free parameters than the default MSHT20 case, and find this can be significant at the level of both closure tests and the full fit.</description>

      <title>Radiative Corrections and the Renormalization Group for the Two-Nucleon Interaction in Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of effective field theory and the renormalization group to determine the impact of radiative corrections on the nucleon-nucleon potential and the binding energy of the deuteron. In order to do so, we present a modified version of pionless effective field theory inspired by earlier work in nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics. The renormalization group improvement of the deuteron binding energy leads to a shift on the order of a few percent and is consistent with the experimental value. This work serves as a starting point for a dedicated study of radiative corrections in few-body systems relevant for precision tests of the Standard Model in an effective field theory framework.</description>

      <title>Interplay Between Neutrino Kicks and Hydrodynamic Kicks of Neutron Stars and Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are observed with high space velocities and elliptical orbits in binaries. The magnitude of these effects points to natal kicks that originate from asymmetries during the supernova (SN) explosions. Using a growing set of long-time 3D SN simulations with the Prometheus-Vertex code, we explore the interplay of NS kicks that are induced by asymmetric neutrino emission and by asymmetric mass ejection. Anisotropic neutrino emission can arise from a large-amplitude dipolar convection asymmetry inside the proto-NS (PNS) termed LESA (Lepton-number Emission Self-sustained Asymmetry) and from aspherical accretion downflows around the PNS, which can lead to anisotropic neutrino emission (absorption/scattering) with a neutrino-induced NS kick roughly opposite to (aligned with) the kick by asymmetric mass ejection. In massive progenitors hydrodynamic kicks can reach up to more than 1300 km/s, whereas our calculated neutrino kicks reach (55-140) km/s (estimated upper bounds of (170-265) km/s) and only about (10-50) km/s, if LESA is the main cause of asymmetric neutrino emission. Therefore hydrodynamic NS kicks dominate in explosions of high-mass progenitors, whereas LESA-induced neutrino kicks dominate for NSs born in low-energy SNe of the lowest-mass progenitors, when these explode nearly spherically. Our models suggest that the Crab pulsar with its velocity of about 160 km/s, if born in the low-energy explosion of a low-mass, single-star progenitor, should have received a hydrodynamic kick in a considerably asymmetric explosion. Black holes, if formed by the collapse of short-lived PNSs and solely kicked by anisotropic neutrino emission, obtain velocities of only some km/s.</description>

      <title>Accessing the speed of sound in relativistic ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions using the mean transverse momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that the speed of sound of the strong interaction at high temperature can be measured using the variation of the mean transverse momentum with the particle multiplicity in ultracentral heavy-ion collisions. We test this correspondence by running hydrodynamic simulations at zero impact parameter with several equations of state, at several colliding energies from 0.2 TeV to 15 TeV per nucleon pair. The correspondence is found to be precise and robust for a smooth, boost-invariant fluid and an ideal detector. We discuss the differences between this ideal setup and an actual experiment. We conclude that the extraction of the speed of sound from data is reliable, and that the main uncertainty comes from our poor knowledge of the distribution of density fluctuations at the early stages of the collision.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the photon mass via the Shapiro effect in the solar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of a finite mass for the photon on its propagation in a weak gravitational field. In particular, we analyse the gravitational time delay, also known as the Shapiro effect. We work in isotropic coordinates in the weak-field limit and find that the mass-dependent corrections enhance the gravitational time delay. Doppler-tracking data from the Cassini mission allow us to set an upper bound on the photon mass, namely $m_\gamma &lt; 4.9 \times 10^{-7} \, {\rm eV/c^2}$ at $95\%$ CL. We also discuss next-generation solar-system tests of general relativity that could improve this upper limit, potentially by a factor of ten. Though not competitive with the currently best limits, our bound is at the ballpark of earlier ones based on the gravitational bending of light by the Sun.</description>

      <title>A theoretical perspective on the almost dark galaxy Nube: exploring the fuzzy dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent astronomical observations, an almost dark galaxy, designated as Nube, has unveiled an intriguing anomaly in its stellar distribution. Specifically, Nube exhibits an exceptionally low central brightness, with the 2D half-light radius of its stars far exceeding the typical values found in dwarf galaxies, and even surpassing those observed in ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). This phenomenon is difficult to explain within the framework of cold dark matter (CDM). Meanwhile, due to its ultralight particle mass, fuzzy dark matter (FDM) exhibits a de Broglie wavelength on the order of kiloparsecs under the typical velocities of galaxies. The interference between different modes of the FDM wave gives rise to fluctuations in the gravitational field, which can lead to the dynamical heating of stars within galaxies, resulting in an expansion of their spatial distribution. In this paper, we aim to interpret the anomalous stellar distribution observed in Nube as a consequence of the dynamical heating effect induced by FDM. Our findings suggest that a FDM particle mass around $1-2\times 10^{-23}$ eV can effectively account for this anomaly. And we propose that the FDM dynamical heating effect provides a new insight into understanding the formation of field UDGs.</description>

      <title>From chiral EFT to perturbative QCD: a Bayesian model mixing approach to symmetric nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraining the equation of state (EOS) of strongly interacting, dense matter is the focus of intense experimental, observational, and theoretical effort. Chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) can describe the EOS between the typical densities of nuclei and those in the outer cores of neutron stars while perturbative QCD (pQCD) can be applied to properties of deconfined quark matter, both with quantified theoretical uncertainties. However, describing the complete range of densities between nuclear saturation and an almost-free quark gas with a single EOS that has well-quantified uncertainties is a challenging problem. In this work, we argue that Bayesian multi-model inference from $\chi$EFT and pQCD can help bridge the gap between the two theories. We develop a correlated Bayesian model mixing approach that uses a Gaussian Process (GP) to assimilate different information into a single QCD EOS for symmetric nuclear matter. In the present implementation, this mixed EOS is informed solely by those of $\chi$EFT and pQCD, together with the associated truncation errors. The GP is trained on the pressure as a function of number density in the low-density and high-density regions where $\chi$EFT and pQCD are, respectively, valid. We impose priors on the GP kernel hyperparameters to suppress unphysical correlations between these regimes. This results in smooth $\chi$EFT-to-pQCD curves for both the pressure and the speed of sound. We show that using uncorrelated pointwise mixing requires uncontrolled extrapolation of at least one of $\chi$EFT or pQCD into regions where the perturbative series breaks down and leads to an acausal EOS. We also discuss future extensions and applications to neutron star matter guided by recent EOS constraints from nuclear theory, nuclear experiment, and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>A new quantization scheme of black holes in effective loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loop quantum cosmology has achieved great successes, in which the polymerization plays a crucial role. In particular, the phase-space-variable dependent polymerization turns out to be the unique one that leads to consistent quantization of the homogeneous and isotropic universe. However, when applying the same scheme to the quantization of black holes, it meets resistances, when the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) gauge is adopted. In this paper, we continue to study the quantum effects of the polymerization near the location that a classical black hole horizon used to be, from the point of view of effective loop quantum gravity in the KS gauge. In particular, we find a phase-space-variable dependent polymerization scheme that leads to negligible quantum effects near the location of the classical black hole horizon, but significantly alters the spacetime structure near the origin, so that the classical singularity is finally replaced by a finite and regular transition surface. The final geodesically-complete spacetime consists of the regular transition surface that connects a black hole in one side and an anti-trapped region in the other side. In the anti-trapped region, no white hole horizons are found and the spacetime is extended to infinity, at which the geometric radius of the two-spheres becomes infinitely large.</description>
