      <title>On the spectrum of non-ergodic measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a topological dynamical system where the group is abelian and the topologies are locally compact and second-countable. Given an invariant measure for this system, we show that if its dynamical spectrum is contained in some Borel subset of the dual group then the same holds almost surely for all ergodic measures arising via the Choquet theorem. In particular, if the invariant measure has pure point dynamical spectrum, so do almost all the ergodic measures. As an application, we show that given any mean almost periodic measure, in its hull there exists a Besicovitch almost periodic measure.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a self contained presentation of the notion of variance of a vector field introduced by Jean Ecalle and Bruno Vallet in \cite{ev} following a previous work of Jean Ecalle and Dana Schlomiuk in \cite{es}. We give complete proofs and definitions of various results stated in these articles. Following J. Ecalle and D. Schlomiuk, We illustrate the interest of the variance by giving a complete proof of the formulas for the mould defining the nilpotent part of a resonant vector field.</description>

      <title>Keplerian shear for Chacon Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of keplerian shear was introduced by Damien Thomine recently. It is useful for non ergodic systems, and can be seen as strong mixing conditionally on invariant fibers. The notion is particularly interesting when a.e. fiber is not strongly mixing.  We develop here an approach appropriate for systems such that a.e. fiber is weakly mixing, and apply it to a family of rank one transformations. Each transformation is a kind of Chacon map, built with a random number of spacers at each step of the Rochklin tower. We prove that this new dynamical system exhibits keplerian shear. The method relies on a version of a local limit theorem for time dependent Birkhoff sums along the fullshift.</description>

      <title>Dimension gap and phase transition for one-dimensional random walks with reflective boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb Z$- and $\mathbb N$-extensions of interval maps with at most countably many full branches modelling one-dimensional random walks without and with a reflective boundary. We analyse the associated Gurevich pressure and explore the relations governing these two cases. For such extensions, we obtain variational formulae for the Gurevich pressure that depend only on the base system. As a consequence, we characterise the systems with a dimension gap and, in the presence of a reflective boundary, provide general conditions in terms of asymptotic covariances for a second order phase transition. As a by-product, we derive a variational formula for the spectral radius of infinite Hessenberg matrices.</description>

      <title>A Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem for Bebutov shifts and applications to switched systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a version of the Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem for certain classes of curves on the 2-sphere which are not required to be the trajectories of an underlying flow or semiflow on the sphere itself. Using this result we extend the Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem to the context of continuous semiflows on compact subsets of the 2-sphere and the projective plane, give new sufficient conditions for the existence of periodic trajectories of certain low-dimensional affine control systems, and give a new criterion for the global uniform exponential stability of switched systems of homogeneous ODEs in dimension three. We prove in particular that periodic asymptotic stability implies global uniform exponential stability for real linear switched systems of dimension three and complex linear switched systems of dimension two. In combination with a recent result of the second author, this resolves a question of R. Shorten, F. Wirth, O. Mason, K. Wulff and C. King and resolves a natural analogue of the Lagarias-Wang finiteness conjecture in continuous time.</description>

      <title>The Lyapunov spectrum for Schneider map on $p\mathbb{Z}_p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic formalism associated with the Schneider map on the p-adic integers $p\mathbb{Z}_p$ . By introducing a geometric potential that captures the expansion of cylinder sets generated by the map, we define a Lyapunov exponent adapted to this non-Archimedean setting. We investigate the corresponding Lyapunov spectrum and show that it is real analytic on its natural domain. Moreover, we obtain an explicit closed formula for the spectrum. As a consequence, we recover and refine known results on the Hausdorff dimension of sets defined by a prescribed asymptotic arithmetic mean of the continued fraction digits. Finally, we relate the Lyapunov exponent to the exponential rate of convergence of rational approximations arising from truncations of the Schneider continued fraction expansion. This provides a $p$-adic analogue of classical results from Diophantine approximation and yielding precise dimension formulas for the associated level sets.</description>

      <title>On the dynamical stability of skeletal muscle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been debate for over 70-years about whether active skeletal muscle is dynamically stable at lengths greater than its optimal length. The stability of computational muscle models is a critical issue, as it directly affects our ability to simulate muscle deformation across different operating lengths, especially at lengths where muscles are known to remain functional despite model-predicted instabilities.
  In this study, we revisit the question of dynamical stability of ODE-based models of skeletal muscle. In particular, we investigate whether activation-independent tissue properties can provide stability to contractions along the dip region of the total force-length curve. First, using a combination of analytical tools (eigenvalue analysis and non-dimensionalization) and numerical simulations, we confirm that traditional Hill-type muscle models can display divergent dynamics in this region. Then, we propose a stabilized version of a 1D Hill-type muscle model that incorporates the 3D nature of skeletal muscle deformation. This results in a completely convex force-length relationship that can bring robustness to numerical simulations, while preserving the computational efficiency of 1D models. Our findings suggest that activation-independent intrinsic mechanical properties of muscle are sufficient to stabilize contractions even in the dip region, offering new insight into how muscles maintain functional integrity during active stretch.</description>

      <title>Diffusive synchronization of phase waves in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze synchronization of relaxation oscillations in multiple-timescale reaction-diffusion systems. Interpreting synchronization as convergence to frequency-synchronized wave-train solutions, we resolve for the first time the case of phase waves. These waves are nearly phase-synchronized relaxation oscillations, featuring quasistationary plateaus of length $\varepsilon^{-1}$ separated by fast transition layers, where $\varepsilon\ll1$ is the timescale separation parameter. Tracking the decay of modulations via a Bloch-wave eigenfunction analysis, we find a remarkably weak interaction strength of order $\varepsilon^{8/3}$. This weak layer interaction and many of the technical difficulties arise from repeated scattering of eigenfunctions through fold points at the ends of the quasistationary plateaus. We capture this by combining a novel geometric desingularization approach with Lin's method, exponential trichotomies, and the Riccati transform. While our spectral stability analysis yields diffusive synchronization of all phase waves in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, it also identifies potential finite-wavelength instabilities, which we realize in a system variant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Keplerian shear was introduced within the context of measure preserving dynamical systems by Damien Thomine, as a version of mixing for non ergodic systems. In this study we provide a characterization of the Keplerian shear using Rajchman measure, for some flows on tori bundles. Our work applies to dynamical systems with singularities or with non-absolutely continuous measures. We relate the speed of decay of conditional correlations with the Rajchman order of the measures. Some of these results are extended to the case of compact Lie group bundles.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a deterministic model to examine how information affects the spread of Typhoid Fever. The models properties, including its stability and basic reproduction number, are analyzed. Simulations show that information can influence behavior in ways that may increase disease transmission. Nota bly, the rise in Typhoid cases is linked to poor adherence to health precautions. The findings highlight the critical role of public education in controlling the disease and emphasize the need to include information campaigns in preven tion strategies.</description>

      <title>Fibration Symmetries and Cluster Synchronization in Multi-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on recent advances in fibration symmetry theory, we investigate how structural symmetries influence synchronization in systems with higher-order interactions (HOI). Using bipartite graph representations, we identify a node partition in fibres, based on equivalent incidence relations in hypergraphs. We study how identical nodes with an isomorphic input set can synchronize due to structural properties under our specific model assumptions, examining the dynamical model of Kuramoto with higher-order interactions and frustration parameters. Recent works established for directed hypergraphs that balanced partitions characterize robust synchrony, invariant under all admissible dynamics, whereas our contribution isolates the case of Kuramoto dynamics and shows that synchrony under homogeneous initial conditions and natural frequencies necessarily coincides with the fibration partition. As a conclusion, let us examine situations that require adjustments to the hypergraph topology to handle redundancy or to align with a target cluster configuration, especially in the presence of noise or incomplete information. These considerations open up new questions for future investigations. Our methodology combines theoretical modeling and simulations with applications to real-world data topologies, highlighting how representational choices and local input equivalence influence synchronization behavior.</description>

Abstract: This is the first article of a series of two where we study the problem of bounded deviations for homeomorphisms of closed surfaces of genus $\ge 2$. This first part studies bounded deviations with respect to closed geodesics. As a byproduct of our proofs, we also get a criterion of existence of periodic orbits in terms of big deviation with respect to some closed geodesic. The combination with the second part [arXiv:2511.14226] generalises to the higher genus case most of the bounded deviations results already known for the torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a compact topological dynamical system $(X,f)$, we associate to every pair $(x,y)$ a canonical order-theoretic invariant, its emergent order spectrum $\Omega(x,y)$. We first prove that, if $x$ and $y$ are chain-related, one can always build families of nested and acyclic $\varepsilon_n$-chains ($\varepsilon_n \to 0$). The order spectrum $\Omega(x,y)$ is then defined as the set of countable linear order-types obtained as direct limits of (order-compatible) nested and acyclic $\varepsilon_n$-chains. The order spectrum is independent of the compatible metric and of the vanishing sequence, and invariant under topological conjugacy. Moreover, it discriminates recurrence phenomena that are indiscernible via Conley's decomposition or Auslander's prolongational hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of transfer of energy to high frequencies in a quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation with sublinear dispersion, on the one dimensional torus. We exhibit initial data undergoing finite but arbitrary large Sobolev norm explosion: their initial norm is arbitrary small in Sobolev spaces of high regularity, but at a later time becomes arbitrary large. We develop a novel mechanism producing instability, which is based on extracting, via paradifferential normal forms, an effective equation driving the dynamics whose leading term is a non-trivial transport operator with non-constant coefficients. We prove that such operator is responsible for energy cascades via a positive commutator estimate inspired by Mourre's commutator theory.</description>

      <title>The factorization of matrices into products of positive definite factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positive-definite matrices materialize as state transition matrices of linear time-invariant gradient flows, and the composition of such materializes as the state transition after successive steps where the driving potential is suitably adjusted. Thus, factoring an arbitrary matrix (with positive determinant) into a product of positive-definite ones provides the needed schedule for a time-varying potential to have a desired effect. The present work provides a detailed analysis of this factorization problem by lifting it into a sequence of Monge-Kantorovich transportation steps on Gaussian distributions and studying the induced holonomy of the optimal transportation problem. From this vantage point we determine the minimal number of positive-definite factors that have a desired effect on the spectrum of the product, e.g., ensure specified eigenvalues or being a rotation matrix. Our approach is computational and allows to identify the needed number of factors as well as trade off their conditioning number with their actual number.</description>

Abstract: We study a generalization of conditional probability for arbitrary ordered vector spaces. A related problem is that of assigning a numerical value to one vector relative to another.
  We characterize the groups for which these generalized probabilities can be stationary, respectively invariant. Our results deviate from the setting of classical probability; this leads to a new criterion for amenability and for fixed points in cones.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Opinion Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and investigate a multi-dimensional opinion dynamics model where people are characterised by both opinions and importance weights across these opinions. Opinion changes occur through binary interactions, with a novel coupling mechanism: the change in one topic depends on the weighted similarity across the full opinion vector. We state the kinetic equation for this process and derive its mean-field partial differential equation to describe the overall dynamics. Analytical computations and numerical simulations confirm that this model generates complex stationary states, and we demonstrate that the final opinion structures are critically determined by the peoples' opinion weights.</description>
