      <title>AG-groups as parallelogram spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that an AG-group is paramedial and a paramedial is a parallelogram space. From which it follows that an AG-group is a parallelogram space. In this paper we give a direct proof of this fact and study it further. Our main result is that the parallelogram space of an AG-group is again an AG-group, which particularly implies that the parallelogram space for an Abelian group is also an Abelian group. We then generalise this result to medial quasigroups. Finally, we provide some quick methods of finding the other vertices of this parallelogram if at least one nontrivial vertex is known.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism invariance of the girth of Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For all Artin groups, we characterise the girth (i.e. the length of a shortest cycle) of the defining graph algebraically, showing that it is an isomorphism invariant. Using this result, we prove that the Artin groups based on a cycle graph are isomorphically rigid.
  Alongside the girth, we introduce a new graph invariant, the weighted girth, which takes into account the labels of the defining graph. Within the class of two-dimensional Artin groups of hyperbolic type, we characterise the weighted girth in terms of certain minimal right-angled Artin subgroups, showing that it is an isomorphism invariant. Finally, under the further hypothesis of leafless defining graph, we recover the weighted girth as the girth of the commutation graph introduced by Hagen-Martin-Sisto.</description>

      <title>Growth of associated monomial algebras with application to Manturov groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that an associative algebra shares the same growth and Gelfand-Kirillov dimension (GK-dimension) as its associated monomial algebra with respect to a degree-lexicographic order. This article mainly investigates the relationship between the GK-dimension of an algebra and that of its associated monomial algebra with respect to a monomial order. We obtain sufficient conditions on a monomial order such that these two algebras have the same GK-dimension. Our result generalizes the well-known result and has several applications. In particular, as an application, we study the growth of Manturov $(k,n)$-groups for positive integers $n&gt;k$. It is shown that the Manturov $(1,n)$-group has growth equal to $0$ for all $n&gt;1$; the Manturov $(2,3)$-group has growth equal to $2$; and, for all $n&gt;k\geq3$, the Manturov $(k,n)$-group contains a free subgroup of rank $2$ and thus has exponential growth.</description>

      <title>Efficient Compression in Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Straight-line programs are a central tool in several areas of computer science, including data compression, algebraic complexity theory, and the algorithmic solution of algebraic equations. In the algebraic setting, where straight-line programs can be interpreted as circuits over algebraic structures such as semigroups or groups, they have led to deep insights in computational complexity.
  A key result by Babai and Szemer\'edi (1984) showed that finite groups afford efficient compression via straight-line programs, enabling the design of a black-box computation model for groups. Building on their result, Fleischer (2019) placed the Cayley table membership problem for certain classes (pseudovarieties) of finite semigroups in NPOLYLOGTIME, and in some cases even in FOLL. He also provided a complete classification of pseudovarieties of finite monoids affording efficient compression.
  In this work, we complete this classification program initiated by Fleischer, characterizing precisely those pseudovarieties of finite semigroups that afford efficient compression via straight-line programs. Along the way, we also improve several known bounds on the length and width of straight-line programs over semigroups, monoids, and groups. These results lead to new upper bounds for the membership problem in the Cayley table model: for all pseudovarieties that afford efficient compression and do not contain any nonsolvable group, we obtain FOLL algorithms. In particular, we resolve a conjecture of Barrington, Kadau, Lange, and McKenzie (2001), showing that the membership problem for all solvable groups is in FOLL.</description>

      <title>Centralisers of semi-simple elements are semidirect products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G be a reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field, and let s $\in$ G be a semisimple element. We show that the centraliser of s is the semi-direct product of its identity component by its group of components.  We then look at the case where G is defined over an algebraic closure of a finite field Fq, and F is a Frobenius endomorphism attached to an Fqstructure on G. Under the additional assumption that s lies in an F -stable maximal torus such that F acts trivially on the Weyl group, we show that if the centraliser of s is F -stable we can make the above semi-direct product decomposition F -stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every automorphism of the congruence completion of the extended mapping class group that preserves the set of conjugacy classes of procyclic groups generated by Dehn twists is inner, and that its automorphism group is naturally isomorphic to the automorphism group of the procongruence pants complex. In the genus-zero case, we prove the stronger result that all automorphisms of the profinite completion of the extended mapping class group are inner.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of free metabelian Lie algebras, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that all Chein automorphisms (or one-row transformations) of lower degree $\geq 4$ of a free metabelian Lie algebra $M_n$ of rank $n\geq 4$ over an arbitrary field $K$ of characteristic $\neq 3$ are tame. We then show that all exponential automorphisms of $M_n$ of lower degree $\geq 5$ are also tame under the same conditions. The same results hold for fields of any characteristic when $n\geq 5$. These results contradict some long-standing results in the area.
  We also prove that a large class of automorphisms of $M_n$ of rank $n\geq 4$ that move only two variables are almost tame, that is, they can be expressed as a product of Chein automorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an induction scheme that aims at establishing the stable Andrews-Curtis conjecture in the affirmative. The stable Andrews-Curtis conjecture is equivalent to the conjecture that every contractible fake surface is 3-deformable to a point. We prove that every contractible fake surface of complexity less than 6 is 3-deformable to a point by induction.</description>

      <title>Dense Conjugacy Classes and Stability of Locally Finite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mapping class groups of locally finite graphs are the analogue of those of infinite-type surfaces, and serve as a "big" version of $\text{Out}(F_n)$. In this paper, we investigate which of these mapping class groups have a dense conjugacy class. We obtain a complete classification for self-similar locally finite graphs, and show that a large class of mapping class groups do not have a dense conjugacy class. One of the main tools we develop is flux homomorphisms, which we define for a broad class of locally finite graphs. Along the way, we develop a combinatorial notion for locally finite graphs, and we use it to provide a simple criterion for determining whether a locally finite graph is stable.</description>
