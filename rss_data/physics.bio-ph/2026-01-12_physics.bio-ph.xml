      <title>Knowledge Distillation of a Protein Language Model Yields a Foundational Implicit Solvent Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit solvent models (ISMs) promise to deliver the accuracy of explicit solvent simulations at a fraction of the computational cost. However, despite decades of development, their accuracy has remained insufficient for many critical applications, particularly for simulating protein folding and the behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins. Developing a transferable, data-driven ISM that overcomes the limitations of traditional analytical formulas remains a central challenge in computational chemistry. Here we address this challenge by introducing a novel strategy that distills the evolutionary information learned by a protein language model, ESM3, into a computationally efficient graph neural network (GNN). We show that this GNN potential, trained on effective energies from ESM3, is robust enough to drive stable, long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations. When combined with a standard electrostatics term, our hybrid model accurately reproduces protein folding free-energy landscapes and predicts the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins. This approach yields a single, unified model that is transferable across both folded and disordered protein states, resolving a long-standing limitation of conventional ISMs. By successfully distilling evolutionary knowledge into a physical potential, our work delivers a foundational implicit solvent model poised to accelerate the development of predictive, large-scale simulation tools.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic stability and kinetic control of capsid morphologies in hepatitis B virus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymorphism has been observed in viral capsid assembly, demonstrating the ability of identical protein dimers to adopt multiple geometries under the same solution conditions. A well-studied example is the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which forms two stable capsid morphologies both in vivo and in vitro. These capsids differ in diameter, containing either 90 or 120 protein dimers. Experiments have shown that their relative prevalence depends on the ionic conditions of the solution during assembly. We developed a model that incorporates salt effects by altering the intermolecular binding free energy between capsid proteins, thereby shifting the relative thermodynamic stability of the two morphologies. This model reproduces experimental results on the prevalence ratios of the large and small HBV capsids. We also constructed a kinetic model that captures the time-dependent ratio of the two morphologies under subcritical capsid concentrations, consistent with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Inferring three-body interactions in cell migration dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In active matter and living matter, such as clusters of migrating cells, collective dynamics emerges from the underlying interactions. A common assumption of theoretical descriptions of collective cell migration is that these interactions are pairwise additive. It remains unclear, however, if the dynamics of groups of cells is solely determined by pairwise interactions, or if higher-order interaction terms come into play. To investigate this question, we use time-lapse microscopy to record the dynamics of three cells interacting together in a linear three-site geometry. We collect a large number of cellular trajectories and develop an inference scheme to infer both pairwise and potential three-body cell-cell interactions. Our results reveal evidence of three-body interactions in one of the two cell lines tested. However, these three-body interactions only introduce minor corrections to the overall dynamics. Our work provides a methodology to infer the existence of three-body interactions from trajectory data, and supports the commonly assumed pairwise nature of cell-cell interactions.</description>

      <title>Flow-wave coupling synchronizes oscillations in growing active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillatory biochemical signals and mechanical forces must coordinate robustly during development, yet the principles governing their mutual coupling remain poorly understood. In syncytial embryos and cell-free extracts, mitotic waves propagate across millimeter scales while simultaneously generating cytoplasmic flows, suggesting a two-way interaction between chemical oscillators and mechanics. Here, we combine experiments in Xenopus Laevis cytoplasmic extracts with a minimal particle-based model to reveal a mechanochemical feedback that stabilizes phase wave propagation. In contrast to previous models of oscillatory active matter, an asymmetric size cycle, slow growth and rapid shrinkage, combined with size-dependent mechanical interactions generates a net particle displacement and flows aligned with the wave direction, which in turn drive a synchronization transition. Our results show that mechanical forces actively maintain the coherence of biochemical waves, providing a general mechanism for long-range order in oscillating active matter.</description>

      <title>Irreversible behavior drives neural flows in the hippocampus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the brain, neural activity undergoes directed flows between states, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry. At the same time, animals also exhibit irreversible flows between behavioral states. Yet it remains unclear whether -- and how -- irreversibility in the brain relates to irreversibility in behavior. Here, we explore this connection in the hippocampus, where neural activity encodes physical location. We show that hippocampal irreversibility can be quantified using the time-delayed cross-correlations between neurons. As a mouse moves along a virtual track, we find that physical flows through the animal's environment generate neural flows through its cognitive map. Strikingly, this neural irreversibility is explained by a minimal model with only three parameters: the average velocity of the mouse, the variance in this velocity, and the resolution of the neural encoding. Together, these results provide a mechanistic understanding of irreversibility in the hippocampus and shed light on the links between symmetry breaking in the brain and behavior.</description>

      <title>Molecular signatures of pressure-induced phase transitions in a lipid bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how lipid bilayers respond to pressure is essential for interpreting the coupling between membrane proteins and their native environments. Here, we use all-atom molecular dynamics to examine the pressure-temperature behavior of model membranes composed of DMPC or $\Delta$9-cis-PC. Within the studied range (288-308 K, 1-2000 bar), DMPC undergoes a liquid--gel transition, while $\Delta$9-cis-PC remains fluid due to unsaturation. The CHARMM36 force field reproduces experimental boundaries with high fidelity: simulated DMPC transitions deviate by only 5-10 K and 100-300 bar, and $\Delta$9-cis-PC exhibits no transition. Hysteresis is modest but most pronounced when starting from low-temperature gels. We identify area per lipid, bilayer thickness, and acyl-chain gauche fraction as sensitive phase markers; among these, the gauche fraction provides the most robust signature. Simulations indicate an interdigitated gel is the equilibrium structure under finite-size conditions. However, at low temperature and high pressure, interdigitation decreases, consistent with the experimental lamellar gel phase. This long-lived interdigitation critically impacts standard order parameters, specifically area per lipid and membrane thickness. These results underscore the accuracy of modern force fields and highlight how simulations mechanistically complement experimental studies of pressure-regulated membranes.</description>

      <title>Analytical review of nanoplastic bioaccumulation data and a unified toxicokinetic model: from teleosts to human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoplastics (NPs) are increasingly detected in human blood and organs at concentrations reaching hundreds to thousands of parts per million, yet no quantitative framework has linked short-term experimental uptake kinetics to long-term, organ-specific accumulation. Here we analytically review the most reliable uptake and depuration datasets available in teleost fish using a sequential two-compartment toxicokinetic model that distinguishes systemic circulation from tissue-level retention. While anomalous, non-Markovian transport is expected at microscopic scales, we show -- through an explicit theoretic analysis on minimal information -- that such formulations are not identifiable with existing data. Allowing unresolved early-time dynamics to be absorbed into effective, non-zero initial conditions yields an emergent Markovian description that is maximally informative and consistent across species, organs, particle sizes, and exposure levels. When expressed in normalized variables, uptake dynamics collapse onto a universal trajectory governed by a single dimensionless parameter, the systemic excretion capacity, which is generically small under experimental conditions. The resulting scale-free framework reveals systematic power-law dependencies of enrichment and retention times on ambient concentration, particle size, and body mass. Exploiting this structure, we examine the consistency of extrapolations to humans and show that reported organ burdens -- particularly in the brain -- are quantitatively compatible with inefficient systemic clearance and strong lipid-driven partitioning. At steady state, human tissue concentrations follow a robust approximate cubic scaling with lipid fraction, identifying lipid content as the dominant and mechanistically interpretable determinant of chronic nanoplastic accumulation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the scale dependence of the Reynolds number in correlated fluctuating fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the incompressible Navier--Stokes equation, the Reynolds number ($\mathrm{Re}$) is a dimensionless parameter quantifying the relative importance of inertial over viscous forces. In the low-$\mathrm{Re}$ regime ($\mathrm{Re} \ll 1$), the flow dynamics are commonly approximated by the linear Stokes equation. Here we show that, within the framework of spatially fluctuating hydrodynamics, this linearization breaks down when the thermal noise is spatially correlated, even if $\mathrm{Re} \ll 1$. We perform direct numerical simulations of spatially correlated fluctuating hydrodynamics in both one and two dimensions. In one dimension, the linearized dynamics exhibit significantly slower relaxation of high-wavenumber Fourier modes than the full nonlinear dynamics. In two dimensions, an analogous discrepancy arises in the particle velocity autocorrelation function, which decays more slowly in the correlated linear Stokes case than in the correlated nonlinear Navier--Stokes case. In both settings, spatial correlations inhibit viscous momentum diffusion at small scales, leading to prolonged relaxation under the linear dynamics, whereas nonlinear mode coupling accelerates small-scale relaxation. Thus, the interplay between nonlinear coupling and viscous damping becomes scale dependent, invalidating the use of a single global Reynolds number. Taken together, these findings show that, for spatially correlated fluctuating fluids, the effective Reynolds number must be reinterpreted as a scale-dependent quantity.</description>
