      <title>Bayesian Calibration of Gravitational-Wave Detectors Using Null Streams Without Waveform Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Bayesian null-stream method to constrain calibration errors in closed-geometry gravitational-wave (GW) detector networks. Unlike prior methods requiring electromagnetic counterparts or waveform models, this method uses sky-independent null streams to calibrate the detectors with any GW signals, independent of general relativity or waveform assumptions. We show a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. We discuss prospects for next-generation detectors like Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and LISA, where enhanced calibration accuracy will advance low-frequency GW science.</description>

      <title>A Parametrized Test of General Relativity for LISA Massive Black Hole Binary Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observations of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) will provide long duration inspiral signals with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data, ideal for testing general relativity (GR) in the strong-field and high-velocity regime. We present an extension of the Flexible Theory-Independent (FTI) framework, adapted to gravitational waves (GWs) from MBHBs observed with LISA, to perform parametrized inspiral tests of GR. This approach introduces generic deviations to the post-Newtonian (PN) coefficients of the frequency-domain GW phase while accounting for the time- and frequency-dependent instrument response, thus effectively identifying potential deviations from GR by constraining modifications to the PN phasing formula. Complementary analyses using Fisher matrix and full Bayesian approaches confirm that LISA observations could improve constraints on deviations from GR by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the most recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA measurements. Since LISA`s sensitivity to different GW phases -- inspiral, merger, and ringdown -- varies across the MBHB parameter space with masses between $10^4$ and $10^7M_{\odot}$, the optimal regime for testing deviations is not known a priori. Our results illustrate how the strength of these constraints depends significantly on both the total mass and the SNR, reflecting the trade-off between inspiral and merger-ringdown contributions to the observed signal. We also investigate the interplay between inspiral-only versus inspiral-merger-ringdown analyses in constraining these inspiral deviation parameters. This work contributes to the development of robust tests of GR with LISA, enhancing our ability to probe the nature of gravity and BHs with GW observations.</description>

      <title>On planetary orbits, ungravity and entropic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous works, entropic gravity and ungravity have been considered as possible solutions to the dark energy and dark matter problems. To test the viability of these models, modifications to planetary orbits are calculated for ungravity and different models of entropic gravity. Using the gravitational sector of unparticles, an equation for the contribution to the effect of orbital precession is obtained. We conclude that the estimated values for the ungravity parameters from planetary orbits are inconsistent with the values needed for the cosmological constant. The same ideas are explored for entropic gravity arising from a modified entropy--area relationship.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive look into the accuracy of SpEC binary black hole waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical relativity simulations provide a full description of the dynamics of binary systems, including gravitational radiation. The waveforms produced by these simulations have a number of applications in gravitational-wave detection and inference. In this work, we revisit the accuracy of the waveforms produced by the Spectral Einstein Code. Motivated by the wide range of waveform applications, we propose and explore three accuracy metrics between simulation resolutions: (i) the generalized frequency-weighted mismatch, (ii) the relative amplitude difference, and (iii) the phase difference at different times. We find that numerical errors accumulate over the binary evolution, but the error is not intrinsically larger during the latest, more dynamical stages. Studying errors across the parameter space, we identify a positive correlation between both the mismatch and the phase difference with precessing spin, but little correlation with aligned spin or eccentricity. Lastly, amplitude and phases differences are symmetric upon exchanging resolutions across the catalog, suggesting that there is no systematic error.</description>

      <title>The impact of missing data on the construction of LISA Time Delay Interferometry Michelson variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of missing input data on the construction of second-generation Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) variables, which enable data analysis for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). TDI relies on the introduction of precise time delays into the raw interferometric data streams before they are combined to suppress otherwise dominant laser phase noise. We show that a single missing sample, corresponding to 0.25 s of data, will result in an effective data gap of approximately 90 s in the second-generation TDI output if further measures are not taken. This additional gap is largely independent of the initial gap duration, but increases linearly with the order of the fractional-delay filter used for the computations. For a realistic gap scenario, incorporating both planned and unplanned data interruptions consistent with a target duty cycle of ~84%, we find that frequent, short-duration gaps (e.g., a total of 1000 per year, each of which have short durations ~ 100 s) could result in an additional loss in the TDI variables of about one day per year corresponding to a ~0.3% reduction in duty cycle. This amounts to a loss of approximately one day of LISA data suitable for the global-fit per year.</description>

      <title>Singularities as Solitons? Quantum Vacuum Architecture of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that black holes are \emph{soliton-esque} objects, where gravitational collapse is balanced by quantum vacuum dispersion, modeled via \(R+\alpha R^{2}\) gravity. Classical singularities are replaced by oscillating, finite-radius cores, thereby evading static no-go theorems. The event horizon is replaced by the \textit{Lamarina}, a surface of maximum redshift whose surface geometry yields Hawking-like radiation with corrections. The Raychaudhuri equations impose a Dyson-type ceiling on the maximum radiated power \((P_{\infty} \lesssim c^{5}/G)\), while effective field theory matching dictates a universal minimum Lamarina radius set by the dispersion scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a three--parameter family of asymptotically flat Einstein--Maxwell instantons. These solutions are toric, regular, and free of conical and orbifold singularities on the manifold $M=\CP^2\setminus S^1$. They are counterexamples to the Euclidean Einstein--Maxwell Black Hole Uniqueness Conjecture. In the case of vanishing charge these instantons reduce to the Chen--Teo Ricci flat instantons.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Schild transformation of the Benenti-Francaviglia metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Benenti-Francaviglia (BF) family of metrics provides the most general form of a spacetime metric that admits two mutually commuting Killing vectors and an irreducible Killing tensor. The geodesic equations for the BF family are thus completely integrable by separation of variables. Within this broad class, we explore the Kerr-Schild transformation of a degenerate subclass distinguished by the existence of a shear-free null geodesic congruence. By requiring the deformed metric to preserve the Killing symmetry and circularity, we demonstrate that the deformed metric again falls into the degenerate BF family, modulo the replacement of a single structure function. We apply the present algorithm to ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity and obtain a dyonic generalization of the Chong-Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope rotating black hole solution, by taking the background metric to be a solution of the Einstein-scalar gravity. The present prescription extends to five dimensions, provided that the constant of geodesic motion associated with the extra Killing direction vanishes. The same reasoning applies to the case where the background degenerate BF metric is distorted in a (non)conformal manner. Our formalism offers a unified perspective on the relation between seed and deformed metrics in the Kerr-Schild construction.</description>

      <title>Classical Polymerization of the Bianchi I Model with Deformed Poisson Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the Bianchi~I cosmological model in the presence of both polymer quantization effects and an exponential deformation of the Poisson algebra. Starting from the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the polymer-deformed equations of motion and analyze their solutions for the contracting branch of the model. In contrast with the undeformed classical dynamics, the exponential deformation with suitable values of deformation parameters, produces a noticeably slower evolution of the volume variable and leads to a stabilization of the anisotropy parameters, which remain bounded throughout the evolution. No removal of the initial singularity is observed; however, the deformation significantly modifies the asymptotic behavior, offering a mechanism to suppress anisotropic shear near the singularity. Our results are illustrated through analytic solutions, highlighting the qualitative differences between the standard and the polymer--deformed Bianchi~I cosmology.</description>

      <title>Bonanno-Reuter regular black hole: quasi-resonances, grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections of a massive scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field in the background of the regular, quantum-corrected Bonanno-Reuter black hole, which arises from the renormalization group improvement of the Schwarzschild solution within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. The analysis is performed in both the time and frequency domains. We find that increasing the mass of the field leads to a strong suppression of the damping rate, and extrapolation to larger masses indicates the emergence of arbitrarily long-lived oscillations, or quasi-resonances. In the time domain, the late-time decay follows an asymptotic behavior that differs from the power-law tails of the classical Schwarzschild case. Furthermore, we compute the grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections for the massive scalar field and show that the grey-body factors decrease as the field mass increases, effectively shifting the emitted radiation spectrum toward higher frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correspondence of single-field cosmological models based on Einstein gravity to modern observational data is considered. A method is proposed to determine possible types of dynamics based on extreme values of the scalar field. It is shown that within the framework of this approach, it is possible to obtain a limited class of known inflationary models at early times. It is also shown that on large times the proposed approach leads to the $\Lambda$CDM--model in order to describe the dynamics of the second accelerated expansion of the universe. An interpretation of the considered models is presented as a starting point for constructing verifiable cosmological models based on modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>When vacuum breaks: a self-consistency test for astrophysical environments in extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave signals are typically interpreted under the vacuum hypothesis, i.e. assuming negligible influence from the astrophysical environment. This assumption is expected to break down for low-frequency sources such as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), which are prime targets for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and are expected to form, at least in part, in dense environments such as Active Galactic Nuclei or dark-matter spikes/cores. Modeling environmental effects parametrically is challenging due to the large uncertainties in their underlying physics. We propose a non-parametric test for environmental effects in EMRIs, based on assessing the self-consistency of vacuum parameter posteriors inferred from different portions of the signal. Our results demonstrate that this approach can reveal the presence of astrophysical environments, or even deviations from General Relativity, without introducing additional parameters or assumptions about the underlying physics.</description>

      <title>Unified Dark Matter and Dark Energy in a model of Non-Canonical Scalar-Tensor Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model of non-canonical scalar-tensor theory in which the kinetic term in the Brans-Dicke action is replaced by a non-canonical scalar field Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(X, \phi)= \lambda X^\alpha \phi^\beta - V(\phi)$ where $X = (1/2) \partial_{\mu} \phi \partial^{\mu} \phi$ and $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\lambda$ are parameters of the model. This can be considered as a simple non-canonical generalization of the Brans-Dicke theory with a potential term which corresponds to a special case of this model with the values of the parameter $\alpha = 1$, $\beta = -1$ and $\lambda = 2w_{_{BD}}$ where $w_{_{BD}}$ is the Brans-Dicke parameter. Considering a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe with scale factor $a(t)$, it is shown that, in the matter free Universe, the kinetic term $\lambda X^\alpha \phi^\beta$ can lead to a power law solution $a(t)\propto t^{n}$ but the maximum possible value of $n$ turns out to be $(1+\sqrt{3})/4 \approx 0.683$. When $\alpha \geq 18$, this model can lead to a solution $a(t)\propto t^{2/3}$, thereby mimicking the evolution of scale factor in a cold dark matter dominated epoch with Einstein's General Relativity (GR). With the addition of a linear potential term $V(\phi) = V_{0}\phi$, it is shown that this model mimics the standard $\Lambda$CDM model type evolution of the Universe. The larger the value of $\alpha$, the closer the evolution of $a(t)$ in this model to that in the $\Lambda$CDM model based on Einstein's GR. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that this model with a linear potential can mimic the GR based $\Lambda$CDM model. However, with an appropriate choice of the potential $V(\phi)$, this model can provide a unified description of both dark matter and dynamical dark energy, as if it were based on Einstein's GR.</description>

      <title>Characterization of gravitational radiation at infinity with a cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence or absence of gravitational radiation escaping from the spacetime at $\mathscr{J}$ is characterized in the presence of a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ of any sign. To that end, the properties of the asymptotic super-momentum are used. When $\Lambda=0$, the characterization is equivalent to that based on the News tensor. For $\Lambda\neq 0$, it provides the first reliable definition of existence of radiation at $\mathscr{J}$, and it gives fully satisfactory results in known exact solutions.</description>

      <title>GW231123: extreme spins or microglitches?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently reported binary black hole merger, GW231123, has unusual properties that make it hard to explain astrophysically. Parameter estimation studies are consistent with maximally spinning black holes and the dimensionless spin of the more massive component is constrained to be $\chi_1\gtrsim 0.8$. Analysis of data also revealed potential systematics that could not be fully replicated with simulated studies. We explore the possibility that these measurements are biased due to unmodeled non-Gaussian noise in the detectors, and that the actual black hole spins are more modest. We present evidence for a population of \textit{microglitches} in LIGO gravitational-wave strain data that can lead to biases in the parameter estimation of short-duration signals such as GW231123. Using simulated data of a massive event like GW231123, we demonstrate how microglitches can bias our measurements of black hole spins toward $\chi\approx1$ with negligible posterior support for the true value of $\chi\approx0.7$. We develop a noise model to account for microglitches and show that this model successfully reduces biases in the recovery of signal parameters. We characterize the microglitch population in real interferometer data surrounding GW231123 and find a single detector glitch duty cycle of $0.57_{-0.19}^{+0.21}$, which implies nearly a $100\%$ probability that at least one event through the fourth gravitational wave transient catalog coincides with microglitches in two detectors. We argue that further investigations are required before we can have a confident picture of the astrophysical properties of GW231123.</description>

      <title>Can One Model Gravitational Nonlinear Memory with Fractional Derivative Operators?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether fractional calculus, with its intrinsic long-tailed memory and nonlocal features, can provide a viable model for gravitational-wave memory effects. We consider two toy constructions: ($i$) a fractional modification of the linearized Einstein field equations using a sequential Caputo operator, and ($ii$) a fractionalized quadrupole formula where the source moment is acted upon by the same operator. Both constructions yield history-dependent responses with small memory-like offsets. However, in all cases, the signal decays to zero at late times, failing to reproduce the permanent displacement predicted by GR. Our results, therefore, constitute a no-go demonstration: naive fractionalization is insufficient to model nonlinear gravitational memory. We argue that any successful model must incorporate fractional kernels directly into the hereditary flux-balance integral of General Relativity, while preserving gauge invariance and dimensional consistency. We also discuss possible connections to modified gravity and the absence of memory in the spacetime with dimensions $D&gt;4$.</description>

      <title>Gauge Dependence of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Isocurvature Perturbations: Analytical Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically study the gauge dependence of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) sourced by primordial isocurvature perturbations during radiation domination (RD), working across nine gauges. Through analytical integrations of the kernels supported by graphical comparison we identify a clear dichotomy. We find that in some gauges viz. the uniform-density (UD), total-matter (TM), uniform-curvature (UC), comoving-orthogonal (CO) and transverse-traceless (TT) gauges the energy density grows polynomially in conformal time $\eta^n$, where $n$ varies from $2$ to $8$. While in rest of the gauges viz. the longitudinal (Long.), uniform-expansion (UE), Newtonian-motion (Nm), and N-body (Nb) gauges the late-time energy spectrum converges, and SIGWs behave as radiation. For subhorizon modes ($ k\eta \gg 1 $), the divergence becomes severe, showing that SIGWs are gauge-dependent observables in this regime. We resolve it through a kernel projection that isolates the luminal, freely propagating gravitational wave components (oscillating as $\sin(k\eta)$ and $\cos(k\eta)$), eliminating spurious contributions. The resulting kernel decays as $ (k\eta)^{-1} $ and yields a finite, gauge-independent late-time spectrum, confirming that only luminal modes represent physical SIGWs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the implications provided by the modified Painlev\'{e}-Gullstrand coordinates in the context of quintessence for the Kiselev black hole. In this regard, we set up a fully static line element in terms of lapse and shift functions, apart from including the deformation parameter signaling deviation from the standard Painlev\'{e}-Gullstrand metric. We address two specific issues pertaining to the problems of radiation and dust furnished by the corresponding barotropic index parameter and study the related consequences by performing a range of analyses to explore the influence imposed by quintessence. We also discuss the thermodynamical consequences by evaluating the expressions of the Hawking temperature and the entropy function in closed forms.</description>

      <title>Modified Fronsdal coordinates for maximally extended Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a coordinate system that complements the Kruskal--Szekeres extension. Like the standard construction, it covers the maximally extended Schwarzschild manifold in its entirety, while offering an additional advantage of expressing the areal radius as an explicit function of the new coordinates. Its main limitation, however, is that radial null geodesics are no longer represented as 45-degree lines in the Kruskal plane, making the causal structure more difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, the new system offers a compelling aesthetic trade-off: among all known maximally extended systems - including those of Kruskal-Szekeres, Israel, Fronsdal, Novikov, and Synge - it exhibits the highest degree of symmetry with respect to Schwarzschild's original r- and t-coordinate lines. It trades the regular pattern of Kruskal's light cones for a symmetric nesting arrangement of the two-dimensional spheres. The proposed extension sheds new light on the closely related Fronsdal's six-dimensional embedding construction, and clarifies the deep connection that exists between the most important implicit (Kruskal-Szekeres) and explicit (Israel's) procedures for maximal extension of the Schwarzschild geometry that is well known to those working in the field but rarely presented in textbooks on general relativity.</description>

      <title>Rolling with modular symmetry: quintessence and de Sitter in heterotic orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22781v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modular invariance is a fundamental symmetry in string compactifications, constraining both the structure of the effective theory and the dynamics of moduli and matter fields. It has also gained renewed importance in the context of swampland conjectures and, independently, flavour physics. We investigate a modular-invariant scalar potential arising from heterotic orbifolds, where the flavour structure and moduli dynamics are jointly shaped by the underlying geometry. Focusing on a string-inspired, two-moduli truncation, we uncover a rich vacuum structure featuring anti-de Sitter minima and unstable de Sitter saddle points. We identify large regions in moduli space supporting multifield hilltop quintessence consistent with observations. All solutions satisfy refined swampland de Sitter bounds. Our results illustrate how modular symmetry can guide the construction of controlled, string-motivated quintessence scenarios within consistent effective theories.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer for Transient Noise Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of gravitational waves (GW). The Gravity Spy project has categorized these noise events into various classes. With the O3 run, there is the inclusion of two additional noise classes and thus a need to train new models for effective classification. We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by effectively distinguishing transient noise.

      <title>Detecting Black Hole Microstates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Euclidean two-point function of an appropriately chosen probe operator can detect the microstate of an asymptotically AdS black hole. This detection, which requires a tuned, state-dependent choice of probe, is the result of a new gravitational saddle, which dominates over the usual saddles. The gravitational result can be explicitly reproduced in the dual boundary CFT if we assume the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We also discuss a binary search protocol to detect the black hole microstate from a candidate list.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Cosmic Superstrings and the Overshoot Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit the techniques of dynamical systems to study the cosmological evolution of cosmic fundamental strings and effective strings arising from branes wrapped on internal cycles. We also include the whole potential of the volume modulus characterised by an early time run-away towards a late time minimum. We analyse the overshoot problem with and without radiation, and find that the presence of an initial population of strings arising from NS5-branes wrapped around 4-cycles is enough to ensure that the modulus stabilises in its late time minimum, even in the absence of radiation. The reason is the transfer of energy between the modulus and the effective strings caused by the fact that their tension depends on the volume modulus. Interestingly, we find that the energy density of cosmic superstrings is generically very large when the modulus is oscillating around its minimum, opening up the possibility of a detectable gravitational wave signal. We also find no evidence of an efficient resonant enhancement of cosmic superstrings due to an oscillating tension in the late time minimum.</description>

      <title>Classification of $g$-modes for neutron stars with a strong transition: Novel universal relation including slow stable twin stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the non-radial gravity-pulsation discontinuity mode ($g$-mode) in hybrid compact stars with a strong first-order phase transition, which can give rise to twin-star configurations in some cases. These modes are of utmost relevance since they can be potentially excited in isolated as well as binary neutron star systems in the inspiral phase, thus allowing us to indirectly detect the presence of a deconfinement transition. In order to do this, we consider four categories of twin stars that present distinctive features in their equations of state. We employ the constant speed of sound parametrization, which accounts for a sharp phase transition between confined hadronic matter and deconfined quark matter. Then, working within the relativistic Cowling approximation to obtain the frequencies of non-radial oscillations, we find that, depending on the twin star category, the relations between $g$-mode frequencies and masses as well as tidal deformabilities display a highly distinct behavior across the diverse twin star categories that appear in the slow hadron-quark conversion regime. This distinct phenomenology provides smoking-gun evidence to clearly distinguish and further classify hybrid stars with a strong transition from purely hadronic stars using upcoming gravitational-wave data. In addition, we present for each of the categories studied the relation between the $g$-mode frequency and the normalized energy density jump. Finally, we present a novel universal relationship for the discontinuity $g$-mode able to encompass the four categories including long branches of slow stable twin stars and address its asteroseismological capability.</description>

      <title>Boundary Conditions of Warped AdS$_3$ in New Massive Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To satisfy the Cardy formula for Warped AdS$_3$ (WAdS$_{3}$) solutions in a quadratic ensemble, a specific set of boundary conditions has been proposed in \cite{Aggarwal:2020igb}. In this paper, these boundary conditions have been investigated in the three-dimensional new massive gravity (NMG) framework. The associated solution space, asymptotic symmetries, and charge algebra have been extracted. It has been shown that the surface charges are finite, but not integrable, and the integrability of the charges is obtained after restricting to a sub-sector of the original solution space. Finally, we have proved that the Cardy formula reproduces the thermodynamic entropy of a warped BTZ black hole.</description>

      <title>Hyperinvariant Spin Network States -- An AdS/CFT Model from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence and limitations for hyperinvariant tensor networks incorporating a local SU(2) symmetry. As discrete implementations of the anti de-Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, such networks have created bridges between the fields of quantum information theory and quantum gravity. Adding SU(2) symmetry to the tensor network allows a direct connection to spin network states, a basis of the kinematic Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We consider a particular situation where the states can be interpreted as kinematic quantum states for three-dimensional quantum gravity. We show that important aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence are realized in certain quantum states of the gravitational field in LQG, thus justifying, from first principles, a class of models introduced by [F. Pastawski et al., JHEP 06, 149 (2015)]. We provide examples of hyperinvariant tensor networks, but also prove constraints on their existence in the form of no-go theorems that exclude absolutely maximally entangled states as well as general holographic codes from local SU(2)-invariance. We calculate surface areas as expectation values of the LQG area operator and discuss further possible constraints as a consequence of a decay of correlations on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Scalar Quasinormal modes in Reissner--Nordstr\"om black holes: implications for Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscopic charged black holes can provide possibilities to test the consistency of the effective field theory (EFT) corrections to Einstein-Maxwell theory. A particularly interesting result is fixing the sign of a certain combination of EFT couplings from the requirement that all charged black holes should be able to evaporate (Weak Gravity Conjecture). In our work, we analysed the EFT corrections to a set of zero-damping quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the scalar wave probe in a nearly extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. We review the duality of this setup to the problem of the quantum Seiberg-Witten curve of $N=2$ Super-Yang-Mills theory with three flavors. We provide an analytic result for the EFT corrections to the QNMs obtained from the quantization condition imposed on the Seiberg-Witten cycle. Our main result is that the causality requirement of the gravitational theory formulated for the QNMs translates to the same condition on EFT couplings as the one appearing in the Weak Gravity Conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological aspects of Einstein gravity suggest that topological invariance could be a more profound principle in understanding quantum gravity. In this work, we explore a topological supergravity action that initially describes a universe without Riemann curvature, which seems trivial. However, we made a surprising discovery by introducing a small deformation parameter $\lambda$, which can be regarded as an AdS generalization of supersymmetry (SUSY). We find that the deformed topological quantum field theory (TQFT) becomes unstable at low energy, resulting in the emergence of a classical metric, whose dynamics are controlled by the Einstein equation. Our findings suggest that a quantum theory of gravity could be governed by a UV fixed point of a SUSY TQFT, and classical spacetime ceases to exist beyond the Planck scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter overdensities around black holes can alter the dynamical evolution of a companion object orbiting around it, and cause a dephasing of the gravitational waveform. Here, we present a refined calculation of the co-evolution of the binary and the dark matter distribution, taking into account the accretion of dark matter particles on the companion black hole, and generalizing previous quasi-circular calculations to the general case of eccentric orbits. These calculations are validated by dedicated N-body simulations. We show that accretion can lead to a large dephasing, and therefore cannot be neglected in general. We also demonstrate that dark matter spikes tend to circularize eccentric orbits faster than previously thought.</description>

Abstract: The Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime is an exact solution of the Einstein electrovacuum equations describing a black hole immersed in a magnetic field which is asymptotically aligned with the z-axis. It plays an important role in our understanding of the interplay between geometry and matter, and is often used as a proxy for astrophysical environments. Here, we construct the scalar counterpart to the Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime: a non-asymptotically flat black hole geometry with an everywhere regular scalar field whose gradient is asymptotically aligned with the z-axis.</description>

      <title>Massive fields affected by echoes: New physics vs. astrophysical environment</title>

Abstract: Unlike the perturbations of massless fields, the asymptotic tails of massive fields exhibit oscillations and decay slowly, following a power-law envelope. In this work, considering various scenarios admitting (either fundamental or effective) massive scalar and gravitational fields, we demonstrate that bump deformations in the effective potential, either in the near-horizon or far-field regions, modify these asymptotic oscillatory tails. Specifically, the power-law envelope transitions to a more complex oscillatory pattern, which cannot be easily fitted to a simple formula. This behavior is qualitatively different from the echoes of massless fields, which appear mainly during the quasinormal ringing stage and are considerably suppressed at the asymptotic tails. We show that in some models echoes may considerably amplify the signal at the stage of asymptotic tails.</description>

      <title>Background-dependent and classical correspondences between $f(Q)$ and $f(T)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $f(Q)$ and $f(T)$ gravity are based on fundamentally different geometric frameworks, yet they exhibit many similar properties. This article provides a comprehensive summary and comparative analysis of the various theoretical branches of torsional gravity and non-metric gravity, which arise from different choices of affine connection. We identify two types of background-dependent and classical correspondences between these two theories of gravity. The first correspondence is established through their equivalence within the Minkowski spacetime background. To achieve this, we develop the tetrad-spin formulation of $f(Q)$ gravity and derive the corresponding expression for the spin connection. The second correspondence is based on the equivalence of their equations of motion. Utilizing a metric-affine approach, we derive the general affine connection for static and spherically symmetric spacetime in $f(Q)$ gravity and compare its equations of motion with those of $f(T)$ gravity. Among others, our results reveal that, $f(T)$ solutions are not simply a subset of $f(Q)$ solutions; rather, they encompass a complex solution beyond $f(Q)$ gravity in black hole background.</description>

      <title>Constructing Regular Lovelock Black Holes with degenerate vacuum and $\Lambda &lt; 0$, using the gravitational tension. Shadow analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07992v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{Estrada:2024uuu}, a link between gravitational tension (GT) and energy density via the Kretschmann scalar (KS) was proposed to construct regular black holes (RBHs) in Pure Lovelock (PL) gravity. However, including a negative cosmological constant in PL gravity leads to a curvature singularity \cite{Cai:2006pq}. Here, we choose the coupling constants such that the Lovelock equations admit an $n$-fold degenerate AdS vacuum (LnFDGS), allowing us to construct an RBH with $\Lambda &lt; 0$, where the energy density is analogous to the previously mentioned model. To achieve this, we propose alternative definitions for both the KS and GT. We find that, for mass parameter values greater than the extremal value $M_{\text{min}}$, our RBH solution becomes indistinguishable from the AdS vacuum black hole from inside the event horizon out to infinity. At small scales, quantum effects modify the geometry and thermodynamics, removing the singularity. Furthermore, due to the lack of analytical relationships between the event horizon, photon sphere, and shadow in LnFDGS, we propose a numerical method to represent these quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is that infinitesimal rigidity of the moduli space for Hermitian gravitational instantons holds. An important step in the proof is to show that, provided certain boundary conditions hold, a curve of Riemannian metrics passing through a Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein metric is conformally K\"ahler to second perturbative order. This uses ideas of Wu and LeBrun. Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein 4-manifolds have a quasi-locally conserved charge, which is shown to correspond to a parameter of the moduli space. This charge is evaluated for all explicitly known examples. It follows from the proof of our main theorem that infinitesimal Einstein deformations admit a closed 2-form that measures the perturbation in the moduli parameter.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Backreaction in $f(R,G)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for gravitational wave (GW) propagation and their \textbf{nonlinear backreaction} in $f(R, G)$ modified gravity. By developing a scalar-tensor formulation with two auxiliary fields, we systematically investigate both the propagation and backreaction of high-frequency gravitational waves in cosmological backgrounds.
  Within this framework, we derive, for the first time, the complete effective energy-momentum tensor for GWs in $f(R, G)$ theory. The linearized field equations reveal how the Gauss-Bonnet term introduces new curvature-dependent couplings between tensor and scalar degrees of freedom, leading to modified dispersion relations and distinctive wave propagation effects. On de Sitter backgrounds, we obtain exact decoupled equations for the tensor and scalar modes, demonstrating how the additional $G$ dependence alters both the effective masses and energy transport mechanisms compared to the well-established framework of pure $f(R)$ theories.
  Our derivation of the effective energy-momentum tensor extends Isaacson's approach to incorporate the novel scalar field contributions, revealing a complex hierarchy of characteristic length scales ($\lambda$, $\ell$, and $\mathcal{L}$) that govern the backreaction dynamics. The resulting formalism suggests potentially observable signatures in both the propagation (phase shifts, amplitude modulation) and stochastic background of gravitational waves. These effects could be probed by next-generation detectors, offering new constraints on the $f(R, G)$ coupling parameters. The theoretical framework developed here provides a foundation for future studies of gravitational wave generation in modified gravity scenarios and their role in the formation of cosmological structures.</description>

      <title>Modeling Gravitational Wave Modes from the Inspiral of Binaries with Arbitrary Eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eccentric binaries are key targets for current and future gravitational wave (GW) detectors, offering unique insights into the formation and environments of compact binaries. However, accurately and efficiently modeling eccentric waveforms remains challenging, in part due to their complex harmonic structure. In this work, we develop a post-Newtonian (PN) framework to compute the Fourier amplitudes of GWs from the inspiral of eccentric binaries, deriving simple expressions at 1PN order for all relevant $(l, m)$ multipoles, valid for arbitrary eccentricities. We then characterize the GW emission by analyzing the contribution of each $(l, m)$ mode to the strain, its mean frequency, frequency spread, and asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. Additionally, we introduce a method to determine the minimal set of Fourier modes needed to reconstruct the waveform to a given accuracy. Finally, we discuss how our framework can be extended to higher PN orders, obtaining closed-form expressions for the leading-order tail and spin contributions and outlining the steps required to include higher-order corrections. Our results provide both a deeper theoretical understanding of eccentric GW emission and practical tools for developing more accurate and efficient waveform models.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that semiclassical gravity is rendered consistent by considering that quantum systems emit a gravitational field only when they interact with members of Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). These are chains of non-gravitational interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. When systems do not interact with SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of SDCs in a region, spacetime can be flat. This theory holds a version of the equivalence principle, which establishes that different bodies under the same gravitational field evolve similarly in the absence of non-gravitational interactions. It can be tested by experiments investigating the gravitational field emitted by quasi-isolated systems, and the lack of gravity-mediated entanglement and certain kinds of collapse in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment. It provides multiple benefits, such as a semiclassical estimation of the value of the cosmological constant and the prediction of a time-varying dark energy that weakens with time, in agreement with some evidence. More broadly, we propose a new testable framework in which there is a conditional emission of a gravitational field by quantum systems, which may undermine the main motivations for a theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Universality of gravitational radiation from magnetar magnetospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intense magnetic fields inferred from magnetars suggest they may be strong gravitational-wave emitters. Although emissions due to hydromagnetic deformations are more promising from a detection standpoint, exterior fields also contribute a strain. However, numerical evidence suggests that the free energy of stable magnetospheric solutions cannot exceed a few tens of percent relative to the potential state, implying that the magnetospheric contribution to the gravitational-wave luminosity cannot differ significantly between models. This prompts 'universality', in the sense that the strain provides a direct probe of the near-surface field without being muddied by magnetospheric currents. Using a suite of three-dimensional, force-free, general-relativistic solutions for dipole and dipole-plus-quadrupole fields, we find that space-based interferometers may enable marginal detections out to $\lesssim$ kpc distances for slowly-rotating magnetars with fields of $\gtrsim 10^{15}$ G independently of internal deformations.</description>

      <title>Regular black hole's impact on the gravitational waveforms from periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate periodic orbits exhibiting zoom-whirl behavior around a magnetically charged black hole (MCBH) within the framework of the regular black hole. We examine how the magnetic charge influences orbital dynamics by modifying the background spacetime geometry, thereby affecting the energy and angular momentum of particles. In particular, we calculate the radii of the marginally bound orbits (MBOs) and innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs), demonstrating that the magnetic charge parameter reduces both radii. This provides valuable insight into the role of the charge parameter in shaping orbital behavior and altering spacetime geometry. We model the complex motion of a stellar-mass object as a timelike particle, inspiraling into a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the MCBH background, with its trajectory described using periodic geodesic orbits. Based on this analysis of such periodic orbits, we further analyze the gravitational waveforms generated by extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which the SMBH's spacetime dominates the dynamics of the stellar-mass object. By combining particle trajectory analysis with waveform modeling in a semi-analytical approach, we show that the charge parameter significantly alters the zoom-whirl orbital dynamics and induces notable changes in the waveform structure. These results illustrate that future gravitational wave (GW) observations may constrain the properties of MCBHs, thereby deepening our understanding of the gravitational imprint of regular black holes.</description>

Abstract: We derive the phase acquired by a neutral scalar particle propagating along Reissner-Nordstrom geodesics. Considering two flavours propagating on different trajectories which intersect, we plot the interference pattern induced by gravitational lensing from the charged compact object. Although the effect of the charge is subdominant in the metric, it proves to be significant in the phase, and shifts the interference pattern, compared to the Schwarzschild case. This pattern is characterised by two oscillation lengths which, if known, would allow the determination of both eigen masses independently.</description>

      <title>Localized five-dimensional rotating brane-world black hole Analytically Connected to an to an AdS$_5$ boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a method to describe the geometry of an analytic, exponentially localized $5D$ rotating braneworld black hole, using the $5D$ Janis Newman algorithm in Hopf coordinates. The induced metric on the brane matches the standard $4D$ Kerr spacetime. Two curvature singularities arise: one confined to the $3$-brane at $z = r = 0$, and another that, on the brane, reproduces the Kerr singularity at $r = 0$, $\bar{\theta} = \pi/2$. The inner and event horizons, together with the stationary limit hypersurfaces, extend into the extra dimension in a pancake-like shape. We describe their behavior in the bulk.
  The energy momentum tensor represents a source transitioning from an anisotropic, non diagonal structure to a vacuum with negative cosmological constant. Thus, the localized black hole connects to an AdS$_5$ boundary. The geometry is supported by a non-diagonal anisotropic fluid in the bulk, requiring no matter on the brane. To evaluate the energy conditions, we use a one form from the dual basis that yields a diagonal energy momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Could regular primordial black holes be dark matter?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent proposal proposed by Paul Davies and colleagues [Phys. Rev. D \textbf{111} (2025) no.10, 103512] that regular primordial black holes (RPBHs) form stable, zero-temperature remnants and could thereby constitute dark matter is critically examined. While the introduction of a fundamental length scale indeed regulates the Hawking temperature, preventing its divergence, we show that the evaporation timescale for such RPBHs is infinite. This result holds generically for analytic regular black hole spacetimes under standard adiabatic and quasi-static evolution. Consequently, RPBHs never actually reach a true remnant state within any finite time, but instead persist as slowly evaporating objects with a non-zero luminosity. When the combined emission from a cosmological population of these near-remnants is considered, the resulting radiation is found to violate stringent observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background and extragalactic gamma-ray backgrounds. Therefore, low-mass RPBHs are not viable dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Regression of Suspension Violin Modes in KAGRA O3GK Data with Kalman Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suspension thermal modes in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors produce narrow, high-Q spectral lines that can contaminate gravitational searches and bias parameter estimation. In KAGRA, cryogenic mirrors are held by thick suspension fibers, designed to sustain such a low-temperature environment, which may further affect inharmonicity modes, fiber dimensions, and mechanical behavior compared to typical interferometers. As these modes remain a prominent source of narrowband contamination, we implement a Kalman filter to model and track violin lines, building on the methodology introduced in [1], and apply subtraction to KAGRA O3GK data. Using gravitational-wave template injections, we validate that the subtraction preserves matched-filter SNR while effectively suppressing line power. Comparisons of power spectral densities and residual analyses confirm that the method removes deterministic line contributions without introducing waveform distortions. This approach provides a cleaner strain channel for searches and parameter estimation and will become increasingly important for future low-temperature detectors with higher-Q suspensions, such as the Einstein Telescope.</description>

Abstract: By interpreting the difference between the original Regge-Wheeler potential and its piecewise step approximation as perturbative effects induced by the external environment of the black hole, we investigate the stability of Schwarzschild black hole time-domain waveforms. In this work, we employ the Green's function method under the assumption of an observer at spatial infinity to obtain the waveform. For two cases in which the initial Gauss bump near the event horizon or at spatial infinity, we derive analytic expressions for the corresponding waveforms. Our results demonstrate that the waveform is indeed insensitive to tiny modifications of the effective potential, thereby confirming its stability. More importantly, we find that broader initial bumps imprint the influence of small environmental modifications more clearly on the waveform, which may provide theoretical guidance for probing the exterior environment of black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study real-time finite-temperature correlators for free scalars of any mass in a $dS_{d+1}$ static patch in any dimension. We show that whenever the inverse temperature is a rational multiple of the inverse de Sitter temperature, certain Matsubara poles of the symmetric Wightman function disappear. At the de Sitter temperature, we explicitly show how the Lorentzian thermal correlators can all be obtained by analytic continuations from the round $S^{d+1}$. We establish the precise relation between the Harish-Chandra character for $SO(1,d+1)$ and the integrated spectral function, providing a novel dynamical perspective on the former and enabling generalizations. Furthermore, we study scalars with exceptional non-positive masses. We provide a physical picture for the distinctive structures of their characters. For the massless case, we perform a consistent static patch quantization, and find the unique $S^{d+1}$ correlator that analytically continues to the correlators in the quantum theory.</description>

      <title>The essential self-adjointness of the wave operator on radiative spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the essential self-adjointness of the d'Alembertian $\square_g$, allowing a larger class of spacetimes than previously considered, including those that arise from perturbing Minkowski spacetime by gravitational radiation. We emphasize the fact, proven by Taira in closely related settings, that all tempered distributions $u$ satisfying $\square_g u = \lambda u +f$ for $\lambda\in \mathbb{C}\backslash \mathbb{R}$ and $f$ Schwartz are Schwartz. The proof is fully microlocal and relatively quick given the ``de,sc-'' machinery recently developed by the third author.</description>

      <title>On the Holographic Dual of a Symmetry Operator at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological symmetry operators of holographic large $N$ CFT$_D$'s are dual to dynamical branes in the gravity dual AdS$_{D+1}$. We use this correspondence to establish a dictionary between thermal expectation values of symmetry operators in the Euclidean CFT$_D$ and the evaluation of gravitational saddles in the presence of a dynamical brane. Expectation values of $0$-form symmetry operators in the CFT$_D$ are then related to branes wrapped on volume minimizing cycles in the bulk, i.e., the Euclidean continuation of a black hole horizon. We illustrate with some representative examples, including gravity in AdS$_3$, duality / triality defects in 4D $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills theory, and the dual of R-symmetry operators probing 5D BPS black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Memory of Primordial Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signal of binary compact objects has two main contributions at frequencies below the characteristic merger frequency: the gravitational wave signal associated with the early inspiral stage of the binary and the non-linear gravitational wave memory. We compare the sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors to these two contributions, with a particular interest in events with a merger phase at frequencies higher than the detector's peak sensitivity. We demonstrate that for light primordial black holes, current and upcoming detectors are more sensitive to the inspiral signal. Our analysis incorporates the evolution history of primordial black hole binaries, key to accurately estimating the relevant event rates. We also discuss the waveform templates of the memory signal at ground- and space-based interferometers, and the implications for a matched filtering search. This allows us to compare the sensitivity of high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, sensitive to the merger phase, with the sensitivity of existing interferometers.</description>

      <title>Are magnetic fields in cosmic voids primordial?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of magnetic fields in the voids of the large-scale structure of the Universe has been a multifaceted open puzzle for decades. On one hand, their origin is not clear with most of the magnetogenesis models using physics beyond the standard model in the early Universe, and on the other hand, their existence and potential role in explaining the spectra of TeV blazars have been intensely debated in the past decade. Here, we propose a mechanism, within classical electrodynamics, that could fill the voids with late-Universe fields and, under certain conditions, dispel the need for primordial fields altogether to explain the void fields. Specifically, we use the dipole component of the galactic fields to generate space-filling magnetic fields in voids with white-noise spectrum and sufficient amplitude to explain the lack of GeV halos around TeV blazars observed by Fermi-LAT. A definitive test for such fields in the voids will be the white-noise spectral shape, which will constrain possible plasma processes in the voids to the ones that allow for the propagation of these dipole fields into the voids.</description>

      <title>Higher-form (Quasi)Hydrodynamics from Holography: Deformations and Dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the low-energy dynamics of systems with exact and approximate higher-form symmetries using gauge/gravity duality. These symmetries are realised holographically via Maxwell-type theories for massless and massive $p$-forms in AlAdS spacetimes. Double-trace deformations of the boundary theory are considered. While massless theories describe systems with conserved higher-form current, the massive case provides a controlled linearised framework for explicit symmetry breaking induced by defects and charged operators. We perform holographic renormalisation and establish a unified holographic dictionary across a broad theory space, parametrised by spacetime dimension, form rank, quantisation scheme and deformation scale. We compute thermal correlation functions in isotropic black brane backgrounds to characterise the hydrodynamic and quasihydrodynamic regimes of the dual boundary theories. Our analysis reveals a rich structure of relaxation dynamics, emergent photons and duality relations -- including the conventional electric-magnetic Hodge duality and its massive counterpart. These results extend bottom-up holography to include weakly broken higher-form symmetries and open avenues for exploring generalised self-duality constraints and new classes of deformed holographic duals.</description>

      <title>Expectations for the first supermassive black-hole binary resolved by PTAs II: Milestones for binary characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the recent evidence for a gravitational wave (GW) background found by pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments, the next major science milestone is resolving individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The detection of these systems could arise via searches using a power-based GW anisotropy model or a deterministic template model. In Schult et al. 2025, we compared the efficacy of these models in constraining the GW signal from a single SMBHB using realistic, near-future PTA datasets, and found that the full-signal deterministic continuous wave (CW) search may achieve detection and characterization first. Here, we continue our analyses using only the CW model given its better performance, focusing now on characterization milestones. We examine the order in which CW parameters are constrained as PTA data are accumulated and the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) grows. We also study how these parameter constraints vary across sources of different sky locations and GW frequencies. We find that the GW frequency and strain are generally constrained at the same time (or S/N), closely followed by the sky location, and later the chirp mass (if the source is highly evolving) and inclination angle. At fixed S/N, sources at higher frequencies generally achieve better precision on the GW frequency, chirp mass, and sky location. The time (and S/N) at which the signal becomes constrained is dependent on the sky location and frequency of the source, with the effects of pulsar terms and PTA geometry playing crucial roles in source detection and localization.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT phase transitions and criticality for charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of spherically symmetric, charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The gravitational thermodynamics of Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes can be extended by allowing for variations of the cosmological constant and Newton's constant. In the dual CFT this corresponds to including the central charge C and its chemical potential $\mu$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables. In addition, compared to Einstein's theory of gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity introduces higher-order curvature terms. The coupling constants of these higher-order curvature terms $\alpha$ can serve as new thermodynamic quantities, which will also be dual to thermodynamic quantities on the boundary CFT, a feature not present in the CFT dual to Einstein's gravity previously. Based on the holographic dictionary, we consider the critical behavior and phase transition phenomena of the CFT description of the charged Gauss-Bonnet black holes in $d=4$ and $d=5$ in the ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$. We find that the conventional description of free energy cannot adequately describe the phase transitions and critical behavior of the CFT in this ensemble. Perhaps a new understanding and description should be introduced.</description>
