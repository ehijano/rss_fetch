      <title>On a class of third order differential equations describing pseudospherical or spherical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study third order nonlinear partial differential equations which describe surfaces of constant curvature. From the flatness of connection 1-forms, we present a classification of equations with the type $u_t - u_{xxt} = \lambda u^2 u_{xxx} + G(u, u_x, u_{xx}) (\lambda\in\mathbb{R})$, which describe pseudospherical or spherical surfaces. We show that series of typical soliton equations belong to certain subclass, such as the generalized Camassa-Holm equation, which gives a geometric explanation to these equations.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of scattering on combinatorial graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate numerically the scattering of waves on discrete graphs. An efficient algorithm is developed to compute the reflection and transmission (spectral) coefficients. We then explore various configurations of input and output leads, demonstrating how bound states arising from specific vertex-lead connections result in total reflection. The impedance of the leads is shown to influence the spectral coefficients in a predictable manner. Furthermore, for a given input lead we show that the total transmission of a wave packet can be maximized by appropriately selecting the exit lead. Finally, we analyze the spectral signatures of defects within the graph and find that they vary depending on both the defect's location and its spectral characteristics thus enabling its identification.</description>

      <title>Higher order linear differential equations for unitary matrix integrals: applications and generalisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider characterisations of the class of unitary matrix integrals $ \langle (\det U)^q e^{s^{1/2} {\rm Tr}(U + U^\dagger)} \rangle_{U(l)}$ in terms of a first order matrix linear differential equation for a vector function of size $l+1$, and in terms of a scalar linear differential equation of degree $l+1$. It will be shown that the latter follows from the former. The matrix linear differential equation provides an efficient way to compute the power series expansion of the matrix integrals, which with $q=0$ and $q=l$ are of relevance to the enumeration of longest increasing subsequences for random permutations, and to the question of the moments of the first and second derivative of the Riemann zeta on the critical line respectively. This procedure is compared against that following from known characterisations involving the $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III$'$ second order nonlinear differential equation. We show too that that the natural $\beta$ generalisation of the unitary group integral permits characterisation by the same classes of linear differential equations.</description>

      <title>Semi-local observables, edge modes and quantum reference frames in quantum electromagnetism: an algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundaries and corners of spacetime play a vital role in understanding physical concepts including entanglement entropy, the infrared problem in QFT and quantum gravity. Standard local quantum field theory struggles to accommodate such boundary-sensitive observables. In this paper we develop an algebraic framework for \emph{semi-local quantum electromagnetism} on finite Cauchy lenses: a class of compact spacetimes with boundaries and corner. At the classical level, we establish a decomposition of the reduced covariant phase space into bulk closed-loop and surface sectors and demonstrate how the covariant phase space approach relates to the Peierls bracket construction commonly used in perturbative algebraic quantum field theory. Upon quantisation, we obtain a Weyl $C^{*}$-algebra of semi-local observables transforming non-trivially under large gauge transformations (those with non-trivial boundary contribution). To recover gauge invariance, we invoke the notion of \emph{quantum reference frames} (QRFs) and construct a relativisation map, where we treat auxiliary surface degrees of freedom as QRFs for the large gauge transformations. The relativisation map is constructed directly on the level of $C^{*}$-algebras, making our construction state-independent. The QRF viewpoint on semi-local observables provides new tools for understanding gauge theories on manifolds with boundary, including the problem of gluing theories on Cauchy lenses with common boundaries.</description>

      <title>Bohr--Sommerfeld rules for systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete, self-contained formulation of the Bohr--Sommerfeld quantization rule for a semiclassical self-adjoint $2 \times 2$ system on the real line, arising from a simple closed curve in phase space. We focus on the case where the principal symbol exhibits eigenvalue crossings within the domain enclosed by the curve -- a situation commonly encountered in Dirac-type operators. Building on earlier work on scalar Bohr--Sommerfeld rules and semiclassical treatments of the Harper operator near rational flux quanta, we identify additional contributions to the quantization condition, and derive concise expressions for general self-adjoint $2 \times 2$ systems. The resulting formulas give explicit geometric phase corrections and clarify when these phases take quantized values.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear diffusion in relativistic kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonlinear Lorentz invariant kinetic diffusion equation is introduced, which is consistent with the conservation laws of particles number, energy and momentum. The equilibrium solution converges to the Maxwellian density in the Newtonian limit, but it is not given by the J\"uttner distribution commonly employed in relativistic kinetic theory. The nonlinear kinetic diffusion equation on a general Lorentzian manifold is consistent with the contracted Bianchi identities and therefore can be coupled to the Einstein equations of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Bondi-type accretion onto a Kerr black hole in the kinetic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an exact solution representing a Bondi-type stationary accretion of a kinetic (Vlasov) gas onto the Kerr black hole. The solution is exact in the sense that relevant physical quantities, such as the particle current density or the accretion rates, are expressed as explicit integrals, which can be evaluated numerically. Whereas the angular momentum accretion rate is shown to vanish exactly, we provide an analytic approximation which allows us to obtain simple formulas for the mass and energy accretion rates. These formulas are used to derive characteristic time scales of the black hole mass growth and the associated spin-down in two different scenarios: assuming that the ambient energy density is either constant or decreases on a cosmological scale.</description>

      <title>A Closed-form Approximation for Impulse Response of Fractionally Damped Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a fractionally damped oscillator, where the damping term is expressed by the Caputo fractional derivative of order $\beta\in (0,1).$ The impulse response of this oscillator can be expressed in terms of the bivariate Mittag-Leffler function consisting of a double infinite series. Although this series is uniformly convergent, its numerical implementation suffers from computational instabilities. In this contribution, we propose an approximate closed-form solution that avoids these numerical pitfalls while maintaining a reasonable accuracy. The resulting approximation is computationally efficient and robust, making it suitable for practical engineering applications.</description>

Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of a Coulomb gas system in the determinantal case on compact Riemann surfaces of any genus g. Our main tool is the bosonization formula relating the analytic torsion and geometric quantities including the Green functions appearing in the definition of this partition function. As a result, we prove the geometric version of the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture in the determinantal case.</description>

      <title>High-order fully well-balanced numerical methods for one-dimensional blood flow with discontinuous properties, friction and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present well-balanced, high-order, semi-discrete numerical schemes for one-dimensional blood flow models with discontinuous mechanical properties and algebraic source terms representing friction and gravity. While discontinuities in model parameters are handled using the Generalized Hydrostatic Reconstruction, the presence of algebraic source terms implies that steady state solutions cannot always be computed analytically. In fact, steady states are defined by an ordinary differential equation that needs to be integrated numerically. Therefore, we resort on a numerical reconstruction operator to identify and, where appropriate, preserve steady states with an accuracy that depends on the reconstruction operator's numerical scheme. We extend our methods to deal with networks of vessels and show numerical results for single- and multiple-vessel tests, including a network of 118 vessels, demonstrating the capacity of the presented methods to outperform naive discretizations of the equations under study.</description>

      <title>Integrability from a Single Conservation Law in Quantum Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e., integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.</description>

      <title>Existence of transmission eigenvalues for biharmonic scattering by a clamped planar region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the so-called clamped transmission eigenvalue problem. This is a new transmission eigenvalue problem that is derived from the scattering of an impenetrable clamped obstacle in a thin elastic plate. The scattering problem is modeled by a biharmonic wave operator given by the Kirchhoff--Love infinite plate problem in the frequency domain. These scattering problems have not been studied to the extent of other models. Unlike other transmission eigenvalue problems, the problem studied here is a system of homogeneous PDEs defined in all of $\mathbb{R}^2$. This provides unique analytical and computational difficulties when studying the clamped transmission eigenvalue problem. We are able to prove that there exist infinitely many real clamped transmission eigenvalues. This is done by studying the equivalent variational formulation. We also investigate the relationship of the clamped transmission eigenvalues to the Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the negative Laplacian for the bounded scattering obstacle.</description>

      <title>On W-algebras and ODE/IM correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ODE/IM correspondence for two-dimensional conformal field theories with Virasoro and $\mathcal{W}_N$ symmetry. Building on earlier work establishing the correspondence, we develop a systematic algorithm for calculating the eigenvalues of local integrals of motion in terms of the Bethe roots using formal WKB expansions of wave functions associated to the differential operators. The method is demonstrated explicitly for Virasoro, $\mathcal{W}_3$, and $\mathcal{W}_4$ algebras, yielding closed expressions for the eigenvalues of the first few local quantum KdV Hamiltonians. A key geometric structure emerging from our analysis is the mirror curve, a three-punctured sphere that is naturally covered by the WKB curve. We show how the algebraic properties of the $\mathcal{W}$-symmetry algebras are reflected in the geometry of these curves, and how period integrals on these curves reproduce the spectral data of the integrable system. Applications to Argyres-Douglas minimal models allow us to test the prescription both analytically and numerically and we find complete agreement between the calculations in different triality frames. Finally, we examine large rank limits of ground state eigenvalues and show that they match the genus expansion of the topological string partition function on $\mathbb{C}^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the classical and quantum problems for the 1D sigma model with target space the flag manifold $\mathrm{U}(3)\over \mathrm{U}(1)^3$, equipped with the most general invariant metric. In particular, we explicitly describe all geodesics in terms of elliptic functions and demonstrate that the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator may be found by solving polynomial (Bethe) equations. The main technical tool that we use is a mapping between the sigma model and a Gaudin model, which is also shown to hold in the $\mathrm{U}(n)$ case.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of observables in four-dimensional superconformal Yang--Mills theories which, in the planar limit at finite 't Hooft coupling, can be expressed as determinants of semi-infinite matrices built from Bessel functions. This determinant representation points to an underlying integrable structure, which we make explicit by showing that the observables satisfy a nonlinear differential-difference equation. We argue that the solution to this equation admits an expansion in terms of iterated Chen integrals of uniform transcendental weight. Remarkably, the coefficients in this expansion are universal positive integers, independent of the particular observable, suggesting a hidden combinatorial origin. Building on this observation, we show that the resulting expressions possess a natural interpretation in enumerative combinatorics: they coincide with the partition function (or generating function) of an ensemble of lattice paths constrained to a nontrivial domain. This correspondence extends and generalizes the classical Dyck paths to a richer family of path ensembles relevant in gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Planar percolation and the loop O(n) model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a large class of site percolation processes on any planar graph contains either zero or infinitely many infinite connected components. The assumptions that we require are: tail triviality, positive association (FKG) and that the set of open vertices is stochastically dominated by the set of closed ones. This covers the case of Bernoulli site percolation at parameter $p\leq 1/2$ and resolves Conjecture 8 from the work of Benjamini and Schramm from 1996. Our result also implies that $p_c\geq 1/2$ for any invariantly amenable unimodular random rooted planar graph.
  Furthermore, we apply our statement to the loop O(n) model on the hexagonal lattice and confirm a part of the phase diagram conjectured by Nienhuis in 1982: the existence of infinitely many loops around every face whenever $n\in [1,2]$ and $x\in [1/\sqrt{2},1]$. The point $n=2,x=1/\sqrt{2}$ is conjectured to be critical. This is the first instance that this behavior has been proven in such a large region of parameters. In a big portion of this region, the loop O(n) model has no known FKG representation. We apply our percolation result to quenched distributions that can be described as divide and color models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1709.07309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and an irreducible faithful representation $\pi$ of $\mathfrak{g}$, we introduce the Schur polynomials of $(\mathfrak{g},\pi)$-type. We then derive the Sato-Zhou type formula for tau functions of the Drinfeld-Sokolov (DS) hierarchy of $\mathfrak{g}$-type. Namely, we show that the tau functions are linear combinations of the Schur polynomials of $(\mathfrak{g},\pi)$-type with the coefficients being the Pl\"ucker coordinates. As an application, we provide a way of computing polynomial tau functions for the DS hierarchy. For $\mathfrak{g}$ of low rank, we give several examples of polynomial tau functions, and use them to detect bilinear equations for the DS hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: In this work we consider a suitable generalization of the Feynman path integral on a specific class of Riemannian manifolds consisting of compact Lie groups with bi-invariant Riemannian metrics. The main tools we use are the Cartan development map, the notion of oscillatory integral, and the Chernoff approximation theorem. We prove that, for a class of functions of a dense subspace of the relevant Hilbert space, the Feynman map produces the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, where the Laplace-Beltrami operator coincides with the second order Casimir operator of the group.</description>

      <title>On classical aspects of Bose-Einstein condensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Berezin and Weyl quantization are renown procedures for mapping, commutative Poisson algebras of observables to their non-commutative, quantum counterparts. The latter is famous for its use on Weyl algebras, while the former is more appropriate for continuous functions decaying at infinity. In this work, we define a variant of the Berezin quantization map, which acts on the classical Weyl algebra $\mathcal{W}(E,0)$ and constitutes a positive \textit{strict deformation quantization}. This construction provides a natural framework to compare classical and quantum thermal equilibrium states of a Bose gas through the computation of their semi-classical limit.
  To this end, we first introduce a purely algebraic notion of KMS states for the classical Weyl algebra and establish that, in finite volume, there exists a unique such state, which can be interpreted as the Fourier transform of a Gibbs measure on a Hilbert space. We then construct a new class of classical KMS states that realize representations of the canonical commutation relations with infinite local density. These states arise as the semi-classical high-density limit of the quantum equilibrium states originally studied by Araki and Woods \cite{Araki_Woods_63}. A key feature of our approach is that it preserves the macroscopic ground-state occupation of the Bose gas in the classical regime. Finally, we demonstrate that the infinite-volume classical states can be obtained as thermodynamic limits of finite-volume Gibbs states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous construction of generalized spin--boson models with commuting transition matrices and form factors exhibiting critical ultraviolet (UV) divergences. That is, we cover all divergences where a self-energy renormalization, but no non-Fock representation, is required. Our method is based on a direct definition of the renormalized Hamiltonian on a sufficiently large test domain, followed by a Friedrichs extension. We then prove that this Hamiltonian coincides with the one obtained by cut-off renormalization. Furthermore, we show that for specific supercritical cases, i.e., when a non-Fock representation is required, the renormalized Hamiltonian is trivial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that random walks on a family of tilings of d-dimensional Euclidean space, with a canonical choice of conductances, converge to Brownian motion modulo time parameterization. This class of tilings includes Delaunay triangulations (the dual of Voronoi tesselations) and sphere packings. Our regularity assumptions are deterministic and mild. For example, our results apply to Delaunay triangulations with vertices sampled from a d-dimensional Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure. As part of our proof, we establish the uniform convergence of certain finite volume schemes for the Laplace equation, with quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence. In the special case of two dimensions, we give a new, short proof of the main result of Gurel-Gurevich--Jerison--Nachmias (2020).</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Origin of Detachable Boundary States in Topological Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While topology can impose obstructions to exponentially localized Wannier functions, certain topological insulators are exempt from such Wannier obstructions. The absence of the Wannier obstructions can further accompany topological boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. Here, we elucidate a close connection between these detachable topological boundary states and non-Hermitian topology. Identifying topological boundary states as non-Hermitian topology, we demonstrate that intrinsic non-Hermitian topology leads to the inevitable spectral flow. By contrast, we show that extrinsic non-Hermitian topology underlies the detachment of topological boundary states and clarify anti-Hermitian topology of the detached boundary states. Based on this connection and $K$-theory, we complete the tenfold classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states.</description>

      <title>$K$-theory classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hallmark of certain topology, including the Chern number, is the obstruction to constructing exponentially localized Wannier functions in the bulk bands. Conversely, other types of topology do not necessarily impose Wannier obstructions. Remarkably, such Wannier-localizable topological insulators can host boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. In our accompanying Letter [D. Nakamura {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 096601 (2025), arXiv:2407.09458], we demonstrate that non-Hermitian topology underlies detachable boundary states in Hermitian topological insulators and superconductors, thereby establishing their tenfold classification based on internal symmetry. Here, using $K$-theory, we elucidate the relationship between Wannier localizability and detachability of topological boundary states. From the boundary perspective, we classify intrinsic and extrinsic non-Hermitian topology, corresponding to nondetachable and detachable topological boundary states, respectively. From the bulk perspective, on the other hand, we classify Wannier localizability through the homomorphisms of topological phases from the tenfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes to the threefold Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. Notably, these two approaches from the boundary and bulk perspectives lead to the same classification. We clarify this agreement and develop a unified understanding of the bulk-boundary correspondence on the basis of $K$-theory.</description>

Abstract: We consider entropy-optimal graphons associated with extreme and near-extreme constraints on the densities of edges and triangles. We prove that the optimizers for near-extreme constraints are unique and multipodal and are perturbations of the previously known unique optimzers for extreme constraints. This proves the existence of infinitely many phases. We determine the podal structures in these phases and prove the existence of phase transitions between them.</description>

      <title>Quantitative relaxation dynamics from generic initial configurations in the inertial Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relaxation dynamics of the inertial Kuramoto model toward a phase-locked state from a generic initial phase configuration. For this, we propose a sufficient framework in terms of initial data and system parameters for asymptotic phase-locking. It can be roughly stated as set of conditions such as a positive initial order parameter, a coupling strength sufficiently larger than initial frequency diameter and intrinsic frequency diameter, but less than the inverse of inertia. Under the proposed framework, generic initial configuration undergoes three dynamic stages (initial layer, condensation and relaxation stages) before it reaches a phase-locked state asymptotically. The first stage is the initial layer stage in analogy with fluid mechanics, during which the effect of the initial natural frequency distribution is dominant, compared to that of the sinusoidal coupling between oscillators. The second stage is the condensation stage, during which the order parameter increases, and at the end of which a majority cluster is contained in a sufficiently small arc. Finally, the third stage is the persistence and relaxation stage, during which the majority cluster remains stable (persistence) and the total configuration relaxes toward a phase-locked state asymptotically (relaxation). The intricate proof involves with several key tools such as the quasi-monotonicity of the order parameter (for the condensation stage), a nonlinear Gr\"onwall inequality on the diameter of the majority cluster (for the persistence stage), and a variant of the classical {\L}ojasiewicz gradient theorem (for the relaxation stage).</description>

      <title>A Lorentz Covariant Matrix Model for Bosonic M2-Branes: Nambu Brackets and Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Lorentz covariant matrix model as a nonperturbative formulation of the bosonic M2-brane in M-theory. Unlike previous approaches relying on the light-cone gauge or symmetry-based constructions, our model retains full 11-dimensional Lorentz invariance by introducing a novel gauge-fixing condition that restricts the symmetry of volume-preserving deformations (VPD) to a subclass, which we call restricted VPD (RVPD). This restriction enables a consistent matrix regularization of the Nambu bracket, bypassing the long-standing obstructions related to the Leibniz rule and the Fundamental Identity. The resulting model exhibits RVPD symmetry, admits particle-like and noncommutative membrane solutions, and lays the foundation for a Lorentz-invariant, nonperturbative matrix description of M2-branes. Our work offers a new paradigm for constructing Lorentz-invariant matrix models of membranes, revisiting the algebraic structure underlying M-theory.</description>

      <title>Derivations for the MPS overlap formulas of rational spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a universal formula for the overlaps between integrable matrix product states (MPS) and Bethe eigenstates in $\mathfrak{gl}_{N}$ symmetric spin chains. This formula expresses the normalized overlap as a product of a MPS-independent Gaudin-determinant ratio and a MPS-dependent scalar factor constructed from eigenvalues of commuting operators, defined via the $K$-matrix associated with the MPS. Our proof is fully representation-independent and relies solely on algebraic Bethe Ansatz techniques and the $KT$-relation. We also propose a generalization of the overlap formula to $\mathfrak{so}_{N}$ and $\mathfrak{sp}_{N}$ spin chains, supported by algebra embeddings and low-rank isomorphisms. These results significantly broaden the class of integrable initial states for which exact overlap formulas are available, with implications for quantum quenches and defect CFTs.</description>

Abstract: We consider a general class of $n\times n$ random band matrices with bandwidth $W$. When $W^2\ll n$, we prove that with high probability the eigenvectors of such matrices are localized and decay exponentially at the sharp scale $W^2$. Combined with the delocalization results of Yau and Yin [arXiv:2501.01718] and of Erd\H{o}s and Riabov [arXiv:2506.06441], this establishes the conjectured localization-delocalization transition for a large class of random band matrices.</description>
