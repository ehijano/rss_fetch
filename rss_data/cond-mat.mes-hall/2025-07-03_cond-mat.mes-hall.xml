      <title>Pedagogical approach to anomalous position and velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss a pedagogical method in deriving the expressions for anomalous position and velocity. While we follow the steps used in optics in the derivation of the group velocity, we use Bloch wave functions instead of plane wave states. In comparison to the plane wave case, application of Bloch wave functions results in two additional terms in the expression of the group velocity: the Berry phase factor and anomalous position contributions. These two new terms with distinct origins eventually lead to the known anomalous velocity. Aiming for an intuitive understanding, we simulate the situation under an electric field using linear-combination-of-atomic-orbital states and visually demonstrate that the envelope function exhibits the transverse motion expected from an anomalous velocity.</description>

      <title>Localized and quasi-localized energy levels in the electron spectrum of graphene with isolated boron and nitrogen substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the calculation and analysis of local Green functions of impurity atoms of low concentration in a two-dimensional graphene lattice, the conditions for the formation and characteristics of local discrete levels with energies lying outside the band of the quasi-continuous spectrum and quasi-localized states with energies near the Fermi one are determined. Specific calculations were performed for boron and nitrogen impurity atoms, which can actually replace carbon in graphite and graphene nanostructures. For a boron impurity that forms local discrete levels outside the band of the quasi-continuous spectrum, sufficiently simple analytical expressions for the conditions for their formation, energy, intensity at the impurity atom, and damping parameter are obtained. An analysis of the formation of states quasi-localized on nitrogen impurities with energy near the Fermi level in graphene nanostructures was carried out.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-loss diamond nanomechanics enabled by van der Waals self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanomechanical systems are critical platforms for precision measurement, sensing, macroscopic quantum physics, and emerging quantum-information technologies. In these applications, high mechanical quality factors, often achieved using dissipation dilution, are important since they directly enhance measurement sensitivity and quantum coherence. However, surface stiction intrinsic to nanoscale structures severely limits their performance. Here, we transform this longstanding obstacle into a solution for tension-enabled dissipation dilution, via a novel van der Waals (vdW) self-assembly method. Leveraging intrinsic nanoscale surface interactions, we achieve controlled tensile stresses up to 1.3GPa in single-crystal diamond--an ideal but notoriously difficult material to strain-engineer--without introducing additional interface losses. We demonstrate mechanical quality factors exceeding 100 million at 5K, surpassing state-of-the-art systems at comparable aspect ratios. This versatile approach, applicable to other crystalline materials, opens up avenues using cryogenic nanomechanical systems for ultra-precise quantum sensing, tests of quantum gravity, and hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Floquet spin textures in optically pumped non-Hermitian surface states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical effects of quantum matter with interaction are key to physics and technology. The class of non-Hermitian (NH) phenomena is mostly explored in cold atoms, photonics, and metamaterials out of equilibrium. Effective NH systems due to interaction in equilibrium solids, however, provide a unique opportunity for realizing light-NH matter hybrids via periodic irradiation. Given NH topological surface states with magnetic disorder, here we reveal spectroscopically observable Floquet spin textures for this hybrid quantum matter: merged meron strings, dichroic skyrmions, and domain structure accompanying vortices in energy planes; Bloch lines and topologically twisted vortex rings distinct from Hopfions in energy-momentum space; topological selectiveness of linear polarization occurs besides circular dichroism. Spectroscopic energy evolution and chemical potential dependence are key ingredients of this open hybrid system. With spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, this scenario bears prime physical interest by reaching the crossroad between solid-state interaction effects, non-Hermiticity, and light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced magnetoconductivity, magnetoresistivity, and the Hall effect in massive-massless fermion mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of two types of holes, namely the Dirac holes and the heavy holes, in a two-dimensional sample exposed to a weak external permanent magnetic field leads to the emergence of the temperature and magnetic field-dependent contribution to the resistivity due to their interactions. Taking a HgTe-based two-dimensional semimetal as a testbed, we develop a theoretical model describing the role of interactions between the degenerate massive and Dirac particles for the resistivity in the presence of a classical magnetic field. If only the Dirac holes are present in the system, the magnetoconductivity acquires a finite interaction-induced contribution which would be vanishing for the parabolic spectrum. It demonstrates $T^4 \ln(1/T)$ behavior at low temperatures for screened Coulomb interhole interaction potential, asymptotically reaching $T^2$ with increasing temperature. However, the magnetoresistivity and the Hall effect are not affected by the Dirac holes interparticle correlations. Instead, the presence of two types of holes provides a finite contribution to the magnetoconductivity, magnetoresistivity, and the classical Hall effect resistivity. The temperature behavior of the magnetoconductivity here is $T^2$ in the case of the short-range constant interparticle interaciton potential and $T^2 \ln(1/T)$ for the bare unscreened Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>The effect of doping layers position on the heterojunction sharpness in (In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effect of doped layer placed in structures with indirect band-gap (In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots (QDs) on heterointerface sharpness is investigated. We demonstrate that growth of n (p) doped layer below QDs sheet leads to pronounced deceleration (acceleration) for dynamics of exciton recombination (which is very sensitive to heterointeface structure in these QDs) in compare with the undoped structure. Opposite, the placing of the same doped layers above the QDs sheet does not effect on the exciton recombination dynamic at all. The experimental data are explained by increase (decrease) charged vacancy formation rate in the cation sublattice, that result in QD/matrix interface bluring (sharping), with the increases in the electron (hole) concentration at this heterointerface formation. The thicknesses of the diffuse layer on QD/matrix heterointerface estimated is in range from 0 up to 5 in the lattice constant depending on doped layer placing.</description>

      <title>Defects Potentials for Two-Dimensional Topological Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For non-topological quantum materials, introducing defects can significantly alter their properties by modifying symmetry and generating a nonzero analytical index, thus transforming the material into a topological one. We present a method to construct the potential matrix configuration with the purpose of obtaining a non-zero analytical index, akin to a topological invariant like a winding or Chern number. We establish systematic connections between these potentials, expressed in the continuum limit, and their initial tight-binding model description. We apply our method to graphene with an adatom, a vacancy, and both as key examples illustrating our comprehensive description. This method enables analytical differentiation between topological and non-topological zero-energy modes and allows for the construction of defects that induce topology.</description>

      <title>Rashba-induced spin Hall response in a disordered $WTe_2$ four-terminal structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paramount acumen for controlling spin transport properties in nonmagnetic materials is the usage of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We propose a model to calculate the spin hall angle (SHA) for the elemental transition metal dichalcogenide compound, $WTe_2$ entrenched on the intrinsic Rashba SOC. This model, is based on the Landauer-Buttiker formalism for quantum transport, and the $4$-terminal device setup with the presence of disorder from random onsite potential fluctuations. The SHA, including the mean and RMS values, also illustrate the mesoscopic oscillations, and the values obtained are $25\%$ and $30\%$, respectively. The variation pattern of charge and spin current, along with the mean and spin Hall conductance, can be a comparative measure for other TMDs and monolayer Xenes. To validate our outcomes, we compare our results with experimental data and numerically extract real-space simulation results based on the nearest-neighbor tight binding (NNTB) model. Also our results are in line with the scaling theory of localization. This work sets the stage to calculate the spin Hall angle and spin Hall conductivity for other elemental monolayer Xenes and TMDs, considering the intrinsic scattering mechanisms. An extension of this work will be to explore the possible spintronics applications for extrinsic scattering, including side-jump and skew-jump scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Tunable Dot Platform for Controlling Electron Flow in Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an innovative graphene-based architecture to control electronic current flows. The tunable dot platform (TDP) consists of an array of gated dots, with independently adjustable potentials, embedded in graphene. Inspired by Mie theory, and leveraging multiscattering effects, we demonstrate that tailored current behavior can be achieved due to the variety of possible dot configurations. Optimization is performed using differential evolution, which identifies configurations that maximize specific objectives, such as directing or splitting an electron beam by tuning the angular dependence of scattering. Our results demonstrate the potential of the TDP to provide precise control over induced current flows in graphene, making it a promising component for next-generation electronic and electron optic devices.</description>

      <title>Single-shot parity readout of a minimal Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting qubits from noise is essential for building reliable quantum computers. Topological qubits offer a route to this goal by encoding quantum information non-locally, using pairs of Majorana zero modes. These modes form a shared fermionic state whose occupation -- either even or odd -- defines the fermionic parity that encodes the qubit. Crucially, this parity cannot be accessed by any measurement that probes only one Majorana mode. This reflects the non-local nature of the encoding and its inherent protection against noise. A promising platform for realizing such qubits is the Kitaev chain, implemented in quantum dots coupled via superconductors. Even a minimal chain of two dots can host a pair of Majorana modes and store quantum information in their joint parity. Here we introduce a new technique for reading out this parity, based on quantum capacitance. This global probe senses the joint state of the chain and enables real-time, single-shot discrimination of the parity state. By comparing with simultaneous local charge sensing, we confirm that only the global signal resolves the parity. We observe random telegraph switching and extract parity lifetimes exceeding one millisecond. These results establish the essential readout step for time-domain control of Majorana qubits, resolving a long-standing experimental challenge.</description>

      <title>Spin-disorder-induced angular anisotropy in polarized magnetic neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally report a hitherto unseen angular anisotropy in the polarized small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) cross section of a magnetically strongly inhomogeneous material. Based on an analytical prediction using micromagnetic theory, the difference between the spin-up and spin-down SANS cross sections is expected to show a spin-disorder-induced anisotropy. The effect is particularly pronounced in inhomogeneous magnetic materials, such as nanoporous ferromagnets, magnetic nanocomposites, or steels, which exhibit large nanoscale jumps in the saturation magnetization at internal pore-matrix or particle-matrix interfaces. Analysis of the experimental neutron data constitutes a method for determining the exchange-stiffness constant. Our results are generic to the nuclear-magnetic interference terms contained in the polarized magnetic neutron scattering cross section and might also be of relevance to other neutron techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plasmon is a well established collective excitation of metals in the visible and near UV but at much lower frequencies dissipation destroys all trace of the plasmon and typical Drude behaviour sets in. We propose a mechanism for depression of the plasma frequency into the far infra red or even GHz band: periodic structures build of very thin wires dilute the average concentration of electrons and considerably enhance the effective electron mass through self-inductance. Computations replicate the key features and confirm our analytic theory. The new structure has novel properties not observed before in the GHz band, including some possible impact on superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond signatures of optically induced magnons before ultrafast demagnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically induced demagnetization of 3d metallic ferromagnets proceeds as fast as ~100 fs and is a crucial prerequisite for spintronic applications, such as ultrafast magnetization switching and spin transport. On the 100 fs time scale, the magnetization dynamics is widely understood in the context of temperature models considering energy transfers between conduction electrons, magnons and crystal lattice. However, on even faster time scales, the flow of both angular momentum and energy between these subsystems has so far not been studied. Here, we measure ultrafast demagnetization by ultrabroadband THz-emission spectroscopy. We find that the rate of change of the magnetization does not rise instantaneously, but on a time scale as short as 10 fs. This rise is a signature that a transfer of angular momentum from the magnons to conduction electrons proceeds in less than 10 fs, before substantial demagnetization has happened. We further conclude that most of the spin dissipated by the lattice is transferred via magnon-lattice rather than electron-lattice interaction. These results show that the limiting speed of magnetization dynamics is not demagnetization, as generally believed, and harnessing the earliest magnon dynamics could be a new route towards an even faster spintronics.</description>

      <title>On the influence of reference sample properties on magnetic force microscopy calibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) allows the characterization of magnetic stray field distributions with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. Based on a suitable calibration procedure, MFM can also yield quantitative magnetic field values. This process typically involves measuring a reference sample to determine the distribution of the tip's stray field or stray field gradient at the sample surface. This distribution is called the tip transfer function (TTF) and is derived through regularized deconvolution in Fourier space. The properties of the reference sample and the noise characteristics of the detection system significantly influence the derived TTF, thereby limiting its validity range. In a recent study, the tip stray field distribution, and hence the TTF, of an MFM tip was independently measured in real space using a nitrogen vacancy center as a quantum sensor, revealing considerable discrepancies with the reference-sample-based TTF. Here, we analyze the influence of the feature distribution of the reference sample and the MFM measurement parameters on the resulting TTF. We explain the observed differences between quantum-calibrated stray field distributions and the classical approach by attributing them to a loss of information due to missing or suppressed spectral components. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of the spectral coverage of the TTF. Our findings indicate that for high-quality reconstruction of the stray field of a sample under test (SUT), it is more critical to ensure a strong overlap of frequency components between the reference sample and the SUT than to achieve an accurate real-space reconstruction of the tip stray field distribution.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Orbital Hall Effect and Orbital Relaxation in Mesoscopic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in orbitronics, the influence of disorder on the orbital Hall effect and orbital relaxation mechanisms remains poorly understood. In this work, we numerically investigate the role of disorder in orbital transport within mesoscopic devices using a real-space tight-binding model on a two-dimensional square lattice that hosts atomic orbitals capable of carrying atomic orbital angular momentum. By considering devices with varying geometries--square and rectangular--and systematically tuning disorder strength, we examine the disorder effect on orbital Hall current (OHC) generation, and orbital relaxation. Our results reveal a strong dependence of the OHC and orbital Hall angle on disorder strength. In square devices, we demonstrate that the orbital Hall response can be strongly enhanced by disorder and its dependence on the disorder strength indicates the dominance of skew-scattering mechanism in the diffusive regime. In rectangular geometries, the orbital current decays exponentially with increasing device width, from which the orbital relaxation length is extracted. These findings provide critical insights into disorder-driven orbital transport phenomena and lay the foundation for designing next-generation orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Helical spin dynamics in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ as measured with small-angle neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The insulating chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ exhibits a rich array of low-temperature magnetic phenomena, making it a prime candidate for the study of its spin dynamics. Using spin wave small-angle neutron scattering (SWSANS), we systematically investigated the temperature-dependent behavior of the helimagnon excitations in the field-polarized phase of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. Our measurements, spanning 5-55 K, reveal the temperature evolution of spin-wave stiffness and damping constant with unprecedented resolution, facilitated by the insulating nature of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. These findings align with theoretical predictions and resolve discrepancies observed in previous studies, emphasizing the enhanced sensitivity of the SWSANS method. The results provide deeper insights into the fundamental magnetic properties of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, contributing to a broader understanding of chiral magnets.</description>

      <title>Temperature and Magnetic-Field Dependence of Energy Relaxation in a Fluxonium Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise from material defects at device interfaces is known to limit the coherence of superconducting circuits, yet our understanding of the defect origins and noise mechanisms remains incomplete. Here we investigate the temperature and in-plane magnetic-field dependence of energy relaxation in a low-frequency fluxonium qubit, where the sensitivity to flux noise and charge noise arising from dielectric loss can be tuned by applied flux. We observe an approximately linear scaling of flux noise with temperature $T$ and a power-law dependence of dielectric loss $T^3$ up to 100 mK. Additionally, we find that the dielectric-loss-limited $T_1$ decreases with weak in-plane magnetic fields, suggesting a potential magnetic-field response of the underlying charge-coupled defects. We implement a multi-level decoherence model in our analysis, motivated by the widely tunable matrix elements and transition energies approaching the thermal energy scale in our system. These findings offer insight for fluxonium coherence modeling and should inform microscopic theories of intrinsic noise in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Fabrication of Tailored Defect Structures in 2D Materials using Machine Learning-enabled Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with tailored quantum properties can be engineered from atomic scale assembly techniques, but existing methods often lack the agility and accuracy to precisely and intelligently control the manufacturing process. Here we demonstrate a fully autonomous approach for fabricating atomic-level defects using electron beams in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that combines advanced machine learning and automated beam control. As a proof of concept, we achieved controlled fabrication of MoS-nanowire (MoS-NW) edge structures by iterative and targeted exposure of $MoS_2$ monolayer to a focused electron beam to selectively eject sulfur atoms, utilizing high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging for feedback-controlled monitoring structural evolution of defects. A machine learning framework combining a random forest model and convolutional neural networks (CNN) was developed to decode the HAADF image and accurately identify atomic positions and species. This atomic-level information was then integrated into an autonomous decision-making platform, which applied predefined fabrication strategies to instruct beam control about atomic sites to be ejected. The selected sites were subsequently exposed to localized electron beam using an FPGA-controlled scan routine with precise control over beam positioning and duration. While the MoS-NW edge structures produced exhibit promising mechanical and electronic properties, the proposed autonomous fabrication framework is material-agnostic and can be extended to other 2D materials for the creation of diverse defect structures and heterostructures beyond $MoS_2$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bound on current fluctuations in coherent conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a universal bound on the large-deviation functions of particle currents in coherent conductors. This bound depends only on the mean value of the relevant current and the total rate of entropy production required to maintain a non-equilibrium steady state, thus showing that both typical and rare current fluctuations are ultimately constrained by dissipation. Our analysis relies on the scattering approach to quantum transport and applies to any multi-terminal setup with arbitrary chemical potential and temperature gradients, provided the transmission coefficients between reservoirs are symmetric. This condition is satisfied for any two-terminal system and, more generally, when the dynamics of particles within the conductor are symmetric under time-reversal. For typical current fluctuations, we recover a recently derived thermodynamic uncertainty relation for coherent transport. To illustrate our theory, we analyze a specific model comprising two reservoirs connected by a chain of quantum dots, which shows that our bound can be saturated asymptotically.</description>

      <title>Type-1.5 SNSPD: Interacting vortex theory of two bandgap superconducting single photon detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon detectors based on type-2 superconductors have found widespread applications from on-chip quantum computing to quantum remote sensing. Here, we develop the theory for a new class of type-1.5 superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on two bandgap superconductors with high transition temperatures such as MgB2 (Tc ~38.6K). We show that vortex-vortex interactions in two component condensates lead to a unique operating regime where single photons can seed multiple vortices within a hotspot. We also show that dark counts are suppressed in the type-1.5 regime compared to the widely studied type-2 SNSPDs. Our work opens the door for exploring the unique vortex physics of two-gap superconductors for quantum device applications.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Kondo Insulator in a Multilayer Moire Superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kondo insulators are a paradigmatic strongly correlated electron system, arising from the hybridization between itinerary conduction electrons and localized magnetic moments, which opens a gap in the band of conduction electrons. Traditionally, the known Kondo insulators are found in materials with f-electrons. Recent developments in two-dimensional (2D) moire systems provide a new approach to generate flat bands with strong electron correlation, which host localized moments at half filling. In this work, we demonstrate the realization of a Kondo insulator phase in a moire superlattice of monolayer WS2 / bilayer WSe2 which hosts a set of moire flat bands in the WSe2 layer interfacing the WS2 layer and dispersive bands in the other WSe2 layer. When both WSe2 layers are partially doped but with a total density of two holes per moire unit cell, an insulating state appears when the density of the moire band is below one hole per moire unit cell. The insulating state disappears above a certain threshold magnetic field and the system becomes metallic, which is a telltale signature of the Kondo insulator. The physics can be well explained by a periodic Anderson lattice model that includes both the on-site Coulomb repulsion in the moire flat band and the hybridization between moire flat and non-moire dispersive bands. Our results suggest that multilayer moire structures of transition metal dichalcogenides provide a tunable platform to simulate the Kondo insulator, which holds promise to tackle many critical open questions in the Kondo insulators.</description>

      <title>Wilson Line and Disorder Invariants of Topological One-Dimensional Multiband Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological invariants, such as the winding number, the Chern number, and the Zak phase, characterize the topological phases of bulk materials. Through the bulk-boundary correspondence, these topological phases have a one-to-one correspondence to topological edge states, which are robust to certain classes of disorder. For simple models like the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the computation of the winding number and Zak phase are straightforward, however, in multiband systems, this is no longer the case. In this work, we introduce the unwrapped Wilson line across the Brillouin zone to compute the bulk topological invariant. This method can efficiently be implemented numerically to evaluate multiband SSH-type models, including models that have a large number of distinct topological phases. This approach accurately captures all topological edge states, including those overlooked by traditional invariants, such as the winding number and Zak phase. To make a connection to experiments, we determine the sign of the topological invariant by considering a Hall-like configuration. We further introduce different classes of disorder that leave certain edge states protected, while suppressing other edge states, depending on their symmetry properties. Our approach is illustrated using different one-dimensional models, providing a robust framework for understanding topological properties in one-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of long-range order in low-dimensional nonequilibrium $O(N)$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is now well established that the Mermin-Wagner theorem can be circumvented in nonequilibrium systems, allowing for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry and the emergence of long-range order in low dimensions. However, only a few models demonstrating this violation are known, and they often rely on specific mechanisms that may not be generally applicable. In this work, we identify a new mechanism for nonequilibrium-induced long-range order in a class of $O(N)$-symmetric models. Inspired by the role of long-range spatial interactions in equilibrium, consider the effect of non-Markovian dissipation, in stabilizing long range order in low-dimensional nonequilibrium systems. We find that this alone is insufficient, but the interplay of non-Markovian dissipation and slow modes due to conservation laws can effectively suppress fluctuations and stabilize long-range order.</description>

      <title>Fingerprint of Non-Hermiticity in d-wave Altermagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the non-Hermitian counterpart of a new class of collinear magnets, dubbed altermagnets, delineated by net zero magnetization with momentum-dependent spin-splitting bands. The application of an imaginary gauge field in a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet injects a non-reciprocal intercell hopping without hosting exceptional points (EPs). This non-Hermitian phase hosts a point gap which remains robust in the presence and absence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling. By attaching a ferromagnetic lead with the altermagnet, we uncover the emergence of two pairs of second-order EPs. We establish that each of the EPs is associated with a half-integer quantized topological charge, a hallmark signature of the non-Hermitian topology. The existence of this non-Hermitian exceptional phase has been further confirmed by linear variation with the respective momentum and coalescence of the spin expectation value at the EPs. Finally, we demonstrate that the application of a planar magnetic field to the junction not only tunes the location of the EPs but also can annihilate a single pair or even all pairs of EPs with opposite topological charges depending upon the field strength and direction.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Anisotropic Magnetoresistance in Altermagnets and Its Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a newly discovered class of magnets, integrate the advantages of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, such as enabling anomalous transport without stray fields and supporting ultrafast spin dynamics, offering exciting opportunities for spintronics. A key challenge in altermagnetic spintronics is the efficient reading and writing of information by switching the Neel vector orientations to represent binary 0 and 1. Here, we develop a microscopic theory of the magnetoresistance effect in altermagnets and propose that magnetoresistance anisotropy can serve as an effective mechanism for the electrical readout of the Neel vector. Our theory describes a two-step charge-spin-charge conversion process governed by the interplay between spin splitting and spin Hall effects: a longitudinal electric field induces transverse drift spin currents, which induce significant spin accumulation at the boundaries, generating a diffusive spin current that is converted back into a longitudinal charge current. By switching the Neel vector, a substantial change in magnetoresistance, akin to giant magnetoresistance in ferromagnets, is realized, enabling an electrically readable altermagnetic memory. Our microscopic theory provides deeper insights into the fundamental physics of the magnetoresistance effect in altermagnets and offers valuable guidance for designing next-generation ultradense and ultrafast spintronic devices based on altermagnetism.</description>

Abstract: Time modulation opens new avenues for light, heat control, and energy harvesting, yet the impact of nonequilibrium dynamics of microscopic particles remains largely unexplored. We develop a microscopic theory to describe radiative heat transfer in such Floquet systems. Significant heat transfer occurs due to differences in electronic properties between parallel metal plates, despite identical driving protocols and temperatures. This arises from a unique exponential-staircase distribution of radiative photons, induced by nonequilibrium electronic fluctuations, and can be tuned via both microscopic properties and driving parameters. Our work highlights the importance of nonequilibrium microscopic details, unlocking new opportunities for active cooling, thermophotovoltaics, thermal imaging and manipulation, and carrier dynamics probing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a large family of one-dimensional (1D) topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) classified by $\mathbb{Z}$ invariants protected by space-time inversion symmetry. This finding stands in marked contrast to the conventional classification of 1D band topology protected by inversion symmetry and characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-quantized polarization (Berry-Zak phase). Such kind of enriched topological phases relies on imposing restriction on tunneling forms. By considering the nontrivial relative polarization among sublattices (orbitals), we introduce the inversion winding number as a topological invariant for characterizing and categorizing band topology. The bulk-edge correspondence with regard to the inversion winding number is discussed. Leveraging real-space analysis, we discover disorder-induced topological Anderson insulators and propose to experimentally distinguish band topology through relative polarization of edge states or bulk states. Our comprehensive findings present a paradigmatic illustration for the ongoing investigation and classification of band topology in TCIs.</description>

      <title>Protected chaos in a topological lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The erratic nature of chaotic behavior is thought to erode the stability of periodic behavior, including topological oscillations. However, we discover that in the presence of chaos, non-trivial topology not only endures but also provides robust protection to chaotic dynamics within a topological lattice hosting non-linear oscillators. Despite the difficulty in defining topological invariants in non-linear settings, non-trivial topological robustness still persists in the parametric state of chaotic boundary oscillations. We demonstrate this interplay between chaos and topology by incorporating chaotic Chua's circuits into a topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit. By extrapolating from the linear limit to deep into the non-linear regime, we find that distinctive correlations in the bulk and edge scroll dynamics effectively capture the topological origin of the protected chaos. Our findings suggest that topologically protected chaos can be robustly achieved across a broad spectrum of periodically-driven systems, thereby offering new avenues for the design of resilient and adaptable non-linear networks.</description>

      <title>Mode-Shell correspondence, a unifying phase space theory in topological physics -- part II: Higher-dimensional spectral invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mode-shell correspondence relates the number $I_M$ of gapless modes in phase space to a topological \textit{shell invariant} $\Ish$ defined on a close surface -- the shell -- surrounding those modes, namely $I_M=I_S$. In part I, we introduced the mode-shell correspondence for zero-modes of chiral symmetric Hamiltonians (class AIII). In this part II, we extend the correspondence to arbitrary dimension and to both symmetry classes A and AIII. This allows us to include, in particular, $1D$-unidirectional edge modes of Chern insulators, massless $2D$-Dirac and $3D$-Weyl cones, within the same formalism. We provide an expression of $I_M$ that only depends on the dimension of the dispersion relation of the gapless mode, and does not require a translation invariance. Then, we show that the topology of the shell (a circle, a sphere, a torus), that must account for the spreading of the gapless mode in phase space, yields specific expressions of the shell index. Semi-classical expressions of those shell indices are also derived and reduce to either Chern or winding numbers depending on the parity of the mode's dimension. In that way, the mode-shell correspondence provides a unified and systematic topological description of both bulk and boundary gapless modes in any dimension, and in particular includes the bulk-boundary correspondence. We illustrate the generality of the theory by analyzing several models of semimetals and insulators, both on lattices and in the continuum, and also discuss weak and higher-order topological phases within this framework. Although this paper is a continuation of Part I, the content remains sufficiently independent to be mostly read separately.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Coherence Peak in Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancement and peaks in near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) typically arise due to surface phonon-polaritons, plasmon-polaritons, and electromagnetic (EM) modes in structured materials. However, the role of material quantum coherence in enhancing near-field radiative heat transfer remains unexplored. Here, we unravel that NFRHT in superconductor-ferromagnetic systems displays a unique peak at the superconducting phase transition that originates from the quantum coherence of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors. Our theory takes into account evanescent EM radiation emanating from fluctuating currents related to Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles in stark contrast to the current-current correlations induced by free electrons in conventional materials. Our proposed NFRHT configuration exploits ferromagnetic resonance at frequencies deep inside the superconducting band gap to isolate this superconducting coherence peak. Furthermore, we reveal that Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles have opposite effects on near-field thermal radiation and isolate their effects on many-body radiative heat transfer near superconductors. Our proposed phenomenon can have applications for developing thermal isolators and heat sinks in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Coulomb drag in odd electron liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of Coulomb drag resistance in bilayers of electron liquids with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. In the hydrodynamic regime, the viscosity tensor of such fluids has a nonvanishing odd component. In this scenario, fluctuating viscous stresses drive the propagation of plasmons, whose dispersion relations are modified by nondissipative odd viscous waves. Coulomb coupling of electron density fluctuations induces a drag force exerted by one layer on the other in the presence of a steady flow. This drag force can be expressed through the dynamic structure factor of the electron liquid, which is peaked at frequencies corresponding to plasmon resonances in the bilayer. As a result, the drag resistivity depends on the dissipationless odd viscosity of the fluid. We quantify this effect and present a general theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations applicable to odd electron liquids, both with and without Galilean invariance.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Pauli Spin Blockade and Current Rectification in 15-13-15 Armchair Graphene Nanoribbon Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the electronic structures of 13-11-13 and 15-13-15 armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) superlattices (SLs) using a tight-binding model. We demonstrate that the conduction and valence subbands of 15-13-15 AGNR SLs can be accurately described by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, with topologically protected interface states emerging at the junctions between 15-AGNR and 13-AGNR segments. These interface states enable the formation of quantum dot arrays with energy levels well separated from bulk states, making them promising candidates for high-temperature solid-state quantum processors. For 15-13-15 AGNRH segments, we observe both localized zigzag edge states and topologically protected interface states under longitudinal electric fields, with the latter providing efficient tunneling channels in contrast to the less conductive edge states. We further explore nonlinear charge transport through these interface states under Pauli spin blockade, showing that tunneling current spectra reveal charge stability diagrams and Coulomb blockade oscillations, consistent with experimental findings in other serial double quantum dot systems. Additionally, we examine the impact of orbital offsets on tunneling current rectification and demonstrate that significant current rectification is achieved over a wide temperature range when level broadening is optimized. These results highlight the potential of 15-13-15 AGNRHs for robust spin-current conversion and applications in quantum devices, offering advantages over other proposed structures due to precise tunability of key parameters via bottom-up synthesis techniques and the ease of two-gate electrode integration.</description>

      <title>Dirac charge in antiferromagnetic topological semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological node of electronic bands can carry emergent charge degree of freedom such as the Berry curvature monopole of the Weyl semimetals, which results in intriguing transport and optical phenomena. In this study, we discuss the existence of the hidden "Dirac charge" and its detection via the photocurrent response in antiferromagnetic (AFM) Dirac semimetals. In light of the Berry curvature defined in the spin and spin-charge-mixed parameter space, we identify Dirac charges as sources or sinks of the Berry curvature in the generalized parameter space. We demonstrate that this Dirac charge can be detected via the photocurrent driven by the spin-charge-coupled motive force. By using real-time simulation, we find that the Dirac charge plays a significant role in the photocurrent generation in AFM Dirac semimetals. This work reveals the hidden property of the Dirac points in AFM Dirac semimetals.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux Quanta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH), due to their experimentally observed anyonic topological order, are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers ("topological qbits") subject to error-protected quantum operations ("topological quantum gates"), both plausibly necessary for future quantum computing at useful scale, but both remaining insufficiently understood. Here we present a novel non-Lagrangian effective description of FQH anyons, based on previously elusive proper global quantization of effective topological flux in extraordinary non-abelian cohomology theories. This directly translates the system's quantum -observables, -states, -symmetries, and -measurement channels into purely algebro-topological analysis of local systems of Hilbert spaces over the quantized flux moduli spaces. Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of FQH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory (a cousin of Hypothesis H in high-energy physics), the results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition in a double quantum dot Josephson junction driven by electron-electron interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we employ a surrogate BCS model with discrete energy levels to investigate a hybrid system comprising two quantum dots (QD1 and QD2), where QD1 is tunnel-coupled to two superconducting leads. Through exact diagonalization of this system, we obtain numerically exact solutions that enable rigorous computation of key physical quantities. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram featuring multiple controllable phase transitions mediated by quantum dot interactions. Specifically, the system first undergoes an initial phase transition when tuning QD2's interaction strength while maintaining QD1 in the non-interacting regime. Subsequent adjustment of QD1's interaction induces a secondary phase transition, followed by a third transition arising from inter-dot coupling modulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that parallel magnetic field application can drive reversible ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase transitions under specific parameter conditions. Finally, we report the emergence of non-local magnetization phenomena when subjecting QD1 to weak magnetic fields. And our results demonstrate that the orientation of nonlocal magnetization can be precisely manipulated through systematic adjustment of the on-site interaction strength $U_2$ in QD2.</description>

      <title>Quasi-symmetry Constrained Spin Ferromagnetism in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets break time-reversal symmetry and their spin-orbit coupling (SOC) allow for an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that depends on the direction of the N\'eel ordering vector. The AHE and the ferromagnetic spin moment share the same symmetry and hence are usually proportional. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations find that the AHE exists with negligible ferromagnetic spin moment for some compounds, whereas it reaches sizable values for other altermagnets. By examining realistic minimal models for altermagnetism in which the DFT phenomenology is captured, we uncover a general SOC-enabled quasi-symmetry, the uniaxial spin space-group, that provides a natural explanation for the amplitude of the ferromagnetic spin moment across the vast range of different altermagnetic materials. Additionally, we derive analytic expressions for the magnetic anisotropy energy, providing a simple means to identify the preferred N\'eel vector orientation for altermagnets.</description>

Abstract: By decoupling the geometric from the dynamical contributions in the scattering processes, we develop a method to compute the scattering matrix of electrons in a one-dimensional coherent conductor connected to two electrodes. In particular, we demonstrate that, in the high-energy regime, the transmission matrix converges to the Berry operator of the system. We showcase the method through several examples featuring different in-plane magnetic field profiles. Notably, our results reveal the possibility of achieving near-perfect spin-flip transmission, highlighting potential applications in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Passive leakage removal unit based on a disordered transmon array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.</description>

Abstract: Thermal emission is naturally spatially incoherent and lacks directionality. Here, we demonstrate that by precisely controlling the spatial temperature distribution within a solid, directional thermal emission can be achieved across a broad spectral range. These anisothermal sources open new avenues for manipulating radiative heat flux at the microscale and hold promise for applications in thermal management and energy conversion, enabling more efficient and targeted thermal control.</description>

      <title>Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported in F. Xu, arXiv.2504.06972 which display a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble/Wigner crystal phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in 2D GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at filling $\nu = -0.63$, the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope, necessitating a different interpretation. We propose that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a Van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi surface topology and a metallic phase with non-quantized Hall response. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have a valley-imbalanced metal parent state.</description>
