      <title>On the Error-correcting Capability of Twisted Centralizer Codes Obtained from a Fixed Rank-1 Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a generalization on the error correcting capability of twisted centralizer codes obtained from a fixed rank 1 matrix. In particular, we fix the combinatorial matrix which is obtained by getting the linear combination of the matrix whose all entries are 1 and the identity matrix of order n. Results reveal that such codes have a dimension 1 for any fixed combinatorial matrix and constant a hence having a relatively low information rate due to the way its codewords are constructed, but are found to be maximum distance separable codes.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Deception in OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a promising technology, physical layer security (PLS) enhances security by leveraging the physical characteristics of communication channels. However, the conventional PLS approach leads to a considerable disparity in the effort legitimate users need to secure data compared to eavesdroppers. To address this issue, we propose a physical layer deception (PLD) framework, which applies random deceptive ciphering and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to defend against eavesdropping proactively. While ensuring the same level of confidentiality as traditional PLS methods, the PLD approach additionally introduces a deception mechanism, even when the eavesdropper possesses the same knowledge about the transmitter end as the legitimate receiver. Through thorough theoretical analyses and numerical simulations, we prove the superiority of our method over the conventional PLS approach.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference on the Boolean Hypercube with the Quantum Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive variational inference upper-bounds on the log-partition function of pairwise Markov random fields on the Boolean hypercube, based on quantum relaxations of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We then propose an efficient algorithm to compute these bounds based on primal-dual optimization. An improvement of these bounds through the use of ''hierarchies,'' similar to sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchies is proposed, and we present a greedy algorithm to select among these relaxations. We carry extensive numerical experiments and compare with state-of-the-art methods for this inference problem.</description>

      <title>Large Generative Model-assisted Talking-face Semantic Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) continually unveils the potential of Semantic Communication (SemCom). However, current talking-face SemCom systems still encounter challenges such as low bandwidth utilization, semantic ambiguity, and diminished Quality of Experience (QoE). This study introduces a Large Generative Model-assisted Talking-face Semantic Communication (LGM-TSC) System tailored for the talking-face video communication. Firstly, we introduce a Generative Semantic Extractor (GSE) at the transmitter based on the FunASR model to convert semantically sparse talking-face videos into texts with high information density. Secondly, we establish a private Knowledge Base (KB) based on the Large Language Model (LLM) for semantic disambiguation and correction, complemented by a joint knowledge base-semantic-channel coding scheme. Finally, at the receiver, we propose a Generative Semantic Reconstructor (GSR) that utilizes BERT-VITS2 and SadTalker models to transform text back into a high-QoE talking-face video matching the user's timbre. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed LGM-TSC system.</description>

      <title>Soft Reverse Reconciliation for Discrete Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of the information reconciliation phase is crucial for quantum key distribution (QKD). Reverse reconciliation (RR) is typically preferred over direct reconciliation (DR) because it yields higher secure key rates. However, a significant challenge in continuous-variable (CV) QKD with discrete modulations (such as QAM) is that Alice lacks soft information about the symbol decisions made by Bob. This limitation restricts error correction to hard-decoding methods, with low reconciliation efficiency. This work introduces a reverse reconciliation softening (RRS) procedure designed for CV-QKD scenarios employing discrete modulations. This procedure generates a soft metric that Bob can share with Alice over a public channel, enabling her to perform soft-decoding error correction without disclosing any information to a potential eavesdropper. After detailing the RRS procedure, we investigate how the mutual information between Alice's and Bob's variables changes when the additional metric is shared. We show numerically that RRS improves the mutual information with respect to RR with hard decoding, practically achieving the same mutual information as DR with soft decoding. Finally, we test the proposed RRS for PAM-4 signalling with a rate 1/2 binary LDPC code and bit-wise decoding through numerical simulations, obtaining more than 1dB SNR improvement compared to hard-decoding RR.</description>

      <title>Learned codes for broadcast channels with feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on designing error-correcting codes for the symmetric Gaussian broadcast channel with feedback. Feedback not only expands the capacity region of the broadcast channel but also enhances transmission reliability. In this work, we study the construction of learned finite blocklength codes for broadcast channels with feedback. Learned error-correcting codes, in which both the encoder and decoder are jointly trained, have shown impressive performance in point-to-point channels, particularly with noisy feedback. However, few learned schemes exist for multi-user channels. Here, we develop a lightweight code for the broadcast channel with feedback that outperforms existing schemes and operates effectively at short blocklengths.</description>

      <title>Age of Gossip With Time-Varying Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a gossiping network, where a source node sends updates to a network of $n$ gossiping nodes. Meanwhile, the connectivity topology of the gossiping network changes over time, among a finite number of connectivity ''states,'' such as the fully connected graph, the ring graph, the grid graph, etc. The transition of the connectivity graph among the possible options is governed by a finite state continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). When the CTMC is in a particular state, the associated graph topology of the gossiping network is in the way indicated by that state. We evaluate the impact of time-varying graph topologies on the freshness of information for nodes in the network. We use the version age of information metric to quantify the freshness of information at the nodes. Using a method similar to the first passage percolation method, we show that, if one of the states of the CTMC is the fully connected graph and the transition rates of the CTMC are constant, then the version age of a typical node in the network scales logarithmically with the number of nodes, as in the case if the network was always fully connected. That is, there is no loss in the age scaling, even if the network topology deviates from full connectivity, in this setting. We perform numerical simulations and analyze more generally how having different topologies and different CTMC rates (that might depend on the number of nodes) affect the average version age scaling of a node in the gossiping network.</description>

      <title>Towards Entropic Constraints on Quantum Speedups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some quantum algorithms have "quantum speedups": improved time complexity as compared with the best-known classical algorithms for solving the same tasks. Can we understand what fuels these speedups from an entropic perspective? Information theory gives us a multitude of metrics we might choose from to measure how fundamentally 'quantum' is the behavior of a quantum computer running an algorithm. The entanglement entropies for subsystems of a quantum state can be analyzed for subsystems of qubits in a quantum computer throughout the running of an algorithm. Here, a framework for making this entropic analysis is constructed, and performed on a selection of quantum circuits implementing known fast quantum algorithms and subroutines: Grover search, the quantum Fourier transform, and phase estimation. Our results are largely unsatisfactory: known entropy inequalities do not suffice to identify the presence or absence of quantum speedups. Although we know our algorithms must have quantum "magic", the Ingleton inequality, which holds for all entropies of subsystems of stabilizer states, is not violated in any of our examples. In some cases, however, monogamy of mutual information, which is obeyed for product states but violated for highly entangled bipartite states such as the $GHZ$ states, fails at some point in the course of our quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The seminal work of Bencz\'ur and Karger demonstrated cut sparsifiers of near-linear size, with several applications throughout theoretical computer science. Subsequent extensions have yielded sparsifiers for hypergraph cuts and more recently linear codes over Abelian groups. A decade ago, Kogan and Krauthgamer asked about the sparsifiability of arbitrary constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). For this question, a trivial lower bound is the size of a non-redundant CSP instance, which admits, for each constraint, an assignment satisfying only that constraint (so that no constraint can be dropped by the sparsifier). For graph cuts, spanning trees are non-redundant instances.
  Our main result is that redundant clauses are sufficient for sparsification: for any CSP predicate R, every unweighted instance of CSP(R) has a sparsifier of size at most its non-redundancy (up to polylog factors). For weighted instances, we similarly pin down the sparsifiability to the so-called chain length of the predicate. These results precisely determine the extent to which any CSP can be sparsified. A key technical ingredient in our work is a novel application of the entropy method from Gilmer's recent breakthrough on the union-closed sets conjecture.
  As an immediate consequence of our main theorem, a number of results in the non-redundancy literature immediately extend to CSP sparsification. We also contribute new techniques for understanding the non-redundancy of CSP predicates. In particular, we give an explicit family of predicates whose non-redundancy roughly corresponds to the structure of matching vector families in coding theory. By adapting methods from the matching vector codes literature, we are able to construct an explicit predicate whose non-redundancy lies between $\Omega(n^{1.5})$ and $\widetilde{O}(n^{1.6})$, the first example with a provably non-integral exponent.</description>

      <title>Quantum fault tolerance with constant-space and logarithmic-time overheads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a model of fault-tolerant quantum computation with quick and noiseless polyloglog-time auxiliary classical computation, we construct a fault tolerance protocol with constant-space and $\widetilde{O}(\log N)$-time overhead, where $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides sub-polylog factors. Our construction utilizes constant-rate quantum locally testable codes (qLTC), new fault-tolerant gadgets on qLTCs and qLDPC codes, and a new analysis framework. In particular, 1) we develop a new simple and self-contained construction of magic state distillation for qubits using qudit quantum Reed-Solomon codes with $(\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{\gamma}$ spacetime overhead, where $\gamma \rightarrow 0$. 2) We prove that the recent family of almost-good qLTCs of Dinur-Lin-Vidick admit parallel single-shot decoders against adversarial errors of weight scaling with the code distance. 3) We develop logical state preparation and logical gate procedures with $\widetilde{O}(1)$-spacetime overhead on qLTCs. 4) To combine these ingredients, we introduce a new framework of fault tolerance analysis called the weight enumerator formalism. The framework permits easy formal composition of fault-tolerant gadgets, so we expect it to be of independent interest. Our work gives the lowest spacetime overhead to date, which, for the first time, matches that of classical fault tolerance up to sub-polylog factors. We conjecture this is optimal up to sub-polylog factors.</description>

      <title>Quantum LDPC Codes of Almost Linear Distance via Homological Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new constructions of quantum codes of linear or close-to-linear distance and dimension with low-weight stabilizers. Only a few constructions of such codes were previously known, and were primarily based on a specific operation from homological algebra, namely the balanced product. In contrast, our constructions are based on a more basic and widely used product, namely the homological product (i.e. the tensor product of chain complexes). Our results help address the natural question: When do homological products preserve good code distance?
  Our first main result constructs asymptotically good $[[N,\Theta(N),\Theta(N)]]$ quantum codes with small polynomial stabilizer weight from homological products of codes with a property called product-expansion. This notion was recently introduced and used to bound the distance of balanced product quantum codes; we apply it instead to homological products.
  For every $\epsilon&gt;0$, our second main result constructs close-to-linear distance $[[N,N^{1-\epsilon},N^{1-\epsilon}]]$ (subsystem) quantum LDPC codes with constant stabilizer weight from iterated homological products of a constant-sized quantum locally testable code. The key insight here is that by using subsystem codes (but still with constant-weight stabilizers), we can circumvent a particular obstruction that limited the distance of many prior product code constructions to at most $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{N})$.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by studies of data retrieval in polymer-based storage systems, we consider the problem of reconstructing a multiset of binary strings that have the same length and the same weight from the compositions of their prefixes and suffixes of every possible length. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for which unique reconstruction up to reversal of the strings is possible. Additionally, we present two algorithms for reconstructing strings from the compositions of prefixes and suffixes of constant-length constant-weight strings.</description>

      <title>Noisy Linear Group Testing: Exact Thresholds and Efficient Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In group testing, the task is to identify defective items by testing groups of them together using as few tests as possible. We consider the setting where each item is defective with a constant probability $\alpha$, independent of all other items. In the (over-)idealized noiseless setting, tests are positive exactly if any of the tested items are defective. We study a more realistic model in which observed test results are subject to noise, i.e., tests can display false positive or false negative results with constant positive probabilities. We determine precise constants $c$ such that $cn\log n$ tests are required to recover the infection status of every individual for both adaptive and non-adaptive group testing: in the former, the selection of groups to test can depend on previously observed test results, whereas it cannot in the latter. Additionally, for both settings, we provide efficient algorithms that identify all defective items with the optimal amount of tests with high probability. Thus, we completely solve the problem of binary noisy group testing in the studied setting.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum asymptotic equipartition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a generalized quantum asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) beyond the i.i.d. framework where the random samples are drawn from two sets of quantum states. In particular, under suitable assumptions on the sets, we prove that all operationally relevant divergences converge to the quantum relative entropy between the sets. More specifically, both the smoothed min- and max-relative entropy approach the regularized relative entropy between the sets. Notably, the asymptotic limit has explicit convergence guarantees and can be efficiently estimated through convex optimization programs, despite the regularization, provided that the sets have efficient descriptions.
  We give four applications of this result: (i) The generalized AEP directly implies a new generalized quantum Stein's lemma for conducting quantum hypothesis testing between two sets of quantum states. (ii) We introduce a quantum version of adversarial hypothesis testing where the tester plays against an adversary who possesses internal quantum memory and controls the quantum device and show that the optimal error exponent is precisely characterized by a new notion of quantum channel divergence, named the minimum output channel divergence. (iii) We derive a relative entropy accumulation theorem stating that the smoothed min-relative entropy between two sequential processes of quantum channels can be lower bounded by the sum of the regularized minimum output channel divergences. (iv) We apply our generalized AEP to quantum resource theories and provide improved and efficient bounds for entanglement distillation, magic state distillation, and the entanglement cost of quantum states and channels.
  At a technical level, we establish new additivity and chain rule properties for the measured relative entropy which we expect will have more applications.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lagrange Coded Computing: A Flexible Computation-Communication Tradeoff for Resilient, Secure, and Private Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating arbitrary multivariate polynomials over a massive dataset containing multiple inputs, on a distributed computing system with a master node and multiple worker nodes. Generalized Lagrange Coded Computing (GLCC) codes are proposed to simultaneously provide resiliency against stragglers who do not return computation results in time, security against adversarial workers who deliberately modify results for their benefit, and information-theoretic privacy of the dataset amidst possible collusion of workers. GLCC codes are constructed by first partitioning the dataset into multiple groups, then encoding the dataset using carefully designed interpolating polynomials, and sharing multiple encoded data points to each worker, such that interference computation results across groups can be eliminated at the master. Particularly, GLCC codes include the state-of-the-art Lagrange Coded Computing (LCC) codes as a special case, and exhibit a more flexible tradeoff between communication and computation overheads in optimizing system efficiency. Furthermore, we apply GLCC to distributed training of machine learning models, and demonstrate that GLCC codes achieve a speedup of up to $2.5\text{--}3.9\times$ over LCC codes in training time, across experiments for training image classifiers on different datasets, model architectures, and straggler patterns.</description>

      <title>Codebook Configuration for RIS-aided Systems via Implicit Neural Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is envisioned to be an enabling technique in 6G wireless communications. By configuring the reflection beamforming codebook, RIS focuses signals on target receivers to enhance signal strength. In this paper, we investigate the codebook configuration for RIS-aided communication systems. We formulate an implicit relationship between user's coordinates information and the codebook from the perspective of signal radiation mechanisms, and introduce a novel learning-based method, implicit neural representations (INRs), to solve this implicit coordinates-to-codebook mapping problem. Our approach requires only user's coordinates, avoiding reliance on channel models. Additionally, given the significant practical applications of the 1-bit RIS, we formulate the 1-bit codebook configuration as a multi-label classification problem, and propose an encoding strategy for 1-bit RIS to reduce the codebook dimension, thereby improving learning efficiency. Experimental results from simulations and measured data demonstrate significant advantages of our method.</description>

      <title>Three classes of propagation rules for generalized Reed-Solomon codes and their applications to EAQECCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Hermitian hulls of generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes over finite fields. For a given class of GRS codes, by extending the length, increasing the dimension, and extending the length and increasing the dimension at the same time, we obtain three classes of GRS codes with Hermitian hulls of arbitrary dimensions. Furthermore, based on some known $q^2$-ary Hermitian self-orthogonal GRS codes with dimension $q-1$, we obtain several classes of $q^2$-ary maximum distance separable (MDS) codes with Hermitian hulls of arbitrary dimensions. It is worth noting that the dimension of these MDS codes can be taken from $q$ to $\frac{n}{2}$, and the parameters of these MDS codes can be more flexible by propagation rules. As an application, we derive three new propagation rules for MDS entanglement-assisted quantum error correction codes (EAQECCs) constructed from GRS codes. Then, from the presently known GRS codes with Hermitian hulls, we can directly obtain many MDS EAQECCs with more flexible parameters. Finally, we present several new classes of (MDS) EAQECCs with flexible parameters, and the distance of these codes can be taken from $q+1$ to $\frac{n+2}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Indirect Lossy Source Coding with Observed Source Reconstruction: Nonasymptotic Bounds and Second-Order Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14962v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the joint compression of a pair of correlated sources, where the encoder is allowed to access only one of the sources. The objective is to recover both sources under separate distortion constraints for each source while minimizing the rate. This problem generalizes the indirect lossy source coding problem by also requiring the recovery of the observed source. In this paper, we aim to study the nonasymptotic and second-order asymptotic properties of this problem. Specifically, we begin by deriving nonasymptotic achievability and converse bounds valid for general sources and distortion measures. The source dispersion (Gaussian approximation) is then determined through asymptotic analysis of the nonasymptotic bounds. We further examine the case of erased fair coin flips (EFCF) and provide its specific nonasymptotic achievability and converse bounds. Numerical results under the EFCF case demonstrate that our second-order asymptotic approximation closely approximates the optimum rate at appropriately large blocklengths.</description>

      <title>Model-based Deep Learning for Wireless Resource Allocation in RSMA Communications Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has been proven as an effective communication scheme for 5G and beyond. However, current approaches to RSMA resource management require complicated iterative algorithms, which cannot meet the stringent latency requirement by users with limited resources. Recently, data-driven methods are explored to alleviate this issue. However, they suffer from poor generalizability and scarce training data to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a fractional programming (FP) based deep unfolding (DU) approach to address resource allocation problem for a weighted sum rate optimization in RSMA. By carefully designing the penalty function, we couple the variable update with projected gradient descent algorithm (PGD). Following the structure of PGD, we embed a few learnable parameters in each layer of the DU network. Through extensive simulation, we have shown that the proposed model-based neural networks can yield similar results compared to the traditional optimization algorithm for RSMA resource management but with much lower computational complexity, less training data, and higher resilience to out-of-distribution (OOD) data.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Massive MIMO: Precoding Design and Channel Estimation in the Electromagnetic Domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable massive multiple-input multiple-output (RmMIMO), as an electronically-controlled fluid antenna system, offers increased flexibility for future communication systems by exploiting previously untapped degrees of freedom in the electromagnetic (EM) domain. The representation of the traditional spatial domain channel state information (sCSI) limits the insights into the potential of EM domain channel properties, constraining the base station's (BS) utmost capability for precoding design. This paper leverages the EM domain channel state information (eCSI) for antenna radiation pattern design at the BS. We develop an orthogonal decomposition method based on spherical harmonic functions to decompose the radiation pattern into a linear combination of orthogonal bases. By formulating the radiation pattern design as an optimization problem for the projection coefficients over these bases, we develop a manifold optimization-based method for iterative radiation pattern and digital precoder design. To address the eCSI estimation problem, we capitalize on the inherent structure of the channel. Specifically, we propose a subspace-based scheme to reduce the pilot overhead for wideband sCSI estimation. Given the estimated full-band sCSI, we further employ parameterized methods for angle of arrival estimation. Subsequently, the complete eCSI can be reconstructed after estimating the equivalent channel gain via the least squares method. Simulation results demonstrate that, in comparison to traditional mMIMO systems with fixed antenna radiation patterns, the proposed RmMIMO architecture offers significant throughput gains for multi-user transmission at a low channel estimation overhead.</description>

      <title>R-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields for Modeling RIS-enabled Wireless Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, ray tracing has gained renewed interest with the advent of Reflective Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) technology, a key enabler of 6G wireless communications due to its capability of intelligent manipulation of electromagnetic waves. However, accurately modeling RIS-enabled wireless environments poses significant challenges due to the complex variations caused by various environmental factors and the mobility of RISs. In this paper, we propose a novel modeling approach using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to characterize the dynamics of electromagnetic fields in such environments. Our method utilizes NeRF-based ray tracing to intuitively capture and visualize the complex dynamics of signal propagation, effectively modeling the complete signal pathways from the transmitter to the RIS, and from the RIS to the receiver. This two-stage process accurately characterizes multiple complex transmission paths, enhancing our understanding of signal behavior in real-world scenarios. Our approach predicts the signal field for any specified RIS placement and receiver location, facilitating efficient RIS deployment. Experimental evaluations using both simulated and real-world data validate the significant benefits of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Compute-Update Federated Learning: A Lattice Coding Approach Over-the-Air</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a federated learning framework that enables over-the-air computation via digital communications, using a new joint source-channel coding scheme. Without relying on channel state information at devices, this scheme employs lattice codes to both quantize model parameters and exploit interference from the devices. We propose a novel receiver structure at the server, designed to reliably decode an integer combination of the quantized model parameters as a lattice point for the purpose of aggregation. We present a mathematical approach to derive a convergence bound for the proposed scheme and offer design remarks. In this context, we suggest an aggregation metric and a corresponding algorithm to determine effective integer coefficients for the aggregation in each communication round. Our results illustrate that, regardless of channel dynamics and data heterogeneity, our scheme consistently delivers superior learning accuracy across various parameters and markedly surpasses other over-the-air methodologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the partial order (POs) for both the binary erasure channel (BEC) and the binary memoryless symmetric channel (BMSC) under any block rate-matched polar codes. Firstly, we define the POs in the sense of rate-matched polar codes as a sequential block version. Furthermore, we demonstrate the persistence of POs after block rate matching in the BEC. Finally, leveraging the existing POs in the BEC, we obtain more POs in the BMSC under block rate matching. Simulations show that the PW sequence constructed from \beta-expansion can be improved by the tool of POs. Actually, any fixed reliable sequence in the mother polar codes can be improved by POs for rate matching.</description>

      <title>Optimizing AoI at Query in Multiuser Wireless Uplink Networks: A Whittle Index Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how to schedule multiple users to optimize information freshness in a pull-based wireless network, where the status updates from users are requested by randomly arriving queries at the destination. We use the age of information at query (QAoI) to characterize the performance of information freshness. Such a decision-making problem is naturally modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), which, however, is prohibitively high to be solved optimally by the standard method due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this issue, we employ Whittle index approach, which allows us to decouple the original MDP into multiple sub-MDPs by relaxing the scheduling constraints. However, the binary Markovian query arrival process results in a bi-dimensional state and complex state transitions within each sub-MDP, making it challenging to verify Whittle indexability using conventional methods. After a thorough analysis of the sub-MDP's structure, we show that it is unichain and its optimal policy follows a threshold-type structure. This facilitates the verification of Whittle indexability of the sub-MDP by employing an easy-to-verify condition. Subsequently, the steady-state probability distributions of the sub-MDP under different threshold-type policies are analyzed, constituting the analytical expressions of different Whittle indices in terms of the expected average QAoI and scheduling time of the sub-MDP. Building on these, we devise an efficient algorithm to calculate Whittle indices for the formulated sub-MDPs. The simulation results validate our analyses and show the proposed Whittle index policy outperforms baseline policies and achieves near-optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant Coding for Quantum Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.07161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing encoding and decoding circuits to reliably send messages over many uses of a noisy channel is a central problem in communication theory. When studying the optimal transmission rates achievable with asymptotically vanishing error it is usually assumed that these circuits can be implemented using noise-free gates. While this assumption is satisfied for classical machines in many scenarios, it is not expected to be satisfied in the near term future for quantum machines where decoherence leads to faults in the quantum gates. As a result, fundamental questions regarding the practical relevance of quantum channel coding remain open. By combining techniques from fault-tolerant quantum computation with techniques from quantum communication, we initiate the study of these questions. We introduce fault-tolerant versions of quantum capacities quantifying the optimal communication rates achievable with asymptotically vanishing total error when the encoding and decoding circuits are affected by gate errors with small probability. Our main results are threshold theorems for the classical and quantum capacity: For every quantum channel $T$ and every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists a threshold $p(\epsilon,T)$ for the gate error probability below which rates larger than $C-\epsilon$ are fault-tolerantly achievable with vanishing overall communication error, where $C$ denotes the usual capacity. Our results are not only relevant in communication over large distances, but also on-chip, where distant parts of a quantum computer might need to communicate under higher levels of noise than affecting the local gates.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent Finds Over-Parameterized Neural Networks with Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression: A Distribution-Free Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression by an over-parameterized two-layer neural network trained by gradient descent (GD) in this paper. We show that, if the neural network is trained by GD with early stopping, then the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of $\cO(\eps_n^2)$, which is the same rate as that for the classical kernel regression trained by GD with early stopping, where $\eps_n$ is the critical population rate of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the network and $n$ is the size of the training data. It is remarked that our result does not require distributional assumptions on the training data, in a strong contrast with many existing results which rely on specific distributions such as the spherical uniform data distribution or distributions satisfying certain restrictive conditions. The rate $\cO(\eps_n^2)$ is known to be minimax optimal for specific cases, such as the case that the NTK has a polynomial eigenvalue decay rate which happens under certain distributional assumptions. Our result formally fills the gap between training a classical kernel regression model and training an over-parameterized but finite-width neural network by GD for nonparametric regression without distributional assumptions. We also provide confirmative answers to certain open questions or address particular concerns in the literature of training over-parameterized neural networks by GD with early stopping for nonparametric regression, including the characterization of the stopping time, the lower bound for the network width, and the constant learning rate used in GD.</description>
