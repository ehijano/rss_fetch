      <title>Envelope vector solitons in nonlinear flexible mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to investigate the dynamics of lattice envelope vector soliton solutions propagating within a one-dimensional chain of flexible mechanical metamaterial. To model the system, we formulate discrete equations that describe the longitudinal and rotational displacements of each individual rigid unit mass using a lump element approach. By applying the multiple-scales method in the context of a semi-discrete approximation, we derive an effective nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation that characterizes the evolution of rotational and slowly varying envelope waves from the aforementioned discrete motion equations. We thus show that this flexible mechanical metamaterial chain supports envelope vector solitons where the rotational component has the form of either a bright or a dark soliton. In addition, due to nonlinear coupling, the longitudinal displacement displays kink-like profiles thus forming the 2-components vector soliton. These findings, which include specific vector envelope solutions, enrich our knowledge on the nonlinear wave solutions supported by flexible mechanical metamaterials and open new possibilities for the control of nonlinear waves and vibrations.</description>

      <title>In-situ aligned all-polarization-maintaining Er-doped fiber laser mode-locked by a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the wide applications for high-repetition-rate mode-locked fiber lasers, challenges persist in shortening the cavity length and coupling the fiber collimators for most existing techniques. Here, we introduce a novel collimator alignment method and demonstrate an all-polarization-maintaining erbium-doped fiber laser that contains a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror with a repetition rate of 213 MHz. Compared to the conventional method, we achieve in-situ alignment of the collimators in a simplified two-step process. Besides, through a comparison of the spectra from the output ports of the laser, we assess their quality and establish the spectral evolution relationships among these ports. It is found that, in addition to the widely believed large nonlinear effects, spectral interference also plays a significant role in spectral distortion. Moreover, a transition between different stability states is observed from the power variation of the single pulse.</description>

      <title>Compact expansion of a repulsive suspension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14756v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short-range repulsion governs the dynamics of matter from atoms to animals. Using theory, simulations, and experiments, we find that an ensemble of repulsive particles spreads compactly with a sharp boundary, in contrast to the diffusive spreading of Brownian particles. Starting from the pair interactions, at high densities, the many-body dynamics follow non-linear diffusion with a self-similar expansion, growing as $t^{1/4}$; At longer times, thermal motion dominates with the classic $t^{1/2}$ expansion. A logarithmic growth controlled by nearest-neighbor interactions connects the two self-similar regimes.</description>
