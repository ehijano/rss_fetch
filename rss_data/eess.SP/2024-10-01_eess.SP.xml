      <title>PHemoNet: A Multimodal Network for Physiological Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion recognition is essential across numerous fields, including medical applications and brain-computer interface (BCI). Emotional responses include behavioral reactions, such as tone of voice and body movement, and changes in physiological signals, such as the electroencephalogram (EEG). The latter are involuntary, thus they provide a reliable input for identifying emotions, in contrast to the former which individuals can consciously control. These signals reveal true emotional states without intentional alteration, thus increasing the accuracy of emotion recognition models. However, multimodal deep learning methods from physiological signals have not been significantly investigated. In this paper, we introduce PHemoNet, a fully hypercomplex network for multimodal emotion recognition from physiological signals. In detail, the architecture comprises modality-specific encoders and a fusion module. Both encoders and fusion modules are defined in the hypercomplex domain through parameterized hypercomplex multiplications (PHMs) that can capture latent relations between the different dimensions of each modality and between the modalities themselves. The proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art models on the MAHNOB-HCI dataset in classifying valence and arousal using electroencephalograms (EEGs) and peripheral physiological signals.

      <title>Enhancing EEG Signal Generation through a Hybrid Approach Integrating Reinforcement Learning and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study introduces an innovative approach to the synthesis of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by integrating diffusion models with reinforcement learning. This integration addresses key challenges associated with traditional EEG data acquisition, including participant burden, privacy concerns, and the financial costs of obtaining high-fidelity clinical data. Our methodology enhances the generation of EEG signals with detailed temporal and spectral features, enriching the authenticity and diversity of synthetic datasets. The uniqueness of our approach lies in its capacity to concurrently model time-domain characteristics, such as waveform morphology, and frequency-domain features, including rhythmic brainwave patterns, within a cohesive generative framework. This is executed through the reinforcement learning model's autonomous selection of parameter update strategies, which steers the diffusion process to accurately reflect the complex dynamics inherent in EEG signals.
  We validate the efficacy of our approach using both the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset and a proprietary dataset, each collected under stringent experimental conditions. Our results indicate that the method preserves participant privacy by generating synthetic data that lacks biometric identifiers and concurrently improves the efficiency of model training by minimizing reliance on large annotated datasets. This research offers dual contributions: firstly, it advances EEG research by providing a novel tool for data augmentation and the advancement of machine learning algorithms; secondly, it enhances brain-computer interface technologies by offering a robust solution for training models on diverse and representative EEG datasets. Collectively, this study establishes a foundation for future investigations in neurological care and the development of tailored treatment protocols in neurorehabilitation.</description>

      <title>A Multitask VAE for Time Series Preprocessing and Prediction of Blood Glucose Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data preprocessing is a critical part of time series data analysis. Data from connected medical devices often have missing or abnormal values during acquisition. Handling such situations requires additional assumptions and domain knowledge. This can be time-consuming, and can introduce a significant bias affecting predictive model accuracy and thus, medical interpretation. To overcome this issue, we propose a new deep learning model to mitigate the preprocessing assumptions. The model architecture relies on a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to produce a preprocessing latent space, and a recurrent VAE to preserve the temporal dynamics of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such an architecture on telemonitoring data to forecast glucose-level of diabetic patients. Our results show an improvement in terms of accuracy with respect of existing state-of-the-art methods and architectures.</description>

      <title>Loneliness Forecasting Using Multi-modal Wearable and Mobile Sensing in Everyday Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adverse effects of loneliness on both physical and mental well-being are profound. Although previous research has utilized mobile sensing techniques to detect mental health issues, few studies have utilized state-of-the-art wearable devices to forecast loneliness and estimate the physiological manifestations of loneliness and its predictive nature. The primary objective of this study is to examine the feasibility of forecasting loneliness by employing wearable devices, such as smart rings and watches, to monitor early physiological indicators of loneliness. Furthermore, smartphones are employed to capture initial behavioral signs of loneliness. To accomplish this, we employed personalized machine learning techniques, leveraging a comprehensive dataset comprising physiological and behavioral information obtained during our study involving the monitoring of college students. Through the development of personalized models, we achieved a notable accuracy of 0.82 and an F-1 score of 0.82 in forecasting loneliness levels seven days in advance. Additionally, the application of Shapley values facilitated model explainability. The wealth of data provided by this study, coupled with the forecasting methodology employed, possesses the potential to augment interventions and facilitate the early identification of loneliness within populations at risk.</description>

      <title>Self-Tuning Spectral Clustering for Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral clustering has proven effective in grouping speech representations for speaker diarization tasks, although post-processing the affinity matrix remains difficult due to the need for careful tuning before constructing the Laplacian. In this study, we present a novel pruning algorithm to create a sparse affinity matrix called \emph{spectral clustering on p-neighborhood retained affinity matrix} (SC-pNA). Our method improves on node-specific fixed neighbor selection by allowing a variable number of neighbors, eliminating the need for external tuning data as the pruning parameters are derived directly from the affinity matrix. SC-pNA does so by identifying two clusters in every row of the initial affinity matrix, and retains only the top $p\%$ similarity scores from the cluster containing larger similarities. Spectral clustering is performed subsequently, with the number of clusters determined as the maximum eigengap. Experimental results on the challenging DIHARD-III dataset highlight the superiority of SC-pNA, which is also computationally more efficient than existing auto-tuning approaches.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning to Detect Anxiety Disorders from Error-Related Negativity and EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anxiety is a common mental health condition characterised by excessive worry, fear and apprehension about everyday situations. Even with significant progress over the past few years, predicting anxiety from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, specifically using error-related negativity (ERN), still remains challenging. Following the PRISMA protocol, this paper systematically reviews 54 research papers on using EEG and ERN markers for anxiety detection published in the last 10 years (2013 -- 2023). Our analysis highlights the wide usage of traditional machine learning, such as support vector machines and random forests, as well as deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks across different data types. Our analysis reveals that the development of a robust and generic anxiety prediction method still needs to address real-world challenges, such as task-specific setup, feature selection and computational modelling. We conclude this review by offering potential future direction for non-invasive, objective anxiety diagnostics, deployed across diverse populations and anxiety sub-types.</description>

      <title>ROK Defense M&amp;S in the Age of Hyperscale AI: Concepts, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating hyperscale AI into national defense modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) is crucial for enhancing strategic and operational capabilities. We explore how hyperscale AI can revolutionize defense M\&amp;S by providing unprecedented accuracy, speed, and the ability to simulate complex scenarios. Countries such as the United States and China are at the forefront of adopting these technologies and are experiencing varying degrees of success. Maximizing the potential of hyperscale AI necessitates addressing critical challenges, such as closed networks, long-tail data, complex decision-making, and a shortage of experts. Future directions emphasize the adoption of domestic foundation models, the investment in various GPUs / NPUs, the utilization of big tech services, and the use of open source software. These initiatives will enhance national security, maintain competitive advantages, and promote broader technological and economic progress. With this blueprint, the Republic of Korea can strengthen its defense capabilities and stay ahead of the emerging threats of modern warfare.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Localization for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization is expected to play a significant role in future wireless networks as positioning and situational awareness, navigation and tracking, are integral parts of 6G usage scenarios. Nevertheless, in many cases localization requires extra equipment, which interferes with communications systems, while also requiring additional resources. On the other hand, high frequency and highly directional communications offer a new framework of improved resolution capabilities in the angular and range domains. The implementation of integrated sensing and communications is being explored to unify the sensing and communications systems and promote a communicate-to-sense approach. To this end, a localization algorithm is presented that utilizes beam-forming and the emerging beam-focusing technique, to estimate the location of the receiver. The algorithm can be implemented with large antenna arrays, and large intelligent surfaces. The performance of the algorithm for static and mobile users is evaluated through Monte-Carlo simulations. The results are presented with the empirical CDF for both static and mobile users, and the probability of successful estimation for static users.</description>

      <title>EMGTTL: Transformers-Based Transfer Learning for Classification of ADL using Raw Surface EMG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface Electromyography (sEMG) is widely studied for its applications in rehabilitation, prosthetics, robotic arm control, and human-machine interaction. However, classifying Activities of Daily Living (ADL) using sEMG signals often requires extensive feature extraction, which can be time-consuming and energy-intensive. The objective of this study is stated as follows. Given sEMG datasets, such as electromyography analysis of human activity databases (DB1 and DB4), with multi-channel signals corresponding to ADL, is it possible to determine the ADL categories without explicit feature extraction from sEMG signals. Further is it possible to learn across the datasets to improve the classification performances. A classification framework, named EMGTTL, is developed that uses transformers for classification of ADL and the performance is enhanced by cross-data transfer learning. The methodology is implemented on EMAHA-DB1 and EMAHA-DB4. Experiments have shown that the transformer architecture achieved 64.47% accuracy for DB1 and 68.82% for DB4. Further, using transfer learning, the accuracy improved to 66.75% for DB1 (pre-trained on DB4) and 71.04% for DB4 (pre-trained on DB1).</description>

      <title>Radio Foundation Models: Pre-training Transformers for 5G-based Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based radio fingerprinting (FP) outperforms classic localization methods in propagation environments with strong multipath effects. However, the model and data orchestration of FP are time-consuming and costly, as it requires many reference positions and extensive measurement campaigns for each environment. Instead, modern unsupervised and self-supervised learning schemes require less reference data for localization, but either their accuracy is low or they require additional sensor information, rendering them impractical. In this paper we propose a self-supervised learning framework that pre-trains a general transformer (TF) neural network on 5G channel measurements that we collect on-the-fly without expensive equipment. Our novel pretext task randomly masks and drops input information to learn to reconstruct it. So, it implicitly learns the spatiotemporal patterns and information of the propagation environment that enable FP-based localization. Most interestingly, when we optimize this pre-trained model for localization in a given environment, it achieves the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods but requires ten times less reference data and significantly reduces the time from training to operation.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Antenna Position Design for IRS-Aided Multi-User Movable Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA) technologies have been proposed to enhance wireless communications by creating favorable channel conditions. This paper investigates the joint beamforming and antenna position design for an MA-enabled IRS (MA-IRS)-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) communication system, where the MA-IRS is deployed to aid the communication between the MA-enabled base station (BS) and user equipment (UE). In contrast to conventional fixed position antenna (FPA)-enabled IRS (FPA-IRS), the MA-IRS enhances the wireless channel by controlling the positions of the reflecting elements. To verify the system's effectiveness and optimize its performance, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem with a minimum rate threshold constraint for the MU-MISO communication. To tackle the non-convex problem, a product Riemannian manifold optimization (PRMO) method is proposed for the joint design of the beamforming and MA positions. Specifically, a product Riemannian manifold space (PRMS) is constructed and the corresponding Riemannian gradient is derived for updating the variables, and the Riemannian exact penalty (REP) method and a Riemannian Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (RBFGS) algorithm is derived to obtain a feasible solution over the PRMS. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with the conventional FPA-IRS-aided MU-MISO communication, the reflecting elements of the MA-IRS can move to the positions with higher channel gain, thus enhancing the system performance. Furthermore, it is shown that integrating MA with IRS leads to higher performance gains compared to integrating MA with BS.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Photoplethysmography-Based Sleep Staging Models by Leveraging Temporal Context for Wearable Devices Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate sleep stage classification is crucial for diagnosing sleep disorders and evaluating sleep quality. While polysomnography (PSG) remains the gold standard, photoplethysmography (PPG) is more practical due to its affordability and widespread use in wearable devices. However, state-of-the-art sleep staging methods often require prolonged continuous signal acquisition, making them impractical for wearable devices due to high energy consumption. Shorter signal acquisitions are more feasible but less accurate. Our work proposes an adapted sleep staging model based on top-performing state-of-the-art methods and evaluates its performance with different PPG segment sizes. We concatenate 30-second PPG segments over 15-minute intervals to leverage longer segment contexts. This approach achieved an accuracy of 0.75, a Cohen's Kappa of 0.60, an F1-Weighted score of 0.74, and an F1-Macro score of 0.60. Although reducing segment size decreased sensitivity for deep and REM stages, our strategy outperformed single 30-second window methods, particularly for these stages.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Neural Network based Indoor User Localization using Cloud Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid quantum neural network (HQNN) for indoor user localization using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values. We use publicly available RSSI datasets for indoor localization using WiFi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee to test the performance of the proposed HQNN. We also compare the performance of the HQNN with the recently proposed quantum fingerprinting-based user localization method. Our results show that the proposed HQNN performs better than the quantum fingerprinting algorithm since the HQNN has trainable parameters in the quantum circuits, whereas the quantum fingerprinting algorithm uses a fixed quantum circuit to calculate the similarity between the test data point and the fingerprint dataset. Unlike prior works, we also test the performance of the HQNN and quantum fingerprint algorithm on a real IBM quantum computer using cloud quantum computing services. Therefore, this paper examines the performance of the HQNN on noisy intermediate scale (NISQ) quantum devices using real-world RSSI localization datasets. The novelty of our approach lies in the use of simple feature maps and ansatz with fewer neurons, alongside testing on actual quantum hardware using real-world data, demonstrating practical applicability in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>An Intrinsically Knowledge-Transferring Developmental Spiking Neural Network for Tactile Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient descent computed by backpropagation (BP) is a widely used learning method for training artificial neural networks but has several limitations: it is computationally demanding, requires frequent manual tuning of the network architecture, and is prone to catastrophic forgetting when learning incrementally. To address these issues, we introduce a brain-mimetic developmental spiking neural network (BDNN) that mimics the postnatal development of neural circuits. We validate its performance through a neuromorphic tactile system capable of learning to recognize objects through grasping. Unlike traditional BP-based methods, BDNN exhibits strong knowledge transfer, supporting efficient incremental learning of new tactile information. It requires no hyperparameter tuning and dynamically adapts to incoming data. Moreover, compared to the BP-based counterpart, it achieves classification accuracy on par with BP while learning over ten times faster in ideal conditions and up to two or three orders of magnitude faster in practical settings. These features make BDNN well-suited for fast data processing on edge devices.</description>

      <title>Challenge-Response to Authenticate Drone Communications: A Game Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for physical layer authentications based on the challenge-response concept for a transmitting drone (Alice). In a preliminary training phase, Alice moves over several positions, and Bob (either a drone or a ground device) estimates the Alice-Bob channel gains. Then Alice transmits its message from different random positions (challenge) and Bob, upon receiving the messages, authenticates the sender via a log-likelihood test on the estimated channel gains (response). In turn, the intruder Trudy selects random positions on which she transmits messages on behalf of Alice to Bob. In this paper, we design the probability mass distribution of Alice's challenge positions and the Trudy response positions by modeling the problem as a zero-sum game between Bob and Trudy, where the payoff of Trudy is the missed detection probability. Moreover, we propose three different approaches that minimize the energy spent by Alice without sacrificing security, which differ in computational complexity and resulting energy consumption. Finally, we test the proposed technique via numerical simulations, which include a realistic model of both Alice-Bob and Trudy-Bob fading channels, affected by shadowing.</description>

      <title>Interference Cancellation Schemes for Full-Duplex Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the introduction of interference cancellation in full-duplex joint radar and communication receivers is analysed. More specifically, a focus is made on scenarios in which the receiver simultaneously receives radar echoes from the environment, and communication signals from other joint radar and communication transceivers. First, the phase-coded frequency modulated continuous wave waveform designed for integrated sensing and communication is presented. Then, simple structures in which interference cancellation is only applied at the radar or communication function are proposed, relying on the information gathered at the other function. The detection probability and bit error rate improvements are analysed numerically w.r.t. different system parameters, such as the communication constellation, or the number of transmitted pulses. The introduction of error correcting codes is also considered. Next, iterative interference cancellation structures are investigated. Thanks to multiple interference cancellation layers, both the radar and communication performance are improved, and the robustness of the system to any scenario is enhanced. This is shown numerically through the analysis of the performance achieved by simple and iterative structures, which are compared for different radar echo to communication signal power ratio. Finally, a dynamic automotive scenario is considered. Leveraging on previous radar measurements, the parameters of the radar echo are inferred, and it is reconstructed beforehand, enabling to remove the first radar processing block. The complexity of the iterative structures is thus reduced, at the price of a slight performance reduction. A dynamic automotive scenario is considered, highlighting the impact of the tracking of the next vehicle ahead on the system.</description>

      <title>On Neural-Network Representation of Wireless Self-Interference for Inband Full-Duplex Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network modeling is a key technology of science and research and a platform for deployment of algorithms to systems. In wireless communications, system modeling plays a pivotal role for interference cancellation with specifically high requirements of accuracy regarding the elimination of self-interference in full-duplex relays. This paper hence investigates the potential of identification and representation of the self-interference channel by neural network architectures. The approach is promising for its ability to cope with nonlinear representations, but the variability of channel characteristics is a first obstacle in straightforward application of data-driven neural networks. We therefore propose architectures with a touch of "adaptivity" to accomplish a successful training. For reproducibility of results and further investigations with possibly stronger models and enhanced performance, we document and share our data.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Power Outage Prediction for Rapid Disaster Response and Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme weather events are increasingly common due to climate change, posing significant risks. To mitigate further damage, a shift towards renewable energy is imperative. Unfortunately, underrepresented communities that are most affected often receive infrastructure improvements last. We propose a novel visual spatiotemporal framework for predicting nighttime lights (NTL), power outage severity and location before and after major hurricanes. Central to our solution is the Visual-Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (VST-GNN), to learn spatial and temporal coherence from images. Our work brings awareness to underrepresented areas in urgent need of enhanced energy infrastructure, such as future photovoltaic (PV) deployment. By identifying the severity and localization of power outages, our initiative aims to raise awareness and prompt action from policymakers and community stakeholders. Ultimately, this effort seeks to empower regions with vulnerable energy infrastructure, enhancing resilience and reliability for at-risk communities.</description>

      <title>Impact of Electrode Position on Forearm Orientation Invariant Hand Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Variation of forearm orientation is one of the crucial factors that drastically degrades the forearm orientation invariant hand gesture recognition performance or the degree of freedom and limits the successful commercialization of myoelectric prosthetic hand or electromyogram (EMG) signal-based human-computer interfacing devices. This study investigates the impact of surface EMG electrode positions (elbow and forearm) on forearm orientation invariant hand gesture recognition. Methods: The study has been performed over 19 intact limbed subjects, considering 12 daily living hand gestures. The quality of the EMG signal is confirmed in terms of three indices. Then, the recognition performance is evaluated and validated by considering three training strategies, six feature extraction methods, and three classifiers. Results: The forearm electrode position provides comparable to or better EMG signal quality considering three indices. In this research, the forearm electrode position achieves up to 5.35% improved forearm orientation invariant hand gesture recognition performance compared to the elbow electrode position. The obtained performance is validated by considering six feature extraction methods, three classifiers, and real-time experiments. In addition, the forearm electrode position shows its robustness with the existence of recent works, considering recognition performance, investigated gestures, the number of channels, the dimensionality of feature space, and the number of subjects. Conclusion: The forearm electrode position can be the best choice for getting improved forearm orientation invariant hand gesture recognition performance. Significance: The performance of myoelectric prosthesis and human-computer interfacing devices can be improved with this optimized electrode position.</description>

      <title>Shuffled Linear Regression via Spectral Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shuffled linear regression (SLR) seeks to estimate latent features through a linear transformation, complicated by unknown permutations in the measurement dimensions. This problem extends traditional least-squares (LS) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) approaches by jointly estimating the permutation, resulting in shuffled LS and shuffled LASSO formulations. Existing methods, constrained by the combinatorial complexity of permutation recovery, often address small-scale cases with limited measurements. In contrast, we focus on large-scale SLR, particularly suited for environments with abundant measurement samples. We propose a spectral matching method that efficiently resolves permutations by aligning spectral components of the measurement and feature covariances. Rigorous theoretical analyses demonstrate that our method achieves accurate estimates in both shuffled LS and shuffled LASSO settings, given a sufficient number of samples. Furthermore, we extend our approach to address simultaneous pose and correspondence estimation in image registration tasks. Experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world image registration scenarios show that our method outperforms existing algorithms in both estimation accuracy and registration performance.</description>

      <title>What If We Had Used a Different App? Reliable Counterfactual KPI Analysis in Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern wireless network architectures, such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), the operation of the radio access network (RAN) is managed by applications, or apps for short, deployed at intelligent controllers. These apps are selected from a given catalog based on current contextual information. For instance, a scheduling app may be selected on the basis of current traffic and network conditions. Once an app is chosen and run, it is no longer possible to directly test the performance that would have been obtained with another app. This test, however, would be potentially valuable to monitor and optimize the network operation. With this goal in mind, this paper addresses the "what-if" problem of estimating the values of key performance indicators (KPIs) that would have been obtained if a different app had been implemented by the RAN. To this end, we propose a conformal-prediction-based counterfactual analysis method for wireless systems that provides reliable "error bars" for the estimated KPIs, containing the true KPIs with a user-defined probability, despite the inherent covariate shift between logged and test data. Experimental results for medium access control-layer apps and for physical-layer apps demonstrate the merits of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Quantized and Asynchronous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in federated learning have shown that asynchronous variants can be faster and more scalable than their synchronous counterparts. However, their design does not include quantization, which is necessary in practice to deal with the communication bottleneck. To bridge this gap, we develop a novel algorithm, Quantized Asynchronous Federated Learning (QAFeL), which introduces a hidden-state quantization scheme to avoid the error propagation caused by direct quantization. QAFeL also includes a buffer to aggregate client updates, ensuring scalability and compatibility with techniques such as secure aggregation. Furthermore, we prove that QAFeL achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ ergodic convergence rate for stochastic gradient descent on non-convex objectives, which is the optimal order of complexity, without requiring bounded gradients or uniform client arrivals. We also prove that the cross-term error between staleness and quantization only affects the higher-order error terms. We validate our theoretical findings on standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Input and State Estimation for Multi-agent System with Dynamic Topology and Heterogeneous Sensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A crucial challenge in decentralized systems is state estimation in the presence of unknown inputs, particularly within heterogeneous sensor networks with dynamic topologies. While numerous consensus algorithms have been introduced, they often require extensive information exchange or multiple communication iterations to ensure estimation accuracy. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm that achieves an unbiased and optimal solution comparable to filters with full information about other agents. This is accomplished through the use of information filter decomposition and the fusion of inputs via covariance intersection. Our method requires only a single communication iteration for exchanging individual estimates between agents, instead of multiple rounds of information exchange, thus preserving agents' privacy by avoiding the sharing of explicit observations and system equations. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by dynamic communication topologies, we propose two practical strategies to handle issues arising from intermittent observations and incomplete state estimation, thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the estimation process. Experiments and ablation studies conducted in both stationary and dynamic environments demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over other baselines. Notably, it performs as well as, or even better than, algorithms that have a global view of all neighbors.</description>

      <title>Pre-Chirp-Domain Index Modulation for Full-Diversity Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing towards 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), tailored as a superior multicarrier technique utilizing chirp signals for high-mobility communications, is envisioned as a promising candidate for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless network. AFDM is based on the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) with two adjustable parameters of the chirp signals, termed as the pre-chirp and post-chirp parameters, respectively. We show that the pre-chirp counterpart can be flexibly manipulated for additional degree-of-freedom (DoF). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel AFDM scheme with the pre-chirp index modulation (PIM) philosophy (AFDM-PIM), which can implicitly convey extra information bits through dynamic pre-chirp parameter assignment, thus enhancing both spectral and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first demonstrate that the subcarrier orthogonality is still maintained by applying distinct pre-chirp parameters to various subcarriers in the AFDM modulation process. Inspired by this property, each AFDM subcarrier is constituted with a unique pre-chirp signal according to the incoming bits. By such arrangement, extra binary bits can be embedded into the index patterns of pre-chirp parameter assignment without additional energy consumption. For performance analysis, we derive the asymptotically tight upper bounds on the average bit error rates (BERs) of the proposed schemes with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection, and validate that the proposed AFDM-PIM can achieve the optimal diversity order under doubly dispersive channels. Based on the derivations, we further propose an optimal pre-chirp alphabet design to enhance the BER performance via intelligent optimization algorithms. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed AFDM-PIM outperforms the classical benchmarks under doubly dispersive channel.</description>

      <title>Frequency Diverse Array-enabled RIS-aided Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been envisioned as a prospective technology to enable ubiquitous sensing and communications in next-generation wireless networks. In contrast to existing works on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided ISAC systems using conventional phased arrays (PAs), this paper investigates a frequency diverse array (FDA)-enabled RIS-aided ISAC system, where the FDA aims to provide a distance-angle-dependent beampattern to effectively suppress the clutter, and RIS is employed to establish high-quality links between the BS and users/target. We aim to maximize sum rate by jointly optimizing the BS transmit beamforming vectors, the covariance matrix of the dedicated radar signal, the RIS phase shift matrix, the FDA frequency offsets and the radar receive equalizer, while guaranteeing the required signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) of the radar echo signal. To tackle this challenging problem, we first theoretically prove that the dedicated radar signal is unnecessary for enhancing target sensing performance, based on which the original problem is much simplified. Then, we turn our attention to the single-user single-target (SUST) scenario to demonstrate that the FDA-RIS-aided ISAC system always achieves a higher SCNR than its PA-RIS-aided counterpart. Moreover, it is revealed that the SCNR increment exhibits linear growth with the BS transmit power and the number of BS receive antennas. In order to effectively solve this simplified problem, we leverage the fractional programming (FP) theory and subsequently develop an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on symmetric alternating direction method of multipliers (SADMM) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithm in terms of sum rate and radar SCNR.</description>

      <title>Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow: Towards Minimum MSE Photo-Realistic Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods typically attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for parameter learning when the studied model exhibits random discontinuous jumps in behaviour. To facilitate the learning of high dimensional parameter sets, such as those associated to neural networks, we adopt the emerging framework of differentiable particle filtering, wherein parameters are trained by gradient descent. We design a new differentiable interacting multiple model particle filter to be capable of learning the individual behavioural regimes and the model which controls the jumping simultaneously. In contrast to previous approaches, our algorithm allows control of the computational effort assigned per regime whilst using the probability of being in a given regime to guide sampling. Furthermore, we develop a new gradient estimator that has a lower variance than established approaches and remains fast to compute, for which we prove consistency. We establish new theoretical results of the presented algorithms and demonstrate superior numerical performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Cross-Domain Message Passing for OTFS Transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of the cross-domain iterative detection (CDID) framework with orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, where two distinct CDID algorithms are presented. The proposed schemes estimate/detect the information symbols iteratively across the frequency domain and the delay-Doppler (DD) domain via passing either the a posteriori or extrinsic information. Building upon this framework, we investigate the error performance by considering the bias evolution and state evolution. Furthermore, we discuss their error performance in convergence and the DD domain error state lower bounds in each iteration. Specifically, we demonstrate that in convergence, the ultimate error performance of the CDID passing the a posteriori information can be characterized by two potential convergence points. In contrast, the ultimate error performance of the CDID passing the extrinsic information has only one convergence point, which, interestingly, aligns with the matched filter bound. Our numerical results confirm our analytical findings and unveil the promising error performance achieved by the proposed designs.</description>

      <title>Design and In-training Optimization of Binary Search ADC for Flexible Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible Electronics (FE) offer distinct advantages, including mechanical flexibility and low process temperatures, enabling extremely low-cost production. To address the demands of applications such as smart sensors and wearables, flexible devices must be small and operate at low supply voltages. Additionally, target applications often require classifiers to operate directly on analog sensory input, necessitating the use of Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) to process the sensory data.
  However, ADCs present serious challenges, particularly in terms of high area and power consumption, especially when considering stringent area and energy budget. In this work, we target common classifiers in this domain such as MLPs and SVMs and present a holistic approach to mitigate the elevated overhead of analog to digital interfacing in FE. First, we propose a novel design for Binary Search ADC that reduces area overhead 2X compared with the state-of-the-art Binary design and up to 5.4X compared with Flash ADC. Next, we present an in-training ADC optimization in which we keep the bare-minimum representations required and simplifying ADCs by removing unnecessary components. Our in-training optimization further reduces on average the area in terms of transistor count of the required ADCs by 5X for less than 1% accuracy loss.</description>

      <title>Outage-Constrained Sum Secrecy Rate Maximization for STAR-RIS with Energy-Harvesting Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel strategy for enhancing secure wireless communication through the use of a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) in a multiple-input single-output system. In the presence of energy-harvesting eavesdroppers, the study aims to maximize the secrecy rate while adhering to strict energy harvesting constraints. By dynamically manipulating the wireless environment with the STAR-RIS, the research examines the balance between harvested energy and secrecy rate under two key protocols: energy splitting and mode selection. The study addresses both imperfect and perfect channel state information (CSI) and formulates a complex non-convex optimization problem, which is solved using a penalty concave convex procedure combined with an alternating optimization algorithm. The method optimizes beamforming and STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficients to achieve a optimal balance between secure communication and energy harvesting constraints. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach is effective, even with imperfect CSI, and outperforms conventional RIS methods in terms of robust security and energy performance.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Spatial-Spectral Partial Volume Compartment Mapping with Applications to Multicomponent Diffusion and Relaxation MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm to solve a regularized spatial-spectral image estimation problem. Our approach is based on the linearized alternating directions method of multipliers (LADMM), which is a variation of the popular ADMM algorithm. Although LADMM has existed for some time, it has not been very widely used in the computational imaging literature. This is in part because there are many possible ways of mapping LADMM to a specific optimization problem, and it is nontrivial to find a computationally efficient implementation out of the many competing alternatives. We believe that our proposed implementation represents the first application of LADMM to the type of optimization problem considered in this work (involving a linear-mixture forward model, spatial regularization, and nonnegativity constraints). We evaluate our algorithm in a variety of multiparametric MRI partial volume mapping scenarios (diffusion-relaxation, relaxation-relaxation, relaxometry, and fingerprinting), where we consistently observe substantial ($\sim$3$\times$-50$\times$) speed improvements. We expect this to reduce barriers to using spatially-regularized partial volume compartment mapping methods. Further, the considerable improvements we observed also suggest the potential value of considering LADMM for a broader set of computational imaging problems.</description>

      <title>Removing the need for ground truth UWB data collection: self-supervised ranging error correction using deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indoor positioning using UWB technology has gained interest due to its centimeter-level accuracy potential. However, multipath effects and non-line-of-sight conditions cause ranging errors between anchors and tags. Existing approaches for mitigating these ranging errors rely on collecting large labeled datasets, making them impractical for real-world deployments. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised deep reinforcement learning approach that does not require labeled ground truth data. A reinforcement learning agent uses the channel impulse response as a state and predicts corrections to minimize the error between corrected and estimated ranges. The agent learns, self-supervised, by iteratively improving corrections that are generated by combining the predictability of trajectories with filtering and smoothening. Experiments on real-world UWB measurements demonstrate comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised methods, overcoming data dependency and lack of generalizability limitations. This makes self-supervised deep reinforcement learning a promising solution for practical and scalable UWB-ranging error correction.</description>

      <title>Misspecification of Multiple Scattering in Scalar Wave Fields and its Impact in Ultrasound Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the localization of targets in the presence of multiple scattering. We focus on the often omitted scenario in which measurement data is affected by multiple scattering, and a simpler model is employed in the estimation. We study the impact of such model mismatch by means of the Misspecified Cram\'er-Rao Bound (MCRB). In numerical simulations inspired by tomographic inspection in ultrasound nondestructive testing, the MCRB is shown to correctly describe the estimation variance of localization parameters under misspecification of the wave propagation model. We provide extensive discussion on the utility of the MCRB in the practical task of verifying whether a chosen misspecified model is suitable for localization based on the properties of the maximum likelihood estimator and the nuanced distinction between bias and parameter space differences. Finally, we highlight that careful interpretation is needed whenever employing the classical CRB in the presence of mismatch through numerical examples based on the Born approximation and other simplified propagation models stemming from it.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Automated Diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Sleep Stage Classification in Children Using Millimeter-wave Radar and Pulse Oximeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Study Objectives: To evaluate the agreement between the millimeter-wave radar-based device and polysomnography (PSG) in diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and classification of sleep stage in children. Methods: 281 children, aged 1 to 18 years, who underwent sleep monitoring between September and November 2023 at the Sleep Center of Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, were recruited in the study. All enrolled children underwent sleep monitoring by PSG and the millimeter-wave radar-based device, QSA600, simultaneously. QSA600 recordings were automatically analyzed using a deep learning model meanwhile the PSG data was manually scored. Results: The Obstructive Apnea-Hypopnea Index (OAHI) obtained from QSA600 and PSG demonstrates a high level of agreement with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.945 (95% CI: 0.93 to 0.96). Bland-Altman analysis indicates that the mean difference of OAHI between QSA600 and PSG is -0.10 events/h (95% CI: -11.15 to 10.96). The deep learning model evaluated through cross-validation showed good sensitivity (81.8%, 84.3% and 89.7%) and specificity (90.5%, 95.3% and 97.1%) values for diagnosing children with OAHI&gt;1, OAHI&gt;5 and OAHI&gt;10. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.923, 0.955 and 0.988, respectively. For sleep stage classification, the model achieved Kappa coefficients of 0.854, 0.781, and 0.734, with corresponding overall accuracies of 95.0%, 84.8%, and 79.7% for Wake-sleep classification, Wake-REM-Light-Deep classification, and Wake-REM-N1-N2 N3 classification, respectively. Conclusions: QSA600 has demonstrated high agreement with PSG in diagnosing OSA and performing sleep staging in children. The device is portable, low-load and suitable for follow up and long-term pediatric sleep assessment.</description>

      <title>Joint Microseismic Event Detection and Location with a Detection Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microseismic event detection and location are two primary components in microseismic monitoring, which offers us invaluable insights into the subsurface during reservoir stimulation and evolution. Conventional approaches for event detection and location often suffer from manual intervention and/or heavy computation, while current machine learning-assisted approaches typically address detection and location separately; such limitations hinder the potential for real-time microseismic monitoring. We propose an approach to unify event detection and source location into a single framework by adapting a Convolutional Neural Network backbone and an encoder-decoder Transformer with a set-based Hungarian loss, which is applied directly to recorded waveforms. The proposed network is trained on synthetic data simulating multiple microseismic events corresponding to random source locations in the area of suspected microseismic activities. A synthetic test on a 2D profile of the SEAM Time Lapse model illustrates the capability of the proposed method in detecting the events properly and locating them in the subsurface accurately; while, a field test using the Arkoma Basin data further proves its practicability, efficiency, and its potential in paving the way for real-time monitoring of microseismic events.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction is based on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes, i.e., the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET, which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). The $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs, and which may be performed either locally or per-scale. These pooling operations are harder to define in both traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets, and geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are able to extract a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be used along with very simple machine learning methods (i.e., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification systems with far fewer parameters to train than most modern graph neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</description>

      <title>Efficient Federated Low Rank Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop and analyze a Gradient Descent (GD) based solution, called Alternating GD and Minimization (AltGDmin), for efficiently solving the low rank matrix completion (LRMC) in a federated setting. LRMC involves recovering an $n \times q$ rank-$r$ matrix $\Xstar$ from a subset of its entries when $r \ll \min(n,q)$. Our theoretical guarantees (iteration and sample complexity bounds) imply that AltGDmin is the most communication-efficient solution in a federated setting, is one of the fastest, and has the second best sample complexity among all iterative solutions to LRMC. In addition, we also prove two important corollaries. (a) We provide a guarantee for AltGDmin for solving the noisy LRMC problem. (b) We show how our lemmas can be used to provide an improved sample complexity guarantee for AltMin, which is the fastest centralized solution.</description>
