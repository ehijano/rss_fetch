      <title>Enhancing Urban Sensing Utility with Sensor-enabled Vehicles and Easily Accessible Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban sensing is essential for the development of smart cities, enabling monitoring, computing, and decision-making for urban management.Thanks to the advent of vehicle technologies, modern vehicles are transforming from solely mobility tools to valuable sensors for urban data collection, and hold the potential of improving traffic congestion, transport sustainability, and infrastructure inspection.Vehicle-based sensing is increasingly recognized as a promising technology due to its flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and extensive spatiotemporal coverage. However, optimizing sensing strategies to balance spatial and temporal coverage, minimize redundancy, and address budget constraints remains a key challenge.This study proposes an adaptive framework for enhancing the sensing utility of sensor-equipped vehicles.By integrating heterogeneous open-source data, the framework leverages spatiotemporal weighting to optimize vehicle selection and sensing coverage across various urban contexts.An entropy-based vehicle selection strategy, \texttt{Improved OptiFleet}, is developed to maximize sensing utility while minimizing redundancy.The framework is validated using real-world air quality data from 320 sensor-equipped vehicles operating in Guangzhou, China, over two months.Key findings show that the proposed method outperforms baseline strategies, providing up to 5\% higher sensing utility with reduced fleet sizes, and also highlights the critical role of dynamic urban data in optimizing mobile sensing strategies.</description>

      <title>DBMC-aNOMAly: Asynchronous NOMA with Pilot-Symbol Optimization Protocol for Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple access (MA) schemes can enable cooperation between multiple nodes in future diffusion-based molecular communication (DBMC) networks. Non-orthogonal MA for DBMC networks (DBMC-NOMA) is a promising option for efficient simultaneous MA using a single molecule type. Expanding significantly upon previous work on the topic, this paper addresses the question of parameter optimization and bit error probability (BEP) reduction in an asynchronous network using DBMC-NOMA. First, we analytically derive the associated BEP and use the result for a thorough comparison with other MA schemes like time-division and molecule-division MA. We show that the asynchronous nature of the system can be exploited for performance gain, and the upper-bound performance can be achieved in all circumstances by avoiding a few worst-case offset configurations. Subsequently, we propose DBMC-aNOMAly, a pilot-symbol-based optimization protocol for asynchronous DBMC-NOMA, and extensively evaluate it using Monte-Carlo simulations. DBMC-aNOMAly is shown to provide robust BEP reduction for different network sizes, noise levels, subjected to sampling jitter, as well as for changing conditions during runtime, particularly, compared to protocols in previous work. DBMC-aNOMAly consists of a set of simple operations such as comparisons and additions, deliberately designed to be implementable with chemical reaction networks, setting up future work on the realistic modeling of the protocol.</description>

      <title>The Native Spiking Microarchitecture: From Iontronic Primitives to Bit-Exact FP8 Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and recent breakthroughs by Huanting Wang's team at Monash University establish angstrom-scale channels as promising post-silicon substrates with native integrate-and-fire (IF) dynamics. However, utilizing these stochastic, analog materials for deterministic, bit-exact AI workloads (e.g., FP8) remains a paradox. Existing neuromorphic methods often settle for approximation, failing Transformer precision standards. To traverse the gap "from stochastic ions to deterministic floats," we propose a Native Spiking Microarchitecture. Treating noisy neurons as logic primitives, we introduce a Spatial Combinational Pipeline and a Sticky-Extra Correction mechanism. Validation across all 16,129 FP8 pairs confirms 100% bit-exact alignment with PyTorch. Crucially, our architecture reduces Linear layer latency to O(log N), yielding a 17x speedup. Physical simulations further demonstrate robustness against extreme membrane leakage (beta approx 0.01), effectively immunizing the system against the stochastic nature of the hardware.</description>

      <title>JEEVHITAA -- An End-to-End HCAI System to Support Collective Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current mobile health platforms are predominantly individual-centric and lack the necessary primitives for coordinated, auditable, multi-actor workflows. However, in many settings worldwide, health decisions are enacted by multi-actor care networks rather than single users. We present JEEVHITAA, an Android/Flutter system that provides context-sensitive, role-aware sharing and verifiable information flows for care circles. JEEVHITAA ingests platform and device data (via Google Health Connect and BLE connectors), constructs multi-layer user profiles from sensor streams and tiered onboarding, and enforces fine-grained, time-bounded access control across permissioned care graphs. Data are end-to-end encrypted in local stores and during peer sync (Firebase), and provisions are made for document capture by camera or upload as PDF. An integrated retrieval-augmented LLM pipeline (i) produces structured, role-targeted summaries and action plans, (ii) enables users to gather advanced insights on health reports, and (iii) performs evidence-grounded user-relevant verification of arbitrary health content, returning provenance, confidence scores, and source citations. We describe the system architecture, connector abstractions, and security primitives, and evaluate robustness and compatibility using synthetic, ontology-driven simulations and vendor compatibility tests. Finally, we outline plans for longitudinal in-the-wild deployments to measure system performance, the correctness of access control, and the real-world effectiveness of relationship-aware credibility support.</description>

      <title>Estimating Black Carbon Concentration from Urban Traffic Using Vision-Based Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black carbon (BC) emissions in urban areas are primarily driven by traffic, with hotspots near major roads disproportionately affecting marginalized communities. Because BC monitoring is typically performed using costly and specialized instruments. there is little to no available data on BC from local traffic sources that could help inform policy interventions targeting local factors. By contrast, traffic monitoring systems are widely deployed in cities around the world, highlighting the imbalance between what we know about traffic conditions and what do not know about their environmental consequences. To bridge this gap, we propose a machine learning-driven system that extracts visual information from traffic video to capture vehicles behaviors and conditions. Combining these features with weather data, our model estimates BC at street level, achieving an R-squared value of 0.72 and RMSE of 129.42 ng/m3 (nanogram per cubic meter). From a sustainability perspective, this work leverages resources already supported by urban infrastructure and established modeling techniques to generate information relevant to traffic emission. Obtaining BC concentration data provides actionable insights to support pollution reduction, urban planning, public health, and environmental justice at the local municipal level.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Data Valuation and Monetisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As organisations increasingly recognise data as a strategic resource, they face the challenge of translating informational assets into measurable business value. Existing valuation approaches remain fragmented, often separating economic, governance, and strategic perspectives and lacking operational mechanisms suitable for real settings. This paper introduces a unified valuation framework that integrates these perspectives into a coherent decision-support model. Building on two artefacts from the Horizon Europe DATAMITE project, a taxonomy of data-quality and performance metrics, and an Analytic Network Process (ANP) tool for deriving relative importance, we develop a hybrid valuation model. The model combines qualitative scoring, cost- and utility-based estimation, relevance/quality indexing, and multi-criteria weighting to define data value transparently and systematically. Anchored in the Balanced Scorecard (BSC), the framework aligns indicators and valuation outcomes with organisational strategy, enabling firms to assess monetisation potential across Data-as-a-Service, Information-as-a-Service, and Answers-as-a-Service pathways. Methodologically, the study follows a Design Science approach complemented by embedded case studies with industrial partners, which informed continual refinement of the model. Because the evaluation is connected to a high-level taxonomy, the approach also reveals how valuation considerations map to BSC perspectives. Across the analysed use cases, the framework demonstrated flexibility, transparency, and reduced arbitrariness in valuation, offering organisations a structured basis for linking data assets to strategic and economic outcomes.</description>

      <title>CMOS 2.0 -- Redefining the Future of Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to revisit the functional scaling paradigm by capitalizing on two recent developments in advanced chip manufacturing, namely 3D wafer bonding and backside processing. This approach leads to the proposal of the CMOS 2.0 platform. The main idea is to shift the CMOS roadmap from geometric scaling to fine-grain heterogeneous 3D stacking of specialized active device layers to achieve the ultimate Power-Performance-Area and Cost gains expected from future technology generations. However, the efficient utilization of such a platform requires devising architectures that can optimally map onto this technology, as well as the EDA infrastructure that supports it. We also discuss reliability concerns and eventual mitigation approaches. This paper provides pointers into the major disruptions we expect in the design of systems in CMOS 2.0 moving forward.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the standards body for mobile networks, is in the final phase of Release 19 standardization and is beginning Release 20. Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning (AI/ML) has brought about a paradigm shift in technology and it is being adopted across industries and verticals. 3GPP has been integrating AI/ML into the 5G advanced system since Release 18. This paper focuses on the AI/ML related technological advancements and features introduced in Release 19 within the Service and System Aspects (SA) Technical specifications group of 3GPP. The advancements relate to two paradigms: (i) enhancements that AI/ML brought to the 5G advanced system (AI for network), e.g. resource optimization, and (ii) enhancements that were made to the 5G system to support AI/ML applications (Network for AI), e.g. image recognition.</description>

      <title>Solving Sudoku using oscillatory neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the capabilities of physical computing with Oscillatory Neural Networks (ONN) to solve combinatorial optimization problems. To solve Sudokus with ONNs, we define a novel mapping strategy that utilizes the unique characteristics of the computation paradigm. The problem is encoded through a puzzle specific graph-embedding, which implements the constraints through different subgraphs. These subgraphs are then combined into a single adjacency matrix, which allows the natural dynamics of the phases of coupled oscillators to find a solution to the puzzle. We model the phase dynamics of the ONN by means of the Kuramoto differential equation. This novel approach is then compared to the well-established iterative method to solve Sudoku already used in binary Hopfield networks (HNN). Solving optimization problems typically requires a large amount of energy to solve on conventional hardware. Therefore, we are motivated to explore the mapping of Sudoku from a theoretical point of view to establish the validity of this approach. The simulation results show that the novel ONN mapping outperforms the established HNN methodology.</description>

      <title>From GPUs to RRAMs: Distributed In-Memory Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Method for Solving Large-Scale Linear Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of computational workloads is surpassing the capabilities of conventional architectures, which are constrained by fundamental limits. In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.</description>
