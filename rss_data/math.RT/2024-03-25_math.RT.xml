      <title>Uniqueness up to Inner Automorphism of Regular Exact Borel Subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K\"ulshammer, K\"onig and Ovsienko proved that for any quasi-hereditary algebra $(A,\leq_A)$ there exists a Morita equivalent quasi-hereditary algebra $(R, \leq_R)$ containing a basic exact Borel subalgebra $B$. The obtained Borel subalgebra is in fact a regular exact Borel subalgebra. Later, Conde showed that given a quasi-hereditary algebra $(R,\leq_R)$ with a basic regular exact Borel subalgebra $B$ and a Morita equivalent quasi-hereditary algebra $(R',\leq_{R'})$ with a basic regular exact Borel subalgebra $B'$, the algebras $R$ and $R'$ are isomorphic, and K\"ulshammer and Miemietz showed that there is even an isomorphism $\varphi:R\rightarrow R'$ such that $\varphi(B)=B'$.
  In this article, we show that if $R=R'$, then $\varphi$ can be chosen to be an inner automorphism. Moreover, instead of just proving this for regular exact Borel subalgebras of quasi-hereditary algebras, we generalize this to an appropriate class of subalgebras of arbitrary finite-dimensional algebras. As an application, we show that if $(A, \leq_A)$ is a finite-dimensional algebra and $G$ is a finite group acting on $A$ via automorphisms, then under some natural compatibility conditions, there is a Morita equivalent quasi-hereditary algebra $(R, \leq_R)$ with a basic regular exact Borel subalgebra $B$ such that $g(B)=B$ for every $g\in G$.</description>

      <title>Symplectic differential reduction algebras and skew-affine generalized Weyl algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a map $\varphi\!:U(\mathfrak{g})\rightarrow A$ of associative algebras, $U(\mathfrak{g})$ the universal enveloping algebra of a (complex) finite-dimensional reductive Lie algebra, the representation theory of $A$ is intimately tied to the representation theory of the $A$-subquotient known as the reduction algebra for $(A,\mathfrak{g}, \varphi)$. Herlemont and Ogievetsky studied differential reduction algebras for the general linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ as the algebra of $h$-deformed differential operators formed from realizations of $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ in the $N$-fold tensor product of the $n $th Weyl algebra. In this paper, we further the study of differential reduction algebras by presenting the symplectic differential reduction algebra $D\big(\mathfrak{sp}(4)\big)$, by generators and relations, and showing its connections to Bavula's generalized Weyl algebras (GWAs). In doing so, we determine a new class of GWAs we call $\textit{skew-affine}$ GWAs, of which $D\big(\mathfrak{gl}(2)\big)$ and $D\big(\mathfrak{sp}(4)\big)$ are examples. We conjecture that the differential reduction algebra of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2n)$ is a twisted generalized Weyl algebra (TGWA) and that the relations for $D\big(\mathfrak{sp}(2n)\big)$ yield solutions to the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation (DYBE).</description>

      <title>Regular categories, oligomorphic monoids, and tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knop constructed a tensor category associated to a finitely-powered regular category equipped with a degree function. In recent work with Harman, we constructed a tensor category associated to an oligomorphic group equipped with a measure. In this paper, we explain how Knop's approach fits into our theory. The first, and most important, step describes finitely-powered regular categories in terms of oligomorphic monoids; this may be of independent interest. We go on to examine some aspects of this construction when the regular category one starts with is the category of $G$-sets for an oligomorphic group $G$, which yields some interesting examples.</description>

      <title>A descent basis for the Garsia-Procesi module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assign to each Young diagram $\lambda$ a subset $\mathcal{B}_{\lambda'}$ of the collection of Garsia-Stanton descent monomials, and prove that it determines a basis of the Garsia-Procesi module $R_\lambda$, whose graded character is the Hall-Littlewood polynomial $\tilde{H}_{\lambda}[X;t]$. This basis is a major index analogue of the basis $\mathcal{B}_\lambda \subset R_\lambda$ defined by certain recursions in due to Garsia and Procesi, in the same way that the descent basis is related to the Artin basis of the coinvariant algebra $R_n$, which in fact corresponds to the case when $\lambda=1^n$. By anti-symmetrizing a subset of this basis with respect to the corresponding Young subgroup under the Springer action, we obtain a basis in the parabolic case, as well as a corresponding formula for the expansion of $\tilde{H}_{\lambda}[X;t]$. Despite a similar appearance, it does not appear obvious how to connect these formulas appear to the specialization of the modified Macdonald formula of Haglund, Haiman and Loehr at $q=0$.</description>

      <title>On interpolation categories for the hyperoctahedral group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two different types of Deligne categories have been defined to interpolate the finite dimensional complex representations of the hyperoctahedral group. The first one, initially defined by Knop and then further studied by Likeng and Savage, uses a categorical analogue of the permutation representation as a tensor generator. The second one, due to Flake and Maassen, is tensor generated by a categorical analogue of the reflection representation. We construct a symmetric monoidal functor between the two and show that it is an equivalence of symmetric monoidal categories.</description>

      <title>Arthur packets for pure real forms of symplectic and special orthogonal groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arthur packets have been defined for pure real forms of symplectic and special orthogonal groups following two different approaches. The first approach, due to Arthur, Moeglin and Renard uses harmonic analysis. The second approach, due to Adams, Barbasch and Vogan uses microlocal geometry. We prove that the two approaches produce essentially equivalent Arthur packets. This extends previous work of the authors and J. Adams for the quasisplit real forms.</description>

      <title>Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology for affine superspaces A^(m,n)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of Lie superalgebra of vector fields on affine super-spaces $\mathbb{A}^{m,n}$ with trivial coefficients. In this paper we extend the methodology developed in the previous paper (arXiv:2210.16585) to perform the calculation for arbitrary dimensions $(m, n)$ with $m \geq n$. This combined with previously known results for other dimensions $(m, n)$ fully settles the local problem of Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology with trivial coefficients for super-manifolds. As part of the proof we also compute the cohomology of Lie superalgebras $\mathfrak{gl}(m,n)$ with coefficients given by Schur functors of the standard representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that many tame modules of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ algebra can be explicitly constructed in a purely combinatorial way using the theory of $q$-characters. The examples include families of evaluation modules obtained from analytic continuation and automorphism twists of Verma modules of the quantum affine $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ algebra. The combinatorial bases in the modules are labeled by colored plane partitions with various properties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.06029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a more down-to-earth introduction to the connection between Gelfand-Tsetlin modules over $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ and diagrammatic KLRW algebras, and develop some of its consequences. In addition to a new proof of this description of the category Gelfand-Tsetlin modules appearing in earlier work, we show three new results of independent interest: (1) we show that every simple Gelfand-Tsetlin module is a canonical module in the sense of Early, Mazorchuk and Vishnyakova, and characterize when two maximal ideals have isomorphic canonical modules, (2) we show that the dimensions of Gelfand-Tsetlin weight spaces in simple modules can be computed using an appropriate modification of Leclerc's algorithm for computing dual canonical bases, and (3) we construct a basis of the Verma modules of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ which consists of generalized eigenvectors for the Gelfand-Tsetlin subalgebra.
  Furthermore, we present computations of multiplicities and Gelfand-Kirillov dimensions for all integral Gelfand-Tsetlin modules in ranks 3 and 4; unfortunately, for ranks $&gt;4$, our computers are not adequate to perform these computations.</description>

Abstract: Building on a geometric counterpart of Steinberg's tensor product formula for simple representations of a connected reductive algebraic group $G$ over a field of positive characteristic, and following an idea of Arkhipov--Bezrukavnikov--Braverman--Gaitsgory--Mirkovi\'c, we define and initiate the study of some categories of perverse sheaves on the affine Grassmannian of the Langlands dual group to $G$ that should provide geometric models for blocks of representations of the Frobenius kernel $G_1$ of $G$. In particular, we show that these categories admit enough projective and injective objects, which are closely related to some tilting perverse sheaves, and that they are highest weight categories in an appropriate generalized sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an element, which we call the Kirillov projector, that connects the topics of the title: on the one hand, it is defined using the Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}_N$, on the other hand, it gives a canonical projection onto the space of Whittaker vectors for any Whittaker module over the mirabolic subalgebra. Using the Kirillov projector, we deduce some categorical properties of Whittaker modules, for instance, we prove a mirabolic analog of Skryabin's theorem. We also show that it quantizes a rational version of the Cremmer-Gervais $r$-matrix. As application, we construct a universal vertex-IRF transformation from the standard dynamical $R$-matrix to this constant one in categorical terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be an arbitrary finite quiver. We use nonabelian stable envelopes to relate representations of the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ to representations of the BPS Lie algebra associated to the tripled quiver $\tilde Q$ with its canonical potential. We use this comparison to provide an isomorphism between the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra and the BPS Lie algebra. Via this isomorphism we prove Okounkov's conjecture, equating the graded dimensions of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ with the coefficients of Kac polynomials. Via general results regarding cohomological Hall algebras in dimensions two and three we furthermore give a complete description of $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ as a generalised Kac-Moody Lie algebra with Cartan datum given by intersection cohomology of singular Nakajima quiver varieties, and prove a conjecture of Maulik and Okounkov, stating that their Lie algebra is obtained from a Lie algebra defined over the rationals, by extension of scalars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of Haiman's conjecture on the diagonal coinvariant rings of real reflection groups to the context of irreducible quaternionic reflection groups (also known as symplectic reflection groups). For a reflection group $W$ acting on a quaternionic vector space $V$, by regarding $V$ as a complex vector space we consider the scheme-theoretic fiber over zero of the quotient map $\pi:V \to V/W$. For $W$ an irreducible reflection group of (quaternionic) rank at least $6$, we show that the ring of functions on this fiber admits a $(g+1)^n$-dimensional quotient arising from an irreducible representation of a symplectic reflection algebra, where $g=2N/n$ with $N$ the number of reflections in $W$ and $n=\mathrm{dim}_\mathbf{H}(V)$, and we conjecture that this holds in general. We observe that in fact the degree of the zero fiber is precisely $g+1$ for the rank one groups (corresponding to the Kleinian singularities).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximable triangulated categories, as introduced and developed by Neeman, provide a solid framework for studying localization sequences within triangulated categories. In our paper, we demonstrate that a recollement of approximable triangulated categories, given certain mild conditions, induces short exact sequences of both triangulated subcategories and Verdier quotient categories. Specifically, in the case of a recollement of locally Hom-finite noetherian approximable triangulated categories, we find that this induces a short exact sequence of the bounded closures of compact objects within these categories. Furthermore, if the recollement extends one step downwards, it yields a short exact sequence of the singularity categories of these triangulated categories, offering a generalization of the localization sequence established by Jin-Yang-Zhou for the singularity categories of finite-dimensional algebras. We also present applications of these results within the derived categories of finite-dimensional algebras, DG algebras, and schemes.</description>

Abstract: We study the permutation group $\mathcal{BK}_P$ generated by Bender-Knuth moves on linear extensions of a poset $P$, an analog of the Berenstein-Kirillov group on column-strict tableaux. We explore the group relations, with an emphasis on identifying posets $P$ for which the cactus relations hold in $\mathcal{BK}_P$. We also examine $\mathcal{BK}_P$ as a subgroup of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_{\mathcal{L}(P)}$ on the set of linear extensions of $P$ with the focus on analyzing posets $P$ for which $\mathcal{BK}_P = \mathfrak{S}_{\mathcal{L}(P)}$.</description>

      <title>On m-tuples of nilpotent 2x2 matrices over an arbitrary field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebra of ${\rm GL}_n$-invariants of $m$-tuples of $n\times n$ matrices with respect to the action by simultaneous conjugation is a classical topic in case of infinite base field. On the other hand, in case of a finite field generators of polynomial invariants even in case of a pair of $2\times 2$ matrices are not known. Working over an arbitrary field we classified all ${\rm GL}_2$-orbits on $m$-tuples of $2\times 2$ nilpotent matrices for all $m&gt;0$. As a consequence, we obtained a minimal separating set for the algebra of ${\rm GL}_2$-invariant polynomial functions of $m$-tuples of $2\times 2$ nilpotent matrices. We also described the least possible number of elements of a separating set for an algebra of invariant polynomial functions over a finite field.</description>

      <title>Graded pseudo-traces for strongly interlocked modules for a vertex operator algebra and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of strongly interlocked for indecomposable generalized modules for a vertex operator algebra, and show that the notion of graded pseudo-trace is well defined for modules which satisfy this property. We prove that the graded pseudo-trace is a symmetric linear operator that satisfies the logarithmic derivative property. As an application, we prove that all the indecomposable reducible generalized modules for the rank one Heisenberg (one free boson) vertex operator algebras are strongly interlocked, independent of the choice of conformal vector and thus have well-defined graded pseudo-traces. We also completely characterize which indecomposable reducible generalized modules for the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebras induced from the level zero Zhu algebra are strongly interlocked. In particular, we prove that the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebra with central charge c has modules induced from the level zero Zhu algebra with conformal weight h that are strongly interlocked if and only if either (c,h) is outside the extended Kac table, or the central charge is either c = 1 or 25, the conformal weight satisfies a certain property, and the level zero Zhu algebra module being induced is determined by a Jordan block of size less than a certain specified parameter. We give several examples of graded pseudo-traces for Heisenberg and Virasoro strongly interlocked modules.</description>

      <title>Topology and entanglement of molecular phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a quantum phase space for molecular rotational and nuclear-spin states. Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, our framework yields admissible position and momentum states, inter-convertible via a generalized Fourier transform. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We identify two features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, many molecular species are intrinsically rotation-spin entangled in a way that cannot be broken without transitioning to another species or breaking symmetry. Second, each molecular position state houses an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed.</description>

      <title>The Schur polynomials in all primitive $n$th roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Schur polynomials in all primitive $n$th roots of unity are $1$, $0$, or $-1$, if $n$ has at most two distinct odd prime factors. This result can be regarded as a generalization of properties of the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomial and its multiplicative inverse. The key to the proof is the notion of a unimodular system of vectors. Namely, this result is reduced in turn to four propositions on the unimodularity of vector systems, and the last proposition is proved by using graph theory.</description>

      <title>Virasoro constraints and representations for quiver moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Virasoro constraints for moduli spaces of representations of quiver with relations by Joyce's vertex algebras. Using the framed Virasoro constraints, we construct a representation of half of the Virasoro algebra on the cohomology of moduli stacks of quiver representations under smoothness assumption. By exploiting the non-commutative nature of the Virasoro operators, we apply our theory for quivers to del Pezzo surfaces using exceptional collections. In particular, the Virasoro constraints and representations are proven for moduli of sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$, $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$ and $\text{Bl}_{\mathsf{pt}}(\mathbb{P}^2)$. Lastly, we unravel the Virasoro constraints for Grassmannians in terms of symmetric polynomials and Hecke operators.</description>
