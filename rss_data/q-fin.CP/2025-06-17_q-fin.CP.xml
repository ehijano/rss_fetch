      <title>Small Volatility Approximation and Multi-Factor HJM Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we demonstrate how we can use Small Volatility Approximation in calibration of Multi-Factor HJM model with deterministic correlations, factor volatilities and mean reversals. It is noticed that quality of this calibration is very good and it does not depend on number of factors.</description>

      <title>Implied Probabilities and Volatility in Credit Risk: A Merton-Based Approach with Binomial Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore credit risk pricing by modeling equity as a call option and debt as the difference between the firm's asset value and a put option, following the structural framework of the Merton model. Our approach proceeds in two stages: first, we calibrate the asset volatility using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) formula; second, we recover implied mean return and probability surfaces under the physical measure. To achieve this, we construct a recombining binomial tree under the real-world (natural) measure, assuming a fixed initial asset value. The volatility input is taken from a specific region of the implied volatility surface - based on moneyness and maturity - which then informs the calibration of drift and probability. A novel mapping is established between risk-neutral and physical parameters, enabling construction of implied surfaces that reflect the market's credit expectations and offer practical tools for stress testing and credit risk analysis.</description>

      <title>Operator Deep Smoothing for Implied Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise a novel method for nowcasting implied volatility based on neural operators. Better known as implied volatility smoothing in the financial industry, nowcasting of implied volatility means constructing a smooth surface that is consistent with the prices presently observed on a given option market. Option price data arises highly dynamically in ever-changing spatial configurations, which poses a major limitation to foundational machine learning approaches using classical neural networks. While large models in language and image processing deliver breakthrough results on vast corpora of raw data, in financial engineering the generalization from big historical datasets has been hindered by the need for considerable data pre-processing. In particular, implied volatility smoothing has remained an instance-by-instance, hands-on process both for neural network-based and traditional parametric strategies. Our general operator deep smoothing approach, instead, directly maps observed data to smoothed surfaces. We adapt the graph neural operator architecture to do so with high accuracy on ten years of raw intraday S&amp;P 500 options data, using a single model instance. The trained operator adheres to critical no-arbitrage constraints and is robust with respect to subsampling of inputs (occurring in practice in the context of outlier removal). We provide extensive historical benchmarks and showcase the generalization capability of our approach in a comparison with classical neural networks and SVI, an industry standard parametrization for implied volatility. The operator deep smoothing approach thus opens up the use of neural networks on large historical datasets in financial engineering.</description>

      <title>LOB-Bench: Benchmarking Generative AI for Finance -- an Application to Limit Order Book Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While financial data presents one of the most challenging and interesting sequence modelling tasks due to high noise, heavy tails, and strategic interactions, progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of consensus on quantitative evaluation paradigms. To address this, we present LOB-Bench, a benchmark, implemented in python, designed to evaluate the quality and realism of generative message-by-order data for limit order books (LOB) in the LOBSTER format. Our framework measures distributional differences in conditional and unconditional statistics between generated and real LOB data, supporting flexible multivariate statistical evaluation. The benchmark also includes features commonly used LOB statistics such as spread, order book volumes, order imbalance, and message inter-arrival times, along with scores from a trained discriminator network. Lastly, LOB-Bench contains "market impact metrics", i.e. the cross-correlations and price response functions for specific events in the data. We benchmark generative autoregressive state-space models, a (C)GAN, as well as a parametric LOB model and find that the autoregressive GenAI approach beats traditional model classes.</description>

      <title>Multi-period Mean-Buffered Probability of Exceedance in Defined Contribution Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate multi-period mean-risk portfolio optimization for long-horizon Defined Contribution plans, focusing on buffered Probability of Exceedance (bPoE), a more intuitive, dollar-based alternative to Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We formulate both pre-commitment and time-consistent Mean-bPoE and Mean-CVaR portfolio optimization problems under realistic investment constraints (e.g., no leverage, no short selling) and jump-diffusion dynamics. These formulations are naturally framed as bilevel optimization problems, with an outer search over the shortfall threshold and an inner optimization over rebalancing decisions. We establish an equivalence between the pre-commitment formulations through a one-to-one correspondence of their scalarization optimal sets, while showing that no such equivalence holds in the time-consistent setting. We develop provably convergent numerical schemes for the value functions associated with both pre-commitment and time-consistent formulations of these mean-risk control problems.
  Using nearly a century of market data, we find that time-consistent Mean-bPoE strategies closely resemble their pre-commitment counterparts. In particular, they maintain alignment with investors' preferences for a minimum acceptable terminal wealth level-unlike time-consistent Mean-CVaR, which often leads to counterintuitive control behavior. We further show that bPoE, as a strictly tail-oriented measure, prioritizes guarding against catastrophic shortfalls while allowing meaningful upside exposure, making it especially appealing for long-horizon wealth security. These findings highlight bPoE's practical advantages for Defined Contribution investment planning.</description>
