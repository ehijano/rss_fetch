      <title>Note on the noise reduction in spectroscopic detection with compressed sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopy sampling along delay time is typically performed with uniform delay spacing, which has to be low enough to satisfy the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The sampling theorem puts the lower bound for the sampling rate to ensure accurate resolution of the spectral features. However, this bound can be relaxed by leveraging prior knowledge of the signals, such as sparsity. Compressed sensing, a under-sampling technique successfully applied to spatial measurements (e.g., single-pixel imaging), has yet to be fully explored for the spectral measurements especially for the temporal sampling. In this work, we investigate the capability of compressed sensing for improving the temporal spectroscopic measurements to mitigate both measurement noise and intrinsic noise. By applying compressed sensing to single-shot pump-probe data, we demonstrate its effectiveness in noise reduction. Additionally, we propose a feasible experimental scheme using a digital mirror device to implement compressed sensing for temporal sampling. This approach provides a promising method for spectroscopy to reduce the signal noise and the number of sample measurements.</description>

      <title>Partial ionization cross sections of isobutanol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron and positron impact partial ionization cross sections (PICS) for isobutanol were calculated using variants of the binary encounter Bethe model (BEB). The modified BEB (mBEB) model and the mass spectrum dependent (MSD) method are used to calculate the PICS of cationic fragments of isobutanol. Also for calculating the positron impact ionization and dissociative ionization cross sections, we have used the BEB-0 model and the BEB-W model which are scaled Wannier threshold laws along with the BEB-A and BEB-B models which obey Jansen's threshold law. The study also compares the PICS calculated from other isomers of butanol presented in the literature. We also presented the synthetic electron impact mass spectrum of isobutanol which is compared with the experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Stable and Accurate Orbital-Free DFT Powered by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hohenberg and Kohn have proven that the electronic energy and the one-particle electron density can, in principle, be obtained by minimizing an energy functional with respect to the density. Given that decades of theoretical work have so far failed to produce this elusive exact energy functional promising great computational savings, it is reasonable to try and learn it empirically. Using rotationally equivariant atomistic machine learning, we obtain for the first time a density functional that, when applied to the organic molecules in QM9, yields energies with chemical accuracy while also converging to meaningful electron densities. Augmenting the training data with densities obtained from perturbed potentials proved key to these advances. Altogether, we are now closer than ever to fulfilling Hohenberg and Kohn's promise, paving the way for more efficient calculations in large molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Embedding Theory-Based Multi-Configurational Quantum Chemistry Approach to Lanthanide Single-Ion Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient theoretical descriptions of lanthanide systems based on ab initio electronic structure theory remain highly challenging due to the complex interplay of strong electronic correlation and significant relativistic effects in 4f electrons. The composite multi-configurational quantum chemistry method, which combines the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) approach with subsequent state interaction (SI) treatment of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), abbreviated as CASSI-SO, has emerged as the preferred method for ab initio studies of lanthanide systems. However, its widespread application is hindered by its substantial computational cost. Building on the success of integrating density-matrix embedding theory (DMET) with CASSI-SO in our previous theoretical study of 3d single-ion magnets (SIMs) (Ai, Sun, and Jiang, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2022, 13, 10627), we now extend the DMET+CASSI-SO approach to lanthanide SIM systems. We provide a detailed formulation of the regularized direct inversion of iterative subspace (R-DIIS) algorithm, which ensures obtaining physically correct restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) wavefunctions, a critical factor for the effectiveness of DMET. Additionally, we introduce the subspace R-DIIS (sR-DIIS) algorithm, which proves to be more efficient and robust for lanthanide systems. Using several representative lanthanide single-ion magnets (4f-SIMs) as test cases, we demonstrate the performance of these new algorithms and highlight the exceptional accuracy of the DMET+CASSI-SO approach. We anticipate that this enhanced DMET+CASSI-SO methodology will significantly advance large-scale theoretical investigations of complex lanthanide systems.</description>

      <title>Formally exact fluorescence spectroscopy simulations for mesoscale molecular aggregates with $N^0$ scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a size-invariant (i.e., $N^0$) scaling algorithm for simulating fluorescence spectroscopy in large molecular aggregates. We combine the dyadic adaptive hierarchy of pure states (DadHOPS) equation-of-motion with an operator decomposition scheme and an efficient Monte Carlo sampling algorithm to enable a formally exact, local description of the fluorescence spectrum in large molecular aggregates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ensemble average inverse participation ratio (IPR) of DadHOPS wave functions reproduces the delocalization extent extracted from fluorescence spectroscopy of J-aggregates with strong vibronic transitions. This work provides a computationally efficient framework for fluorescence simulations, offering a new tool for understanding the optical properties of mesoscale molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Comparing Perturbative and Commutator-Rank-Based Truncation Schemes in Unitary Coupled-Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary coupled cluster (UCC) theory offers a promising Hermitian alternative to conventional coupled cluster (CC) theory, but its practical implementation is hindered by the non-truncating nature of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian ($\bar{H}$). To address this challenge, various truncation strategies have been developed to approximate $\bar{H}$ in a compact and reliable manner. In this work, we compare the numerical performance of approximate UCC with single and double excitations (UCCSD) methods that employ many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) and commutator rank based truncation schemes. Our results indicate low-order MBPT-based schemes, such as UCC(2) and UCC(3), yield reasonable results near equilibrium, but they become unreliable at stretched geometries. Higher-order MBPT-based schemes do not necessarily improve performance, as the UCCSD(4) and UCCSD(5) amplitude equations sometimes lack solutions. In contrast, commutator-rank-based truncations exhibit greater numerical stability, with the Bernoulli representation of the BCH expansion enabling more rapid and smooth convergence to the UCCSD limit compared to the standard BCH formulation.</description>

      <title>First Principles Reactive Flux Theory for Surface Reactions: Multiple Channels and Recrossing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogenous reactions typically consist of multiple elementary steps and their rate coefficients are of fundamental importance in elucidating the mechanisms and micro-kinetics of these processes. Transition-state theory (TST) for calculating surface reaction rate coefficients often relies solely on the harmonic approximation of adsorbent vibrations and neglects recrossing dynamics. Here, we combine, for the first time, an efficient metadynamics enhanced sampling method with a more general reactive flux approach to calculate rate coefficients of surface reactions of any order and/or with multiple reaction coordinates, overcoming these limitations of TST. We apply this approach to a textbook surface reaction, CO oxidation on Pt(111), for which rate constants have been precisely measured, using a full-dimensional neural network potential energy surface constructed from first-principles data. An accurate multi-dimensional free-energy surface is obtained by incorporating three collective variables, yielding rate coefficients for both CO oxidation and the competing CO desorption that are in good agreement with experimental data. Interestingly, our results reveal significant dynamic recrossing in both channels, which however arises from distinct physical mechanisms. This approach represents an accurate and general framework for calculating rate coefficients of elementary surface processes from first-principles, which is vital for developing predictive kinetic models for heterogenous catalysis.</description>

      <title>The Polarization Projected Density Matrix: A Practical Way to Recover Molecular Frame Information from Isotropic Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to model ultrafast time-dependent nonlinear optical polarization sensitive signals emitted from randomly-oriented molecules. By projecting the laboratory-frame analyzer polarization axis into the molecular frame and linking that axis with the density matrix through a tensor product, we demonstrate an approach to find a specific molecular orientation that yields a good approximation to simulated four-wave mixing signals produced by the same model but with averaging over molecular orientation.</description>

      <title>Derivation of Hierarchically Correlated Orbital Functional Theory: The Role of Hypercomplex Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a detailed mathematical derivation of the hierarchically correlated orbital functional theory (HCOFT), a framework based on hypercomplex orbitals. Recent study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 206402] has demonstrated that hypercomplex orbitals in a determinant are equivalent to a set of real-valued orbitals that allow fractional occupations, making them desirable fundamental descriptors for many-electron systems. The algebraic properties of Clifford algebra are rigorously applied to derive key quantities within HCOFT, addressing the complexities introduced by the hypercomplex representation. It is shown that, despite this added complexity, the resulting density and kinetic energy remain physically meaningful and satisfy essential properties, including the Pauli exclusion principle. To establish the uniqueness of HCOFT, alternative definitions of hypercomplex orbitals within Clifford algebra are explored. These alternatives can lead to the loss of physical meaning in fundamental quantities for many-electron systems. Overall, this work demonstrates that HCOFT not only preserves the desired physical properties but also provides a single-determinant framework capable of describing multi-reference systems.</description>

      <title>Driven similarity renormalization group with a large active space: Applications to oligoacenes, zeaxanthin, and chromium dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new implementation of the driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG) based on a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) reference. The explicit build of high-order reduced density matrices is avoided by forming matrix-product-state compressed intermediates. This algorithm facilitates the application of DSRG second- and third-order perturbation theories to dodecacene with an active space of 50 electrons in 50 orbitals. This active space appears the largest employed to date within the framework of internally contracted multireference formalism. The DMRG-DSRG approach is applied to several challenging systems, including the singlet-triplet gaps ($\Delta_{\rm ST}$) of oligoacenes ranging from naphthalene to dodecacene, the vertical excitation energies of zeaxanthin, and the ground-state potential energy curve (PEC) of Cr$_2$ molecule. Our best estimate for the vertical $\Delta_{\rm ST}$ of dodecacene is 0.22 eV, showing an excellent agreement with that of the linearized adiabatic connection method (0.24 eV). For zeaxanthin, all DSRG schemes suggest the order of $\rm 2\, ^1 A_g^- &lt; 1\, ^1 B_u^+ &lt; 1\, ^1 B_u^-$ for excited states. Both the equilibrium and the shoulder regions of the Cr$_2$ PEC are reasonably reproduced by the linearized DSRG with one- and two-body operators.</description>

      <title>Endofullerenes and Dispersion-Corrected Density Functional Approximations: A Cautionary Tale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study by Panchagnula et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 161, 054308 (2024)] illustrated the non-concordance of a variety of electronic structure methods at describing the symmetric double-well potential expected along the anisotropic direction of the endofullerene Ne@C$_{70}$. In this article we delve deeper into the difficulties of accurately capturing the dispersion interaction within this system, scrutinising a variety of state-of-the-art density-functional approximations (DFAs) and dispersion corrections (DCs). We identify rigorous criteria for the double-well potential and compare the shapes, barrier heights, and minima positions obtained with the DFAs and DCs to the correlated wavefunction data in the previous study, alongside new coupled-cluster calculations. We show that many of the DFAs are extremely sensitive to the numerical integration grid used, and note that the choice of DC is not independent of the DFA. Functionals with many empirical parameters tuned for main-group thermochemistry do not necessarily result in a reasonable PES, while improved performance can be obtained using nearly dispersionless DFAs with very few empirical parameters and allowing the DC to compensate. We pose the Ne@C$_{70}$ system as a challenge to functional developers and as a diagnostic system for testing dispersion corrections, and reiterate the need for more experimental data for comparison.</description>

Abstract: An ordered moment approach to exact open quantum dynamics is presented, which bypasses the Feynmann-Vernon influence functional formalism. The hierarchical equations of motion are constructed using Wick's contraction, which follows specific orderings of the bath's creation and annihilation operators. Our approach moves beyond the traditional influence functional formalism, offering a more intuitive and direct framework, and extends the applicability of theory to nonlinear system--bath coupling scenarios.</description>

      <title>Compactfying Electronic Wavefunctions I: Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial Ordering by Self-Assembly of Isotropic Octahedral Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that isotropic octahedral (sixfold branched) junctions with three diagonal endpoint pairs of different colors almost inevitably form a macroscopic assembly of uniaxial order, exhibiting the perfect order of a single color. Monte Carlo simulations of the antiferromagnetic three-state Potts model on the tripartite reo net, consisting of corner-sharing regular octahedrons, confirm this counterintuitive prediction, while showcasing switching self-assembly upon an ordering phase transition. The possible inequivalence of three directions, i.e., more symmetry breaking than uniaxiality, is found and discussed for the ordered phase of this model at finite temperatures. Some additional analyses of the model are provided, including the possibility of a metastable isotropic order, which aligns better with intuition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We briefly review the problem of Brownian motion and describe some intriguing facets. The problem is first treated in its original form as enunciated by Einstein, Langevin, and others. Then, utilizing the problem of Brownian motion as a paradigm and upon using the Langevin equation(s), we present a brief exposition of the modern areas of stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems in a manner accessible to a non-expert. This is followed by an analysis of non-Markovian Brownian dynamics via generalized Langevin equation(s) in which we particularly shed light onto its derivation, the emergence of the fluctuation-dissipation relation, and the recently-discovered effective-mass framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory has become the world's favorite electronic structure method, and is routinely applied to both materials and molecules. Here, we review recent attempts to use modern machine-learning to improve density functional approximations. Many different researchers have tried many different approaches, but some common themes and lessons have emerged. We discuss these trends and where they might bring us in the future.</description>

      <title>A COMSOL framework for predicting hydrogen embrittlement -- Part I: coupled hydrogen transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen threatens the structural integrity of metals and thus predicting hydrogen-material interactions is key to unlocking the role of hydrogen in the energy transition. Quantifying the interplay between material deformation and hydrogen diffusion ahead of cracks and other stress concentrators is key to the prediction and prevention of hydrogen-assisted failures. In this work, a generalised theoretical and computational framework is presented that for the first time encompasses: (i) stress-assisted diffusion, (ii) hydrogen trapping due to multiple trap types, rigorously accounting for the rate of creation of dislocation trap sites, (iii) hydrogen transport through dislocations, (iv) equilibrium (Oriani) and non-equilibrium (McNabb-Foster) trapping kinetics, (v) hydrogen-induced softening, and (vi) hydrogen uptake, considering the role of hydrostatic stresses and local electrochemistry. Particular emphasis is placed on the numerical implementation in COMSOL Multiphysics, releasing the relevant models and discussing stability, discretisation and solver details. Each of the elements of the framework is independently benchmarked against results from the literature and implications for the prediction of hydrogen-assisted fractures are discussed. The second part of this work (Part II) shows how these crack tip predictions can be combined with crack growth simulations.</description>

      <title>A COMSOL framework for predicting hydrogen embrittlement -- Part II: phase field fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction of hydrogen embrittlement requires a robust modelling approach and this will foster the safe adoption of hydrogen as a clean energy vector. A generalised computational model for hydrogen embrittlement is here presented, based on a phase field description of fracture. In combination with Part I of this work, which describes the process of hydrogen uptake and transport, this allows simulating a wide range of hydrogen transport and embrittlement phenomena. The material toughness is defined as a function of the hydrogen content and both elastic and elastic-plastic material behaviour are incorporated, enabling to capture both ductile and brittle fractures, and the transition from one to the other. The accumulation of hydrogen near a crack tip and subsequent embrittlement is numerically evaluated in a single-edge cracked plate, a boundary layer model and a 3D vessel case study, demonstrating the potential of the framework. Emphasis is placed on the numerical implementation, which is carried out in the finite element package COMSOL Multiphysics, and the models are made freely available.</description>

      <title>Short-Time Infrequent Metadynamics for Improved Kinetics Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrequent Metadynamics is a popular method to obtain the rates of long timescale processes from accelerated simulations. The inference procedure is based on rescaling the first-passage times of Metadynamics trajectories using a bias-dependent acceleration factor. While useful in many cases, it is limited to Poisson kinetics, and a reliable estimation of the unbiased rate requires slow bias deposition and prior knowledge of efficient collective variables. Here, we propose an improved inference scheme, which is based on two key observations: 1) The time-independent rate of Poisson processes can be estimated using short trajectories only. 2) Short trajectories experience minimal bias, and their rescaled first-passage times follow the unbiased distribution even for relatively high deposition rates and suboptimal collective variables. Therefore, by limiting the inference procedure to short timescales, we obtain an improved tradeoff between speedup and accuracy at no additional computational cost, especially when employing suboptimal collective variables. We demonstrate the improved inference scheme for a model system and two molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Renormalized Internally-Contracted Multireference Coupled Cluster with Perturbative Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we combine the many-body formulation of the internally contracted multireference coupled cluster (ic-MRCC) method with Evangelista's multireference formulation of the driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG). The DSRG method can be viewed as a unitary multireference coupled cluster theory, which renormalizes the amplitudes based on a flow equation approach to eliminate numerical instabilities. We extend this approach by demonstrating that the unitary flow equation approach can be adapted for nonunitary transformations, rationalizing the renormalization of ic-MRCC amplitudes. We denote the new approach, the renormalized ic-MRCC (ric-MRCC) method. To achieve high accuracy with a reasonable computational cost, we introduce a new approximation to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. We fully consider the linear commutator while approximating the quadratic commutator, for which we neglect specific contractions involving amplitudes with active indices. Moreover, we introduce approximate perturbative triples to obtain the ric-MRCCSD[T] method. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approaches in comparison to advanced multireference methods for the potential energy curves of H8, F2, H2O, N2, and Cr2. Additionally, we show that ric-MRCCSD and ric-MRCSSD[T] match the accuracy of CCSD(T) for evaluating spectroscopic constants and of full configuration interaction energies for a set of small molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated and high-throughput quantum chemical investigations into chemical processes have become feasible in great detail and broad scope. This results in an increase in complexity of the tasks and in the amount of generated data. An efficient and intuitive way for an operator to interact with these data and to steer virtual experiments is required. Here, we introduce Heron, a graphical user interface that allows for advanced human-machine interactions with quantum chemical exploration campaigns into molecular structure and reactivity. Heron offers access to interactive and automated explorations of chemical reactions with standard electronic structure modules, haptic force feedback, microkinetic modeling, and refinement of data by automated correlated calculations including black-box complete active space calculations. It is tailored to the exploration and analysis of vast chemical reaction networks. We show how interoperable modules enable advanced workflows and pave the way for routine low-entrance-barrier access to advanced modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>Phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method for cavity-QED matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method to cavity quantum-electrodynamical (QED) matter systems. The method can be formulated in both the Coulomb and the dipole gauge. We verify its accuracy by benchmarking calculations on a set of small molecules against full configuration interaction and state-of-the-art QED coupled cluster (QED-CCSD) calculations. Our results show that (i) gauge invariance can be achieved within correlation-consistent Gaussian basis sets, (ii) the accuracy of QED-CCSD can be enhanced significantly by adding the standard perturbative triples correction without light-matter coupling, and (iii) there is a straightforward way to evaluate the differential expression for the photon occupation number that works in any gauge. The high accuracy and favorable computational scaling of our AFQMC approach will enable a broad range of applications. Besides polaritonic chemistry, the method opens a way to simulate extended QED matter systems.</description>

      <title>HybridLinker: Topology-Guided Posterior Sampling for Enhanced Diversity and Validity in 3D Molecular Linker Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linker generation is critical in drug discovery applications such as lead optimization and PROTAC design, where molecular fragments are assembled into diverse drug candidates. Existing methods fall into PC-Free and PC-Aware categories based on their use of 3D point clouds (PC). PC-Free models prioritize diversity but suffer from lower validity due to overlooking PC constraints, while PC-Aware models ensure higher validity but restrict diversity by enforcing strict PC constraints. To overcome these trade-offs without additional training, we propose HybridLinker, a framework that enhances PC-Aware inference by providing diverse bonding topologies from a pretrained PC-Free model as guidance. At its core, we propose LinkerDPS, the first diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) method operating across PC-Free and PC-Aware spaces, bridging molecular topology with 3D point clouds via an energy-inspired function. By transferring the diverse sampling distribution of PC-Free models into the PC-Aware distribution, HybridLinker significantly and consistently surpasses baselines, improving both validity and diversity in foundational molecular design and applied property optimization tasks, establishing a new DPS framework in the molecular and graph domains beyond imaging.</description>

      <title>Procedural Synthesis of Synthesizable Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing synthetically accessible molecules and recommending analogs to unsynthesizable molecules are important problems for accelerating molecular discovery. We reconceptualize both problems using ideas from program synthesis. Drawing inspiration from syntax-guided synthesis approaches, we decouple the syntactic skeleton from the semantics of a synthetic tree to create a bilevel framework for reasoning about the combinatorial space of synthesis pathways. Given a molecule we aim to generate analogs for, we iteratively refine its skeletal characteristics via Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations over the space of syntactic skeletons. Given a black-box oracle to optimize, we formulate a joint design space over syntactic templates and molecular descriptors and introduce evolutionary algorithms that optimize both syntactic and semantic dimensions synergistically. Our key insight is that once the syntactic skeleton is set, we can amortize over the search complexity of deriving the program's semantics by training policies to fully utilize the fixed horizon Markov Decision Process imposed by the syntactic template. We demonstrate performance advantages of our bilevel framework for synthesizable analog generation and synthesizable molecule design. Notably, our approach offers the user explicit control over the resources required to perform synthesis and biases the design space towards simpler solutions, making it particularly promising for autonomous synthesis platforms.

      <title>Stiefel Flow Matching for Moment-Constrained Structure Elucidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation is a fundamental step in understanding chemical phenomena, with applications in identifying molecules in natural products, lab syntheses, forensic samples, and the interstellar medium. We consider the task of predicting a molecule's all-atom 3D structure given only its molecular formula and moments of inertia, motivated by the ability of rotational spectroscopy to measure these moments. While existing generative models can conditionally sample 3D structures with approximately correct moments, this soft conditioning fails to leverage the many digits of precision afforded by experimental rotational spectroscopy. To address this, we first show that the space of $n$-atom point clouds with a fixed set of moments of inertia is embedded in the Stiefel manifold $\mathrm{St}(n, 4)$. We then propose Stiefel Flow Matching as a generative model for elucidating 3D structure under exact moment constraints. Additionally, we learn simpler and shorter flows by finding approximate solutions for equivariant optimal transport on the Stiefel manifold. Empirically, enforcing exact moment constraints allows Stiefel Flow Matching to achieve higher success rates and faster sampling than Euclidean diffusion models, even on high-dimensional manifolds corresponding to large molecules in the GEOM dataset.</description>
