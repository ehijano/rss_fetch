      <title>Existence of Discrete Traveling Waves in Fully Coupled Network of Mackey-Glass Relay Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully coupled network of Mackey-Glass generators is considered. Each generator is described by a limit equation for the Mackey-Glass equation. The right parts are represented by a relay function obtained when the exponent in the denominator of the nonlinearity tends to infinity. Discrete traveling waves are sought in the system. These modes are such that all components are represented by the same periodic function with successive (multiple of the same value) shifts. Moreover, this periodic function has the smallest number of switchings, that is, points at which the right-hand sides change the analytical form. It is shown that discrete traveling waves coexist in the system. Moreover, their number is equal to the factorial of the number of generators.</description>

      <title>Ising Hamiltonian for Coupled Fibre-Based Optical Parametric Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, I derive an Ising Hamiltonian for $N$ coupled fibre-based Optical Parametric Oscillators (OPOs). For this, I use the Lugiato-Lefever equation. The derivation of the Hamiltonian does not pretend to be mathematically correct, although it works under the assumption of plane waves propagating through the OPOs. Its objective is rather to be as close as possible to the Hamilton formalism than to be mathematically rigorous. The approach is based on the assumptions that are justified from the physical point of view and are implemented experimentally. The resulting Ising Hamiltonian contains all necessary terms that are connected to the appearance and evolution of phase solitons.</description>

      <title>Tricritical point as a crossover between type-I$_s$ and type-II$_s$ bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tricritical point as a crossover between (stationary finite-wavelength) type-I$_s$ and (stationary longwave) type-II$_s$ bifurcations is identified in the study of diffusive-thermal (Turing) instability of flames propagating in a Hele-Shaw channel in a direction transverse to a shear flow. Three regimes exhibiting different scaling laws are identified in the neighbourhood of the tricritical point. For these three regimes, sixth-order partial differential equations are obtained governing the weakly nonlinear evolution of unstable solutions near the onset of instability. These sixth-order PDES may be regarded as the substitute for the classical fourth-order Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation which is not applicable near the tricritical point.</description>

      <title>Two-component nonlinear waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized equation for the study of two-component nonlinear waves in different fields of physics is considered. In special cases, this equation is reduced to a set of the various well-known equations describing nonlinear solitary waves in the different areas of physics. Using both the slowly varying envelope approximation and the generalized perturbation reduction method, the generalized equation is transformed into the coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations and the two-component nonlinear solitary wave solution is obtained. Explicit analytical expressions for the shape and parameters of two-component nonlinear wave consisting of two breathers oscillating with the sum and difference frequencies and wave numbers are presented. The solution of the generalized equation coincides with the vector 0\pi pulse of the self-induced transparency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ivancevic option pricing model is studied via variational approach. Both the Gaussian anstz and the (sech ansatz are used, and each has a unique results from one another. But in terms of existance of soliton solutions they both agree that hot market temperatures support the existance of soliton solutions.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic evolution of solitons embedded on lipid membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heimburg-Jackson model, or thermodynamic soliton theory of nervous impulses, has a well-established record as an alternative model for studying the dynamics of nerve impulses and lipid bilayers. Within this framework, nerve impulses can be represented as nonlinear excitations of low amplitude depicted by the damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and their adiabatic evolution can be analyzed using direct perturbative methods. Based on the foregoing, we carry out the current study using the quasi-stationary approach to obtain the adiabatic evolution of solitons embedded in lipid bilayers under the influence of a viscous elastic fluid. This analysis encompasses liquid-to-gel transition of the lipid bilayers, for whose dark and bright solitons arise, respectively.</description>

      <title>Pseudo grid-based physics-informed convolutional-recurrent network solving the integrable nonlinear lattice equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional discrete learning methods involve discretizing continuous equations using difference schemes, necessitating considerations of stability and convergence. Integrable nonlinear lattice equations possess a profound mathematical structure that enables them to revert to continuous integrable equations in the continuous limit, particularly retaining integrable properties such as conservation laws, Hamiltonian structure, and multiple soliton solutions. The pseudo grid-based physics-informed convolutional-recurrent network (PG-PhyCRNet) is proposed to investigate the localized wave solutions of integrable lattice equations, which significantly enhances the model's extrapolation capability to lattice points beyond the temporal domain. We conduct a comparative analysis of PG-PhyCRNet with and without pseudo grid by investigating the multi-soliton solutions and rational solitons of the Toda lattice and self-dual network equation. The results indicate that the PG-PhyCRNet excels in capturing long-term evolution and enhances the model's extrapolation capability for solitons, particularly those with steep waveforms and high wave speeds. Finally, the robustness of the PG-PhyCRNet method and its effect on the prediction of solutions in different scenarios are confirmed through repeated experiments involving pseudo grid partitioning.</description>

      <title>Exact solitary wave solutions for a coupled gKdV-Schrodinger system by a new ODE reduction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new method is developed for finding exact solitary wave solutions of a generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation with p-power nonlinearity coupled to a linear Schr\"odinger equation arising in many different physical applications. This method yields 22 solution families, with p=1,2,3,4. No solutions for p&gt;1 were known previously in the literature. For p=1, four of the solution families contain bright/dark Davydov solitons of the 1st and 2nd kind, obtained in recent work by basic ansatze applied to the ODE system for travelling waves. All of the new solution families have interesting features, including bright/dark peaks with (up to) p symmetric pairs of side peaks in the amplitude and a kink profile for the nonlinear part in the phase. The present method is fully systematic and involves several novel steps which reduce the travelling wave ODE system to a single nonlinear base ODE for which all polynomial solutions are found by symbolic computation. It is applicable more generally to other coupled nonlinear dispersive wave equations as well as to nonlinear ODE systems of generalized H\'enon-Heiles form.</description>

      <title>Customizable wave tailoring materials enabled by nonlinear bilevel inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passive transformation of waves via nonlinear systems is ubiquitous in settings ranging from acoustics to optics and electromagnetics. Passivity is of particular importance for responding rapidly to stimuli and nonlinearity enormously expands signal transformability compared to linear systems due to the breaking of superposition. It is well known that different types of nonlinearity yield vastly different effects on propagating signals, which raises the question of ``what precise nonlinearity is the best for a given wave tailoring application?'' Considering a one-dimensional spring-mass chain as a testbed, we couple the shape optimization of structures for tailored nonlinear constitutive responses with reduced-order nonlinear dynamical inverse design. Using minimization of peak kinetic energy transmission from impact as a case study, we identify ideal nonlinear constitutive responses and the geometries needed to achieve them. As part of this, we show the large sensitivity of this metric to small changes in nonlinearity, and thus the need for high precision, free-form nonlinearity tailoring. We validate our predictions using impact experiments in a chain of nonlinear springs and masses. This work sets the foundation for broader passive nonlinear mechanical wave tailoring material design, with applications to computing, signal processing, shock mitigation, and autonomous materials.</description>
