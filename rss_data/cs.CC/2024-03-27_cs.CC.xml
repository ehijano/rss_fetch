      <title>Counting Stars is Constant-Degree Optimal For Detecting Any Planted Subgraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computational limits of the following general hypothesis testing problem. Let H=H_n be an \emph{arbitrary} undirected graph on n vertices. We study the detection task between a ``null'' Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph G(n,p) and a ``planted'' random graph which is the union of G(n,p) together with a random copy of H=H_n. Our notion of planted model is a generalization of a plethora of recently studied models initiated with the study of the planted clique model (Jerrum 1992), which corresponds to the special case where H is a k-clique and p=1/2.
  Over the last decade, several papers have studied the power of low-degree polynomials for limited choices of H's in the above task. In this work, we adopt a unifying perspective and characterize the power of \emph{constant degree} polynomials for the detection task, when \emph{H=H_n is any arbitrary graph} and for \emph{any p=\Omega(1).} Perhaps surprisingly, we prove that the optimal constant degree polynomial is always given by simply \emph{counting stars} in the input random graph. As a direct corollary, we conclude that the class of constant-degree polynomials is only able to ``sense'' the degree distribution of the planted graph H, and no other graph theoretic property of it.</description>

      <title>The n-vehicle exploration problem is NP-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03965v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $n$-vehicle exploration problem (NVEP) is a combinatorial search problem, which tries to find a permutation of $n$ vehicles to make one of the vehicles travel the maximal distance. Assuming the $n$ vehicles travel together, with some vehicles being used to refuel others, and at last all the vehicles return to the start point. NVEP has a fractional form of objective function, and its computational complexity of general case remains open. Given a directed graph $G$, if it has a Hamiltonian path, then the Hamiltonian path can be reduced in polynomial time to a single instance of NVEP, in which the traveling distance is at least $n$. The total length consists of $n$ parts, each of which is required to equal to $1$. We prove that $G$ has a hamiltonian path of total weight of $n$ if and only if the reduced NVEP instance has a sequence of length at least $n$ with each term equals to $1$. Therefore we show that Hamiltonian path $\leq_P$ NVEP, and consequently prove that NVEP is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial view of Holant problems on higher domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the Boolean domain, there is a class of symmetric signatures called ``Fibonacci gates'' for which a beautiful P-time combinatorial algorithm has been designed for the corresponding $\operatorname{Holant}$ problems.
  In this work, we give a combinatorial view for $\operatorname{Holant}(\mathcal{F})$ problems on a domain of size 3 where $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of arity 3 functions with inputs taking values on the domain of size 3 and the functions share some common properties. The combinatorial view can also be extended to the domain of size 4.
  Specifically, we extend the definition of "Fibonacci gates" to the domain of size 3 and the domain of size 4. Moreover, we give the corresponding combinatorial algorithms.</description>
