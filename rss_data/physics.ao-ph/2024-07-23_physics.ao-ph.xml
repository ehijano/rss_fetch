      <title>Assessing the climate benefits of afforestation: phenomenology, processes, methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Afforestation greatly influences several earth system processes, making it essential to understand these effects to accurately assess its potential for climate change mitigation. Although our understanding of forest-climate interactions has improved, significant knowledge gaps remain, preventing definitive assessments of afforestation's net climate benefits. In this review, focusing on the Canadian boreal, we identify these gaps and synthesize existing knowledge. The review highlights regional realities, Earth's climatic history, uncertainties in biogeochemical (BGC) and biogeophysical (BGP) changes following afforestation, and limitations in current assessment methodologies, emphasizing the need to reconcile these uncertainties before drawing firm conclusions about the climate benefits of afforestation. We hope that the identified gaps will drive the development of a more informed decision-making framework for Canadian afforestation policy, one that considers regional and future climatic contexts. Although we use the Canadian boreal as an example, most arguments in this review are applicable across the globe, particularly for the circumpolar nations.</description>

      <title>Data driven weather forecasts trained and initialised directly from observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skilful Machine Learned weather forecasts have challenged our approach to numerical weather prediction, demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional physics-based approaches. Data-driven systems have been trained to forecast future weather by learning from long historical records of past weather such as the ECMWF ERA5. These datasets have been made freely available to the wider research community, including the commercial sector, which has been a major factor in the rapid rise of ML forecast systems and the levels of accuracy they have achieved. However, historical reanalyses used for training and real-time analyses used for initial conditions are produced by data assimilation, an optimal blending of observations with a physics-based forecast model. As such, many ML forecast systems have an implicit and unquantified dependence on the physics-based models they seek to challenge. Here we propose a new approach, training a neural network to predict future weather purely from historical observations with no dependence on reanalyses. We use raw observations to initialise a model of the atmosphere (in observation space) learned directly from the observations themselves. Forecasts of crucial weather parameters (such as surface temperature and wind) are obtained by predicting weather parameter observations (e.g. SYNOP surface data) at future times and arbitrary locations. We present preliminary results on forecasting observations 12-hours into the future. These already demonstrate successful learning of time evolutions of the physical processes captured in real observations. We argue that this new approach, by staying purely in observation space, avoids many of the challenges of traditional data assimilation, can exploit a wider range of observations and is readily expanded to simultaneous forecasting of the full Earth system (atmosphere, land, ocean and composition).</description>

      <title>Turbulent convection in rotating slender cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent convection in the interiors of the Sun and the Earth occurs at high Rayleigh numbers $Ra$, low Prandtl numbers $Pr$, and different levels of rotation rates. To understand the combined effects better, we study rotating turbulent convection for $Pr = 0.021$ (for which some laboratory data corresponding to liquid metals are available), and varying Rossby numbers $Ro$, using direct numerical simulations (DNS) in a slender cylinder of aspect ratio 0.1; this confinement allows us to attain high enough Rayleigh numbers. We are motivated by the earlier finding in the absence of rotation that heat transport at high enough $Ra$ is similar between confined and extended domains. We make comparisons with higher aspect ratio data where possible. We study the effects of rotation on the global transport of heat and momentum as well as flow structures (a) for increasing rotation at a few fixed values of $Ra$ and (b) for increasing $Ra$ (up to $10^{10}$) at the fixed, low Ekman number of $1.45 \times 10^{-6}$. We compare the results with those from unity $Pr$ simulations for the same range of $Ra$ and $Ro$, and with the non-rotating case over the same range of $Ra$ and low $Pr$. We find that the effects of rotation diminish with increasing $Ra$. These results and comparison studies suggest that, for high enough $Ra$, rotation alters convective flows in a similar manner for small and large aspect ratios, and so useful insights on the effects of high thermal forcing on convection can be obtained by considering slender domains.</description>

      <title>Interpretable multiscale Machine Learning-Based Parameterizations of Convection for ICON</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based parameterizations have been developed for Earth System Models (ESMs) with the goal to better represent subgrid-scale processes or to accelerate computations. ML-based parameterizations within hybrid ESMs have successfully learned subgrid-scale processes from short high-resolution simulations. However, most studies used a particular ML method to parameterize the subgrid tendencies or fluxes originating from the compound effect of various small-scale processes (e.g., radiation, convection, gravity waves) in mostly idealized settings or from superparameterizations. Here, we use a filtering technique to explicitly separate convection from these processes in simulations with the Icosahedral Non-hydrostatic modelling framework (ICON) in a realistic setting and benchmark various ML algorithms against each other offline. We discover that an unablated U-Net, while showing the best offline performance, learns reverse causal relations between convective precipitation and subgrid fluxes. While we were able to connect the learned relations of the U-Net to physical processes this was not possible for the non-deep learning-based Gradient Boosted Trees. The ML algorithms are then coupled online to the host ICON model. Our best online performing model, an ablated U-Net excluding precipitating tracer species, indicates higher agreement for simulated precipitation extremes and mean with the high-resolution simulation compared to the traditional scheme. However, a smoothing bias is introduced both in water vapor path and mean precipitation. Online, the ablated U-Net significantly improves stability compared to the non-ablated U-Net and runs stable for the full simulation period of 180 days. Our results hint to the potential to significantly reduce systematic errors with hybrid ESMs.</description>

      <title>A hypothesis on ergodicity and the signal-to-noise paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04669v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter raises the possibility that ergodicity concerns might have some bearing on the signal-to-noise paradox. This is explored by applying the ergodic theorem to the theory behind ensemble weather forecasting and the ensemble mean. Using the ensemble mean as our best forecast of observations amounts to interpreting it as the most likely phase-space trajectory, which relies on the ergodic theorem. This can fail for ensemble forecasting systems if members are not perfectly exchangeable with each other, the averaging window is too short and/or there are too few members. We argue these failures can occur in cases such as the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) forecasts due to intransitivity or regime behaviour for regions such as the North Atlantic and Arctic. This behaviour, where different ensemble members may become stuck in different relatively persistent flow states (intransitivity) or multi-modality (regime behaviour), can in certain situations break the ergodic theorem. The problem of non-ergodic systems and models in the case of weather forecasting is discussed, as are potential mitigation methods and metrics for ergodicity in ensemble systems.</description>

      <title>Lightning as a natural accelerator of relativistic particles and a source of synchrotron radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A physical model of the formation of a vortex current in a plasma channel of lightning discharges due to the anomalous Hall effect caused by relativistic spin-orbit interaction phenomenon is proposed. The existence of fast electromagnetic surface plasmon waves propagating along the lightning discharge channel at a speed close to the speed of light in vacuum is shown. The spin properties of electrons become important at relativistic velocities, so the spin-orbit coupling arises as an effective magnetic force acting on the spin of an electron, leading to the formation of a spin-induced vortex current in the absence of an external magnetic field. This makes it possible to consider the lightning discharge channel as a charged particle accelerator that generates microwave, X-ray, gamma-ray and RF emissions by a current pulse moving along a helical trajectory via synchrotron and cyclotron radiation mechanisms. The proposed theoretical model of the formation of a spin-induced vortex current in the lightning plasma channel is consistent with observations of lightning and spark discharges.</description>

      <title>Calculating radio emissions of positive streamer phenomena using 3D simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study radio emissions from positive streamers in air using 3D simulations, from which the radiated electric field is computed by solving Jefimenko's equations. The simulations are performed at 0.5 bar using two photoionization methods: the Helmholtz approximation for a photon density and a Monte Carlo method using discrete photons, with the latter being the most realistic. We consider cases with single streamers, streamer branching, streamers interacting with preionization and streamer-streamer encounters. We do not observe a strong VHF radio signal during or after branching, which is confirmed by lab experiments. This indicates that the current inside a streamer discharges evolves approximately continuously during branching. On the other hand, stochastic fluctuations in streamer propagation due to Monte Carlo photoionization lead to more radio emission being emitted at frequencies of 100 MHz and above. Another process that leads to such high-frequency emission is the interaction of a streamer with a weakly preionized region, for example present due to a previous discharge. In agreement with previous work, we observe the strongest and highest-frequency emission from streamer encounters. The amount of total energy that is radiated seems to depend primarily on the background electric field, and less on the particular streamer evolution. Finally, we present approximations for the maximal current along a streamer channel and a fit formula for a streamer's current moment.</description>

      <title>Towards diffusion models for large-scale sea-ice modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make the first steps towards diffusion models for unconditional generation of multivariate and Arctic-wide sea-ice states. While targeting to reduce the computational costs by diffusion in latent space, latent diffusion models also offer the possibility to integrate physical knowledge into the generation process. We tailor latent diffusion models to sea-ice physics with a censored Gaussian distribution in data space to generate data that follows the physical bounds of the modelled variables. Our latent diffusion models reach similar scores as the diffusion model trained in data space, but they smooth the generated fields as caused by the latent mapping. While enforcing physical bounds cannot reduce the smoothing, it improves the representation of the marginal ice zone. Therefore, for large-scale Earth system modelling, latent diffusion models can have many advantages compared to diffusion in data space if the significant barrier of smoothing can be resolved.</description>
