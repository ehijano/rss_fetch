      <title>A Weight Function Lemma Heuristic for Graph Pebbling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph pebbling is a problem in which pebbles are distributed across the vertices of a graph and moved according to a specific rule: two pebbles are removed from a vertex to place one on an adjacent vertex. The goal is to determine the minimum number of pebbles required to ensure that any target vertex can be reached, known as the pebbling number. Computing the pebbling number lies beyond NP in the polynomial hierarchy, leading to bounding methods. One of the most prominent techniques for upper bounds is the Weight Function Lemma (WFL), which relies on costly integer linear optimization. To mitigate this cost, an alternative approach is to consider the dual formulation of the problem, which allows solutions to be constructed by hand through the selection of strategies given by subtrees with associated weight functions. To improve the bounds, the weights should be distributed as uniformly as possible among the vertices, balancing their individual contribution. However, despite its simplicity, this approach lacks a formal framework. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel heuristic method that refines the selection of balanced strategies. The method is motivated by our theoretical analysis of the limitations of the dual approach, in which we prove lower bounds on the best bounds achievable. Our theoretical analysis shows that the bottleneck lies in the farthest vertices from the target, forcing surplus weight onto the closer neighborhoods. To minimize surplus weight beyond the theoretical minimum, our proposed heuristic prioritizes weight assignment to the farthest vertices, building the subtrees starting from the shortest paths to them and then filling in the weights for the remaining vertices. Applying our heuristic to Flower snarks and Blanu\v{s}a snarks, we improve the best-known upper bounds, demonstrating the effectiveness of a structured strategy selection when using the WFL.</description>

      <title>Continuous Petri Nets Faithfully Fluidify Most Permissive Boolean Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of biological networks has benefited from the richness of Boolean networks (BNs) and the associated theory. These results have been further fortified in recent years by the emergence of Most Permissive (MP) semantics, combining efficient analysis methods with a greater capacity of explaining pathways to states hitherto thought unreachable, owing to limitations of the classical update modes. While MPBNs are understood to capture any behaviours that can be observed at a lower level of abstraction, all the way down to continuous refinements, the specifics and potential of the models and analysis, especially attractors, across the abstraction scale remain unexplored. Here, we fluidify MPBNs by means of Continuous Petri nets (CPNs), a model of (uncountably infinite) dynamic systems that has been successfully explored for modelling and theoretical purposes. CPNs create a formal link between MPBNs and their continuous dynamical refinements such as ODE models. The benefits of CPNs extend beyond the model refinement, and constitute well established theory and analysis methods, recently augmented by abstract and symbolic reachability graphs. These structures are shown to compact the possible behaviours of the system with focus on events which drive the choice of long-term behaviour in which the system eventually stabilises. The current paper brings an important keystone to this novel methodology for biological networks, namely the proof that extant PN encoding of BNs instantiated as a CPN simulates the MP semantics. In spite of the underlying dynamics being continuous, the analysis remains in the realm of discrete methods, constituting an extension of all previous work.</description>

      <title>Scaling Quantum Simulation-Based Optimization: Demonstrating Efficient Power Grid Management with Deep QAOA Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Simulation-based Optimization (QuSO) is a recently proposed class of optimization problems that entails industrially relevant problems characterized by cost functions or constraints that depend on summary statistic information about the simulation of a physical system or process. This work extends initial theoretical results that proved an up-to-exponential speedup for the simulation component of the QAOA-based QuSO solver proposed by Stein et al. for the unit commitment problem by an empirical evaluation of the optimization component using a standard benchmark dataset, the IEEE 57-bus system. Exploiting clever classical pre-computation, we develop a very efficient classical quantum circuit simulation that bypasses costly ancillary qubit requirements by the original algorithm, allowing for large-scale experiments. Utilizing more than 1000 QAOA layers and up to 20 qubits, our experiments complete a proof of concept implementation for the proposed QuSO solver, showing that it can achieve both highly competitive performance and efficiency in its optimization component compared to a standard classical baseline, i.e., simulated annealing.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Counting Linear Regions in ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.</description>

      <title>Reachability in temporal graphs under perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reachability and other path-based measures on temporal graphs can be used to understand spread of infection, information, and people in modelled systems. Due to delays and errors in reporting, temporal graphs derived from data are unlikely to perfectly reflect reality, especially with respect to the precise times at which edges appear. To reflect this uncertainty, we consider a model in which some number $\zeta$ of edge appearances may have their timestamps perturbed by $\pm\delta$ for some $\delta$. Within this model, we investigate temporal reachability and consider the problem of determining the maximum number of vertices any vertex can reach under these perturbations. We show that this problem is intractable in general but is efficiently solvable when $\zeta$ is sufficiently large. We also give algorithms which solve this problem in several restricted settings. We complement this with some contrasting results concerning the complexity of related temporal eccentricity problems under perturbation.</description>

      <title>Big Ramsey degrees using parameter spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.00967v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the universal homogeneous partial order has finite big Ramsey degrees and discuss several corollaries. Our proof relies on parameter spaces and the Carlson-Simpson theorem rather than on (a strengthening of) the Halpern-L\"auchli theorem and the Milliken tree theorem, which are typically used to bound big Ramsey degrees in the existing literature (originating from the work of Laver and Milliken).
  This new technique has many additional applications. We show that the homogeneous universal triangle-free graph has finite big Ramsey degrees, providing a short proof of a recent result by Dobrinen. Moreover, generalizing an indivisibility (vertex partition) result of Nguyen van Th\'e and Sauer, we give an upper bound on big Ramsey degrees of metric spaces with finitely many distances. This leads to a new combinatorial argument for the oscillation stability of the Urysohn Sphere.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap between Reactivity, Contraction, and Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reactivity, contractivity, and Lyapunov exponents are powerful tools for studying the stability properties of dynamical systems and have been extensively investigated in the literature for decades. In this paper, we review and extend the concepts of reactivity, contractivity, and finite-time Lyapunov exponents for discrete-time dynamical systems and establish connections among them. We focus on time-invariant maps, time-varying linear maps, and certain classes of time-varying nonlinear maps. In particular, we show that if the corresponding $p$-iteration systems (with p &gt; 1) are contractive, then the original systems admit stable attractors such as fixed points or limit cycles. We demonstrate the application of these results to the analysis of synchronization stability in coupled networks and discuss how p-iteration systems can serve as a useful framework for studying network synchronization.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to two conjectures on Venn diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1984, Winkler conjectured that every simple Venn diagram with $n$ curves can be extended to a simple Venn diagram with $n+1$ curves. His conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the dual graph of any simple Venn diagram has a Hamilton cycle. In this work, we construct counterexamples to Winkler's conjecture for all $n\geq 6$. As part of this proof, we computed all 3.430.404 simple Venn diagrams with $n=6$ curves (even their number was not previously known), among which we found 72 counterexamples. While working on Winkler's conjecture, Pruesse and Ruskey considered the (multi)graph whose vertices are the crossings of the curves of a Venn diagram and curve segments between consecutive crossings form the edges. They proved that this graph has a Hamilton cycle for every simple Venn diagram with $n$ curves, and conjectured that this also holds for non-simple diagrams. We construct counterexamples to this conjecture for all $n\geq 4$.</description>
