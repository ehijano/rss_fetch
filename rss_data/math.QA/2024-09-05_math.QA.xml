      <title>Based cluster algebras of infinite ranks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend based cluster algebras to infinite ranks. By extending (quantum) cluster algebras associated with double Bott-Samelson cells, we recover infinite rank cluster algebras arising from representations of (shifted) quantum affine algebras. As the main application, we show that the fundamental variables of the cluster algebras associated with double Bott-Samelson cells could be computed via a braid group action when the Cartan matrix is of finite type. We also obtain the result A=U for the associated infinite rank (quantum) cluster algebras. Additionally, several conjectures regarding quantum virtual Grothendieck rings by Jang-Lee-Oh and Oh-Park follow as consequences. Finally, we quantize cluster algebras arising from representations of shifted quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tube Algebras, Symmetry-Resolved Partition Functions, and Twisted Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of generalized tube algebras which describe how finite, non-invertible global symmetries of bosonic 1+1d QFTs act on operators which sit at the intersection point of a collection of boundaries and interfaces. We develop a 2+1d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) picture of boundaries and interfaces which, among other things, allows us to deduce the representation theory of these algebras. In particular, we initiate the study of a character theory, echoing that of finite groups, and demonstrate how many representation-theoretic quantities can be expressed as partition functions of the SymTFT on various backgrounds, which in turn can be evaluated explicitly in terms of generalized half-linking numbers. We use this technology to explain how the torus and annulus partition functions of a 1+1d QFT can be refined with information about its symmetries. We are led to a vast generalization of Ishibashi states in CFT: to any multiplet of conformal boundary conditions which transform into each other under the action of a symmetry, we associate a collection of generalized Ishibashi states, in terms of which the twisted sector boundary states of the theory and all of its orbifolds can be obtained as linear combinations. We derive a generalized Verlinde formula involving the characters of the boundary tube algebra which ensures that our formulas for the twisted sector boundary states respect open-closed duality. Our approach does not rely on rationality or the existence of an extended chiral algebra; however, in the special case of a diagonal RCFT with chiral algebra $V$ and modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$, our formalism produces explicit closed-form expressions - in terms of the $F$-symbols and $R$-matrices of $\mathscr{C}$, and the characters of $V$ - for the twisted Cardy states, and the torus and annulus partition functions decorated by Verlinde lines.</description>

      <title>On certain invariants of compact quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a number of invariants of locally compact quantum groups defined by their scaling and modular groups and the spectrum of their modular elements. Focusing mainly on compact quantum groups we consider the question whether triviality of one of the invariants is equivalent to the quantum group being of Kac type and show that it has a positive answer in many cases including duals of second countable type $\mathrm{I}$ discrete quantum groups. We perform a complete calculation of the invariants for all $q$-deformations of compact, simply connected, semisimple Lie groups as well as for some non-compact quantum groups and the compact quantum groups $\operatorname{U}_F^+$. Finally we introduce a family of conditions for discrete quantum groups which for classical discrete groups are all equivalent to the fact that the group is i.c.c. We show that the above mentioned question about characterization of Kac type quantum groups by one of our invariants has a positive answer for duals of discrete quantum groups satisfying such an i.c.c.-type condition and illustrate this with the example of $\operatorname{U}_F^+$.</description>
