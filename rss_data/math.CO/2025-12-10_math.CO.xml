      <title>Progress on Albertson's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Albertson conjectured that every graph with chromatic number $r$ has crossing number at least the crossing number of the complete graph $K_r$. This conjecture was proved for $r\le 12$ by Albertson, Cranston, and Fox; for $r\le 16$ by Bar\'{a}t and T\'{o}th; and for $r\le 18$ by Ackerman. Here we verify it for $r\le 24$; we also greatly restrict the possibilities for counterexamples when $r\in\{25,26\}$. In addition, we strengthen earlier work bounding the order of a minimum counterexample for each choice of $r$: we exclude the possibility that $|G|\ge 2.82r$ and exclude the possibility that $1.228r\le |G|\le 1.768r$. Finally, as $r$ grows, we extend the lower end of this range of excluded orders for a minimum counterexample. In particular: if $r\ge 125{,}000$, then we exclude the possibility that $1.10r\le |G|\le 1.768r$; and if $r\ge 825{,}000$, then we exclude the possibility that $1.05r\le |G|\le 1.768r$.</description>

      <title>Spectrally symmetric orientations of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hermitian adjacency matrices of digraphs based on the sixth root of unity were introduced in [B. Mohar, A new kind of Hermitian matrices for digraphs, Linear Alg. Appl. (2020)]. They appear to be the most natural choice for the spectral theory of digraphs. Undirected graphs have adjacency spectrum symmetric about 0 if and only if they are bipartite. The situation is more complex for the Hermitian spectra of digraphs. In this paper we study non-bipartite oriented graphs with symmetric Hermitian spectra. Our main result concerns the extremal problem of maximizing the density of spectrally symmetric oriented graphs. The maximum possible density is shown to be between 13/18} and 10/11. Furthermore, we give a necessary condition for an oriented graph to be spectrally symmetric based on the adjacency spectrum of the underlying graph. This allows us to show that line graphs of sufficiently dense graphs do not admit spectrally symmetric orientations. We also show how to construct infinite families of spectrally symmetric graphs using 1-sums.</description>

      <title>Online Ramsey turnaround numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The online Ramsey turnaround game is a game between two players, Builder and Painter, on a board of $n$ vertices using $3$ colors, for a fixed graph $H$ on at most $n$ vertices. The goal of Painter is to force a monochromatic copy of $H$, the goal of Builder is to avoid this as long as possible. In each round of the game, Builder exposes one new edge and is allowed to forbid the usage of one color for Painter to color this newly exposed edge, and Painter colors the edge according to this restriction. The game is over as soon as Painter manages to achieve a monochromatic copy of $H$. For sufficiently large $n$, we consider the smallest number $f(n, H)$ of edges so that Painter can always win after $f(n, H)$ edges have been exposed by Builder. In addition, we define $f(H)$ to be the smallest $n$ such that Painter can always win on a clique with $n$ vertices. We give bounds for both functions and show that this problem is closely related to other concepts in extremal graph theory, such as polychromatic colorings, set-coloring Ramsey numbers, chromatic Ramsey numbers, and 2-color Tur\'an numbers.</description>

      <title>Billey-Postnikov posets, rationally smooth Schubert varieties, and Poincar\'e duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Billey-Postnikov (BP) decompositions govern when Schubert varieties $X(w)$ decompose as bundles of smaller Schubert varieties. We further develop the theory of BP decompositions and show that, in finite type, they can be recognized by pattern conditions and are indexed by the order ideals of a poset $\mathsf{bp}(w)$ that we introduce; we conjecture that this holds in any Coxeter group. We then apply BP decompositions to show that, when $X(w)$ is rationally smooth and $W$ simply laced, the Schubert structure constants $c_{uv}^w$ satisfy a triangularity property, yielding a canonical involution on the Schubert cells of $X(w)$ respecting Poincar\'{e} duality. We also classify the rationally smooth Bruhat intervals in finite type (other than $E$) which admit generalized Lehmer codes, answering questions and conjectures of Billey-Fan-Losonczy, Bolognini-Sentinelli, and Bishop-Mili\'{c}evi\'{c}-Thomas. Finally, we show that rationally smooth Schubert varieties in infinite type need not have Grassmannian BP decompositions, disproving conjectures of Richmond-Slofstra and Oh-Richmond.</description>

      <title>A unified planar network approach to total positivity of combinatorial matrices and real-rootedness of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a common sufficient condition for the total positivity of combinatorial triangles and their reversals, as well as the real-rootedness of generating functions of the rows. The proof technique is to construct a unified planar network that represent the matrix, its reversal, and the Toeplitz matrices of rows, respectively, when selecting different sets of sources and sinks. These results can be applied to the exponential Riordan arrays, the iteration matrices and the $n$-recursive matrices. As consequences, we prove the total positivity and real-rootedness properties associated to many well-known combinatorial numbers, including the Stirling numbers of both kinds (of type A and type B), the Lah numbers, the idempotent numbers, the Delannoy numbers, and the derangement numbers of type A and type B.</description>

      <title>The 1/4-phenomenon of placement probabilities of tilings in the Aztec diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider domino tilings of the Aztec diamond. Using the Domino Shuffling algorithm introduced by Elkies, Kuperberg, Larsen, and Propp in arXiv:math/9201305, we are able to generate domino tilings uniformly at random. In this paper, we investigate the probability of finding a domino at a specific position in such a random tiling. We prove that this placement probability is always equal to $1/4$ plus a rational function, whose shape depends on the location of the domino, multiplied by a position-independent factor that involves only the size of the diamond. This result leads to significantly more compact explicit counting formulas compared to previous findings. As a direct application, we derive explicit counting formulas for the domino tilings of Aztec diamonds with $2\times 2$-square holes at arbitrary positions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we will introduce a central problem in additive combinatorics, which arised from the famous van der Waerden theorem and an early conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Tur\'{a}n. The first important theorem was due to Roth in 1953. There were a number of generalized or improved results afterwards, which we call Roth-type theorems. We will list them and try to give concise expositions to the ideas in some of the proofs without much prior knowledge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the Ehrhart polynomials of cross-polytopes, as well as of pyramids over them, have positive coefficients. We give a combinatorial proof of this fact by showing that a scaled version of the Ehrhart polynomials are generating functions for certain colored permutations. This answers a question posed by Stanley.</description>

      <title>Raimi's theorem for manifolds with circle symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raimi's classical theorem establishes a partition of the natural numbers with a remarkable unavoidability property: for every finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there is a color class whose translate meets both parts of the partition in infinitely many points. Recently, Kang, Koh, and Tran have extended this phenomenon to the circle group, proving that there exists a measurable partition of the circle such that every finite measurable cover admits a rotation whose image meets each part of the partition in positive measure. This paper shows that this phenomenon extends beyond compact abelian groups to a wide class of non-group geometric surfaces that still exhibit \textit{a hidden one-dimensional symmetry}. Specifically, we establish analogs of Raimi's theorem for three families of surfaces (with their natural surface measures): the unit sphere $S^{n-1} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, rotational power surfaces (such as cones and paraboloids), and circular cylindrical surfaces. The common feature is that each of these surfaces carries a natural measure-preserving action of the circle group by rotation in a fixed plane and admits a measurable trivialization as a product $C \times Y$. This circle-bundle structure allows the measurable Raimi partition on the base circle to be lifted to an unavoidable partition on the manifold. Our approach is unified through a general circle-bundle theorem, which reduces all three geometric cases to verifying suitable equivariance and product disintegration properties of the surface measure.</description>

      <title>Resolvable Triple Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new construction of triple arrays by combining a symmetric 2-design with a resolution of another 2-design. This is the first general method capable of producing non-extremal triple arrays. We call the triple arrays which can be obtained in this way resolvable. We employ the construction to produce the first examples of $(21 \times 15, 63)$-triple arrays, and enumerate all resolvable $(7 \times 15, 35)$-triple arrays, of which there was previously only a single known example. An infinite subfamily of Paley triple arrays turns out to be resolvable.
  We also introduce a new intermediate object, unordered triple arrays, that are to triple arrays what symmetric 2-designs are to Youden rectangles, and propose a strengthening of Agrawal's long-standing conjecture on the existence of extremal triple arrays. For small parameters, we completely enumerate all unordered triple arrays, and use this data to corroborate the new conjecture. We construct several infinite families of resolvable unordered triple arrays, and, in particular, show that all $((q + 1) \times q^2, q(q + 1))$-triple arrays are resolvable and are in correspondence with finite affine planes of order $q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents combinatorial facts dealing with the number of unlabeled partially ordered sets (posets) refined by the number of arcs in the Hasse diagram (sequence A342447 in OEIS). The main result is that the differences with respect to the number of points in this sequence become stationary if the number of points is sufficiently high. These differences are proposed as the new sequence A376894. In addition, the underlying combinatorial and graph theoretical arguments were used to extend some further OEIS sequences.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite set of points $V=\{v_1, \dots, v_m\}$ in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ and a point $r \in \mathbb{R}^d$, a subset $S \subset V$ is called $r$-balanced if $\mathrm{relint}(\mathrm{conv}(S)) \cap r \neq \emptyset$. In the case when $r$ is a point in the relative interior of the whole set $\mathrm{conv}(V)$, we prove that the poset of all balanced subsets, excluding the whole set $V$, is homotopy equivalent to the sphere of dimension $m-k-2$, where $k$ is the dimension of the affine hull of $V$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2011, Dyer published a series of conjectures on the weak order of Coxeter groups. One of these conjectures stated that the inversion set of the join of two elements in a Coxeter group is equal to some "closure" of the union of their inversion sets. In this paper we show that this "closure" is in fact a preclosure, which we call the Bruhat preclosure, but is a closure whenever our underlying set is an inversion set. By performing the Bruhat preclosure an infinite number of times we obtain a closure which we call the infinite Bruhat closure. We show in a uniform way that Dyer's conjecture is true when using the infinite Bruhat closure (instead of Bruhat preclosure) if the join exists between two elements. Finally, we end by showing in type A, the Bruhat preclosure is a closure thus giving a (second) proof that Dyer's conjecture is true in type A.</description>

Abstract: G.-Pechenik-Pfannerer-Striker-Swanson applied hourglass plabic graphs to construct web bases for spaces of tensor invariants of fundamental representations of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$, extending Kuperberg's celebrated basis for $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_3)$. We give several combinatorial characterizations of basis webs in the kernel of the projection to invariants in a tensor product of arbitrary (type $1$) irreducibles. We apply this to show that the nonzero images of basis webs form a basis (a property shared with Lusztig's dual canonical basis) yielding distinguished clasped web bases for each such tensor product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the appearance of Hamilton $\ell$-cycles in dense $k$-uniform hypergraphs when $\ell \leq k-2$ and $k-\ell$ does not divide $k$. Our main result reduces this problem to the robust existence of a connected $\ell$-cycle tiling in host graph families that are approximately closed under subsampling. As an application, we determine the minimum $d$-degree threshold for $d=k-2$ and all $1 \leq \ell \leq k-2$ when $k - \ell$ does not divide $k$. We also reduce the case $\ell &lt; d$ entirely to the corresponding (non-connected) $\ell$-cycle tiling problem. In addition, our outcomes lead to counting and random robust versions of these results. The proofs are based on the recently introduced method of blow-up covers and thus avoid the use of the Regularity Lemma and the Absorption Method.</description>

      <title>On the Prague dimension of sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Prague dimension of a graph $G$ is defined as the minimum number of complete graphs whose direct product contains $G$ as an induced subgraph. Introduced in the 1970s by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, Pultr, and R\"odl -- and motivated by the work of Dushnik and Miller, as well as by the induced Ramsey theorem -- determining the Prague dimension of a graph is a notoriously hard problem. In this paper, we show that for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $p$ such that $ n^{-1+\varepsilon} \le p \le n^{-\varepsilon}$, with high probability the Prague dimension of $G_{n,p}$ is $\Theta_{\varepsilon}(pn)$, which improves upon a recent result by Molnar, R\"odl, Sales and Schacht.
  Inspired by the work of Bennett and Bohman, our approach centres on analysing a random greedy process that builds an independent set of size $\Omega(p^{-1}\log pn)$ by iteratively selecting vertices uniformly at random from the common non-neighbourhood of those already chosen. Using the differential equation method, we show that every non-edge is essentially equally likely to be covered by this process, which is key to establishing our bound.</description>

      <title>Reddening sequences and mutation of infinite quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster algebras, introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky through the process of quiver mutation, have become central objects in modern algebra and geometry, linking combinatorial constructions with diverse mathematical domains such as Teichmuller theory, total positivity, and even theoretical physics. Building on foundational work by Fomin, Shapiro, and Thurston connecting cluster algebras to triangulated surfaces, recent research has extended mutation theory to infinite settings, including the infinity-gon and more general marked surfaces. In this paper, we develop a purely combinatorial framework for mutation of infinite quivers, independent of but compatible with these topological constructions. By formalizing infinite quivers as limits of embedded finite quivers, we establish a consistent definition of mutation that generalizes prior surface-based results. We then apply this framework to extend the notion of reddening sequences, special mutation sequences with significant algebraic consequences, from the finite to the infinite setting. Our approach not only unifies previous topological and combinatorial perspectives but also provides a technical foundation for further generalizations of cluster algebra theory in the infinite case.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence of equilateral polygons in planar integer lattices. Maehara showed that it's sufficient to work with rectangular lattices $\Lambda(m) = L[(1,0),(0,\sqrt{m})]$ with $m \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. Building on results of Maehara and of Iino and Sakiyama, we show that for every such $m$ there exists $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$, the lattice $\Lambda(m)$ contains an equilateral $n$-gon. This extends previous classifications of equilateral polygons in planar lattices.</description>

      <title>Finding core subgraphs of directed graphs via discrete Ricci curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ricci curvature and its associated flow offer powerful geometric methods for analyzing complex networks. While existing research heavily focuses on applications for undirected graphs such as community detection and core extraction, there have been relatively less attention on directed graphs.
  In this paper, we introduce a definition of Ricci curvature and an accompanying curvature flow for directed graphs. Crucially, for strongly connected directed graphs, this flow admits a unique global solution. We then apply this flow to detect strongly connected subgraphs from weakly connected directed graphs. (A weakly connected graph is connected overall but not necessarily strongly connected). Unlike prior work requiring graphs to be strongly connected, our method loosens this requirement. We transform a weakly connected graph into a strongly connected one by adding edges with very large artificial weights. This modification does not compromise our core subgraph detection. Due to their extreme weight, these added edges are automatically discarded during the final iteration of the Ricci curvature flow.
  For core evaluation, our approach consistently surpasses traditional methods, achieving better results on at least two out of three key metrics. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/12tangze12/Finding-core-subgraphs-on-directed-graphs.</description>

      <title>Generalized Interlacing Families: New Error Bounds for CUR Matrix Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of generalized interlacing families of polynomials, which extends the classical interlacing polynomial method to handle polynomials of varying degrees. We establish a fundamental property for these families, proving the existence of a polynomial with a desired degree whose smallest root is greater than or equal to the smallest root of the expected polynomial. Applying this framework to the generalized CUR matrix approximation problem, we derive a theoretical upper bound on the spectral norm of a residual matrix, expressed in terms of the largest root of the expected polynomial. We then explore two important special cases: the classical CUR matrix decompositions and the row subset selection problem. For classical CUR matrix decompositions, we derive an explicit upper bound for the largest root of the expected polynomial. This yields a tighter spectral norm error bound for the residual matrix compared to many existing results. Furthermore, we present a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for solving the classical CUR problem under certain matrix conditions. For the row subset selection problem, we establish the first known spectral norm error bound. This paper extends the applicability of interlacing families and deepens the theoretical foundations of CUR matrix decompositions and related approximation problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A paradoxical idea in quantum transport is that attaching weakly-coupled edges to a large base graph creates high-fidelity quantum state transfer. We provide a mathematical treatment that rigorously prove this folklore idea. Our proofs are elementary and build upon the Feshbach-Schur method from perturbation theory. We also show the idea is effective in circumventing Anderson localization in spin chains and finding speedups in hitting times useful for quantum search.</description>

Abstract: We classify all wormhole singularities, i.e. cyclic quotient surface singularities admitting at least two extremal P-resolutions, thereby solving an open problem posed by Urz\'ua. Our approach introduces a new combinatorial framework based on what we call the coherent graph of a framed triangulated polygon. As an application, we give an alternative proof of the Hacking-Tevelev-Urz\'ua theorem on the maximum number of extremal P-resolutions of a cyclic quotient singularity.</description>

Abstract: Let $G_{\mathbb{R}}$ be a Lie group of Hermitian type, and $L(\lambda)$ a highest weight Harish-Chandra module of $G_{\mathbb{R}}$ with highest weight $\lambda$. In this article, we exhibit a bijection between the set of connected Dynkin subdiagrams containing the noncompact simple root and the set of unitary highest weight modules $L(-w\rho-\rho)$, where $\rho$ is half the sum of positive roots. We find that $L(-w\rho-\rho)$ is unitary if and only if the Schubert variety $X(w)$ is smooth. We also give the cardinality of the set of unitary highest weight modules $L(-w\rho-\rho)$ for each Kazhdan-Lusztig right cell.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ideals of semidirect products of L-algebras and the structure of simple L-algebras. We provide a precise characterization of the ideals of semidirect products and describe the structure of their prime spectrum. Furthermore, we introduce a family of finite simple L-algebras and prove that every simple linear L-algebra belongs to this family. We also show that the family we construct coincides with the class of simple algebras in a certain subclass of finite CKL-algebras. As an application, we use these results to give a clear description of linear Hilbert algebras and their symmetric semidirect products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the theory of hyperbolic polynomials and Hodge theory, we develop the theory of Lorentzian polynomials on cones. This notion captures the Hodge-Riemann relations of degree zero and one. Motivated by fundamental properties of volume polynomials of Chow rings of simplicial fans, we define a class of multivariate polynomials which we call hereditary polynomials. We give a complete and easily checkable characterization of hereditary Lorentzian polynomials. This characterization is used to give elementary and simple proofs of the Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture for the characteristic polynomial of a matroid, and the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for convex bodies.
  We then characterize Chow rings of simplicial fans which satisfy the Hodge-Riemann relations of degree zero and one, and we prove that this property only depends on the support of the fan.
  Several different characterizations of Lorentzian polynomials on cones are provided.</description>

Abstract: We consider infinite sequences of positive numbers. The connection between log-concavity and the Bessenrodt--Ono inequality had been in the focus of several papers. This has applications in the white noise distribution theory and combinatorics. We improve a recent result of Benfield and Roy and show that for the sequence of partition numbers $\{p(n)\}$ Nicolas' log-concavity result implies the result of Bessenrodt and Ono towards $p(n) \, p(m) &gt; p(n+m)$. We provide several examples. Benfield and Roy gave a conjecture related to $\ell $-ary partition numbers. We prove part of this conjecture.</description>

      <title>A lower bound theorem for $d$-polytopes with $2d+2$ vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a lower bound theorem for the number of $k$-faces ($1\le k\le d-2$) in a $d$-dimensional polytope $P$ (abbreviated as a $d$-polytope) with $2d+2$ vertices, extending the previously known case for $k=1$. We identify all minimisers for $d\le 5$. Two distinct lower bounds emerge, depending on the number of facets of $P$. When $P$ has precisely $d+2$ facets, the lower bound is tight when $d$ is odd. If $P$ has at least $d+3$ facets, the lower bound is always tight, and equality holds for some $1\le k\le d-2$ only when $P$ has precisely $d+3$ facets.
  Moreover, for $1\le k\le \ceil{d/3}-2$, the minimisers among $d$-polytopes with $2d+2$ vertices have precisely $d+3$ facets, while for $\floor{0.4d}\le k\le d-1$, the lower bound arises from $d$-polytopes with $d+2$ facets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structure connectivity and substructure connectivity are innovative indicators for assessing network reliability and fault tolerance. Similarly, fault diameter evaluates fault tolerance and transmission delays in networks. This paper extends the concept of fault diameter by introducing two new variants: structure fault diameter and substructure fault diameter, derived from structure connectivity and substructure connectivity respectively. For a connected graph $G$ with $W$-structure connectivity $\kappa(G;W)$ or $W$-substructure connectivity $\kappa^s(G;W)$, the $W$-structure fault diameter $D_f(G;W)$ and $W$-substructure fault diameter $D_f^s(G;W)$ are defined as the maximum diameter of any subgraph of $G$ resulting from removing up to $\kappa(G;W)-1$ $W$-structures or $\kappa^s(G;W)-1$ $W$-substructures. For the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with $n \geq 3$ and $1 \leq m \leq n - 2$, we determine both $D_f(Q_n;Q_m)$ and $D_f^s(Q_n;Q_1)$. These findings generalize existing results for the diameter and fault diameter of $Q_n$, providing a broader understanding of the hypercube's structural properties under fault conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous Ryser--Brualdi--Stein conjecture asserts that every $k \times k$ Latin square contains a partial transversal of size $k-1$. Since its appearance, the conjecture has attracted significant interest, leading to several proposed generalizations. One of the most notable of these, by Aharoni, Kotlar, and Ziv, conjectures that $k$ disjoint common bases of two matroids of rank $k$ have a common independent partial transversal of size $k-1$. Although simple counterexamples show that the size $k-1$ above cannot be improved to $k$ (i.e., a transversal instead of a partial transversal), it is remarkable that no such counterexample is known for the special case of spanning arborescences. This motivated the formulation of the Rainbow Arborescence Conjecture: any graph on $n$ vertices formed by the union of $n-1$ spanning arborescences contains an arborescence using exactly one arc from each.
  We prove several partial results on this conjecture. We show that the computational problem of testing the existence of such an arborescence with a fixed root is NP-complete, verify the conjecture in several special cases, and study relaxations of the problem. In particular, we establish the validity of the conjecture when the underlying undirected graph is a cycle; this also yields a new result on systems of distinct representatives for intervals on a cycle.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trickle-Down Theorems for Path Complexes via C-Lorentzian Polynomials with Applications to Sampling and Log-Concave Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a $d$-partite $d$-dimensional simplicial complex with parts $T_1,\dots,T_d$ and let $\mu$ be a distribution on the facets of $X$. Informally, we say $(X,\mu)$ is a path complex if for any $i&lt;j&lt;k$ and $F \in T_i,G \in T_j, K\in T_k$, we have $\mathbb{P}_\mu[F,K | G]=\mathbb{P}_\mu[F|G]\cdot\mathbb{P}_\mu[K|G].$ We develop a new machinery with $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian polynomials to show that if all links of $X$ of co-dimension 2 have spectral expansion at most $1/2$, then $X$ is a $1/2$-local spectral expander. We then prove that one can derive fast-mixing results and log-concavity statements for top-link spectral expanders.
  We use our machinery to prove fast mixing results for sampling maximal flags of flats of distributive lattices (a.k.a. linear extensions of posets) subject to external fields, and to sample maximal flags of flats of "typical" modular lattices. We also use it to re-prove the Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture and to prove a conjecture of Chan and Pak which gives a generalization of Stanley's log-concavity theorem. Lastly, we use it to prove near optimal trickle-down theorems for "sparse complexes" such as constructions by Lubotzky-Samuels-Vishne, Kaufman-Oppenheim, and O'Donnell-Pratt.</description>

Abstract: In the last decade, the order polytope of the zigzag poset has been thoroughly studied. A related poset, called \emph{crown poset}, obtained by adding an extra relation between the endpoints of an even zigzag poset, is not so well understood. In this paper, we study the order polytopes of crown posets. We provide explicit formulas for their $f$-vectors. We provide recursive formulas for their Ehrhart polynomial, giving a counterpart to formulas found in the zigzag case by Petersen--Zhuang (2025). We use these formulas to simplify a computation by Ferroni--Morales--Panova (2025) of the linear term of the order polynomial of these posets. Furthermore, we provide a combinatorial interpretation for the coefficients of the $h^*$-polynomial in terms of the cyclic swap statistic on cyclically alternating permutations, which provides a circular version of a result by Coons--Sullivant (2023).</description>

      <title>Trichotomy and $tK_m$-goodness of sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $n+k-2$ edges and $tK_m$ denote the disjoint union of $t$ complete graphs $K_m$. In this paper, by developing a trichotomy for sparse graphs, we show that for given integers $m\ge 2$ and $t\ge 1$, there exists a positive constant $c$ such that if $1\le k\le cn^{\frac{2}{m-1}}$ and $n$ is large, then $G$ is $tK_m$-good, that is, the Ramsey number is \[ r(G, tK_m)=(n-1)(m-1)+t\,. \] In particular, the above equality holds for any positive integers $k$, $m$, and $t$, provided $n$ is large. The case $t=1$ was obtained by Burr, Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp (1980), and the case $k=1$ was established by Luo and Peng (2023).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a combinatorial proof of the $q$-Pfaff--Saalsch\"utz identity by a composition of explicit bijections, in which $q$-binomial coefficients are interpreted as counting subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_q$-vector spaces. As a corollary, we obtain a new multiplication rule for quantum binomial coefficients and hence a new presentation of Lusztig's integral form $\mathcal{U}_{\mathbb{Z}[q, q^{-1}]}(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ of the Cartan subalgebra of the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genevois introduced and investigated mediangle graphs as a common generalization of median graphs (1-sekeleta of CAT(0) cube complexes) and Coxeter graphs (Cayley graphs of Coxeter systems) and studied groups acting on them. He asked if mediangle graphs can be endowed with the structure of a contractible cell complex. We answer this in the affirmative by proving that bipartite mediangle graphs are tope graphs of finitary Complexes of Oriented Matroids (COMs). We also show that the oriented matroids (OMs) constituting the cells of COMs arising from bipartite mediangle graphs are exactly the simplicial OMs.</description>

      <title>Resnikoff silver numbers and tilings of the half-line (Dedicated to the memory of H.L.Resnikoff)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on work by H.L.Resnikoff we consider (Resnikoff) silver numbers, which generalize the familiar golden number. By definition, a silver number is the largest positive root of a certain polynomial called silver polynomial. In turn, a corresponding companion matrix of a silver polynomial gives rise to a well known construction of inflationary tilings of the (non-negative) real half-line, via an iteration of inflation and substitution. Resnikoff noted for the golden number $\phi$ that this tiling corresponds to the set of what he called $\phi$-integers. We generalize this result for a special class of silver numbers, the distinguished silver numbers, by showing that the integers for a distinguished silver number give rise to a tiling, of which we provide a precise description. For the general problem, whether the integers for an arbitrary silver number give rise to a tiling, we cannot give a general answer, but we show that tilings are obtained if and only if the differences of silver integers satisfy a (rather weak looking) non-accumulation condition. If tilings of this type exist for certain (necessarily non-distinguished) silver numbers, they would seem to form a class of inflationary tilings that differs from those obtained by inflation and substitution. In an Appendix we recall necessary notions and -- mostly known -- results, including the inflation-substitution construction principle for (one dimensional) inflationary tilings, in an elementary manner. For the readers' convenience we also collect the pertinent facts about non-negative matrices, thus the construction is accessible with only basic prerequisites from linear algebra and analysis. Finally, in our setting we give a detailed proof of a non-periodicity result that goes back to Penrose.</description>

      <title>Ramsey numbers for sparse graphs versus path or cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11835v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ramsey numbers $r(G, C_k)$ and $r(G, P_k)$ involving cycles and paths are fundamental objects in extremal combinatorics. We substantially improve the seminal 1982 result of Burr, Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp by weakening the key conditions required on the graph $G$. Our improvements are mainly driven by a novel reconstruction of the end-edge matching and an enhancement of the dichotomy lemma of Burr et al. (1982).
  For odd cycles $C_k$ ($k\ge3$), we prove that $r(G, C_k) = 2n-1$ holds for connected $n$-vertex graphs $G$ under two density regimes: either $n = \Omega(k^2)$ with $e(G) \le (1 + O(1/k^2)) n$, or $n = \Omega(k)$ with minimum degree $\delta(G)\ge2$ and $e(G) \le (1 + O(1/k^2)) n$.
  For paths $P_k$ ($k\ge2$), we prove that $r(G, P_k) = \max\{ n + \lfloor k/2\rfloor - 1, n + k - 2 - \alpha' - \gamma \},$ under analogous relaxed conditions: either $n = \Omega(k^2)$ with $e(G) \le (1 + O(1/k^2)) n$, or $n = \Omega(k)$ with $\delta(G)\ge2$ and $e(G) \le (1 + O(1/k)) n$. Here $\alpha'$ is the independence number of an appropriate subgraph of $G$ and $\gamma=0$ if $k-1$ divides $n+k-3-\alpha'$, and $\gamma=1$ otherwise.
  Consequently, our results unify and recover the classical exact results $r(C_n,C_k)=2n-1$ for odd $k\ge3$ and $n=\Omega(k)$, and $r(P_n,P_k)=r(C_n,P_k)=n+\left\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\right\rfloor-1$ for $k\ge2$ and $n=\Omega(k)$. In these corollaries, the requirement $n=\Omega(k)$ is tight up to a constant factor, and the quadratic condition $n=\Omega(k^2)$ for general sparse graphs highlights the significant effect of leaves.</description>

      <title>Towards the classification of maximum scattered linear sets of $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^5)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every maximum scattered linear set in $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^5)$ is the projection of an $\mathbb{F}_q$-subgeometry $\Sigma$ of $\mathrm{PG}(4,q^5)$ from a plane $\Gamma$ external to the secant variety to $\Sigma$. The pair $(\Gamma,\Sigma)$ will be called a projecting configuration for the linear set. The projecting configurations for the only known maximum scattered linear sets in $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^5)$, namely those of pseudoregulus and LP type, have been characterized in the literature by B. Csajb\'{o}k, C. Zanella in 2016 and by C. Zanella, F. Zullo in 2020. Let $(\Gamma,\Sigma)$ be a projecting configuration for a maximum scattered linear set in $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^5)$, let $\sigma$ be a generator of $\mathbb{G}=\mathrm{P}\Gamma \mathrm{L}(5,q^5)_\Sigma$, and $A=\Gamma\cap\Gamma^{\sigma^4}$, $B=\Gamma\cap\Gamma^{\sigma^3}$. If $A$ and $B$ are not both points, then the projected linear set is of pseudoregulus type. Then, suppose that they are points. The rank of a point $X$ is the vectorial dimension of the span of the orbit of $X$ under the action of $\mathbb{G}$. In this paper, by investigating the geometric properties of projecting configurations, it is proved that if at least one of the points $A$ and $B$ has rank 5, the associated maximum scattered linear set must be of LP type. Then, if a maximum scattered linear set of a new type exists, it must be such that $\mathrm{rk} A=\mathrm{rk} B=4$. In this paper we derive two possible polynomial forms that such a linear set must have. An exhaustive analysis by computer shows that for $q\leq 25$, no new maximum scattered linear set exists.</description>

      <title>Trickle-down Theorems via C-Lorentzian Polynomials II: Pairwise Spectral Influence and Improved Dobrushin's Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a probability distribution on a multi-state spin system on a set $V$ of sites. Equivalently, we can think of this as a $d$-partite simplical complex with distribution $\mu$ on maximal faces. For any pair of vertices $u,v\in V$, define the pairwise spectral influence $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ as follows. Let $\sigma$ be a choice of spins $s_w\in S_w$ for every $w\in V \setminus \{u,v\}$, and construct a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{(S_u\cup S_v)\times (S_u\cup S_v)}$ where for any $s_u\in S_u, s_v\in S_v$, the $(us_u,vs_v)$-entry is the probability that $s_v$ is the spin of $v$ conditioned on $s_u$ being the spin of $u$ and on $\sigma$. Then $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is the maximal second eigenvalue of this matrix, over all choices of spins for all $w \in V \setminus \{u,v\}$. Equivalently, $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is the maximum local spectral expansion of links of codimension $2$ that include a spin for every $w \in V \setminus \{u,v\}$.
  We show that if the largest eigenvalue of the pairwise spectral influence matrix with entries $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is bounded away from 1, i.e. $\lambda_{\max}(\mathcal{I})\leq 1-\epsilon$ (and $X$ is connected), then the Glauber dynamics mixes rapidly and generate samples from $\mu$. This improves/generalizes the classical Dobrushin's influence matrix as the $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ lower-bounds the classical influence of $u\to v$. As a by-product, we also prove improved/almost optimal trickle-down theorems for partite simplicial complexes. The proof builds on the trickle-down theorems via $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian polynomials machinery recently developed by the authors and Lindberg.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a lower bound on the rank of tensors constructed from families of linear maps that `expand' the dimension of every subspace. Such families, called {\em dimension expanders} have been studied for many years with several known explicit constructions. Using these constructions we show that one can construct an explicit $[D]\times [n] \times [n]$-tensor with rank at least $(2 - \epsilon)n$, with $D$ a constant depending on $\epsilon$. Our results extend to border rank over the real or complex numbers.</description>

Abstract: The rainbow arborescence conjecture posits that if the arcs of a directed graph with $n$ vertices are colored by $n-1$ colors such that each color class forms a spanning arborescence, then there is a spanning arborescence that contains exactly one arc of every color. We prove that the conjecture is true if the underlying undirected graph is a cycle.</description>

      <title>A new generalization of the Narayana numbers inspired by linear operators on associative $d$-ary algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a generalization of the Narayana numbers $N_d(n,k) = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{n+1}{k+1} \binom{ n + (n-k)(d-2)+1}{k}$ for integers $d \geq 2$ and $n,k \geq 0$. This two-parameter array extends the classical Narayana numbers ($d=2$) and yields a $d$-ary analogue of the Catalan numbers $C_d(n) = \sum_{k=0}^n N_d(n,k)$. We give nine combinatorial interpretations of $N_d(n,k)$ that unify and generalize known combinatorial interpretations of the Narayana numbers and $C_3(n)$ in the literature. In particular, we show that $N_d(n,k)$ counts a natural class of operator monomials over a $d$-ary associative algebra, thereby extending a result of Bremner and Elgendy for the binary case. We also construct explicit bijections between these monomials and several families of classic combinatorial objects, including Schr\"{o}der paths, Dyck paths, rooted ordered trees, and $231$-avoiding permutations.</description>

      <title>Explicit Formulas and Combinatorial Interpretation of Triangular Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the weighted paths to interpret any triangular array of the form
  \[
  T(n,k)=(a_2 n + a_1 k + a_0)\,T(n-1,k)
  + (b_2 n + b_1 k + b_0)\,T(n-1,k-1),
  \]
  allowing a structural analysis of the coefficients $\big(T(n,k)\big)_{n,k\in \mathbb{N}}$.
  This leads to explicit expressions for general $T(n,k)$, with simpler formulas arising in the cases $a_2=0$ or $b_2=0$, as well as in the fully general case.
  Applications include explicit formulas for the $r$-Eulerian numbers and the marked $r$-Eulerian numbers ones. We will write also the case where $b_{n,k}=1$, as a matrix of passage.
  \textbf{Keywords:} triangular recurrence, weighted paths, $r$-Eulerian numbers, combinatorial interpretation.</description>

      <title>Sharp thresholds, hitting times and the power of choice for random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a random geometric graph process where random points $(X_i)_{i \ge 1}$ are embedded consecutively in the $d$-dimensional unit torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, and every two points at distance at most $r$ form an edge. As $r\to 0$, we confirm that well-known hitting time results for $k$-connectivity (with $k\ge 1$ fixed) and Hamiltonicity in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph process also hold for the considered geometric analogue. Moreover, we exhibit a sort of probabilistic monotonicity for each of these properties.
  We also study a geometric analogue of the power of choice where, at each step, an agent is given two random points sampled independently and uniformly from $\mathbb{T}^d$ and must add exactly one of them to the already constructed point set. When the agent is allowed to make their choice with the knowledge of the entire sequence of random points (offline 2-choice), we show that they can construct a connected graph at the first time $t$ when none of the first $t$ pairs of proposed points contains two isolated vertices in the graph induced by $(X_i)_{i=1}^{2t}$, and maintain connectivity thereafter by following a simple algorithm. We also derive analogous results for $k$-connectivity and Hamiltonicity. This shows that each of the said properties can be attained two times faster (time-wise) and with four times fewer points in the offline 2-choice process compared to the 1-choice process.
  In the online version where the agent only knows the process until the current time step, we show that $k$-connectivity and Hamiltonicity cannot be significantly accelerated (time-wise) but may be realised on two times fewer points compared to the 1-choice analogue.</description>

      <title>The Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa (Marton) Conjecture in Integers and Finite Fields via Spectral Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We settle the Polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa (PFR/Marton) conjecture for the integers and for cyclic groups. More precisely, we show that if $A$ is a finite subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ with $|A+A| \le K|A|$, then there is a subgroup $H$ of index at most $K^{O(1)}$ such that $A$ is contained in at most $K^{O(1)}$ cosets of $H$. The proof is based on a new spectral stability dichotomy for the $L^4$ Fourier mass of $\mathbf{1}_A$: either this mass is concentrated on a span of size $K^{O(1)}$, or, after passing to a quotient of codimension $K^{O(1)}$, the doubling constant of the image of $A$ decreases by a definite power of $K$. Using Freiman modeling we transfer this dichotomy to cyclic groups, obtain polynomial Bogolyubov-type bounds, and deduce Marton's conjecture in $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$. As a corollary, we also recover and extend the finite-field formulation of Marton's conjecture: in odd characteristic we obtain a direct spectral proof, and together with the characteristic-2 result of Green, Gowers, Manners, and Tao this yields a complete resolution of the conjecture for all finite fields. For context beyond finite fields, we recall their theorem for abelian groups of bounded exponent.</description>

Abstract: Seaweed algebras are a class of Lie algebras that are naturally characterized by a pair of compositions, which in turn are represented visually as planar graphs called meanders. These meanders provide a straightforward method for computing the index of the associated algebra. The goal of this paper is to enumerate those seaweed algebras with a fixed index and whose associated compositions have restricted part sizes. In particular, we enumerate those with composition part sizes from so-called acyclic sets. We also establish a bijection between sets of indecomposable seaweed algebras with meanders with certain restricted part sizes and sets of permutations with restricted displacements. In certain cases, the index of the algebra can be determined by a simple statistic on the permutation.</description>

      <title>Intersection problems for linear codes and polynomials over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves a stability result for a variation of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem in the context of polynomials over finite fields. Let $\mathcal F$ be a family of polynomials of degree at most $k \geq 3$ in $\mathbb F_q[X]$. Call $\mathcal F$ intersecting if for any two polynomials $f, g$ in $\mathcal F$, there exists a point $x \in \mathbb F_q$ for which $f(x) = g(x)$. An intersecting family is called a star if it consists of all polynomials $f$ with ${\rm deg } f \leq k$ such that $f(x) = y$ for some fixed points $x, y \in \mathbb F_q$. In this paper we prove that if $\mathcal F$ is an intersecting family with $|\mathcal F| \geq \frac 1{\sqrt 2} q^k + \mathcal O(q^{k-1})$, then $\mathcal F$ is contained in a star. In fact, we prove that this is still true if we also evaluate the polynomials "at infinity", which is equivalent to studying the problem for homogeneous bivariate polynomials.
  The proof technique extends to a general framework for intersection problems of linear codes $C$. One has to investigate the geometry of the projective system $\mathcal S$ associated to $C$. If the hyperplanes that don't intersect $\mathcal S$ are well spread out with respect to the points not on $\mathcal S$, then one obtains stability results, showing that any intersecting family of reasonably large size is contained in a star.</description>

      <title>Exact supported co-degree bounds for Hamilton cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $k\ge 3$ and $\ell \in [k-1]$ such that $(k,\ell) \ne (3,1)$, we show that any sufficiently large $k$-graph $G$ must contain a Hamilton $\ell$-cycle provided that it has no isolated vertices and every set of $k-1$ vertices contained in an edge is contained in at least $\left(1 - \frac{1}{\lfloor{\frac{k}{k-\ell}\rfloor}(k-\ell)}\right)n - (k - 3)$ edges. We also show that this bound is tight for infinitely many values of $k$ and $\ell$ and is off by at most $1$ for all others, and is hence essentially optimal. This improves an asymptotic version of this result due to Mycroft and Z\'arate-Guer\'en, and the case $\ell = k-1$ completely resolves a conjecture of Illingworth, Lang, M\"uyesser, Parczyk and Sgueglia.
  These results support the utility of $\textit{minimum}$ $\textit{supported}$ $\textit{co-degree}$ conditions in a $k$-graph, a recently introduced variant of the standard notion of minimum co-degree applicable to $k$-graphs with non-trivial strong independent sets. Our proof techniques involve a novel blow-up tiling framework introduced by Lang, avoiding traditional approaches using the regularity and blow-up lemmas.</description>

      <title>Degenerate crossing number and signed reversal distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph drawn in the plane, the degenerate crossing number of the drawing is the number of points in the plane which are contained in the relative interior of at least two edges, where each edge is required to be drawn as a simple arc. The degenerate crossing number of a graph is the minimum degenerate crossing number among all its drawings.
  Given a drawing, cutting a neighborhood of the surface around each crossing and pasting a M\"obius band gives a non-orientable surface, on which the drawing of the graph can be extended to an embedding. From this observation, Mohar derived that the degenerate crossing number of a graph is at most its non-orientable genus, and conjectured that these quantities are equal for every graph. He also made a stronger conjecture for loopless pseudo-triangulations with a fixed embedding scheme.
  In this paper, we prove a structure theorem that allows to understand when the degenerate crossing number and non-orientable genus coincide in a large class of loopless bipartite embedding schemes. In particular, we provide a counterexample to Mohar's stronger conjecture, but show that in the vast majority of the 2-vertex cases, as well as for many bipartite graphs, Mohar's conjecture is satisfied.
  The reversal distance between two signed permutations is the minimum number of reversals that transform one permutation to the other one. If we represent the trajectory of each element of a signed permutation under successive reversals by a simple arc, we obtain a drawing of a 2-vertex embedding scheme with degenerate crossings. Our main result is proved by leveraging this connection and a classical result in genome rearrangement (the Hannenhalli--Pevzner algorithm) and can also be understood as an extension of this algorithm when the reversals do not necessarily happen in a monotone order.</description>

      <title>Seminorm estimates and joint ergodicity for pairwise independent Hardy sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a robust structure theory for multiple ergodic averages of commuting transformations along Hardy sequences of polynomial growth. We then apply it to derive a number of novel results on joint ergodicity, recurrence and convergence. In particular, we prove joint ergodicity for (a) pairwise independent Hardy sequences and weakly mixing transformations, (b) strongly independent Hardy sequences and ergodic transformations, (c) strongly irrationally independent Hardy sequences and totally ergodic transformations. We use these joint ergodicity results to provide new recurrence results for multidimensional patterns along strongly independent Hardy sequences, showing for instance that all subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper density contain patterns of the form
  $$ (m_1, m_2),\; (m_1 + \lfloor n^{\sqrt{2}}\rfloor, m_2),\; (m_1, m_2 + \lfloor n^{\sqrt{2}} + n^{1/2}\rfloor).$$
  Last but not least, we positively resolve the joint ergodicity classification problem for pairwise independent Hardy sequences, of which the aforementioned families are special cases.
  While building on recent technical advances (e.g. PET coefficient tracking schemes and joint ergodicity criteria), our work introduces a number of technical developments of its own. We construct a suitable generalization of Host-Kra and box seminorms that quantitatively control ergodic averages along Hardy sequences.
  We subsequently use them to obtain Host-Kra seminorm estimates for averages along all pairwise independent Hardy sequences. Furthermore, we develop an ergodic version of the quantitative concatenation argument that has recently found extensive use in combinatorics, number theory and harmonic analysis. Lastly, we obtain new simultaneous Taylor approximations for Hardy sequences, a crucial ingredient to deal with the aforementioned classes of Hardy sequences.</description>

      <title>Copositivity, discriminants and nonseparable signed supports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we establish a connection between copositivity, that is, nonnegativity on the positive orthant, of sparse real Laurent polynomials and discriminants. Specifically, we consider Laurent polynomials in the positive orthant with fixed support and fixed coefficient signs. We provide a criterion to decide whether a given polynomial is copositive that is based in determining the intersection points of the signed discriminant and a path going through the coefficients of the polynomial. If the signed support satisfies a combinatorial condition termed nonseparability, we show additionally that this intersection consists of one point, and that tracking one path in homotopy continuation methods suffices to decide upon copositivity.
  Building on these results, we show that any copositive polynomial with nonseparable signed support can be decomposed into a sum of nonnegative circuit polynomials, generalising thereby previously known supports having this property.</description>
